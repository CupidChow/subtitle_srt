Mr. Tan, I'm here!

Mr. Tan!

21

Fatty!

00:01:54,339 --> 00:01:54,939
No rush.

23
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,900

Quiet down! What's all this?

29
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,620
Mr. Tan, we're here to pay.

30
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:03,620
You register it.

31
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,980
We're first in line, right?

32
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,059
By the rule,

33
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,459
the first to pay will get Binhai Road!

34
00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:11,019
Listen, Binhai Road is reserved
for county-level cadres.

35
00:02:11,619 --> 00:02:12,619
What are you doing?

36
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:13,419
To pay!

37
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:15,459
This is ridiculous.

38
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:17,304
We've signed the letter of intent.

39
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:18,340
They have no chance.

40
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:18,980
Exactly!

41
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:19,739
That's right!

42
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:20,859
Don't worry.

43
00:02:20,859 --> 00:02:21,624
Fatty. What?

44
00:02:21,624 --> 00:02:22,340
- Mr. Xie.
- Calm down!

45
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:22,859
Yes.

46
00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:23,736
- Come to me.
- Be patient.

47
00:02:23,736 --> 00:02:24,500
I can help you.

48
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,060
What?

49
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:25,899
Get out of here.

50
00:02:25,976 --> 00:02:26,699
- Okay.
- No.

51
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:27,419
Move! Go home.

52
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:28,019
No, Mr. Xie.

53
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:28,980
You gave it up?

54
00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:29,859
No!

55
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:30,699
Talk to you later.

56
00:02:30,899 --> 00:02:31,579
- Leave.
- No!

57
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:32,380
Go home!

58
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,179
Fatty!

59
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,500
Listen. Don't be superstitious.

60
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,340
Leave now!

61
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,619
Yuehai is full of potential.

62
00:02:37,619 --> 00:02:38,680
I know you want to pay.

63
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,899
- Come another day.
- Great enthusiasm!

64
00:02:39,899 --> 00:02:40,820
Except Binhai Road...

65
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:41,820
Congrats.

66
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,224
It's just a minor incident.

67
00:02:43,224 --> 00:02:44,312
- Don't worry.
- It's fine.

68
00:02:44,312 --> 00:02:45,464
You handle it first.

69
00:02:45,464 --> 00:02:46,419
We are not in a hurry.

70
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:47,899
Leave the prime locations for them.

71
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,899
We're here specifically for Binhai Road.

72
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,060
We want Binhai Road, right?

73
00:02:51,064 --> 00:02:51,820
- Yes!
- Yes!

74
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,459
Calm down!

75
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,299

76
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:54,899

77
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:55,640
Listen to me!

78
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,220
Leave!

79
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:56,980
Listen.

80
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,019
Let me tell you.

81
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:00,419
Even if you pay, he can't accept it.

82
00:03:00,899 --> 00:03:01,459
Why not?

83
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:04,820
Because we already signed
the letter of intent. You know?

84
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:05,540
Binhai Road

85
00:03:05,688 --> 00:03:06,648
- is already ours.
- Letter of intent?

86
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,864

87
00:03:07,864 --> 00:03:09,619
- the first to pay gets it. Right?
- Listen.

88
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:10,859
We came to pay first.

89
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,019
Right?

90
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:13,464
- Stop it!
- First-come, first-served.

91
00:03:13,464 --> 00:03:14,179
No problem.

92
00:03:14,619 --> 00:03:15,299
Stop shouting!

93
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:15,899
- Stop shouting!
- Yes.

94
00:03:15,899 --> 00:03:16,540
We pay first.

95
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,419
Will you stop it?

96
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:18,540
What?

97
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:19,739
Stop arguing here.

98
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:20,940
Just go home.

99
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:21,699
Who are you?

100
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:22,739
No need to know.

101
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:23,980
Don't act like a hooligan.

102
00:03:24,899 --> 00:03:25,459
A hooligan?

103
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:26,340
How dare you!

104
00:03:27,179 --> 00:03:27,820
Stop!

105
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:29,380
Stop arguing.

106
00:03:31,619 --> 00:03:33,100
What's wrong with Fatty?

107
00:03:33,619 --> 00:03:35,579
I told him to wait for news.
He's so impulsive.

108
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,899
He spoiled the whole plan.

109
00:03:37,179 --> 00:03:37,859
Exactly.

110
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,380
Keep your cool.

111
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:40,780
Go and talk to them.

112
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,739
Don't fight.

113
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,780
Don't worry. I won't.

114
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,739
Good. I trust you.

115
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:50,019
It's fine.

116
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:52,060
Stop fighting! Stop!

117
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:53,139

Calm down!

120
00:03:58,019 --> 00:03:58,699
Stop it!

121
00:04:00,179 --> 00:04:02,040
We can't collect money,
or it'll cause trouble.

122
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:02,739
Yes.

123
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:06,820
What are you doing?

124
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:07,899
Mr. Zheng is here.

125
00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:08,619
Get guards.

126
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,780
Okay.

127
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:11,459
Fatty, what do you want?

128
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,780
Stop it!

129
00:04:13,179 --> 00:04:14,380
I'll get guards!

130
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,019
Sorry.

131
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:15,980
We're handling it.

132
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,619
Fatty, this is the government office.

133
00:04:17,619 --> 00:04:18,540
Get them out of here.

134
00:04:18,619 --> 00:04:20,179
- We can talk later.
- We're here to pay.

135
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,140
He called me a hooligan!

136
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,499
Step aside.

137
00:04:24,059 --> 00:04:25,340
Fatty, listen to me.

138
00:04:25,739 --> 00:04:27,499
I don't care who you were.

139
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:29,619
But today, you need to behave.

140
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:30,499
You yelled at me?

141
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,179
Come.

142
00:04:31,179 --> 00:04:32,460
- Don't scold him!
- Mind your manners!

143
00:04:34,619 --> 00:04:35,700
Do you still want the land?

144
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:36,859
Yes.

145
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:38,299
I'm right here, aren't I?

146
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,259
Wait for my news.

147
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:39,819
Thank you.

148
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,059

Come.

153
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,460
Come on. Move!

154

155

Everyone, please leave.

156
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,580
Only you could handle such a big scene.

157
00:04:51,739 --> 00:04:52,939
Look at this situation today.

158
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,980

no one could have fixed it.

159
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,379

Get Cao and Sun Xiaoyan.

169

Set up a stall and prepare dried goods.

170

Help calm the leaders down.

171
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:39,992
Understood.

172
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,020
We're ready to pay.

173
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,259
Yes. Come on.

174
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:43,980
What's the rush?

175
00:05:44,179 --> 00:05:44,900
We're paying.

176
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,540
No rush.

177
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,020
You came from far away.

178
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,939
Have some water first.

179
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:51,259
Really not necessary.
We're just here to pay.

180
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:52,700
Then, some people made a scene.

181
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,379
Have some water.

182

- Yes.

187
00:06:04,299 --> 00:06:05,299
I'm terribly sorry.

188

I suddenly realized
I can't find the official seal.

189
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,020

come with me.

192
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:12,580
Help find it.

193
00:06:12,619 --> 00:06:13,259
No need.

194
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:14,660
We'll accept your signature.

195
00:06:14,739 --> 00:06:15,819
You can stamp it later.

196
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:16,460
The seal?

197
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,780
A signature isn't official.
We need the seal stamp.

198
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,340
Alright?

199
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,540
Come on. All of you.

200
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,179
To get the seal.

201
00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:22,499
Decheng.

202
00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:23,220
Come on!

203
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,700
- Wait!
- What's going on?

204
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,660
Official seal?

205
00:06:25,739 --> 00:06:26,540
- What a hassle!
- Decheng.

206
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,220
Ms. Dan!

207
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,540
- Ms. Dan!
- Zheng Decheng!

208
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:29,819
What are you up to?

209
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,980
Calm down. There was
indeed a situation today.

210
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,059
We'll handle it.

211
00:06:33,499 --> 00:06:35,700
No matter what,
I'll take full responsibility for you.

212
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:38,220
Give us half an hour, alright?

213
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,859
I'll handle it soon.

214
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:41,939
I don't trust anyone.

215
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,460
I only trust you, Qiuping.

216
00:06:47,179 --> 00:06:49,499
Half an hour? I'll have everyone wait.

217
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,419
Thanks, Ms. Dan. Just half an hour.

218
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:53,299
Look.

219
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,304
(Please Conserve Water)

220
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,299
This one's free.

221
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:11,259
Try it. It's free.

222
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,059
Is it tasty?

223
00:07:12,059 --> 00:07:12,939
(Dried Goods)
Try this.

224
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,059
I'll help myself.

225
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:14,700
Eat this.

226
00:07:14,739 --> 00:07:15,580
Hurry up!

227
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,259
Yes, the heat's a bit low.

228
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:20,020
This pot is ready.

229
00:07:20,059 --> 00:07:21,059
I'll call you later.

230
00:07:21,299 --> 00:07:22,259
Go and sit for a while.

231
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,179
Local specialty!

232
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:28,700
No, thanks.

233
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:29,980
Thank you.

234
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,059
Thank you.

235
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:32,020
Let's wait.

236
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,619
Take it easy. They will explain.

237
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,340
Just wait for their solution.

238
00:07:45,739 --> 00:07:46,980
That's the situation.

239
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,780
So I've decided

240
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,259
to give Binhai Road
to the self-employed individuals.

241
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:54,580
Are you kidding?

242
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,220
What about the cadres?

243
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:58,499
Mr. Zheng, don't be reckless.

244
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,859
They've signed the agreement.

245
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,939
I know.
I'll take responsibility for this.

246
00:08:03,179 --> 00:08:04,780
I met the investor with them.

247
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,179
I didn't tell you all immediately

248
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,859
because it wasn't finalized yet.

249
00:08:09,179 --> 00:08:12,140
Never expect that Xuemei and the others
would sign the contract so fast.

250
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,220
Gao Xuemei!

251
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:16,540
Hold on! Don't get worked up.

252
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,939
Xuemei isn't wrong.

253
00:08:18,179 --> 00:08:19,379
She's doing it all for Yuehai.

254
00:08:22,859 --> 00:08:24,140
Okay, everyone.

255
00:08:24,299 --> 00:08:25,540
Lower your voices!

256
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:29,299
Mr. Zheng,
I'm holding back my temper to talk.

257
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,900
Gao Xuemei is my wife.

258
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:32,739
I know exactly what she's thinking.

259
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,700
I'll talk to her later.

260
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,248
You, as Secretary,

261
00:08:36,248 --> 00:08:38,019
can't be as reckless as her.

262
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:39,180
X-Xie.

263
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,940
He isn't being reckless.

264
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:42,820
His purpose is to protect the interests

265
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:44,779
of the self-employed individuals.

266
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,420
We all understand that, right?

267
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:47,180
But Mr. Zheng,

268
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:48,060
what about

269
00:08:48,139 --> 00:08:50,499
the thousands of county cadres?

270
00:08:51,192 --> 00:08:52,379
There are dozens downstairs!

271
00:08:52,739 --> 00:08:53,859
What should we do right now?

272
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:02,980
Lin, you never speak,
but now you need to take a stance.

273
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,739
Say something. Come on.

274
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,580
First-come, first-served.

275
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:12,539
Just give the land
to those you promised first.

276
00:09:12,739 --> 00:09:13,619
Exactly!

277
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:14,460
Lin Tofu is right!

278
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,779
Let me translate what he means.

279
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:18,779
He's saying you're just acting on whims.

280
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:32,539
Ms. Li,

281
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:35,960
you invited those cadres

282
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,019
to settle in Yuehai, right?

283
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:41,180
Can you imagine if they hear this news?
Won't they blow up?

284
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:43,139
Aren't you responsible?

285
00:09:58,499 --> 00:10:00,580
Yes, we are responsible for them.

286
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:06,499
How do you all still have the appetite?

287
00:10:06,499 --> 00:10:07,259
Are you happy?

288
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:08,180
Thanks.

289
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:08,820
What's wrong?

290
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,619
Do you all not know?

291
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,220
We've all been deceived
by Zheng Decheng.

292
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,019
That can't be.

293
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,180
I know him very well.

294
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,060
He is very cunning.

295
00:10:18,859 --> 00:10:19,619
No way.

296
00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:21,180
Otherwise, why are we

297
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,259
waiting for him?

298
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:22,899
Mr. Wang.

299
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:25,779
Don't say that.

300
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:29,912
What did I say?

301
00:10:29,912 --> 00:10:31,480
Decheng isn't that kind of person.

302
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,019
Who knows if you and Zheng Decheng

303
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,139
are putting on an act together?

304
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,619
What do you mean by that?

305
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:43,340
Ms. Liu, have something to eat.

306
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:43,980
I'm not hungry.

307
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:49,859
Thank you.

308
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,139
You're welcome.

309
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:01,859
Listen, Li.

310
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,619
I want to give Binhai Road
to the self-employed individuals

311
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,499
because I want
to turn the printing street

312
00:11:07,739 --> 00:11:09,460
into Yuehai's...

313
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:11,940
What is it called again?

314
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,060
Well...

315
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,100
You said it yourself
during the campaign.

316
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:16,420
For a city to develop,

317
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,700
it needs to have its own...

318
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:20,859
I'm getting flustered and forgot.

319
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,980
What is it again?

320
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,544
What industry?

321
00:11:23,544 --> 00:11:24,379
Printing industry.

322
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:26,499
What else? You can't even articulate it.

323
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:27,580
You shut up!

324
00:11:27,859 --> 00:11:29,379
What industry?

325
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,379
Pillar industry.

326
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:31,256
Exactly.

327
00:11:31,739 --> 00:11:33,300
For a city to thrive,

328
00:11:33,739 --> 00:11:36,539
it must build its own
pillar industry. Right?

329
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,940
Mr. Zheng, if we offend the cadres,

330
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,259
how would we
carry out our work moving forward?

331
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:45,980
I'm not afraid.

332
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,379
I've been a grassroots cadre
for many years.

333
00:11:49,496 --> 00:11:50,488
I've offended people.

334
00:11:50,619 --> 00:11:52,019
A few more won't make a difference.

335
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:54,980
No matter what happens,
I'll take full responsibility. Alright?

336
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:56,259
Only you?

337
00:11:56,499 --> 00:11:57,899
All of us can be responsible!

338
00:11:58,139 --> 00:11:59,859
Those who can't be won't be
in this room.

339
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:00,619
Enough.

340
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,259
This isn't just
about taking responsibility.

341
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,980
Since we can't reach a consensus,

342
00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:06,060
we'll take a vote.

343
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:06,820
What do you say?

344
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:07,659
Okay. Vote.

345
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,539
Vote.

346
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,820
Those in favor of giving Binhai Road

347
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:14,460
to the self-employed individuals,
please raise your hands.

348
00:12:30,859 --> 00:12:31,420
Well, I...

349
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,980
I vote yes.

350
00:12:40,499 --> 00:12:41,019
Wait.

351
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,499
M-Ms. Li, are you serious?

352
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,160
I invited these cadres here.
I'll go out and address them.

353
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:48,940
No, wait a moment.

354
00:12:49,619 --> 00:12:50,180
Sit down.

355
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:52,460
It's not over yet.

356
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,499
Sit down.

357
00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:55,420
Sit.

358
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,340
Two votes.

359
00:13:03,859 --> 00:13:05,580
Two votes in favor. Correct?

360
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,899
You two voted for it.

361
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,539
Against? Three votes.

362
00:13:09,859 --> 00:13:11,779
The three of us voted no.

363
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:13,420
Three votes. Three to two.

364
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,820
Three to two.
So it still goes to the cadres.

365
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:18,619
Exactly.

366
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:27,460
That's fair.

367
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,060
Well,

368
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,659
fair enough.

369
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,019
Acceptable.

370
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,739
As key leading cadres
of the town government,

371
00:13:36,499 --> 00:13:38,648
you've cast your valuable votes.

372
00:13:38,648 --> 00:13:40,019
You did what you think is right.

373
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,060
Fair enough.

374
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:44,060
Tan, the voting tally is

375
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,499
one yeas to four nays.

376
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,019
Ms. Li also voted no. Okay?

377
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,700
Impossible. I'm being objective here.

378
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:50,899
My decision stands.

379
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,619
I'll take responsibility.

380
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,220
Regardless, I am the Secretary
of the town Party committee.

381
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,980
I'll bear the consequences
for any incident.

382
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,232
What?

383
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,060
What are you doing?

384
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,739
I told you.

385
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,619
What are you doing?

386
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,739
I'll take responsibility for anything.

387
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:10,100
Open the door.

388
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:13,460
Mr. Zheng.

389
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,499
Mr. Lin, open the door quickly.

390
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:17,060
Mr. Zheng will cause trouble.

391
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:23,259
Zheng Decheng, let's proceed.

392
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,300
Everyone.

393
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:25,980
Let's all take a short break. Okay?

394
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,980
- Take a break.
- Ms. Liu.

395
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,820
A word in private?

396
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:29,460
Get everyone some water.

397
00:14:29,739 --> 00:14:30,460
We're not thirsty.

398
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,352
Restrooms, over there.

399
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,539
Come, Ms. Liu.

400
00:14:34,619 --> 00:14:35,256
You...

401
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,539
Come.

402
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:41,460
Wait outside.

403
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,460
Go ahead.

404
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:51,300
I'll be direct then.

405
00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:53,300
Ms. Liu.

406
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,619
I'll give the Binhai Road
to the self-employed individuals

407
00:14:57,112 --> 00:14:58,220
to build a printing street.

408
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,139
Fine. I won't argue with you.

409
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:11,704
I'll talk to Li Qiuping.

410
00:15:11,704 --> 00:15:13,259
She won't help.

411
00:15:13,619 --> 00:15:15,220
This isn't her call. It's mine.

412
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:16,700
Alright? Settled.

413
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:23,659
How did it go?

414
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:24,899
Mr. Lin, can you open it?

415
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,180
I can't. It's locked from the outside.

416
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,619
Unless I break it.

417
00:15:29,619 --> 00:15:30,499
Just kick it down.

418
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,220
Kick it?

419
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:31,820
No.

420
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,539
Ms. Li.

421
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:37,340
Ms. Li.

422
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,499
- Step aside.
- Sorry.

423
00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:39,420
- Move aside.
- Stop it!

424
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,499
- Don't.
- Step aside.

425
00:15:40,499 --> 00:15:41,100
Tan, move!

426
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:41,700
Listen to her.

427
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,096
Do whatever she says.

428
00:15:43,096 --> 00:15:44,340
She does whatever she wants.

429
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:45,259
Anything!

430
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:48,499
- Mr. Xie, what do you mean by that?
- Make a big fuss!

431
00:15:48,499 --> 00:15:49,580
- Mr. Zheng was right.
- Make a big fuss!

432
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,659
Yuehai must develop pillar industries.

433
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:52,820
- Mr. Tan.
- Move!

434
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,379
Kick it down.

435
00:15:54,499 --> 00:15:55,100
Move aside!

436
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,460
Move aside! Don't stop him!

437
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,580
If you keep doing this,
Mr. Zheng will cause big trouble.

438
00:15:59,619 --> 00:16:00,820
So I'm being unreasonable?

439
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,619
You think I can't deal with you?

440
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,300
Who signed this with me?

441
00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:06,980
It's in black and white.

442
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,220
Your name, Zheng Decheng, is on it.

443
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:10,460
Take a look for yourself!

444
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:11,180
Did I sign this?

445
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:11,980
You think?

446
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:13,340
Zheng Decheng!

447
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,700
Zheng Decheng!

448
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,820
Zheng Decheng!

449
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,640
(Yuehai Town Master Plan)

450
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,220
Get in the bus!

451
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,019
Get in the bus with me.

452
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,300
Get in!

453
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,259
Get in!

454
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:38,100
Go!

455
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,980
Get in!

456
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,139
Ms. Liu!

457
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,180
Get in!

458
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:42,659
Go back with her.

459
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:43,580
Ms. Liu!

460
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:46,379
Hurry! Get out!

461
00:16:46,424 --> 00:16:47,180
Okay.

462
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,139
- Go back!
- Okay.

463
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:51,220
Mr. Zheng, are you okay?

464
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,340
Don't swallow it! Spit it out!

465
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,980
Go see them off.

466
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,059
See you, comrades!

467
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,220
Thank you for today.

468
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,819
That's okay. Go back.

469
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:13,819
Go back.

470
00:17:14,019 --> 00:17:14,860
Goodbye!

471
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,120
Bye.

472
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:23,224
Wait!

473
00:17:43,499 --> 00:17:44,059
I don't care.

474
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:46,860
You have to build another road
beside it.

475
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:47,779
Hold on.

476
00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:49,460
Is this the time to talk about the road?

477
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,579
You just offended all the cadres,
didn't you?

478
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,420
What did you say to them?

479
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:56,620
What could I say?

480
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:59,339
I said I gave Binhai Road
to the self-employed individuals.

481
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:00,220
I let them go.

482
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:01,220
What?

483
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,299
The letter of intent!

484
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,579
It was signed! I told you!

485
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,499
The letter?

486
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,072
I ate it.

487
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:15,900
Mr. Zheng,
I fully support your decision.

488
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,140
But the way you handled this matter...

489
00:18:18,259 --> 00:18:19,900
It's rough yet effective. Astonishing.

490
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:21,980
Effective? How so?

491
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:23,259
He drove the cadres away!

492
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,299
Can't you see that?

493
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,940
You handled it in a rough way.

494
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,380
It can't solve the problem.

495
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,059
It also intensified the conflict
between the two parties!

496
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:35,660
Now we must find a strong solution,

497
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:37,539
or we can't explain to Liu Dan.

498
00:18:37,819 --> 00:18:39,579
Nor to those cadres.

499
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,339
Yes, true.

500
00:18:43,499 --> 00:18:46,180
I accept everyone's criticism.

501
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,940
I acted impulsively on this matter.

502
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:53,019
I'll take full responsibility
for all consequences. Okay?

503
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,539
It's not about responsibility.

504
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:56,539
We need to figure out a solution, right?

505
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,460
Mr. Zheng, you just suggested

506
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,940
building another road
just like Binhai Road?

507
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:03,980
Yes! And preferably, right next to it.

508
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,220
Find another spot
and build another road.

509
00:19:06,936 --> 00:19:08,184
(Yuehai Town Master Plan)
Good idea!

510
00:19:08,184 --> 00:19:10,180
It's still not too late to act.

511
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,380
Good idea.

512
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:12,980
This is Binhai Road.

513
00:19:13,624 --> 00:19:14,712
Starting from here.

514
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:15,704
It works.

515
00:19:15,704 --> 00:19:17,420
This road looks good. Not bad.

516
00:19:17,499 --> 00:19:20,660
We need to open up passages
here, here, and here.

517
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:22,819
It will be a big project.

518
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,779
(Super Dog Restaurant)

519
00:19:44,779 --> 00:19:45,940
Let me state this upfront.

520
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:49,940
I won't be involved in this thing.

521
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:53,900
Very slippery of you!

522
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,579
Everyone was right about you.

523
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,460
See?

524
00:19:56,739 --> 00:19:58,616
When trouble comes,
you just give up first.

525
00:19:58,616 --> 00:20:00,259
You're easily swayed.

526
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,539
I'm slippery?

527
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:05,259
Commoners never fight officials.

528
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:06,700
Don't you understand?

529
00:20:07,819 --> 00:20:09,739
I'm thinking
of the development of Yuehai.

530
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:12,420
I'm not causing trouble for Yuehai.

531
00:20:15,259 --> 00:20:16,152
No.

532
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,040
I can't give up.

533
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,420
All these years, I've pleased people

534
00:20:20,539 --> 00:20:22,539
and suffered a lot

535
00:20:22,739 --> 00:20:24,059
to secure so many orders.

536
00:20:24,339 --> 00:20:25,460
I've drunk too much alcohol.

537
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:27,220
I've been waiting for this.

538
00:20:27,579 --> 00:20:29,900
I just want to be a first-mover.

539
00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:32,460
Right now, very soon,

540
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,860
we'll have our own printing street.

541
00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:37,299
Very soon,
the initiative will be in our hands.

542
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,579
Very soon, we'll be a first-mover.

543
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,700
We absolutely can't back down now.

544
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,900
Besides,

545
00:20:44,339 --> 00:20:45,860
Mr. Zheng trusts us and supports us.

546
00:20:46,499 --> 00:20:47,460
I trust Mr. Zheng.

547
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,739
Mr. Zheng is on our side.

548
00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:55,259
But that doesn't mean
he can make this happen.

549
00:20:56,019 --> 00:20:56,779
Think about it.

550
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,019
Mr. Zheng supports us,

551
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:02,180
which means offending thousands
of cadres.

552
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,499
Consider how severe
the consequences could be!

553
00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:11,299
In that case, Yuehai won't get built.

554
00:21:11,499 --> 00:21:13,819
Forget about building a printing street.

555
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:16,980
As long as Mr. Zheng is here,
Yuehai will thrive.

556
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:21,339
Once we secure his support,

557
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:24,579
we'll get Binhai Road.

558
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:28,259
Changyuan, don't act recklessly!

559
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,739
Don't just think about rejecting me.

560
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,380
Xuemei, won't you say something?

561
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:35,700
What are your thoughts, Xuemei?

562
00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:38,779
I understand if anyone wants to quit.

563
00:21:39,019 --> 00:21:40,620
Besides, Guo makes a valid point.

564
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,819
Mr. Zheng offended leadership for us,

565
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,860
which means the entire Yuehai

566
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,019
has offended leadership.

567
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:47,860
Yes.

568
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,579
Moreover, it'll have awful repercussions

569
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,420
on Xie and my family.

570
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,259
Xuemei, what do you mean?

571
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,980
Are you quitting too?

572
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:06,900
I have no choice.

573
00:22:07,339 --> 00:22:08,259
There is no retreat.

574
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,700
If we keep going,

575
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,059
we might still fail.

576
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,779
But if we don't try,

577
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,579
we'll never build a printing street.

578
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,259
And we'll inevitably lose money, right?

579
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:21,860
Have some.

580
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,620
I won't turn tail and run.

581
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,259
Fine, discuss it among yourselves.

582
00:22:29,624 --> 00:22:31,064
I'm going home for something else.

583
00:22:33,499 --> 00:22:35,940
Changyuan, let me warn you again.

584
00:22:36,339 --> 00:22:38,220
Don't act impulsively or foolishly.

585
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:39,860
Understood.

586
00:22:53,624 --> 00:22:54,299
(Win)

587
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:54,900
Let's do it.

588
00:22:55,288 --> 00:22:57,496
This man has high standards.

589
00:22:57,496 --> 00:22:58,744
Exceptionally strict.

590
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,019
He pays more for high quality.

591
00:23:00,019 --> 00:23:01,976
- Why are you here? Move!
- Mr. Xie.

592
00:23:02,616 --> 00:23:04,504
I'll talk it over with him properly.

593
00:23:06,712 --> 00:23:08,216
We'll do our best.

594
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:22,220
Gao Xuemei!

595
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,299
Gao Xuemei!

596
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:30,099
Out of my way!

597
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:39,539
Your mom?

598
00:23:42,739 --> 00:23:44,539
Xie, what's wrong?

599
00:23:49,339 --> 00:23:50,019
You...

600
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,339
When did you learn to lie?

601
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:02,220
You said
you went to Nanzhou for supplies.

602
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:03,339
What supplies?

603
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:03,980
I...

604
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,180
What did you get?

605
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:05,940
I was wrong.

606
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,220
To be specific!

607
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,059
You worked with the investor
to deceive me, didn't you?

608
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,339
No, Xie.

609
00:24:11,339 --> 00:24:13,059
I admit I didn't think this through.

610
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,860
I should have discussed it
with you first.

611
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,460
Gao Xuemei!

612
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:18,299
I didn't see this coming.

613
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,460
What your mom did

614
00:24:22,779 --> 00:24:24,739
caused big trouble for Yuehai.

615
00:24:24,739 --> 00:24:26,180
Very big trouble!

616
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,059
No matter what you did before,

617
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:39,700
withdraw immediately. Right now!

618
00:24:39,739 --> 00:24:40,440
Okay.

619
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,339
We only have one factory.

620
00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:44,900
Are you ruining it?

621
00:24:45,099 --> 00:24:46,180
No, I am not.

622
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:48,739
Don't turn the pillar industry
into a stupid one.

623
00:24:48,819 --> 00:24:49,579
Use your head.

624
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:50,860
Please, use your head!

625
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,779
Yes.

626
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:54,460
Let others be pillars. You be a brick.

627
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,800
Okay.

628
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:58,539
Too sweet.

629
00:24:59,180 --> 00:24:59,779
Really?

630
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,620
Too sweet.

631
00:25:02,819 --> 00:25:04,220
You never listen to me.

632
00:25:04,299 --> 00:25:06,180
- You never listen to me.
- I never learn.

633
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,460
You let those 'monkeys'...

634
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:09,380
I'm talking about you. Get out!

635
00:25:09,499 --> 00:25:10,140
Leave!

636
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:10,739
Leave!

637
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:11,940
Everyone, withdraw!

638
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,019
Don't participate.

639
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,140
Withdraw, all of you.

640
00:25:17,019 --> 00:25:20,099
Xie, how could we possibly persuade them

641
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:20,940
about this?

642
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,579
Ultimately, Mr. Zheng
will decide on this matter.

643
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,779
What does he think about it?

644
00:25:26,739 --> 00:25:27,739
Did you vote?

645
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,420
Let me tell you, today...

646
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,739
Why am I even telling you this?

647
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:34,220
Stay out of this!

648
00:25:34,456 --> 00:25:35,320
Careful, it's hot!

649
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:43,700
Hello?

650
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:45,299
Ms. Liu, you're home?

651
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:47,420
About what happened today...

652
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,059
Qiuping.

653
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:52,940
This matter has nothing
to do with you anymore.

654
00:25:53,579 --> 00:25:54,620
Tell Zheng Decheng.

655
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,819
There's no turning back from this point.

656
00:25:57,299 --> 00:25:59,339
We are determined to get Binhai Road.

657
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,420
A blackout?

658
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,059
Why?

659
00:26:33,339 --> 00:26:34,460
Sudden blackout. Why?

660
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,299
Who has candles?

661
00:26:35,864 --> 00:26:37,560
- Why is the power out?
- Who has candles?

662
00:26:38,499 --> 00:26:39,339
What's going on?

663
00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:40,420
Sudden blackout.

664
00:26:40,819 --> 00:26:41,620
Any candles?

665
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,620
Got any candles?

666
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:45,940
What's happening?

667
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:46,980
Why is the power out?

668
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:47,980
What's going on?

669
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:48,739
Can't see a thing.

670
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,019
Does anyone have candles?

671
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:51,819
No.

672
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:53,019
Do you have any lights?

673
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:53,700
Any lights?

674
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:54,739
Zhuang, any lights?

675
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:55,620
Any candles at home?

676
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,220
Yes.

677
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:56,739
Yes.

678
00:26:56,819 --> 00:26:57,579
Lights coming!

679
00:26:57,579 --> 00:26:58,460
Lights coming!

680
00:27:02,099 --> 00:27:02,660
Mr. Zheng.

681
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,059
What's the rush?

682
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,180
Take your time.

683
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,620
It's dark inside.

684
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,779
Go inside, Mr. Zheng.

685
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:10,620
Where is he?

686
00:27:12,819 --> 00:27:13,940
What are you doing, Fatty?

687
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:15,339
You...

688
00:27:15,339 --> 00:27:16,380
Changyuan is inside.

689
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,019
Careful.

690
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,579
You're crazy, acting all mysterious.

691
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:24,460
Changyuan.

692
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:27,900
Qian Changyuan.

693
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,900
Mr. Zheng, I'm inside.

694
00:27:32,299 --> 00:27:32,940
Where?

695
00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:35,620
Inside.

696
00:27:38,499 --> 00:27:39,220
Qian Changyuan.

697
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:58,900
What's wrong? Acting all mysterious.

698
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:02,259
Mr. Zheng.

699
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:03,739
Sorry

700
00:28:05,579 --> 00:28:06,460
to trouble you.

701
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,180
Boss!

702
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:20,980
Don't call her boss. Call her Ms. Gao.

703
00:28:22,299 --> 00:28:24,779
Ms. Gao, why was there no notice
about this blackout?

704
00:28:25,299 --> 00:28:26,900
How should I know?

705
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:28,539
How are we supposed to work?

706
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:31,860
You can ask me. I'm a town official.

707
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,499
Well then, sir, why is the power out?

708
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,592
I'll go ask the town government.

709
00:28:43,739 --> 00:28:44,380
Finished?

710
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,739
Be careful with fire!
This is a printery.

711
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,620
Don't worry.

712
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,220
Hold on.

713
00:28:49,499 --> 00:28:50,900
Take a flashlight to light the way.

714
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:51,900
Take your time.

715
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,700
Be careful.

716
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,420
I need this to light my path ahead.

717
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:05,819
Alas.

718
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,220
You scared me!

719
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:15,980
Key.

720
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,539
Safe.

721
00:29:31,579 --> 00:29:32,460
Don't want to give it?

722
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,059
Of course not. It belongs to you.

723
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,940
See? You have more keys

724
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,019
than I do.

725
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,259
I work for you.

726
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,019
Is this the only key to the safe?

727
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,980
It's an unexpected blackout.

728
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,660
Hello?

729
00:30:06,232 --> 00:30:06,744
Hello?

730
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,632
Is this the Power Supply Bureau?

731
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:10,019
This is Yuehai Town.

732
00:30:10,819 --> 00:30:13,180
I'd like to inquire about the reason
for the sudden blackout

733
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:13,860
in Yuehai.

734
00:30:14,072 --> 00:30:15,352
(Pingchuan Power Supply Bureau)

735
00:30:15,352 --> 00:30:16,460
It's a scheduled blackout.

736
00:30:17,539 --> 00:30:18,460
A scheduled blackout?

737
00:30:19,059 --> 00:30:20,620
According to the power usage standards,

738
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:23,739
we weren't scheduled
for a power outage today.

739
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,180
I don't know about that.

740
00:30:26,779 --> 00:30:27,940
I'm just the on-duty staff.

741
00:30:28,299 --> 00:30:30,259
Call back tomorrow during office hours.

742
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:45,819
What do you mean?

743
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,660
I heard

744
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:50,180
the cadres
from both the town and the county

745
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,539
have signed the letter of intent.

746
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,779
If you ask them to give up,

747
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:54,860
they won't agree.

748
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,140
I totally understand.

749
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,499
So, I want you

750
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,099
to help persuade them.

751
00:31:02,739 --> 00:31:04,620
See, there are so many people involved.

752
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:06,579
There are many things to take care of

753
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:09,420
and cost money, right?

754
00:31:11,499 --> 00:31:12,180
How much?

755
00:31:13,579 --> 00:31:14,299
50,000 yuan.

756
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,499
50,000 yuan.

757
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,660
It's already counted?

758
00:31:32,739 --> 00:31:33,380
Sure.

759
00:31:33,499 --> 00:31:34,099
500 yuan.

760
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:34,660
Thank you.

761
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,059
Ms. Li.

762
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,059
Mom.

763
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:40,620
- Ms. Li is here.
- Hello, Ms. Li.

764
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,380
Hello.

765
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,099
Don't mind me.

766
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,339
Ms. Li.

767
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,180
Xuemei.

768
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,700
This is...

769
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,539
They just started their businesses.

770
00:31:49,539 --> 00:31:50,739
They're not established yet.

771
00:31:51,019 --> 00:31:52,120
They trust me,

772
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,784
so they use my account for transactions.

773
00:31:53,784 --> 00:31:55,860
I withdraw the cash
and give it to them separately.

774
00:31:56,099 --> 00:31:57,940
I just take a small service fee.

775
00:31:58,259 --> 00:32:00,339
Actually, you gave me this idea.

776
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,140
Xuemei.

777
00:32:02,808 --> 00:32:03,499
Xuemei.

778
00:32:03,499 --> 00:32:04,099
Coming.

779
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:05,980
I've checked it.

780
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,059
I've counted it.

781
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:07,940
Exactly right.

782
00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:09,499
Same as usual.

783
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,019
Keep this, and thank you.

784
00:32:11,099 --> 00:32:11,819
You're welcome.

785
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,499
No problem?

786
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,499
No problem at all.

787
00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:14,180
I have to go.

788
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:14,739
Alright.

789
00:32:14,739 --> 00:32:15,819
See you, Ms. Li.

790
00:32:16,259 --> 00:32:17,019
Take care.

791
00:32:18,579 --> 00:32:21,019
I was worried
the sudden blackout would cause chaos.

792
00:32:21,259 --> 00:32:23,220
But you've calmed everyone down.

793
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,700
Don't worry about us.

794
00:32:26,499 --> 00:32:27,019
Listen.

795
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,180
Hear the sound of counting money.

796
00:32:33,779 --> 00:32:35,448
As long as we're still counting money,

797
00:32:36,024 --> 00:32:37,240
everyone can rest easy.

798
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,819
Ms. Li, can you imagine?

799
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,380
Once the printing street is built,

800
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,432
the whole street will be filled

801
00:32:45,432 --> 00:32:47,064
with the sound of counting money.

802
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,299
Ms. Li.

803
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,019
We truly hope
the printing street can be built.

804
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:52,140
Yes, Ms. Li.

805
00:32:52,499 --> 00:32:53,940
Can it really happen?

806
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:56,700
Yes.

807
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,019
It will happen. Rest assured.

808
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:10,779
1,000 yuan per stack.

809
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:11,620
50 stacks in total.

810
00:33:18,819 --> 00:33:19,739
It would take me

811
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,099
a month to earn this much.

812
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:26,739
So much money!

813
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,700
It would take me 40 years to earn it!

814
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,819
I've already budgeted extra.

815
00:33:43,739 --> 00:33:45,059
You still owe money

816
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:47,259
for raising turtles, right?

817
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:49,980
Yes.

818
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,579
So,

819
00:33:56,259 --> 00:33:58,099
to repay my debt,

820
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,779
I have to become a stupid bribe taker?

821
00:34:05,779 --> 00:34:07,660
Mr. Zheng.

822
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,619
Mr. Zheng.

823
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,260
Please take it and help me.

824
00:34:10,499 --> 00:34:12,300
You're bribing a public official.

825
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:14,740
Shall I call the police
to arrest you right now?

826
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:17,980
Mr. Zheng, I was wrong!

827
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:18,872
I lost my mind.

828
00:34:18,872 --> 00:34:20,300
I care too much about Binhai Road.

829
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:22,659
Arrest just me, Mr. Zheng!

830
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,619
Please help us.

831
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,232
Where are you going?

832
00:34:30,456 --> 00:34:31,960
To the Power Supply Bureau. And you?

833
00:34:32,059 --> 00:34:32,940
Me too.

834
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,940
You don't need to.

835
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,260
I can deal with

836
00:34:36,499 --> 00:34:37,820
Wang Defa alone.

837
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:46,219
Hello?

838
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:48,780
What?

839
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:55,704
Why didn't you stop them
from going to the Power Supply Bureau?

840
00:34:56,184 --> 00:34:57,368
How long have they been gone?

841
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,179
Okay. Got it.

842
00:35:01,139 --> 00:35:01,900
What's wrong now?

843
00:35:09,499 --> 00:35:12,019
Fatty, we're almost
at the Power Supply Bureau.

844
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,420
Listen up, everyone!

845
00:35:16,139 --> 00:35:19,260
This time, we're fighting
for the 'monkeys' of Yuehai.

846
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,420
We can only win.

847
00:35:20,539 --> 00:35:21,179
Got it?

848
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,059
- Yes!
- Yes!

849
00:35:22,219 --> 00:35:23,219
If we lose,

850
00:35:23,699 --> 00:35:26,579
all our factories
will be shut down. Got it?

851
00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:29,260
Watch out!

852
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,219
Do you even know how to drive?

853
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,980
Mr. Zheng!

854
00:35:51,579 --> 00:35:52,340
Turn around?

855
00:36:20,059 --> 00:36:21,300
Mr. Zheng!

856
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,260
I don't want
to make Binhai Road's things worse.

857
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,820
So before we go in,
I'd like an agreement on three things.

858
00:36:29,659 --> 00:36:31,059
Tell me. What three things?

859
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,900
No swearing. No bad language.

860
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,780
No fights.

861
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,619
Hello.

862
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,380
We're from Yuehai
and are here to see Mr. Wang.

863
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,139
May I ask where his office is?

864
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:45,980
From Yuehai?

865
00:36:46,659 --> 00:36:48,699
Well, he is in a meeting upstairs.

866
00:36:49,059 --> 00:36:50,820
It'll take a while. Just wait.

867
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,699
Then, may I ask where we can wait?

868
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,139
Wherever you like.

869
00:36:55,219 --> 00:36:56,740
How can you talk like that?

870
00:36:57,699 --> 00:36:58,499
What's wrong?

871
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,940
I always talk like this.

872
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:01,619
Isn't Yuehai pretty capable?

873
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,059
Solve problems yourselves.

874
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:04,139
Why come to us?

875
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:05,752
I...

876
00:37:07,179 --> 00:37:07,900
Are you okay?

877
00:37:08,619 --> 00:37:09,176
It's okay.

878
00:37:09,539 --> 00:37:10,420
Okay, sir.

879
00:37:10,499 --> 00:37:11,380
We'll wait here.

880
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:13,619
You little...

881
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:18,420
That's Zheng Decheng?

882
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:20,659
I get it now.

883
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,699
He doesn't even look like a good person.

884
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,460
You...

885
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,460
I know. The three things.

886
00:37:30,659 --> 00:37:34,059
Seems Wang Defa doesn't want
to see us at all.

887
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,499
So what do we do?

888
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:41,980
Go upstairs.

889
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:46,420
Mr. Zheng, don't do anything rash!

890
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:47,539
Relax.

891
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:48,699
Didn't he say?

892
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,940
We can wait wherever we please.

893
00:37:57,699 --> 00:37:58,699
Come on. Sit.

894
00:37:59,300 --> 00:37:59,900
It's fine.

895
00:38:07,192 --> 00:38:08,824
(Men's Restroom)

896
00:38:10,499 --> 00:38:12,900
Excuse me. Can I ask you something?

897
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:16,099
How many men's restrooms are
in this building?

898
00:38:16,699 --> 00:38:17,688
Only one men's restroom.

899
00:38:18,616 --> 00:38:19,768
This is the only one?

900
00:38:20,019 --> 00:38:21,139
Got it. Thanks.

901
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,340
Mr. Zheng, why are we waiting here?

902
00:38:25,659 --> 00:38:26,659
It saves time.

903
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,820
Trust me. We'll catch him
within half an hour.

904
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,499
Are you sure?

905
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:35,059
Yes. Who doesn't need the bathroom
during a meeting?

906
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,699
Besides,

907
00:38:38,659 --> 00:38:42,260
Mr. Wang has kidney problems.

908
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,019
How do you know?

909
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,659
I know, of course.

910
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,780
We used to work with me.

911
00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:48,980
He was my deputy.

912
00:38:51,928 --> 00:38:52,920
(Personnel Department)
I'm going to the restroom.

913
00:38:57,976 --> 00:38:58,619
Mr. Wang.

914
00:38:58,980 --> 00:38:59,740
Hello.

915
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:02,940
Mr. Wang.

916
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:06,980
See? I told you.

917
00:39:09,019 --> 00:39:09,699
Mr. Wang.

918
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:10,900
Mr. Wang.

919
00:39:12,088 --> 00:39:13,016
Going to the restroom?

920
00:39:13,179 --> 00:39:13,980
Sure.

921
00:39:14,059 --> 00:39:14,740
Is it urgent?

922
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,780
Well, we're here

923
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,579
for the power supply to Yuehai.

924
00:39:19,139 --> 00:39:20,059
Just a short talk.

925
00:39:20,139 --> 00:39:21,300
We won't keep you long.

926
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,059
Five minutes at most, okay?

927
00:39:23,139 --> 00:39:24,579
Let me use the restroom first.

928
00:39:26,139 --> 00:39:26,940
Mr. Wang.

929
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:27,980
Look,

930
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:29,860
from last night until now,

931
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,619
Yuehai has been without power.

932
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,900
But according to the power schedule,

933
00:39:36,219 --> 00:39:38,300
it's not Yuehai's turn
for nighttime outages yet.

934
00:39:38,619 --> 00:39:39,900
- Right.
- So what's going on?

935
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:43,940
Well, here is the thing.

936
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,820
The whole county,

937
00:39:48,139 --> 00:39:50,300
not just the county, the whole city is

938
00:39:50,659 --> 00:39:52,619
in very short supply of electricity.

939
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,300
So, a new power outage policy

940
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,219
has been introduced.

941
00:39:58,019 --> 00:39:58,780
Got it?

942
00:39:59,059 --> 00:40:00,900
I need to use the restroom right now.

943
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:01,539
Come on.

944
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,340
The new power outage policy, right?

945
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,659
How come we never heard of it?

946
00:40:05,699 --> 00:40:06,340
Exactly.

947
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,740
You didn't get the notice?

948
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:10,980
It's strange.

949
00:40:11,059 --> 00:40:12,539
Then, I have no idea.

950
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,900
Mr. Wang, when exactly
will the power come back?

951
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,579
When will it come back?

952
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,139
Let me check for you.

953
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,219
Wait a moment.

954
00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:22,740
Huang!

955
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,460
Bring the schedule over here.

956
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:26,740
Which schedule?

957
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,056
The power supply schedule.

958
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,019
Got it.

959
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:29,820
Hurry up.

960
00:40:31,579 --> 00:40:32,420
Wait a second.

961
00:40:32,499 --> 00:40:33,579
You'll see the schedule.

962
00:40:33,699 --> 00:40:34,699
I'll use the restroom.

963
00:40:35,059 --> 00:40:36,780
Then, wait until the schedule arrives.

964
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,139
Go after it arrives.

965
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,059
- The schedule!
- Quick!

966
00:40:44,179 --> 00:40:45,260
Okay, go back.

967
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,260
Right here. Take a look.

968
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,380
Look at this.

969
00:40:55,059 --> 00:40:55,940
Look.

970
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:59,260
Yuehai will have power restored
in one hour.

971
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:02,179
Municipal and residential areas
will get power first.

972
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,300
As for enterprises and factories,

973
00:41:04,499 --> 00:41:06,260
their power remains cut
for two more days.

974
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,380
Wang Defa.

975
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:11,699
Are you doing this on purpose?

976
00:41:11,699 --> 00:41:14,340
Why do you think so?
Didn't you see the schedule?

977
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:15,460
Wang Defa!

978
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,740
Yuehai has so many factories,
big and small.

979
00:41:18,139 --> 00:41:20,539
Do you know how much money
one day of outage costs?

980
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,460
I'm not swearing.

981
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,099
I remember the three rules.

982
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,740
But you never said
I couldn't yell, right?

983
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,139
Can't I yell at you?

984
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:37,179
Mr. Wang, this isn't right.

985
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,460
Mr. Wang, look.

986
00:41:39,699 --> 00:41:40,740
Yuehai's enterprises

987
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,584
have longer outages than others.

988
00:41:42,776 --> 00:41:44,408
Why is that?

989
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,219
Jinxiang's enterprises
have an 8-hour outage.

990
00:41:48,579 --> 00:41:51,059
Pingchuan's enterprises
have an 11-hour outage.

991
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,460
(Power Outage Schedule)
Only Yuehai Town's outage

992
00:41:53,659 --> 00:41:54,900
lasts 72 hours.

993
00:41:55,219 --> 00:41:56,499
Well, that makes sense.

994
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,340
We base the outage duration

995
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:02,579
on your electricity consumption,

996
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:03,139
alright?

997
00:42:03,139 --> 00:42:05,940
Look, Yuehai has so many businesses.

998
00:42:06,059 --> 00:42:07,019
With huge power usage.

999
00:42:07,179 --> 00:42:10,099
Naturally, the outage lasts longer.

1000
00:42:10,499 --> 00:42:11,860
I have to use the restroom.

1001
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,460
No, wait.

1002
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:18,219
Fine.

1003
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,860
Yuehai is exceptional, okay?

1004
00:42:21,219 --> 00:42:23,900
More businesses, higher electricity use.

1005
00:42:24,179 --> 00:42:26,619
But you can't ignore others' survival.

1006
00:42:27,059 --> 00:42:28,340
If you hog all the power,

1007
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,099
what about others?

1008
00:42:30,104 --> 00:42:30,872
You...

1009
00:42:33,304 --> 00:42:34,008
(Men's Restroom)

1010
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,019
Let me ask you.

1011
00:42:37,059 --> 00:42:38,860
Is this about Binhai Road?
Are you purposely

1012
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,300
tripping me up

1013
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:41,860
and messing with me?

1014
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,499
What makes you think so?

1015
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,740
I'm just a minor director.

1016
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:50,980
Do I have that much power?

1017
00:42:51,179 --> 00:42:52,619
I'm not the one calling the shots.

1018
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,900
Then, who ordered you to do this?

1019
00:42:55,219 --> 00:42:56,340
There you go again.

1020
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,820
Look, his wording is inappropriate.

1021
00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:01,099
What do you mean by "order"?

1022
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,168
