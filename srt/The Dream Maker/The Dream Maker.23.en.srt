16
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:39,298
By the way, Qiuping.

17
00:01:39,858 --> 00:01:41,698
Where were we just now?

18
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:43,338
Right, Yuehai.

19
00:01:43,858 --> 00:01:44,358
Yeah.

20
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:46,979
We're family. So let's speak frankly.

21
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,418
You want me to work at your hospital.

22
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:52,138
I might not be able to.

23
00:01:55,138 --> 00:01:56,379
Wait, Mom.

24
00:01:56,498 --> 00:01:57,739
Could you reconsider?

25
00:02:00,778 --> 00:02:01,819
It must be...

26
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:05,979
the hospital paging me.

27
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:09,898
An emergency surgery needs my backup.

28
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:12,018
Sorry, Qiuping.

29
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:14,259
I can't keep you company
after your long journey.

30
00:02:14,418 --> 00:02:16,539
Tao, take good care of Qiuping.
I must go.

31
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:17,819
It's okay, ma'am. Go ahead.

32
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:18,339
Okay.

33
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:18,898
Don't go, Mom.

34
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:20,578
It's too late.

35
00:02:23,578 --> 00:02:24,339
Sit down.

36
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:25,659
Sit.

37
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:27,618
Qiuping, why are you stopping me?

38
00:02:27,618 --> 00:02:29,939
You traveled all this way
only to give up now?

39
00:02:30,339 --> 00:02:31,379
Of course not.

40
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:35,059
How much does your mom love eating?

41
00:02:36,339 --> 00:02:37,059
Put it this way.

42
00:02:37,418 --> 00:02:39,219
She once took an overnight train
to Wuhan

43
00:02:39,298 --> 00:02:40,738
to eat authentic hot dry noodles.

44
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:47,259
Then I know what to do.

45
00:02:50,168 --> 00:02:51,576
Pork trotters and soybean terrine.

46
00:02:52,856 --> 00:02:54,008
Fish balls in clear broth.

47
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:55,219
Don't order too much.

48
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:56,499
It's all light.

49
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:58,618
This place is Yuehai's

50
00:02:58,898 --> 00:03:01,018
most famous snack street,
full of delicious food.

51
00:03:01,138 --> 00:03:02,339
Every stall is fantastic.

52
00:03:02,339 --> 00:03:03,898
- Lupu braised pork rice.
- You take your time.

53
00:03:04,344 --> 00:03:05,752
Special stir-fried rice noodles.

54
00:03:05,918 --> 00:03:06,418
Okay.

55
00:03:06,418 --> 00:03:07,018
It's enough.

56
00:03:07,138 --> 00:03:08,659
Alright, that should be about it.

57
00:03:08,798 --> 00:03:09,298
Okay.

58
00:03:09,298 --> 00:03:09,798
Wait.

59
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:12,499
You also have drunken shrimp.

60
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:13,759
- Yes.
- Right?

61
00:03:13,779 --> 00:03:16,138
It's their specialty. Very delicious.
I highly recommend it.

62
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:17,099
You must try it.

63
00:03:17,418 --> 00:03:18,059
Is that all?

64
00:03:18,059 --> 00:03:18,559
That's all.

65
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:19,159
Okay.

66
00:03:20,339 --> 00:03:21,539
This place is down-to-earth.

67
00:03:21,779 --> 00:03:23,032
It has many more tasty things.

68
00:03:24,259 --> 00:03:25,219
Enjoy yourself.

69
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:28,819
Stir-fried noodles are here. Enjoy.

70
00:03:29,738 --> 00:03:30,858
This is also delicious.

71
00:03:30,858 --> 00:03:32,059
It's good. Eat quickly.

72
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:34,339
Mr. Zheng,

73
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:36,819
should you be eating such greasy food?

74
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,059
We're treating Dr. Jiang.

75
00:03:41,298 --> 00:03:43,238
To be polite, we should eat some too.

76
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:45,298
How is it, Dr. Jiang?

77
00:03:46,178 --> 00:03:46,979
Do you like it?

78
00:03:47,738 --> 00:03:48,779
I never expected

79
00:03:48,779 --> 00:03:51,418
a small place like Yuehai
to have so many delicacies.

80
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:52,418
Mr. Zheng,

81
00:03:53,018 --> 00:03:55,659
especially the drunken shrimp
you ordered. Right?

82
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:56,939
Tasty?

83
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:58,099
I've never eaten

84
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:00,018
such fresh and delicious shrimp.
It's tasty.

85
00:04:00,018 --> 00:04:00,518
Right?

86
00:04:01,178 --> 00:04:02,779
As the saying goes,

87
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:04,792
quality calls for a good eye.

88
00:04:05,138 --> 00:04:06,779
Good food also needs

89
00:04:07,018 --> 00:04:09,259
someone like you who appreciates it.

90
00:04:09,738 --> 00:04:12,819
Mr. Zheng, I know what you want to say.

91
00:04:14,138 --> 00:04:16,498
Though I love good food,

92
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,178
I won't change my plans

93
00:04:19,938 --> 00:04:21,298
just for a meal.

94
00:04:22,418 --> 00:04:24,378
But I will visit Yuehai often.

95
00:04:25,418 --> 00:04:26,258
My answer

96
00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:28,019
might disappoint you both.

97
00:04:28,178 --> 00:04:30,659
I probably won't accept your invitation.

98
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:33,779
But Qiuping and Mr. Zheng,
this meal is on me.

99
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:35,418
Thank you for your high regard.

100
00:04:36,219 --> 00:04:37,858
No. We'll treat you.

101
00:04:39,938 --> 00:04:40,858
What's happening?

102
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:44,339
Mr. Zheng? Mr. Zheng?

103
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:46,779
What act is this?

104
00:04:47,298 --> 00:04:49,659
Ma'am, Mr. Zheng
might really want you to stay.

105
00:04:49,938 --> 00:04:51,178
Mr. Zheng, stop pretending.

106
00:04:51,298 --> 00:04:52,938
Mr. Zheng? Mr. Zheng?

107
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:54,899
Mr. Zheng must be exhausted.

108
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:56,818
Mr. Zheng? Mr. Zheng?

109
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:00,099
Does Mr. Zheng
have any underlying conditions?

110
00:05:01,178 --> 00:05:02,418
He has gallstones.

111
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,858
Get him to the hospital fast.
He might need surgery.

112
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:05,738
Help!

113
00:05:06,258 --> 00:05:07,139
Someone, help!

114
00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:08,378
Come on, carry him away.

115
00:05:08,498 --> 00:05:09,178
Thank you.

116
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:09,779
Come on.

117
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:10,339
- Slowly.
- Let me.

118
00:05:10,378 --> 00:05:10,878
Thank you.

119
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:15,579
Hold it tight.

120
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,139
Don't tear the wound.

121
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:17,779
Okay.

122
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:18,298
Be careful.

123
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:25,418
Mr. Zheng.

124
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:26,618
Li.

125
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:27,118
How are you?

126
00:05:27,258 --> 00:05:28,418
You finally came.

127
00:05:29,258 --> 00:05:30,659
You know, I opened my eyes

128
00:05:31,738 --> 00:05:32,738
with my gallbladder gone.

129
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:35,979
From now on,
I'm a person without a gallbladder.

130
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:37,699
What am I going to do?

131
00:05:38,498 --> 00:05:41,659
You ate too much grease last night.
It was a biliary tract infection.

132
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:44,899
Luckily, Dr. Jiang
performed surgery on you in time.

133
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:48,738
Has Dr. Jiang left?

134
00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:51,339
She still has work. She left first.

135
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:54,339
She's left?

136
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:56,279
Then...

137
00:05:57,099 --> 00:05:58,339
did we get our business done?

138
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:00,058
Was the contract signed?

139
00:06:00,298 --> 00:06:01,219
Not yet.

140
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:03,498
Isn't that a loss?

141
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:06,418
I could've hopped around to recover.

142
00:06:06,818 --> 00:06:09,539
Now with Dr. Jiang gone
and the contract not signed,

143
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:10,779
didn't I suffer for nothing?

144
00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:12,659
I'm afraid so.

145
00:06:14,178 --> 00:06:16,539
If you could just hop around
to get better,

146
00:06:16,858 --> 00:06:17,818
why did you need me?

147
00:06:18,618 --> 00:06:21,258
Dr. Jiang, I was just joking with Li.

148
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:23,378
You're back.

149
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:26,178
Well, look,

150
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:27,298
I'm your patient now, right?

151
00:06:27,938 --> 00:06:29,418
Shouldn't you be responsible for me?

152
00:06:29,938 --> 00:06:32,899
As a doctor,
I'm responsible for all my patients.

153
00:06:33,938 --> 00:06:35,178
Let me see the thermometer.

154
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:46,779
You still have a slight fever.

155
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:52,298
Dr. Jiang,

156
00:06:53,418 --> 00:06:55,219
on behalf of the Yuehai Town government,

157
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,498
I formally invite you

158
00:06:56,498 --> 00:06:59,099
to serve as the director
of Yuehai People's Hospital.

159
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,099
Please look at the contract.

160
00:07:01,178 --> 00:07:02,858
If there are any problems
with the terms,

161
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:03,858
we can discuss.

162
00:07:05,378 --> 00:07:06,019
Have you farted?

163
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:08,539
Have you farted?

164
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:12,818
You can drink
a small amount of water now.

165
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:16,498
But you can only eat after passing gas.

166
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:17,159
Understand?

167
00:07:17,418 --> 00:07:19,219
Come on, let me check your wound.

168
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:20,199
Okay.

169
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:21,519
Come on.

170
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:23,099
Come on. Bend your legs.

171
00:07:25,618 --> 00:07:26,118
Done.

172
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:30,018
(Employment Contract)

173
00:07:31,498 --> 00:07:34,378
Dr. Jiang, sign this contract.

174
00:07:34,738 --> 00:07:36,579
Then I'll let you check my wound.

175
00:07:40,178 --> 00:07:43,258
This is a hospital, not your office.

176
00:07:43,618 --> 00:07:45,258
If you want me to be the director,

177
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:48,099
then I should be
in charge of hospital matters.

178
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:51,378
Dr. Jiang, rest assured.

179
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:53,339
The terms are stated clearly.

180
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:55,178
As long as you come to Yuehai,

181
00:07:55,498 --> 00:07:57,899
you will have full authority
over all hospital matters.

182
00:08:01,618 --> 00:08:02,938
If we sign a contract,

183
00:08:03,378 --> 00:08:05,058
is an annual renewal acceptable?

184
00:08:05,378 --> 00:08:06,498
- No problem.
- No problem.

185
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:09,039
Okay.

186
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:11,659
Let me look it over,
and I'll get back to you.

187
00:08:14,058 --> 00:08:16,618
You still have a low fever.
Keep taking the antibiotics.

188
00:08:17,058 --> 00:08:17,558
Okay.

189
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:20,258
Can I put my legs down now?

190
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:23,699
Aren't you able to hop around?

191
00:08:33,618 --> 00:08:35,858
Li, I feel something isn't right.

192
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,579
My wound seems to be hurting
more and more. Is that normal?

193
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:39,658
It's normal.

194
00:08:40,138 --> 00:08:41,658
The anesthesia is wearing off.

195
00:08:42,498 --> 00:08:43,179
No.

196
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,538
I feel that Dr. Jiang's incision

197
00:08:46,138 --> 00:08:47,378
was an act of revenge.

198
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,538
Then you had it coming.

199
00:08:55,498 --> 00:08:55,998
Come on.

200
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:58,498
Put down your work
and come here, everyone.

201
00:09:00,219 --> 00:09:00,719
Mr. Xiao.

202
00:09:00,738 --> 00:09:02,579
I have a surprise for everyone.

203
00:09:03,658 --> 00:09:05,538
Mr. Xiao, is this the latest pager?

204
00:09:05,699 --> 00:09:06,378
Yes.

205
00:09:06,819 --> 00:09:08,378
The newspaper's perk for all of us.

206
00:09:08,498 --> 00:09:09,419
Everyone gets one.

207
00:09:09,939 --> 00:09:10,858
Easy. One for each.

208
00:09:10,858 --> 00:09:13,579
Mr. Xiao, is there some good news?

209
00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:14,858
Of course.

210
00:09:16,258 --> 00:09:16,979
Du Tao is back.

211
00:09:17,939 --> 00:09:18,439
Du.

212
00:09:18,939 --> 00:09:20,258
Speak of the devil.

213
00:09:20,498 --> 00:09:20,998
Come on, Du.

214
00:09:21,898 --> 00:09:22,699
Listen to me.

215
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,339
You all have Du to thank for this perk.

216
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,979
His article
criticizing outlandish fashion

217
00:09:28,099 --> 00:09:29,618
not only got back on page two

218
00:09:29,618 --> 00:09:32,018
but also garnered
widespread public attention.

219
00:09:32,498 --> 00:09:35,658
And it doubled
our paper's sales this week.

220
00:09:37,819 --> 00:09:38,898
Thank you, Du Tao.

221
00:09:39,099 --> 00:09:39,939
Fantastic.

222
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,378
Here, try some new tea.

223
00:09:46,939 --> 00:09:47,618
Thank you.

224
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:51,819
Du, your recent articles
have been truly impressive.

225
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:53,819
I'm flattered, Mr. Xiao.

226
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:56,979
Articles about Reform and Opening-up
are a dime a dozen these years.

227
00:09:57,898 --> 00:10:00,219
But your articles
are both fresh in angle

228
00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:01,538
and sharp in viewpoint.

229
00:10:02,618 --> 00:10:05,738
Keeping you in the supplement section
was a waste of talent.

230
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:06,898
Not at all.

231
00:10:07,219 --> 00:10:09,699
I saw working in the supplement section
as good practice.

232
00:10:10,018 --> 00:10:12,618
Especially since I received
many reader letters there.

233
00:10:13,099 --> 00:10:15,658
You never know
who you'll find among your readers.

234
00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:18,459
To be honest, many of my article leads

235
00:10:18,738 --> 00:10:20,099
came from those letters.

236
00:10:20,819 --> 00:10:21,319
Really?

237
00:10:22,819 --> 00:10:25,898
Seems opportunity
truly favors the prepared.

238
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:30,219
I called you here today
to share some news.

239
00:10:35,819 --> 00:10:37,339
I'm resigning to go to Shanghai.

240
00:10:38,018 --> 00:10:39,658
I'm starting a magazine

241
00:10:39,898 --> 00:10:43,138
focused on social news
with my ex-classmate, Hu.

242
00:10:44,658 --> 00:10:46,738
Mr. Xiao, you're leaving the paper?

243
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:48,738
For Shanghai?

244
00:10:49,258 --> 00:10:49,758
Yes.

245
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,378
The years of Reform and Opening-up

246
00:10:53,618 --> 00:10:56,538
have indeed brought
many inspiring stories,

247
00:10:57,018 --> 00:10:58,738
but they've also spawned
numerous problems.

248
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,498
I believe we journalists

249
00:11:01,738 --> 00:11:04,579
have the duty and obligation
to dissect these issues.

250
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:05,939
So,

251
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:09,699
I want to create a platform
where I can truly make a difference.

252
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:20,738
Mr. Xiao, I...

253
00:11:22,018 --> 00:11:22,819
I'll be direct then.

254
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:25,018
I want to go too.

255
00:11:25,258 --> 00:11:26,618
Could you take me with you?

256
00:11:28,738 --> 00:11:29,299
Du,

257
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:31,738
you've been my subordinate for years.

258
00:11:31,939 --> 00:11:33,579
I know your capabilities well.

259
00:11:34,378 --> 00:11:35,979
But I must be honest with you.

260
00:11:37,099 --> 00:11:38,898
If you really want to go to Shanghai,

261
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:43,778
you need a truly impactful report
as your calling card.

262
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,258
Okay, I understand.

263
00:11:47,299 --> 00:11:48,738
I... I will prove myself.

264
00:11:49,898 --> 00:11:50,738
It's up to you.

265
00:11:53,699 --> 00:11:54,538
One more thing.

266
00:11:54,898 --> 00:11:56,939
If you do go to Shanghai,

267
00:11:57,219 --> 00:11:58,778
what about your girlfriend in Yuehai?

268
00:12:00,378 --> 00:12:01,258
She should be fine.

269
00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:11,319
Hello?

270
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:12,258
Qiuping?

271
00:12:12,778 --> 00:12:13,498
There's something.

272
00:12:13,939 --> 00:12:16,419
It's about
our paper's chief editor, Mr. Xiao.

273
00:12:16,538 --> 00:12:18,538
He might be transferred.

274
00:12:21,378 --> 00:12:22,138
And then?

275
00:12:23,299 --> 00:12:24,378
Then...

276
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:29,199
Never mind.

277
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,419
Look, I... I need
to return another call first.

278
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:32,839
Okay.

279
00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:33,959
Bye.

280
00:12:56,299 --> 00:12:56,979
Coming.

281
00:12:57,459 --> 00:12:58,179
Okay.

282
00:12:58,299 --> 00:12:59,059
More pieces.

283
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:00,299
- Come on.
- No need, Ms. Xiao.

284
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:02,018
Thanks. Really, no need.

285
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:03,512
Young people should eat more.

286
00:13:03,898 --> 00:13:04,459
It's enough.

287
00:13:06,858 --> 00:13:08,658
Look, there's barely any meat in it.

288
00:13:08,898 --> 00:13:09,398
Stop it.

289
00:13:10,618 --> 00:13:11,118
Oh no.

290
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:13,419
Ms. Xiao's signature dishes:

291
00:13:14,219 --> 00:13:15,538
cabbage and braised fish chunks.

292
00:13:16,538 --> 00:13:18,339
Muddy taste, cabbage nightmare.

293
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:20,459
Alright, stop whining.

294
00:13:21,378 --> 00:13:22,538
Be grateful for having food.

295
00:13:24,018 --> 00:13:25,459
Qingtian, no offense,

296
00:13:25,699 --> 00:13:27,979
but you should learn some manners
from your master.

297
00:13:28,219 --> 00:13:29,738
A gentleman is aboveboard, you know?

298
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,699
If you dare,
say it to Ms. Xiao directly.

299
00:13:32,538 --> 00:13:33,819
Ms. Xiao is from the north.

300
00:13:33,858 --> 00:13:36,299
Her food being a bit salty
is understandable.

301
00:13:36,778 --> 00:13:37,579
Besides, at least

302
00:13:39,099 --> 00:13:40,378
her steamed buns are good.

303
00:13:40,538 --> 00:13:42,579
She's a good person
and has worked here for years.

304
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:43,538
So after all that,

305
00:13:43,538 --> 00:13:45,299
you also think
Ms. Xiao's cooking is awful,

306
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:45,819
Mr. Tan.

307
00:13:46,099 --> 00:13:47,419
Will you ever stop?

308
00:13:48,138 --> 00:13:48,819
Master,

309
00:13:49,378 --> 00:13:50,459
you're in for a treat.

310
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:51,699
Once you're married,

311
00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:53,618
no more eating Ms. Xiao's food for you.

312
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:55,819
Ms. Sun cooks so well.

313
00:13:58,538 --> 00:13:59,538
How about this, Master?

314
00:14:00,618 --> 00:14:02,099
I'll pay you a meal management fee.

315
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:04,099
Could you ask Ms. Sun to include me?

316
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:07,640
If you want to eat,
visit the wonton stall yourself.

317
00:14:08,778 --> 00:14:10,819
But I can't eat wontons every day.

318
00:14:11,258 --> 00:14:13,378
How about this?
Let Ms. Sun open a restaurant.

319
00:14:13,496 --> 00:14:14,979
Next to the town government office.

320
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,538
That way, you can see her every day.

321
00:14:16,979 --> 00:14:17,479
Lin,

322
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:20,378
the storefront on the left
appears vacant now.

323
00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:21,199
Right?

324
00:14:21,858 --> 00:14:22,358
You...

325
00:14:22,939 --> 00:14:25,099
What other signature dishes
does Ms. Sun Xiaoyan have?

326
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:26,618
I'll just eat at home.

327
00:14:29,538 --> 00:14:30,339
Mr. Xie.

328
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:31,219
Xie.

329
00:14:31,219 --> 00:14:32,179
Mr. Xie.

330
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:32,738
What's that?

331
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:33,339
- I...
- Ms. Xiao.

332
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:34,059
Got something.

333
00:14:34,059 --> 00:14:35,378
We need to talk seriously today.

334
00:14:36,099 --> 00:14:36,939
I've got something.

335
00:14:36,939 --> 00:14:38,459
If you keep this up with the food...

336
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:39,699
I have something to tell you.

337
00:14:39,699 --> 00:14:40,538
Listen, if this...

338
00:14:40,538 --> 00:14:41,819
Could I finish first, please?

339
00:14:44,099 --> 00:14:44,618
What is it?

340
00:14:46,618 --> 00:14:49,699
My daughter's having a baby.
I need to go home to care for the baby.

341
00:14:50,018 --> 00:14:51,979
I'll return to my hometown
in a few days.

342
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:54,498
Ms. Xiao is leaving?

343
00:14:56,898 --> 00:14:57,658
You're leaving?

344
00:14:59,138 --> 00:14:59,638
Well...

345
00:15:00,378 --> 00:15:02,538
If you leave, what will we do?

346
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:03,419
When will you return?

347
00:15:03,658 --> 00:15:04,738
I won't be returning.

348
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:09,778
This is so sudden.

349
00:15:10,219 --> 00:15:12,258
Taking care of a baby takes time.

350
00:15:13,258 --> 00:15:13,912
Not returning?

351
00:15:14,018 --> 00:15:16,778
I won't be able
to cook for you all anymore.

352
00:15:16,939 --> 00:15:17,699
I'm sorry.

353
00:15:18,219 --> 00:15:19,018
No need.

354
00:15:19,138 --> 00:15:20,819
This is really...

355
00:15:21,658 --> 00:15:24,138
Mr. Xie, rest assured.
I'll fulfill my duties to the last day.

356
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:24,679
Well...

357
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:25,699
That's all.

358
00:15:25,738 --> 00:15:26,658
It's good news.

359
00:15:27,018 --> 00:15:27,518
Your turn.

360
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:28,939
It's nothing.

361
00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:29,618
It's nothing.

362
00:15:29,778 --> 00:15:30,699
Congratulate Ms. Xiao.

363
00:15:31,018 --> 00:15:32,138
Let's congratulate Ms. Xiao.

364
00:15:32,219 --> 00:15:33,179
Congrats.

365
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:35,018
- Congrats, Ms. Xiao.
- Congrats.

366
00:15:36,099 --> 00:15:36,778
It's good news.

367
00:15:36,939 --> 00:15:38,339
All good news.

368
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:39,339
It's too sudden.

369
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,699
Thank you all.

370
00:15:41,018 --> 00:15:41,699
It's good news.

371
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:42,459
Thank you, Mr. Tan.

372
00:15:43,219 --> 00:15:44,059
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

373
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:44,979
Thank you.

374
00:15:45,538 --> 00:15:46,378
Thank you, everyone.

375
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:46,959
Alright.

376
00:15:47,554 --> 00:15:50,661
(Littering Degrades Dignity)

377
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:52,459
Hello, Mr. Xie.

378
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:03,839
Wu,

379
00:16:04,738 --> 00:16:05,464
what're you doing?

380
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:07,138
Selling tapes.

381
00:16:07,378 --> 00:16:08,258
Where are they from?

382
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:09,538
Hong Kong.

383
00:16:11,059 --> 00:16:11,819
Not working?

384
00:16:17,419 --> 00:16:18,699
You like it? Try it on.

385
00:16:18,738 --> 00:16:19,498
Try it on.

386
00:16:19,498 --> 00:16:20,538
See which one looks good.

387
00:16:24,939 --> 00:16:25,579
This pair.

388
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:26,278
Mr. Xie.

389
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:27,919
I'm off.

390
00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:29,299
Hold on.

391
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:30,219
It's very cheap.

392
00:16:31,618 --> 00:16:32,219
Alright.

393
00:16:32,219 --> 00:16:33,699
I'll take this entire outfit.

394
00:16:36,358 --> 00:16:36,858
Xiaoyu.

395
00:16:36,858 --> 00:16:37,378
Mr. Xie.

396
00:16:37,939 --> 00:16:38,979
Your clothes are so nice.

397
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:40,898
How do I look in this? Well?

398
00:16:44,658 --> 00:16:45,378
A gift for you.

399
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:49,099
More options?

400
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:52,339
Yes.

401
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:53,459
- Xiaoyu.
- Okay.

402
00:16:53,858 --> 00:16:54,459
Try it on.

403
00:16:54,459 --> 00:16:54,979
Xiaoyu.

404
00:16:56,378 --> 00:16:57,018
Xiaoyu!

405
00:16:58,459 --> 00:16:59,459
Over here, Dad!

406
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:01,528
Where's your mom?

407
00:17:02,018 --> 00:17:03,018
I don't know.

408
00:17:03,378 --> 00:17:04,619
I'm busy selling stuff.

409
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,659
How does this look on me?

410
00:17:10,498 --> 00:17:11,859
Not bad. It fits you well.

411
00:17:13,538 --> 00:17:14,619
Sir.

412
00:17:16,659 --> 00:17:18,139
Hello there.

413
00:17:21,058 --> 00:17:23,619
Do you know who I am?

414
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:27,338
It's me.

415
00:17:28,098 --> 00:17:30,258
Sounds like "seagull". Gao Xuemei?

416
00:17:30,699 --> 00:17:32,258
Yes.

417
00:17:32,659 --> 00:17:34,018
Seagull or duck?

418
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:34,619
Stop it.

419
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:35,512
No longer a peacock?

420
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:36,459
Take a look.

421
00:17:36,699 --> 00:17:38,018
Isn't this super trendy?

422
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:39,979
This is real Hong Kong style now.

423
00:17:40,699 --> 00:17:42,018
Look at my big leather jacket.

424
00:17:45,459 --> 00:17:45,959
Right.

425
00:17:46,939 --> 00:17:49,459
There's another leather jacket for you.

426
00:17:49,538 --> 00:17:50,699
Come on. Try this on.

427
00:17:50,699 --> 00:17:51,379
This is for me?

428
00:17:51,379 --> 00:17:52,538
No, I don't want it.

429
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:53,219
Put it on.

430
00:17:53,578 --> 00:17:54,338
Hurry up.

431
00:17:54,778 --> 00:17:55,379
Does it fit?

432
00:17:55,538 --> 00:17:56,179
Sure.

433
00:17:56,419 --> 00:17:57,979
Wearing this now is so stuffy.

434
00:17:57,979 --> 00:17:59,298
That's the vibe we want.

435
00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:00,179
That's it.

436
00:18:01,838 --> 00:18:02,338
Move aside.

437
00:18:02,338 --> 00:18:03,018
Look at you.

438
00:18:03,018 --> 00:18:03,939
Yeah, move aside.

439
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,659
Okay.

440
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:05,459
You can wait.

441
00:18:05,538 --> 00:18:06,038
Come on.

442
00:18:06,538 --> 00:18:07,098
So dashing.

443
00:18:07,699 --> 00:18:08,979
- So dashing.
- Of course I am.

444
00:18:09,098 --> 00:18:09,778
I am dashing.

445
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,808
Do I look like a seal?

446
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:11,679
Stop it.

447
00:18:11,699 --> 00:18:12,619
Good enough for you?

448
00:18:12,778 --> 00:18:13,619
Go away.

449
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:14,619
Not like them.

450
00:18:15,379 --> 00:18:18,619
They wouldn't look like royalty even
in an emperor's robe.

451
00:18:19,538 --> 00:18:20,058
Now walk.

452
00:18:20,778 --> 00:18:21,538
Walk a few steps.

453
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:22,359
Hurry.

454
00:18:23,179 --> 00:18:23,679
Walk.

455
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:29,979
Even Hong Kong superstars
only look this good.

456
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:31,379
And with me by your side,

457
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:35,818
Yuehai won't even be big enough for us.

458
00:18:40,699 --> 00:18:42,278
Let's take a look.

459
00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:43,578
So dashing.

460
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:44,119
Ideal match.

461
00:18:44,459 --> 00:18:45,656
We could be a magazine cover.

462
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:47,128
The trip wasn't wasted.

463
00:18:48,058 --> 00:18:51,538
This "Hong Kong style" or "ghost style"
has made our home a mess.

464
00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:52,979
What are you talking about?

465
00:18:53,538 --> 00:18:55,098
I brought back quality items.

466
00:18:55,738 --> 00:18:57,538
And I brought back lots of each item.

467
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:00,379
I'm not giving them away.
They have to buy them.

468
00:19:04,219 --> 00:19:05,738
Always obsessed with money.

469
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,778
I've got the outfit. Where is the food?

470
00:19:10,459 --> 00:19:11,538
No problem.

471
00:19:16,459 --> 00:19:18,098
Here it comes.

472
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:19,738
Xie,

473
00:19:20,219 --> 00:19:22,778
try this top-grade blood bird's nest.

474
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:34,179
How does it taste?

475
00:19:35,419 --> 00:19:35,939
Well?

476
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,256
Where's this good stuff from?

477
00:19:39,619 --> 00:19:40,119
Guess.

478
00:19:42,058 --> 00:19:43,139
Hong Kong!

479
00:19:45,459 --> 00:19:45,959
It's gone.

480
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:47,219
All gone?

481
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:48,578
Xuemei.

482
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:51,379
Look how much I'm buying.
Can you give me a discount?

483
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:53,619
Looks good.

484
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:54,379
All of these.

485
00:19:54,379 --> 00:19:55,879
How about fifteen yuan off?

486
00:19:55,979 --> 00:19:57,379
Okay, thanks, Xuemei.

487
00:19:57,619 --> 00:19:58,379
Browse more.

488
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:01,219
You... you went to Hong Kong?

489
00:20:01,419 --> 00:20:03,818
Well, I ran into Ms. Chang
at the Canton Fair.

490
00:20:03,939 --> 00:20:05,258
She gave me a tour of Hong Kong.

491
00:20:05,578 --> 00:20:06,258
You know what?

492
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:07,699
Hong Kong is...

493
00:20:08,058 --> 00:20:09,018
It... it...

494
00:20:09,899 --> 00:20:10,399
It...

495
00:20:10,578 --> 00:20:11,659
Forget other things.

496
00:20:11,738 --> 00:20:14,098
Just tell me if this bird's nest
is worth every cent.

497
00:20:14,538 --> 00:20:16,018
They sell it by the gram.

498
00:20:16,338 --> 00:20:17,699
One bowl costs over 100 yuan.

499
00:20:18,578 --> 00:20:19,078
How much?

500
00:20:19,298 --> 00:20:19,939
Over 100 yuan.

501
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:22,018
I... I just...

502
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:23,699
What?

503
00:20:23,699 --> 00:20:24,619
I gulped it down.

504
00:20:25,578 --> 00:20:27,219
You're so spendthrift.

505
00:20:27,738 --> 00:20:28,939
You'll bankrupt us completely

506
00:20:29,098 --> 00:20:29,738
with this trip.

507
00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:31,619
What are you saying?

508
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:33,538
See those people outside?

509
00:20:33,659 --> 00:20:34,538
Why are they here?

510
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:37,899
Guess how much I earned on this trip?

511
00:20:38,219 --> 00:20:38,719
2,000?

512
00:20:39,018 --> 00:20:39,699
Guess higher.

513
00:20:40,258 --> 00:20:40,818
2,500?

514
00:20:41,459 --> 00:20:42,338
Add a zero.

515
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:43,379
250?

516
00:20:43,859 --> 00:20:44,578
Add a zero.

517
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:45,459
25,000?

518
00:20:47,419 --> 00:20:49,899
Look at you, such a spendthrift.

519
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:56,219
I'm telling you,
I regret not bringing more money.

520
00:20:56,419 --> 00:20:57,219
So much.

521
00:20:57,272 --> 00:20:58,439
Contentment brings happiness.

522
00:20:58,439 --> 00:20:58,979
Happiness.

523
00:20:58,979 --> 00:20:59,619
Another bowl.

524
00:20:59,818 --> 00:21:01,219
I can't tell if there are bones.

525
00:21:01,538 --> 00:21:03,179
One more thing I've yet to give you.

526
00:21:13,778 --> 00:21:14,379
What's this?

527
00:21:15,379 --> 00:21:15,879
A radio?

528
00:21:16,379 --> 00:21:18,018
This is called a recorder.

529
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:21,619
Its English name is Walkman.

530
00:21:22,139 --> 00:21:23,538
Walkman.

531
00:21:23,578 --> 00:21:24,939
Walkman.

532
00:21:25,139 --> 00:21:26,338
Walkman.

533
00:21:26,778 --> 00:21:27,979
Walkman.

534
00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:29,619
Walk... Walkman.

535
00:21:30,219 --> 00:21:30,738
Walk...

536
00:21:31,699 --> 00:21:32,379
Come on.

537
00:21:32,578 --> 00:21:34,538
Put it down. Come on.

538
00:21:34,719 --> 00:21:35,219
What?

539
00:21:35,219 --> 00:21:35,859
Come on.

540
00:21:36,219 --> 00:21:36,778
What?

541
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:40,139
We'll...

542
00:21:40,538 --> 00:21:41,219
You take my hand.

543
00:21:43,939 --> 00:21:45,979
We'll go to Hong Kong together.

544
00:21:46,258 --> 00:21:47,864
Let me tell you,
the great stuff there...

545
00:21:48,219 --> 00:21:48,899
Over here.

546
00:21:49,018 --> 00:21:49,778
It's way too much.

547
00:21:50,538 --> 00:21:51,979
Let's go stock up together.

548

549
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:55,538
So dashing.

550
00:21:56,058 --> 00:21:56,699
So dashing.

551
00:21:57,578 --> 00:21:58,538
In this leather jacket,

552
00:21:58,939 --> 00:22:00,818
you move like a big star.

553
00:22:01,379 --> 00:22:02,139
Yeah, like that.

554
00:22:02,619 --> 00:22:03,179
Yes.

555
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:06,058
Electric! Electric! Electric!

556
00:22:06,379 --> 00:22:06,879
How?

557
00:22:07,338 --> 00:22:07,939
How?

Morning.

564
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:35,538
Mr. Xie, you look so dashing.

565
00:22:35,538 --> 00:22:37,816
If not for the motorbike,
I might not have recognized you.

566
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,139
I'll wash up and make wontons.

567
00:22:40,018 --> 00:22:41,179
Come on. Sit down.

568
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:47,459
This...

569
00:22:48,219 --> 00:22:48,859
Walkman.

570
00:22:50,219 --> 00:22:51,738
A new gadget. Xuemei gave it to me.

571
00:22:52,219 --> 00:22:53,139
Sit.

572
00:22:55,058 --> 00:22:55,899
What did you say?

573
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:59,058
I said you look so dashing today.

574
00:22:59,859 --> 00:23:00,659
No wontons?

575
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:02,098
No, no need.

576
00:23:02,778 --> 00:23:03,738
Not many people here.

577
00:23:04,338 --> 00:23:05,258
I just set up.

578
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:07,338
How's business lately?

579
00:23:07,379 --> 00:23:07,899
Pretty good.

580
00:23:08,298 --> 00:23:10,098
Your wontons are really tasty.

581
00:23:10,699 --> 00:23:11,338
- Really.
- Thanks.

582
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:13,459
Whether I eat them or not,

583
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:14,699
it is important.

584
00:23:14,939 --> 00:23:17,258
But I want more people
to eat well and have full stomachs.

585
00:23:17,538 --> 00:23:18,038
Right?

586
00:23:18,258 --> 00:23:19,139
It is also important.

587
00:23:19,338 --> 00:23:22,258
So, two meals a day,
and seventy yuan a month.

588
00:23:22,459 --> 00:23:23,098
How about it?

589
00:23:24,318 --> 00:23:26,298
No, I set up my stall twice a day.

590
00:23:26,298 --> 00:23:27,899
I know it.

591
00:23:27,899 --> 00:23:28,939
You don't get what I mean.

592
00:23:29,818 --> 00:23:31,058
I'm asking you to come

593
00:23:31,098 --> 00:23:32,778
to our town government canteen to cook.

594
00:23:37,258 --> 00:23:38,058
If you like the job

595
00:23:39,018 --> 00:23:40,179
and we're happy with you

596
00:23:41,258 --> 00:23:42,219
after six months,

597
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:43,859
you'll get a regular position.

598
00:23:44,699 --> 00:23:45,979
Then you can settle down

599
00:23:46,179 --> 00:23:47,538
and have a stable government job.

600
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:51,058
I-I haven't thought
about having a government job.

601
00:23:51,258 --> 00:23:53,538
Besides, you have Ms. Xiao
in the canteen.

602
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:56,139
Ms. Xiao? She's gone.

603
00:23:57,379 --> 00:23:59,459
To care for her daughter's
newly born baby.

604
00:24:00,699 --> 00:24:01,199
That's good.

605
00:24:01,459 --> 00:24:01,959
Right.

606
00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:03,738
But now no one cooks for us.

607
00:24:07,139 --> 00:24:09,298
But if I work at the canteen,

608
00:24:09,298 --> 00:24:11,258
who will run my wonton stall?

609
00:24:11,538 --> 00:24:12,379
I've figured it out.

610
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:15,058
When is your wonton stall's peak hour?

611
00:24:15,139 --> 00:24:16,598
Morning and evening, right?

612
00:24:16,699 --> 00:24:17,538
We have

613
00:24:18,098 --> 00:24:19,258
lunch at 11:30 AM

614
00:24:19,338 --> 00:24:20,338
and dinner at 5:30 PM.

615
00:24:20,538 --> 00:24:21,578
Prep work is needed.

616
00:24:21,899 --> 00:24:23,818
But you're the chef.
You don't need to prep.

617
00:24:23,859 --> 00:24:25,538
You can go there and cook, right?

618
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:26,098
Then...

619
00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:27,738
It won't delay anything, right?

620
00:24:28,338 --> 00:24:28,859
No problem.

621
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:32,298
We're all worried about

622
00:24:32,578 --> 00:24:33,899
Lin Dongfu's health.

623
00:24:34,538 --> 00:24:36,219
But he doesn't listen to us.

624
00:24:36,219 --> 00:24:38,018
Once he works, he forgets everything.

625
00:24:38,338 --> 00:24:41,098
I know you're exhausted
juggling both sides.

626
00:24:41,459 --> 00:24:42,459
But who'd be benefited?

627
00:24:43,659 --> 00:24:45,379
By seeing you
and eating the food you cook,

628
00:24:45,379 --> 00:24:47,098
he could eat
several extra bowls of rice.

629
00:24:47,098 --> 00:24:48,838
See how thin he is?

630
00:24:49,018 --> 00:24:50,459
We all care for him.

631
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:54,578
True.

632
00:24:56,179 --> 00:24:57,659
He doesn't eat properly at work.

633
00:24:58,778 --> 00:24:59,979
He won't listen to anyone.

634
00:25:01,818 --> 00:25:03,379
(That's for today's Dongjiang News.)

635
00:25:03,859 --> 00:25:06,018
(Thank you for watching.
We'll see you tomorrow.)

636
00:25:09,338 --> 00:25:10,058
Be careful.

637
00:25:15,338 --> 00:25:17,338
Mr. Zheng, let me tell you

638
00:25:17,338 --> 00:25:20,379
about the new land development.

639
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:21,479
Okay.

640
00:25:24,139 --> 00:25:25,018
Mr. Zheng, Ms. Li.

641
00:25:25,018 --> 00:25:26,818
After our on-site survey
these past few days,

642
00:25:27,219 --> 00:25:27,899
Yuehai

643
00:25:28,538 --> 00:25:31,098
has no more land left to develop.

644
00:25:31,578 --> 00:25:34,258
Except this Gaopu plot
that hasn't been developed.

645
00:25:34,419 --> 00:25:35,258
The reason of it is

646
00:25:35,258 --> 00:25:37,598
that its land utilization rate
is too low.

647
00:25:37,939 --> 00:25:40,179
The entire area is less than 180 mu,

648
00:25:40,459 --> 00:25:41,859
yet the hills take up half of it.

649
00:25:41,859 --> 00:25:44,179
Mr. Lin, what if we blow up the hills?

650
00:25:45,859 --> 00:25:48,939
It is possible, but the cost is high.

651
00:25:49,258 --> 00:25:49,758
How high?

652
00:25:50,139 --> 00:25:51,058
This plot is remote.

653
00:25:51,338 --> 00:25:53,139
The cost for building roads
and blowing up

654
00:25:53,258 --> 00:25:55,419
would be over 7 or 8 million yuan.

655
00:25:55,538 --> 00:25:57,939
What? How would we get 7 or 8 million?

656
00:25:58,219 --> 00:25:59,699
We're truly running on empty.

657
00:26:00,578 --> 00:26:02,098
Do we have to blow up the hills?

658
00:26:02,818 --> 00:26:06,619
Even if we blow up the hills
and build the roads,

659
00:26:06,939 --> 00:26:10,179
would this area be effectively utilized?

660
00:26:10,659 --> 00:26:12,778
A few out-of-town businesses
want to set up shops,

661
00:26:13,018 --> 00:26:14,258
but there are only a few.

662
00:26:14,818 --> 00:26:17,219
This area is less than 180 mu.

663
00:26:17,538 --> 00:26:19,179
Neither very big nor very small.

664
00:26:19,379 --> 00:26:20,419
If we spend so much money,

665
00:26:20,778 --> 00:26:23,219
and couldn't get a solid industry
and income stream,

666
00:26:23,659 --> 00:26:25,538
I think this project
isn't cost-effective.

667
00:26:25,738 --> 00:26:28,538
Exactly. Don't do it
if it isn't worthwhile.

668
00:26:29,058 --> 00:26:29,939
I have a good idea.

669
00:26:31,098 --> 00:26:32,639
Look here. Look.

670
00:26:32,818 --> 00:26:34,018
The hills here.

671
00:26:34,018 --> 00:26:36,479
They're basically
in a ring shape, right?

672
00:26:36,538 --> 00:26:37,459
We can leave them be

673
00:26:37,578 --> 00:26:39,758
and block these gaps, right?

674
00:26:39,778 --> 00:26:40,699
Form a circle.

675
00:26:41,459 --> 00:26:42,456
What does it look like?

676
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:43,419
Like what?

677
00:26:43,859 --> 00:26:45,439
A stadium, right?

678
00:26:45,899 --> 00:26:47,459
A large stadium with 10,000 seats.

679
00:26:47,538 --> 00:26:48,939
Why would we build a stadium?

680
00:26:49,258 --> 00:26:52,038
Forgot the 1988 Seoul Olympics?

681
00:26:52,538 --> 00:26:53,719
- Is it successful?
- Yes.

682
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:54,859
Is it eye-catching?

683
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:55,379
Yes.

684
00:26:55,379 --> 00:26:57,538
Just the sponsorship fees alone.

685
00:26:57,738 --> 00:26:58,899
Can you imagine?

686
00:26:59,179 --> 00:26:59,778
Sponsorship...

687
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:00,578
Wait, Xie.

688
00:27:00,778 --> 00:27:02,538
Xie, you need to think carefully

689
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:03,778
before you speak.

690
00:27:03,979 --> 00:27:05,058
Don't talk nonsense.

691
00:27:05,139 --> 00:27:06,538
This isn't just aiming too high,

692
00:27:06,538 --> 00:27:07,338
but nonsense.

693
00:27:07,578 --> 00:27:11,058
The Beijing Asian Games was accomplished
with the efforts of the entire nation.

694
00:27:11,258 --> 00:27:13,538
Olympics in Yuehai?

695
00:27:13,639 --> 00:27:15,379
Are you daydreaming?

696
00:27:15,459 --> 00:27:17,298
Then tell us, how should we use it?

697
00:27:17,498 --> 00:27:18,778
It's not up to me.

698
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:21,038
We need to be more practical, okay?

699
00:27:21,538 --> 00:27:22,538
Yuehai is doing well now.

700
00:27:22,659 --> 00:27:24,738
The population
will likely keep increasing steadily.

701
00:27:24,738 --> 00:27:27,738
To play it safe, I think
we should build residential housing

702
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,219
and get the facilities well.

703
00:27:29,459 --> 00:27:30,018
Boring.

704
00:27:30,699 --> 00:27:31,538
Too ordinary.

705
00:27:32,098 --> 00:27:32,598
Right?

706
00:27:32,659 --> 00:27:34,379
Look at the housing here.

707
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,318
It's far from the sea

708
00:27:36,538 --> 00:27:37,659
and far from the center.

709
00:27:37,719 --> 00:27:39,338
I know it. It was just an idea.

710
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:40,219
Alright.

711
00:27:40,379 --> 00:27:42,018
You two, stop making wild suggestions.

712
00:27:42,699 --> 00:27:43,939
We'll discuss this later, okay?

713
00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:45,139
Move to the next topic.

714
00:27:45,139 --> 00:27:46,659
Look here, is this...

715
00:27:47,018 --> 00:27:47,738
Alright.

716
00:27:48,738 --> 00:27:51,619
(Lili's Hair Salon)

717
00:27:51,619 --> 00:27:54,139
Lili, your salon has been open for long.

718
00:27:54,538 --> 00:27:55,979
Yet this is my first time here.

719
00:27:56,699 --> 00:27:59,258
Congrats on becoming a boss
at such a young age.

720
00:27:59,699 --> 00:28:01,258
You are flattering me.

721
00:28:01,818 --> 00:28:03,219
I still owe my master money.

722
00:28:03,338 --> 00:28:05,818
And I borrowed a lot of money
to take over this shop.

723
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:08,058
But I'm confident I can make it.

724
00:28:08,738 --> 00:28:10,139
Support my business, okay?

725
00:28:10,699 --> 00:28:11,619
Do a good job then.

726
00:28:12,379 --> 00:28:14,419
I don't trust any other salons.

727
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:15,778
I only trust you.

728
00:28:16,979 --> 00:28:17,538
Good!

729
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:19,578
Then after the cut,
I'll give you a perm too.

730
00:28:19,659 --> 00:28:20,699
My treat.

731
00:28:21,379 --> 00:28:22,379
A perm?

732
00:28:23,338 --> 00:28:24,058
Let me think.

733
00:28:24,338 --> 00:28:24,838
Alright.

734
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,459
Your treat? I'll take one!

735
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:29,459
Ms. Gao.

736
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:31,538
Ms. Li, you are here.

737
00:28:31,778 --> 00:28:32,338
Ms. Gao.

738
00:28:33,219 --> 00:28:33,976
Having a haircut?

739
00:28:35,379 --> 00:28:37,219
If Ms. Li got a perm here,

740
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:38,098
would you put

741
00:28:38,098 --> 00:28:40,338
her photo up at the door as an ad?

742
00:28:40,538 --> 00:28:42,818
Ms. Gao, don't say that!
I wouldn't dare.

743
00:28:44,058 --> 00:28:44,699
Look.

744
00:28:45,018 --> 00:28:45,738
Look at this.

745
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:46,939
Tapes!

746
00:28:47,899 --> 00:28:49,219
- Sandy Lam!
- Sandy Lam!

747
00:28:49,778 --> 00:28:51,699
I love Sandy Lam!

748
00:28:51,738 --> 00:28:53,939
Leslie Cheung's pieces
and Clayderman's piano pieces.

749
00:28:53,939 --> 00:28:54,818
I'll play it for you.

750
00:28:55,018 --> 00:28:56,298
I got these in Hong Kong.

751
00:28:56,619 --> 00:28:58,578
- You went to Hong Kong?
- Of course, I did.

752
00:28:58,619 --> 00:29:00,258
Got your hair permed there too?

753
00:29:00,778 --> 00:29:02,838
What do you think about it?

754
00:29:03,298 --> 00:29:04,538
Nice, very stylish.

755
00:29:05,219 --> 00:29:05,979
I can do that too.

756
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:07,219
Learn from it.

757
00:29:07,258 --> 00:29:08,578
It's so fashionable.

758
00:29:11,738 --> 00:29:14,538
Lili, I'm giving you this tape.

759
00:29:15,139 --> 00:29:17,219
Pick these later. Ten yuan each.

760
00:29:18,538 --> 00:29:20,459
I'll just take the one you're giving me.

761
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:21,899
So stingy!

762
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:23,338
I run a small salon.

763
00:29:23,338 --> 00:29:24,699
I still owe people money.

764
00:29:24,859 --> 00:29:26,619
Fine, whatever.

765
00:29:27,139 --> 00:29:27,738
And this.

766
00:29:28,419 --> 00:29:30,258
Ms. Li, here's my business card.

767
00:29:31,538 --> 00:29:32,778
(Chunmei Printery Ltd.)
Please take it.

768
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:35,058
(General Manager, Gao Xuemei)
Please take it, Lili.

769
00:29:35,338 --> 00:29:36,219
Come on, take it.

770
00:29:36,939 --> 00:29:37,538
Ms. Gao.

771
00:29:37,538 --> 00:29:38,139
Please take it.

772
00:29:38,298 --> 00:29:38,899
Ms. Gao.

773
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:40,859
Please take it.

774
00:29:40,899 --> 00:29:41,538
Thanks, Ms. Gao.

775
00:29:41,939 --> 00:29:42,778
Don't call me that.

776
00:29:42,939 --> 00:29:44,258
From now on, call me Madam Gao.

777
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:46,419
Okay. They call people
that way in Guangdong.

778
00:29:46,578 --> 00:29:47,298
Madam Gao.

779
00:29:47,859 --> 00:29:49,538
What are you waiting for?
Call Madam Gao.

780
00:29:49,578 --> 00:29:50,139
Madam Gao.

781
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:53,098
- What's wrong?
- Well...

782
00:29:54,098 --> 00:29:54,778
Are you okay?

783
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:55,538
Sorry.

784
00:29:55,619 --> 00:29:56,298
Let me fix that.

785
00:29:56,338 --> 00:29:56,979
Take it.

786
00:29:59,379 --> 00:30:02,058
Ms. Li, this perfume is for you.

787
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:02,758
Take it.

788
00:30:03,139 --> 00:30:05,738
Madam Gao, I can't accept this gift.

789
00:30:05,939 --> 00:30:07,778
I bought it for you.
It wasn't expensive.

790
00:30:07,818 --> 00:30:08,379
Take it.

791
00:30:08,578 --> 00:30:10,619
No way. This clearly isn't cheap.

792
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:12,979
Take it back, or I pay you for it.

793
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:16,258
Qiuping, how could I
possibly take your money?

794
00:30:16,379 --> 00:30:18,338
If not, that would get me in trouble.

795
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:20,219
That's too much.

796
00:30:21,058 --> 00:30:23,298
Alright then.
I won't give you the perfume.

797
00:30:23,699 --> 00:30:25,058
How about a tape instead?

798
00:30:26,018 --> 00:30:26,818
A tape is fine.

799
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:29,018
Ten yuan per tape is within my budget.

800
00:30:29,139 --> 00:30:31,258
Ten yuan. I'll pay you later.

801
00:30:31,659 --> 00:30:33,219
Give me Clayderman's piano pieces.

802
00:30:34,018 --> 00:30:35,459
Okay, no problem.

803
00:30:35,578 --> 00:30:37,219
This one is the most elegant.

804
00:30:38,459 --> 00:30:39,798
Here you go.

805
00:30:39,979 --> 00:30:40,538
Thanks.

806
00:30:40,578 --> 00:30:41,258
It sounds good.

807
00:30:41,459 --> 00:30:42,619
I'll pay you later.

808
00:30:42,778 --> 00:30:44,258
Okay, no problem.

809
00:30:47,459 --> 00:30:47,959
Here.

810
00:30:48,939 --> 00:30:49,738
Lili.

811
00:30:51,979 --> 00:30:53,659
Change my hairstyle for me.

812
00:30:54,699 --> 00:30:56,538
Didn't you just get a perm
in Hong Kong?

813
00:30:57,578 --> 00:30:58,379
Ms. Li, see?

814
00:30:58,699 --> 00:31:00,899
I'm trying to support her business,
yet she refuses.

815
00:31:01,338 --> 00:31:02,818
I don't mean that.

816
00:31:04,338 --> 00:31:05,098
Let me get...

817
00:31:06,219 --> 00:31:07,058
Xiaoqing's haircut.

818
00:31:07,578 --> 00:31:09,098
It has to be short.

819
00:31:09,379 --> 00:31:11,058
It's too bad then.

820
00:31:11,098 --> 00:31:11,619
Exactly.

821
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:14,018
Use your skills to style it for me.

822
00:31:15,778 --> 00:31:16,278
Come on.

823
00:31:19,139 --> 00:31:19,818
Madam Gao.

824
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:21,659
If you want the Xiaoqing's haircut,

825
00:31:22,018 --> 00:31:23,979
I'll need
to curl this part inward a bit.

826
00:31:24,518 --> 00:31:25,018
Fine.

827
00:31:25,018 --> 00:31:26,379
But it won't last for long.

828
00:31:26,459 --> 00:31:27,379
Okay if it looks good.

829
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:28,578
Okay, just a moment.

830
00:31:28,859 --> 00:31:29,419
Okay.

831
00:31:32,619 --> 00:31:33,139
Lili.

832
00:31:34,098 --> 00:31:34,979
I can tell

833
00:31:35,899 --> 00:31:37,578
Madam Gao isn't here for you.

834
00:31:38,219 --> 00:31:39,338
Then who is she here for?

835
00:31:40,578 --> 00:31:41,818
Don't put it that way.

836
00:31:42,338 --> 00:31:43,578
I'm getting a perm

837
00:31:44,578 --> 00:31:46,098
while discussing business.

838
00:31:49,538 --> 00:31:50,098
Ms. Li.

839
00:31:50,578 --> 00:31:53,979
This trip to Canton Fair
really opened my eyes.

840
00:31:55,258 --> 00:31:57,338
We used to prefer

841
00:31:57,538 --> 00:31:59,058
storefront-factory model, right?

842
00:31:59,619 --> 00:32:00,979
Low cost, easy to manage.

843
00:32:01,538 --> 00:32:04,258
But essentially,
it's just a small family workshop.

844
00:32:05,459 --> 00:32:06,939
In the Pearl River Delta region,

845
00:32:07,338 --> 00:32:09,098
they've long abandoned this model.

846
00:32:09,298 --> 00:32:12,578
They have massive factories
operating on a large scale.

847
00:32:17,899 --> 00:32:19,338
So your idea is?

848
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:23,288
(Lili's Hair Salon)

849
00:32:25,379 --> 00:32:26,498
Lili's skills are excellent.

850
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:28,179
Goodbye.

851
00:32:28,258 --> 00:32:28,899
Ms. Li.

852
00:32:29,459 --> 00:32:31,538
That's basically the situation.

853
00:32:32,419 --> 00:32:34,899
I want to move forward.

854
00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:37,979
I believe those modern factories

855
00:32:38,619 --> 00:32:40,699
are the future
of Yuehai's printing industry.

856
00:32:41,179 --> 00:32:42,419
I understand now.

857
00:32:43,219 --> 00:32:44,379
You want more plots, right?

858
00:32:45,219 --> 00:32:46,179
How much do you need?

859
00:32:48,379 --> 00:32:49,538
About twenty mu.

860
00:32:49,979 --> 00:32:50,659
Twenty mu?

861
00:32:51,298 --> 00:32:52,578
Eighteen mu would work too.

862
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:54,818
But at least fifteen mu.

863
00:33:04,699 --> 00:33:06,058
How about one hundred eighty mu?

864
00:33:07,939 --> 00:33:08,459
How much?

865
00:33:09,018 --> 00:33:10,058
One hundred eighty mu.

866
00:33:11,538 --> 00:33:13,818
There's an undeveloped plot in Gaopu.

867
00:33:14,219 --> 00:33:17,298
Plus these small hills,
totaling one hundred eighty mu.

868
00:33:17,818 --> 00:33:18,578
Take a look

869
00:33:19,459 --> 00:33:21,459
if you can acquire this entire plot.

870
00:33:24,699 --> 00:33:27,298
Ms. Li, you must be joking.

871
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:29,098
Such a huge plot

872
00:33:29,899 --> 00:33:31,979
could accommodate
several modern factories.

873
00:33:32,699 --> 00:33:33,659
You're right.

874
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:37,699
But if you are the only one
expanding the factory,

875
00:33:38,018 --> 00:33:39,459
it's not a long-term solution.

876
00:33:40,058 --> 00:33:43,738
If you and other self-employed ones
build an industrial park together...

877
00:33:44,338 --> 00:33:44,979
As you said,

878
00:33:45,258 --> 00:33:46,979
only modern factories

879
00:33:47,139 --> 00:33:49,859
are the future
of Yuehai's printing industry.

880
00:33:50,338 --> 00:33:53,179
We can relocate printing street's
main operations there.

881
00:33:55,379 --> 00:33:57,419
Alright, then I'll

882
00:33:57,778 --> 00:33:59,498
discuss this with them.

883
00:34:00,498 --> 00:34:03,939
If you and them
acquire this entire plot,

884
00:34:04,659 --> 00:34:08,618
the town government will cover
the costs of demolishing mountains,

885
00:34:08,979 --> 00:34:10,379
building roads and facilities.

886
00:34:11,178 --> 00:34:12,498
That'd be wonderful.

887
00:34:13,178 --> 00:34:15,618
Xuemei, this is a big deal.

888
00:34:16,178 --> 00:34:18,538
You need to discuss it thoroughly
with Mr. Xie

889
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:19,779
and give me a reply soon.

890
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:22,299
Yes. I definitely will.

891
00:34:22,578 --> 00:34:24,379
Just wait for my reply.

892
00:34:24,779 --> 00:34:25,279
Okay.

893
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:29,359
40,000 yuan.

894
00:34:30,018 --> 00:34:30,578
Xuemei.

895
00:34:31,138 --> 00:34:32,178
You mean

896
00:34:32,498 --> 00:34:34,419
you alone want a loan
over 10 million yuan,

897
00:34:34,779 --> 00:34:37,578
and have each of us
borrow millions to start companies,

898
00:34:38,058 --> 00:34:40,498
so we can open
an industrial park together?

899
00:34:41,098 --> 00:34:43,419
Fatty, you're a big boss now.

900
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,138
Stop being so rowdy when you talk.

901
00:34:45,299 --> 00:34:45,859
Wait.

902
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:47,698
You need to look ahead.

903
00:34:48,098 --> 00:34:49,859
Invest when necessary, you know?

904
00:34:50,038 --> 00:34:51,138
Wait, listen.

905
00:34:51,218 --> 00:34:53,419
My factory is doing fine now,

906
00:34:53,698 --> 00:34:55,098
and I'm perfectly content.

907
00:34:55,578 --> 00:34:57,018
I am not that ambitious.

908
00:34:57,218 --> 00:34:59,018
I just need to settle accounts with you.

909
00:34:59,538 --> 00:35:01,498
Most importantly,
I don't dare make a loan.

910
00:35:01,939 --> 00:35:03,538
You know I don't have money.

911
00:35:05,538 --> 00:35:06,658
Mr. Fatty.

912
00:35:07,058 --> 00:35:08,618
This is your money for goods.

913
00:35:08,698 --> 00:35:11,218
One bag's 500,000 yuan,
and two bags make 1 million.

914
00:35:11,658 --> 00:35:13,698
Don't forget to take it when you leave.

915
00:35:15,018 --> 00:35:17,819
This is the money for goods,

916
00:35:17,859 --> 00:35:19,299
not pure profit, right?

917
00:35:19,419 --> 00:35:20,618
You all know this, don't you?

918
00:35:22,779 --> 00:35:24,739
Well, listen. Actually,

919
00:35:26,218 --> 00:35:30,259
collecting a few million
wouldn't be a problem for me.

920
00:35:30,779 --> 00:35:32,618
But I'm a bit worried.

921
00:35:32,698 --> 00:35:34,739
Just say what's on your mind.

922
00:35:35,138 --> 00:35:37,518
We've known each other
for ages, haven't we?

923
00:35:38,379 --> 00:35:38,899
To be honest.

924
00:35:39,479 --> 00:35:39,979
Go on.

925
00:35:39,979 --> 00:35:42,819
I'm very interested in your idea.

926
00:35:43,339 --> 00:35:44,498
But I'm worried

927
00:35:44,899 --> 00:35:46,779
if I invest the money

928
00:35:47,018 --> 00:35:49,578
and the park gets built,
but orders can't keep up later,

929
00:35:49,658 --> 00:35:51,498
then my investment
would just go in vain.

930
00:35:52,498 --> 00:35:52,998
What's up?

931
00:35:53,498 --> 00:35:55,859
Why do you worry
if the orders can keep up or not?

932
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:58,979
As the sales king of Yuehai,
did I complain anything?

933
00:35:59,578 --> 00:36:00,138
Besides,

934
00:36:00,259 --> 00:36:02,138
are your eyes just for decoration?

935
00:36:03,018 --> 00:36:05,259
Our orders keep increasing.

936
00:36:05,259 --> 00:36:06,578
They're doubling every year.

937
00:36:06,618 --> 00:36:08,498
Lately I'm drowning in orders.

938
00:36:08,979 --> 00:36:09,859
Can't you see?

939
00:36:10,379 --> 00:36:10,899
Moreover,

940
00:36:11,058 --> 00:36:12,658
if your industrial park is established,

941
00:36:12,739 --> 00:36:14,739
I'll expand my sales team greatly.

942
00:36:14,779 --> 00:36:16,178
Orders can't keep up?

943
00:36:16,419 --> 00:36:17,538
What's wrong with you?

944
00:36:18,018 --> 00:36:18,779
Alright. Well,

945
00:36:19,058 --> 00:36:20,698
you have the paper and pen.
Mr. Qian.

946
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:21,279
What's up?

947
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:22,339
Do you dare guarantee?

948
00:36:23,299 --> 00:36:24,138
What guarantee?

949
00:36:24,498 --> 00:36:25,578
You are the sales king.

950
00:36:26,299 --> 00:36:27,899
If I invest my money,

951
00:36:28,058 --> 00:36:29,339
and you can't get enough orders,

952
00:36:29,578 --> 00:36:31,018
will you cover my losses?

953
00:36:31,259 --> 00:36:31,779
Do you dare?

954
00:36:32,018 --> 00:36:33,259
Why would I cover your losses?

955
00:36:33,259 --> 00:36:35,178
See? This is the problem!

956
00:36:35,939 --> 00:36:38,098
Easier said than done.

957
00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:39,899
I'm investing real money.

958
00:36:39,899 --> 00:36:41,698
Who isn't investing real money?

959
00:36:41,698 --> 00:36:42,678
- See?
- Fatty.

960
00:36:43,259 --> 00:36:45,379
If Changyuan can't, I can.

961
00:36:48,259 --> 00:36:50,899
Xuemei, how can you
guarantee something like this?

962
00:36:52,578 --> 00:36:53,379
(Chunmei Printery Ltd., GM, Gao Xuemei)
Business cards?

963
00:36:56,018 --> 00:36:58,058
Xuemei, this is incredible!

964
00:36:58,498 --> 00:36:59,979
I've handled so many business deals.

965
00:37:00,058 --> 00:37:01,819
Only foreign traders had these.

966
00:37:02,979 --> 00:37:04,018
Not just foreign traders.

967
00:37:04,419 --> 00:37:07,178
I collected many of these
at the Canton Fair.

968
00:37:07,899 --> 00:37:09,899
So I determined to make our own.

969
00:37:10,379 --> 00:37:12,498
We tried several times
and finally succeeded.

970
00:37:13,618 --> 00:37:14,218
Xuemei.

971
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:15,138
This...

972
00:37:15,498 --> 00:37:17,058
How does this relate to our orders?

973
00:37:17,299 --> 00:37:18,658
This little business card.

974
00:37:19,018 --> 00:37:19,779
A few years ago,

975
00:37:20,058 --> 00:37:21,979
(Chunmei Printery Ltd., GM, Gao Xuemei)
this was a novelty, right?

976
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:24,939
Now more and more people use them.

977
00:37:25,899 --> 00:37:26,618
I checked

978
00:37:26,819 --> 00:37:28,899
our factory's orders in recent years.

979
00:37:29,379 --> 00:37:30,218
Forget the quantity,

980
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:33,739
just the variety of printed materials
has increased tenfold.

981
00:37:34,299 --> 00:37:35,018
What does it mean?

982
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,618
Demand for printed goods will only rise,

983
00:37:37,618 --> 00:37:38,658
and won't decline.

984
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:42,739
So as long as our printing quality

985
00:37:43,018 --> 00:37:44,819
keeps up,

986
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:47,379
orders will absolutely skyrocket.

987
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:49,138
Building the park is essential.

988
00:37:50,578 --> 00:37:52,058
Xuemei, I'm in.

989
00:37:53,658 --> 00:37:55,038
Great!

990
00:37:55,739 --> 00:37:57,359
Fatty, here's yours.

991
00:37:57,419 --> 00:37:57,919

992
00:37:59,939 --> 00:38:02,058

Thanks for not using Wu Youcai.

996
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:12,498
Even you get business cards now?
Unbelievable!

997
00:38:12,899 --> 00:38:13,698
You've got them too.

998
00:38:15,618 --> 00:38:16,138
You too?

999
00:38:16,138 --> 00:38:17,058

What is it?

1005
00:38:25,658 --> 00:38:26,538
Wait, Xuemei.

1006
00:38:27,419 --> 00:38:27,919
What is it?

1007
00:38:28,178 --> 00:38:30,578
I'm a salesman. This must be misprinted.

Listen.

00:38:34,259 --> 00:38:37,979
How long can you keep drinking
two jin of liquor every night?

1012
00:38:38,379 --> 00:38:39,779
I couldn't last a single day.

1013
00:38:40,498 --> 00:38:42,979
But I have to.
Otherwise, I couldn't land deals.

1014

Look, Fatty and I
just turn on the machines,

1015
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:48,739
- and we can earn money while asleep.
- Exactly.

1016
00:38:48,739 --> 00:38:50,498
Whether I sleep or not,
I'm making money.

What do you mean?

1018
00:38:53,899 --> 00:38:54,819

- Yes.
- Yes.

- Okay.

at the town government.

to start on our own first.

Yes.

1062
00:40:37,058 --> 00:40:39,058
They're offering us many incentives.

1063
00:40:40,618 --> 00:40:42,779
We still have opportunities
to cooperate later.

1064
00:40:44,058 --> 00:40:45,899
Okay. Thanks.

1065
00:40:45,939 --> 00:40:47,498

Guess what she just said on the phone?

1069
00:40:53,138 --> 00:40:53,779
- What?
- What?

1070
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:57,178
She said they'll also build
an industrial park in Nanzhou

1071
00:40:57,259 --> 00:40:58,259
and told us to go there.

1072
00:40:58,658 --> 00:40:59,498
I told them

1073
00:40:59,979 --> 00:41:02,138
we're preparing
to start on our own here.

1074
00:41:02,138 --> 00:41:03,058
- Right!
- Exactly.

1075
00:41:03,058 --> 00:41:05,259
So, we can start drinking now, right?

1076
00:41:05,419 --> 00:41:05,919
Start!

1077
00:41:06,178 --> 00:41:06,698
Let's start!

1078
00:41:06,899 --> 00:41:07,698
- Let's start!
- Start!

1079
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:09,498
Look, this is brandy.

This one.

1096
00:41:33,138 --> 00:41:33,698
Let me see.

1097
00:41:35,178 --> 00:41:37,379
It's for buying fabric.

1098
00:41:40,899 --> 00:41:41,939
March 21st.

1099
00:41:45,259 --> 00:41:47,018
Hello, Yuehai Town Government Office.

1100
00:41:49,979 --> 00:41:52,259
Mr. Wang, what's wrong?

1101
00:41:57,979 --> 00:41:59,128
Okay, I'll note it down.

1102
00:42:00,899 --> 00:42:01,399
Where?

1103
00:42:08,658 --> 00:42:11,299
Don't worry, I'll send someone
to handle it right away.

1104
00:42:12,379 --> 00:42:13,138
Okay, goodbye.

1105
00:42:18,098 --> 00:42:18,739
Mr. Tan.

1106
00:42:19,299 --> 00:42:21,618
A chicken farmer from Kong Village

1107
00:42:21,698 --> 00:42:23,979
got bitten by the dog
from Afang Bakery in our town.

1108
00:42:24,658 --> 00:42:26,419
Her dog is really vicious.

1109
00:42:26,498 --> 00:42:27,992
Did it bite a person or the chickens?

1110
00:42:28,259 --> 00:42:30,259
I'm not quite clear yet.

1111
00:42:30,578 --> 00:42:32,058
It doesn't sound very optimistic.

1112
00:42:32,498 --> 00:42:34,939
Mr. Wang spoke quite anxiously,

1113
00:42:35,259 --> 00:42:36,984
saying the two sides are about to fight.

1114
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:40,339
Why don't you take
the city inspectors to handle it?

1115
00:42:41,178 --> 00:42:43,218
I'm currently reconciling the accounts.

1116
00:42:43,218 --> 00:42:43,718
You...

1117
00:42:44,339 --> 00:42:45,979
It is a conflict between the two towns.

1118
00:42:46,018 --> 00:42:47,739
Sending just anyone won't work.

1119
00:42:47,979 --> 00:42:50,859
But I'm not familiar with that town.
Well, Xie could go.

1120
00:42:50,979 --> 00:42:52,658
Xie is quite familiar with that town.

1121
00:42:53,098 --> 00:42:53,698
I'll go.

1122
00:42:54,578 --> 00:42:55,658
An issue needs resolving?

1123
00:42:56,698 --> 00:42:58,379
Alright then. You continue.

1124
00:42:58,538 --> 00:42:59,379
I'll tell Mr. Xie.

1125
00:42:59,698 --> 00:43:00,198
Okay.

1126
00:43:00,259 --> 00:43:00,759
Mr. Xie.

1127
00:43:00,939 --> 00:43:01,698
You focus on it.

1128
00:43:01,698 --> 00:43:02,678
- Okay.
- Rest assured.
