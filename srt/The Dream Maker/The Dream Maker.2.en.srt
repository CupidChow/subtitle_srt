What makes you think

17
00:01:40,946 --> 00:01:43,305
the 'monkeys' will follow you?

18
00:01:43,825 --> 00:01:45,545
On the night of the county meeting,

19
00:01:45,825 --> 00:01:47,032
'monkeys' of Jiangku District

20
00:01:47,146 --> 00:01:48,105
(Cai Gang, Li Qiuping)
heard the news

21
00:01:48,385 --> 00:01:50,185
and held a meeting with me.

22
00:01:51,346 --> 00:01:52,745
They all want to leave with me.

23
00:01:53,105 --> 00:01:53,825
Ms. Zheng is here!

24
00:01:54,025 --> 00:01:55,066
The Secretary is here!

25
00:01:55,305 --> 00:01:55,805
(Zheng Family Ancestral Hall)
He is here.

26
00:01:57,346 --> 00:01:58,786
Ms. Zheng.

27
00:01:58,825 --> 00:01:59,545
Ms. Zheng is here!

28
00:02:00,626 --> 00:02:01,185
Ms. Zheng!

29
00:02:01,305 --> 00:02:02,265
Ms. Zheng came!

00:02:02,465 --> 00:02:03,626
The Secretary is here!

31
00:02:03,946 --> 00:02:04,986
Ms. Zheng is here!

32
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:06,305
The Secretary's here!

33
00:02:07,366 --> 00:02:07,866
Is it true

34
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:09,186
about building a city?

35
00:02:09,265 --> 00:02:10,265
We're getting anxious.

36
00:02:10,265 --> 00:02:11,705
- Is it true?
- What's the rush?

37
00:02:11,746 --> 00:02:13,186
Mr. Zheng will speak in public.

38
00:02:13,865 --> 00:02:14,665
You're the loudest.

39
00:02:15,226 --> 00:02:17,265
I haven't eaten.
I'll be even louder after I eat.

40
00:02:17,506 --> 00:02:18,186
Hold my bag.

41
00:02:18,385 --> 00:02:18,906
Okay.

42
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:21,026
Attention, guys.

43
00:02:28,825 --> 00:02:30,026
The county committee

44
00:02:31,665 --> 00:02:32,705
has decided

45
00:02:33,385 --> 00:02:35,026
to rebuild Yuehai into a city.

46
00:02:36,665 --> 00:02:37,425
I knew it.

47
00:02:37,746 --> 00:02:38,585
Yuehai!

48
00:02:38,585 --> 00:02:39,346
True information.

49
00:02:39,585 --> 00:02:40,825
My information is true!

50
00:02:42,186 --> 00:02:43,825
Once you move to Yuehai,

51
00:02:45,226 --> 00:02:46,626
you'll all get urban residency.

52
00:02:48,906 --> 00:02:49,665
All of you

53
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:51,746
will become city dwellers.

54
00:02:52,186 --> 00:02:54,066
Better days are just around the corner.

55
00:02:54,985 --> 00:02:57,026
Mr. Zheng, let me confirm this.

56
00:02:57,425 --> 00:02:58,825
So, you mean

57
00:02:59,306 --> 00:03:00,545
we'll soon be city people?

58
00:03:01,585 --> 00:03:03,145
Really? City dwellers?

59
00:03:03,145 --> 00:03:03,645
True.

60
00:03:04,425 --> 00:03:05,425
I, Zheng Decheng,

61
00:03:06,066 --> 00:03:07,786
never make baseless claims.

62
00:03:08,145 --> 00:03:09,226
This is based

63
00:03:10,346 --> 00:03:13,425
on this year's No.1 Central Document

64
00:03:13,825 --> 00:03:14,786
and the People's Daily.

65
00:03:15,226 --> 00:03:16,346
I'm pretty sure.

66
00:03:16,746 --> 00:03:17,246
Mr. Zheng,

67
00:03:17,545 --> 00:03:19,545
what requirements do we need
to go there?

68
00:03:20,145 --> 00:03:20,786
Yes, exactly.

69
00:03:20,786 --> 00:03:21,705
Exactly.

70
00:03:21,705 --> 00:03:22,585
What requirements?

71
00:03:23,026 --> 00:03:23,985
Let me think.

72
00:03:25,665 --> 00:03:26,346
Well,

73
00:03:27,265 --> 00:03:27,825
first,

74
00:03:29,186 --> 00:03:29,825
you need land.

75
00:03:31,306 --> 00:03:33,385
Second, you need to build a house.

76
00:03:35,626 --> 00:03:36,466
What about the cost?

77
00:03:36,985 --> 00:03:39,425
I estimate
around 10,000 should cover it.

78
00:03:39,865 --> 00:03:40,705
That's so cheap!

79
00:03:41,425 --> 00:03:41,985
So cheap!

80
00:03:42,026 --> 00:03:42,526
Wait.

81
00:03:43,746 --> 00:03:44,705
You're being naive.

82
00:03:45,906 --> 00:03:46,626
Why do you think

83
00:03:46,746 --> 00:03:48,226
the 'monkeys' will go to Yuehai?

84
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:51,705
I'm Zheng Decheng. They trust me.

85
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,265
This is alright.

86
00:03:54,865 --> 00:03:55,665
Of course.

87
00:03:55,665 --> 00:03:56,306
It's no problem.

88
00:03:56,786 --> 00:03:57,626
You're single,

89
00:03:58,026 --> 00:03:59,585
ten thousand buys your urban residency.

90
00:03:59,665 --> 00:04:00,506
Your family is big.

91
00:04:00,705 --> 00:04:01,506
Just borrow money.

92
00:04:01,746 --> 00:04:03,186
This is a great opportunity.

93
00:04:03,306 --> 00:04:04,506
That will cost more.

94
00:04:04,506 --> 00:04:05,705
You can borrow money!

95
00:04:05,865 --> 00:04:06,466
Golden chance!

96
00:04:06,466 --> 00:04:07,466
One more thing,

97
00:04:10,665 --> 00:04:12,066
I'll be the Secretary of Yuehai.

98
00:04:13,026 --> 00:04:14,226
Be a Secretary again?

99
00:04:14,265 --> 00:04:15,186
Great, Mr. Zheng!

100
00:04:15,346 --> 00:04:15,846
Wonderful!

101
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:19,186
Of course,

102
00:04:20,225 --> 00:04:23,225
it's not 100 percent confirmed yet.

103
00:04:23,785 --> 00:04:25,785
County leadership is discussing it.

104
00:04:26,785 --> 00:04:29,345
But I believe it's practically settled.

105
00:04:29,866 --> 00:04:33,145
Considering land, housing,
urban residency, and you,

106
00:04:33,265 --> 00:04:34,106
we must go!

107
00:04:34,385 --> 00:04:35,446
Yes, Mr. Zheng!

108
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:38,626
With you there,
we're all reassured, right?

109
00:04:38,626 --> 00:04:39,225
Yes!

110
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:40,986
Aren't you all going?

111
00:04:41,306 --> 00:04:42,585
As long as we follow Mr. Zheng,

112
00:04:42,746 --> 00:04:44,626
we'll surely have a better life.

113
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:45,186
True!

114
00:05:01,225 --> 00:05:02,186
(Pingchuan Yuehai's Secretary Election)
What's he grinning about?

115
00:05:02,265 --> 00:05:02,986
I don't know.

116
00:05:03,122 --> 00:05:05,688
(Cai Gang, Li Qiuping)

117
00:05:07,225 --> 00:05:08,746
The 'monkeys' all believe

118
00:05:09,186 --> 00:05:10,905
I'll definitely
be the Secretary of Yuehai.

119
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:11,905
Leaders,

120
00:05:12,465 --> 00:05:14,306
please don't make me lose face.

121
00:05:16,225 --> 00:05:17,225
Incredibly arrogant!

122
00:05:17,225 --> 00:05:19,066
Zheng Decheng is probably overconfident.

123
00:05:24,345 --> 00:05:25,225
How shameless!

124
00:05:30,465 --> 00:05:31,145
Zheng Decheng.

125
00:05:33,618 --> 00:05:35,192
(Liu Guangfa, Guan Yiming,
Zhao Dongsheng, Xia Changyou, Yan Zhenming)

126
00:05:36,905 --> 00:05:37,546
Let me ask you.

127
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,066
If 50,000 people move into the city,

128
00:05:40,746 --> 00:05:42,106
how will they make a living

129
00:05:42,946 --> 00:05:43,705
and survive?

130
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:45,866
Have you considered these issues?

131
00:05:46,585 --> 00:05:47,225
Mr. Zhao,

132
00:05:47,426 --> 00:05:48,666
we don't need to think

133
00:05:48,825 --> 00:05:50,546
about how they make a living

134
00:05:50,705 --> 00:05:51,866
and support their families.

135
00:05:52,506 --> 00:05:55,106
Those 'monkeys' are all capable.

136
00:05:55,345 --> 00:05:57,705
We only need to focus on one thing:

137
00:06:00,705 --> 00:06:01,306
guidance.

138
00:06:01,825 --> 00:06:04,746
Guide them to become the backbone
of Yuehai's economy.

139
00:06:06,785 --> 00:06:08,666
This does require government guidance.

140
00:06:14,825 --> 00:06:16,905
Do any of you have further questions?

141
00:06:17,705 --> 00:06:19,666
Feel free to ask anything.

142
00:06:19,905 --> 00:06:21,465
I'll answer whatever you ask.

143
00:06:23,506 --> 00:06:26,145
Alright, invite Cai Gang
and Li Qiuping to the stage.

144
00:06:27,905 --> 00:06:30,986
Cai Gang and Li Qiuping,
please come to the stage.

145
00:06:36,705 --> 00:06:40,666
During today's election,
we've been deeply moved

146
00:06:41,426 --> 00:06:42,186
and inspired.

147
00:06:43,106 --> 00:06:44,905
You've answered all questions earnestly,

148
00:06:45,306 --> 00:06:48,746
providing innovative solutions
in such a short time.

149
00:06:49,585 --> 00:06:50,345
Here's my thought.

150
00:06:50,385 --> 00:06:53,106
I'd like to ask each of you
one final question.

151
00:06:53,905 --> 00:06:56,066
Give me one reason each

152
00:06:57,106 --> 00:06:59,946
why you should be Yuehai's Secretary.

153
00:07:00,506 --> 00:07:02,705
Isn't money what Yuehai lacks most?

154
00:07:02,785 --> 00:07:04,186
I can bring in the 'monkeys'.

155
00:07:04,186 --> 00:07:05,306
I can secure funding.

156
00:07:10,265 --> 00:07:11,265
Quite straightforward.

157
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:12,785
Li, you go next.

158
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,785
Sir, I'm very young,
which is my advantage.

159
00:07:21,306 --> 00:07:22,225
That's a valid reason.

160
00:07:22,225 --> 00:07:23,546
Good for you.

161
00:07:24,186 --> 00:07:26,546
Being young means
I act without hesitation.

162
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:30,265
Moreover,
I know every inch of Yuehai's land.

163
00:07:30,626 --> 00:07:33,066
My planning map proves everything.

164
00:07:34,345 --> 00:07:34,845
Good.

165
00:07:37,465 --> 00:07:39,186
Zheng Decheng, be serious.

166
00:07:44,746 --> 00:07:45,345
Mr. Zhao,

167
00:07:46,025 --> 00:07:47,506
based on today's presentations,

168
00:07:47,746 --> 00:07:49,506
I'd like to share some personal ideas.

169
00:07:49,986 --> 00:07:50,486
Go ahead.

170
00:07:51,025 --> 00:07:51,626
First,

171
00:07:52,825 --> 00:07:55,186
we shouldn't worship foreign approaches.

172
00:07:55,746 --> 00:07:58,506
Foreign methods don't suit Pingchuan.

173
00:07:59,366 --> 00:08:01,106
Second, I'm addressing your question.

174
00:08:01,905 --> 00:08:03,785
Yuehai's development mustn't be rushed.

175
00:08:04,265 --> 00:08:05,905
We need realistic development goals.

176
00:08:06,426 --> 00:08:08,905
Throwing out numbers
like 50,000 people is irresponsible.

177
00:08:10,265 --> 00:08:10,866
Third,

178
00:08:11,585 --> 00:08:13,546
stability is paramount.

179
00:08:14,186 --> 00:08:16,345
In steadily advancing development,

180
00:08:16,825 --> 00:08:18,426
I have substantial experience.

181
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:20,186
As a government body,

182
00:08:20,465 --> 00:08:22,585
we must prioritize stability,

183
00:08:23,106 --> 00:08:24,306
avoid frequent policy changes,

184
00:08:24,946 --> 00:08:26,265
refrain from arbitrary decisions,

185
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,186
and never violate central directives.

186
00:08:28,546 --> 00:08:29,225
Mr. Cai,

187
00:08:30,025 --> 00:08:32,985
your "stability"
sounds like doing nothing.

188
00:08:33,865 --> 00:08:36,585
Decheng, inaction beats reckless action.

189
00:08:37,306 --> 00:08:38,745
Your rash actions in Jinshan

190
00:08:39,026 --> 00:08:40,546
caused 10,000 yuan in losses.

191
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:41,465
- I...
- Wait.

192
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,906
Mr. Cai, explain this.

193
00:08:44,266 --> 00:08:46,266
What caused the loss?

194
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:47,906
Sir,

195
00:08:48,186 --> 00:08:48,946
I know about this.

196
00:08:49,345 --> 00:08:52,546
Zheng Decheng led villagers
in Jinshan to raise turtles.

197
00:08:52,705 --> 00:08:53,786
During startup,

198
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:57,105
he borrowed 10,000 yuan
from the credit union in the town's name

199
00:08:57,345 --> 00:08:58,146
to buy hatchlings.

200
00:08:58,465 --> 00:09:01,585
But unfortunately, all hatchlings died.

201
00:09:02,426 --> 00:09:03,705
Why wasn't I informed?

202
00:09:04,266 --> 00:09:06,066
You were at the Party School then.

203
00:09:06,386 --> 00:09:08,745
The former Secretary handled it.

204
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:11,666
He firmly opposed disciplinary action,

205
00:09:11,965 --> 00:09:14,026
so Zheng Decheng
was held responsible for the loss.

206
00:09:14,745 --> 00:09:16,426
He borrowed money

207
00:09:16,705 --> 00:09:17,985
and paid 2,000 upfront,

208
00:09:18,146 --> 00:09:20,705
with 50 yuan docked monthly
from his salary

209
00:09:20,946 --> 00:09:21,745
for eight years.

210
00:09:23,345 --> 00:09:24,026
I heard

211
00:09:24,345 --> 00:09:25,825
that after villagers learned

212
00:09:25,946 --> 00:09:28,105
about his repayments,

213
00:09:28,225 --> 00:09:29,666
they pooled money

214
00:09:29,985 --> 00:09:31,386
to repay Zheng Decheng's debt.

215
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:34,426
But Zheng Decheng firmly refused
to accept their money.

216
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,745
Leaders, I wish to go to Yuehai.

217
00:09:42,026 --> 00:09:43,985
That's entirely separate
from the past mistakes.

218
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:45,505
I guarantee

219
00:09:45,745 --> 00:09:47,865
that I will repay all my previous debts.

220
00:09:48,146 --> 00:09:50,186
If I can't, my son will continue paying

221
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:51,585
until my debt is clear.

222
00:09:52,266 --> 00:09:52,985
Zheng Decheng,

223
00:09:53,786 --> 00:09:56,105
stop pretending to be selfless.

224
00:09:56,426 --> 00:09:58,386
Do you really have no personal motives?

225
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,666
Taking so many 'monkeys' to Yuehai,

226
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,745
are you trying
to become some local emperor?

227
00:10:03,345 --> 00:10:05,146
Mr. Cai, what do you mean by that?

228
00:10:05,426 --> 00:10:06,505
Watch your words.

229
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:08,825
They volunteered
to go to Yuehai with me!

230
00:10:09,146 --> 00:10:09,646
Enough,

231
00:10:10,745 --> 00:10:12,026
calm down.

232
00:10:12,306 --> 00:10:14,786
Having a debate is good.

233
00:10:14,825 --> 00:10:16,146
Let's put it all on the table.

234
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,146
Now, let's put it to a vote.

235
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:19,886
Okay.

236
00:10:21,585 --> 00:10:22,345
Cai Gang.

237
00:10:25,946 --> 00:10:26,946
Cai Gang.

238
00:10:29,146 --> 00:10:30,186
Zheng Decheng.

239
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:33,906
Zheng Decheng.

240
00:10:37,906 --> 00:10:38,786
Cai, how did it go?

241

(Auditorium)
He is cunning,

242
00:10:40,186 --> 00:10:41,825
making the 'monkeys'
pay to build Yuehai.

243
00:10:41,825 --> 00:10:42,666
Unbelievable!

244
00:10:43,386 --> 00:10:43,886
Then,

245
00:10:44,026 --> 00:10:44,786
- any chance?
- Go home.

246
00:10:45,105 --> 00:10:46,200
What do you mean?

247
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,096
Wait for me.

248
00:10:47,096 --> 00:10:48,686
Decheng, how is it going?

249
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,386
Come on, just tell me about it.

250
00:10:54,985 --> 00:10:55,745
I won, I think.

251
00:10:56,105 --> 00:10:57,026

252
00:11:15,306 --> 00:11:15,946

253
00:11:17,985 --> 00:11:19,386
Where are we going? You decide.

Thanks.

00:14:07,105 --> 00:14:10,225
Your idea to bring the 'monkeys'
to build Yuehai is even more impressive.

00:14:19,345 --> 00:14:21,666
could you give me the blueprint

315
00:14:22,825 --> 00:14:23,946
you made?

316
00:14:24,786 --> 00:14:26,225
So, you want the blueprint?

00:14:27,186 --> 00:14:28,026

It costs one 'monkey'.

00:14:35,426 --> 00:14:36,625
That's way too much!

322
00:14:37,146 --> 00:14:39,066

Mr. Zheng,

326
00:14:45,546 --> 00:14:46,985
instead of getting my blueprint,

327
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:50,026
why not try asking Mr. Zhao
for household registration approval?

328
00:14:50,585 --> 00:14:51,186
What?

329
00:14:51,786 --> 00:14:54,985
After all, they care more
about their household registration,

00:14:55,345 --> 00:14:55,946
don't they?

331
00:14:57,705 --> 00:14:58,666
So funny.

00:14:58,906 --> 00:15:00,186

00:16:40,225 --> 00:16:41,105
Let me take a look.

376
00:16:41,745 --> 00:16:42,546
Okay.

377
00:16:55,386 --> 00:16:56,825
Quite impressive!

378
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:58,465
Very good!

379
00:16:59,546 --> 00:17:00,906
Ms. Gao, here's the thing.

380
00:17:01,546 --> 00:17:03,266
If all your samples are real,

381
00:17:03,906 --> 00:17:05,106
I guarantee you right now

382
00:17:05,426 --> 00:17:07,305
we'll pay you to print our trademark!

383
00:17:08,065 --> 00:17:09,465
They're definitely real!

384
00:17:09,886 --> 00:17:10,386
Amazing!

385
00:17:10,386 --> 00:17:11,946
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

386
00:17:12,305 --> 00:17:13,946
Chunmei Printery

387
00:17:14,265 --> 00:17:15,065
values quality.

388
00:17:15,465 --> 00:17:16,346
- Sure.
- Honestly,

389
00:17:16,946 --> 00:17:18,826
in Dongjiang,
Pingchuan has the best printers.

390
00:17:19,065 --> 00:17:21,426
And in Pingchuan, Chunmei is the best!

391
00:17:22,465 --> 00:17:23,745
Quite a good slogan.

392
00:17:27,386 --> 00:17:28,305
(He is about to fight.)

393
00:17:28,785 --> 00:17:29,785
(On the mountain,)

394
00:17:31,065 --> 00:17:32,305
(a cannon roared!)

395
00:17:32,305 --> 00:17:33,465
(Ambushed soldiers emerged.)

396
00:17:33,465 --> 00:17:35,666
(Linhai Dock)
(A white steed charged down the hill!)

397
00:17:35,826 --> 00:17:38,586
(Its rider wore silver armor
over white robes,)

398
00:17:38,586 --> 00:17:41,186
(brandishing a spear as he shouted.)

399
00:17:41,426 --> 00:17:44,346
(Don't be afraid.)

400
00:17:44,426 --> 00:17:45,985
(I'll protect you.)

401
00:17:46,386 --> 00:17:50,346
(Yue Fei fought
against the foreign generals.)

402
00:17:52,626 --> 00:17:55,465
Mr. Shen, it's a bit crowded.

403
00:17:56,265 --> 00:17:57,025
Hold on tight!

404
00:17:59,586 --> 00:18:02,386
We need to take a boat to your factory?

405
00:18:03,626 --> 00:18:05,826
Not far! Once we cross the river,
we're almost there!

406
00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:07,106
Alright.

407
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:07,946
Let me help.

408
00:18:07,946 --> 00:18:09,065
No, I'll hold it myself!

409
00:18:10,785 --> 00:18:11,384
Sorry.

410
00:18:11,384 --> 00:18:12,426
Move a little bit.

411
00:18:12,745 --> 00:18:13,245
Okay.

412
00:18:36,545 --> 00:18:37,186
Mr. Shen.

413
00:18:38,186 --> 00:18:38,785
Sit tight!

414
00:18:41,225 --> 00:18:42,025
Let me tell you,

415
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:43,906
Chunmei Printery

416
00:18:44,386 --> 00:18:48,106
is the perfect union
of Xie Chunlai and Gao Xuemei!

417
00:18:48,386 --> 00:18:48,886
Sure.

418
00:18:49,065 --> 00:18:51,386
As founders,
we personally came to welcome you.

419
00:18:51,386 --> 00:18:51,886
True!

420
00:18:51,946 --> 00:18:52,866
I'm honored.

421
00:18:53,025 --> 00:18:54,906
My surname is Xie,

422
00:18:54,906 --> 00:18:56,426
which is also pronounced as Jie.

423
00:18:56,866 --> 00:18:57,545
Yes, exactly!

424
00:19:00,826 --> 00:19:02,346
To welcome you,

425
00:19:02,745 --> 00:19:03,826
yesterday, my wife

426
00:19:03,985 --> 00:19:05,426
prepared cooking ingredients.

427
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:06,065
Yes!

428
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:08,666
Two giant turtles
and two local chickens!

429
00:19:08,946 --> 00:19:11,946
They're already cooked well,
just waiting for you!

430
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:14,465
Sit tight!

431
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:16,166
Whoa!

432
00:19:16,386 --> 00:19:18,785
Ms. Gao, can you tell me exactly

433
00:19:18,826 --> 00:19:20,545
how far your factory is anyway?

434
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:23,265
Not too far. Just over an hour's drive.

435
00:19:23,305 --> 00:19:23,805
What?

436
00:19:23,946 --> 00:19:26,146
In less than 50 minutes,
and we'll be there!

437
00:19:27,386 --> 00:19:28,626
That's almost an hour!

438
00:19:30,906 --> 00:19:31,705
It's so remote!

439
00:19:31,745 --> 00:19:33,426
Why didn't you tell me beforehand?

440
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:34,985
A good thing takes time.

441
00:19:35,045 --> 00:19:35,545
Right.

442
00:19:35,545 --> 00:19:36,826
A good factory's worth the trip.

443
00:19:36,826 --> 00:19:37,386
Exactly!

444
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:41,946
We cover transportation, meals,
and accommodation.

445
00:19:42,626 --> 00:19:44,505
The key is the top-notch quality.

446
00:19:44,705 --> 00:19:45,225
True.

447
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,106
You'll find out later.

448
00:19:46,705 --> 00:19:47,985
Look at the view!

449
00:19:48,346 --> 00:19:49,146
Take a look.

450
00:19:49,305 --> 00:19:51,106
This is definitely the place
for big deals!

451
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:51,785
Yes!

452
00:19:51,946 --> 00:19:53,426
Good feng shui breeds entrepreneurs!

453
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:55,586
This place is remote,

454
00:19:55,985 --> 00:19:56,946
but it's perfectly safe.

455
00:19:57,186 --> 00:19:57,686
Yes.

456
00:19:57,826 --> 00:19:59,346
No bandits on the road.

457
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:00,065
Right.

458
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:01,186
No robbers or murderers.

459
00:20:01,705 --> 00:20:03,505
Just ignore those few scattered graves.

460
00:20:03,545 --> 00:20:04,305
Out of sight,

461
00:20:04,985 --> 00:20:05,866
out of mind.

462
00:20:05,866 --> 00:20:07,545
- Relax.
- No one could hide there anyway.

463
00:20:07,985 --> 00:20:08,745
- No one could.
- No hiding spots.

464
00:20:08,785 --> 00:20:10,265
Just enjoy the view!

465
00:20:10,705 --> 00:20:11,426
Appreciate it!

466
00:20:14,225 --> 00:20:15,065
Beautiful.

467
00:20:22,265 --> 00:20:25,745
Stop! Stop right away!

468
00:20:29,826 --> 00:20:30,326
What?

469
00:20:30,545 --> 00:20:31,045
Well,

470
00:20:31,346 --> 00:20:32,666
wh-what's wrong?

471
00:20:33,505 --> 00:20:34,005
You...

472
00:20:36,906 --> 00:20:37,626
I need to pee.

473
00:20:39,025 --> 00:20:39,745
Just find a place.

474
00:20:39,826 --> 00:20:40,326
Go ahead!

475
00:20:40,465 --> 00:20:40,965
Go.

476
00:20:41,465 --> 00:20:42,106
I'll wait.

477
00:20:42,906 --> 00:20:43,545
I won't watch.

478
00:20:43,985 --> 00:20:44,666
I hold your bag?

479
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:45,545
No! No need!

480
00:20:46,186 --> 00:20:46,686
Okay.

481
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:47,985
Mr. Shen, feel free!

482
00:20:51,186 --> 00:20:51,985
His bladder jolted.

483
00:20:59,586 --> 00:21:00,086
What?

484
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,386
Where is he going?

485
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,785
- What?
- We're not looking!

486
00:21:08,065 --> 00:21:08,946
Mr. Shen!

487
00:21:10,586 --> 00:21:11,705
I'm not going!

488
00:21:13,426 --> 00:21:15,146
I won't go with you.

489
00:21:20,626 --> 00:21:21,505
He ran off!

490
00:21:22,265 --> 00:21:23,384
He hates a long trip.

491
00:21:23,785 --> 00:21:24,586
I know!

492
00:21:24,745 --> 00:21:26,225
I saw it! No need to explain!

493
00:21:26,505 --> 00:21:27,005
My fault?

494
00:21:27,025 --> 00:21:27,626
Yes!

495
00:21:27,906 --> 00:21:29,505
It's all your fault!

496
00:21:29,785 --> 00:21:32,465
You said one hour, which scared him off.

497
00:21:32,705 --> 00:21:34,086
Didn't you say anything?

498
00:21:34,106 --> 00:21:34,826
Didn't you?

499
00:21:35,146 --> 00:21:36,626
Bandits on the road?

500
00:21:36,985 --> 00:21:39,065
I was comforting him!
Trying to ease his fears!

501
00:21:39,305 --> 00:21:40,025
Are you kidding?

502
00:21:40,305 --> 00:21:41,265
Your comfort scared him.

503
00:21:41,265 --> 00:21:42,465
- Don't be silly.
- You butted in!

504
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,465
Talking about graves.

505
00:21:44,505 --> 00:21:45,906
Look, you're dressed like a spook!

506
00:21:46,106 --> 00:21:46,785
So he was scared!

507
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:48,985
Shut up.

508
00:21:49,785 --> 00:21:50,626
Shut up!

509
00:21:51,586 --> 00:21:54,265
We've lost three deals this month.

510
00:21:57,065 --> 00:22:00,305
My life is so bitter!

511
00:22:01,225 --> 00:22:03,225
I'm exhausted!

512
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:04,996
I brought him here

513
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,985
by bus, boat, and motorbike.

514
00:22:09,465 --> 00:22:11,826
Mr. Shen, you big liar!

515
00:22:12,346 --> 00:22:13,426
You fraud!

516
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,305
You double-crossed me!

517
00:22:15,465 --> 00:22:17,265
You liar!

518
00:22:17,745 --> 00:22:19,545
You deceived me!

519
00:22:19,985 --> 00:22:22,186
You broke my wife's trust!

520
00:22:22,505 --> 00:22:24,505
A pretty lady wanted
to do business with you,

521
00:22:24,745 --> 00:22:25,626
but you tricked her!

522
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:29,305
Princess, you're stunning!

523
00:22:30,346 --> 00:22:32,106
You'll regret this!

524
00:22:32,826 --> 00:22:34,106
May your bike chain

525
00:22:34,505 --> 00:22:36,426
snap!

526
00:22:36,906 --> 00:22:38,545
May you burn out your kettles

527
00:22:38,866 --> 00:22:40,545
and blast yourself with your own farts!

528
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:45,906
I'm here for you.

529
00:22:46,485 --> 00:22:47,985
Is my hairstyle messy?

530
00:22:48,025 --> 00:22:48,586
Let me see.

531
00:22:48,705 --> 00:22:50,305
I paid for it yesterday.

532
00:22:50,305 --> 00:22:51,906
Let me look. It's perfect.

533
00:22:54,225 --> 00:22:55,065
Your tears.

534
00:22:56,106 --> 00:22:56,946
All good.

535
00:22:57,065 --> 00:22:57,666
It's all good?

536
00:22:59,406 --> 00:22:59,906
He left.

537
00:22:59,906 --> 00:23:01,106
What food did you make?

538
00:23:01,745 --> 00:23:02,505
Big turtles.

539
00:23:02,626 --> 00:23:03,545
Go back and eat them.

540
00:23:14,906 --> 00:23:17,626
Sorry! I was in a hurry
and crashed into your door.

541
00:23:18,946 --> 00:23:20,505
So careless. The door's expensive.

542
00:23:20,626 --> 00:23:21,505
I just replaced this.

543
00:23:21,705 --> 00:23:22,785
That's not the point.

544
00:23:22,906 --> 00:23:23,545
I'll pay for it.

545
00:23:25,265 --> 00:23:26,626
I got beaten up.

546
00:23:28,505 --> 00:23:29,666
What happened?

547
00:23:30,426 --> 00:23:31,545
That's not the point either.

548
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:33,906
Mr. Zheng, I need to ask you one thing.

549
00:23:34,186 --> 00:23:35,626
Are you the Secretary of Yuehai?

550
00:23:38,225 --> 00:23:39,265
Of course I am.

551
00:23:39,866 --> 00:23:41,265
The procedure takes time.

552
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:43,186
In this case, I know what to do.

553
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:45,505
Otherwise,
they'll think I'm lying to them.

554
00:23:46,065 --> 00:23:47,545
Who thinks you're tricking them?

555
00:23:48,545 --> 00:23:49,965
Look, Mr. Zheng.

556
00:23:50,906 --> 00:23:52,225
We spontaneously made a register.

557
00:23:52,426 --> 00:23:54,705
All who want to go
to Yuehai wrote their names on it.

558
00:23:54,705 --> 00:23:56,280
(Registration)

559
00:23:57,106 --> 00:23:58,326
- Voluntarily?
- Sure.

560
00:23:58,626 --> 00:23:59,346
Absolutely.

561
00:23:59,946 --> 00:24:00,946
Right after your speech,

562
00:24:01,146 --> 00:24:02,545
I talked to lots of 'monkeys'.

563
00:24:03,146 --> 00:24:05,186
They heard
you're the Secretary of Yuehai,

564
00:24:05,225 --> 00:24:06,426
so they're willing to go.

565
00:24:06,626 --> 00:24:07,866
But right after registering,

566
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:09,586
Fatty came and said

567
00:24:09,785 --> 00:24:10,946
about a rumor that you are

568
00:24:11,065 --> 00:24:12,265
no longer Secretary of Yuehai.

569
00:24:12,505 --> 00:24:13,826
A guy beat you.

570
00:24:14,025 --> 00:24:15,225
Gang Cai? Or Cai...

571
00:24:16,785 --> 00:24:17,626
That's nonsense!

572
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:19,505
How could I not be the Secretary?

573
00:24:19,705 --> 00:24:20,205
Yes.

574
00:24:20,426 --> 00:24:21,545
You don't even believe me?

575
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:22,265
I believe you.

576
00:24:22,465 --> 00:24:23,545
Can't you even handle this?

577
00:24:23,906 --> 00:24:24,826
Turn around right now

578
00:24:25,065 --> 00:24:25,705
and go tell them

579
00:24:26,025 --> 00:24:27,106
that I'm the Secretary.

580
00:24:27,225 --> 00:24:27,946
Mr. Zheng!

581
00:24:27,985 --> 00:24:29,586
I can't do this alone.

582
00:24:29,826 --> 00:24:30,745
You have to go with me.

583
00:24:30,946 --> 00:24:31,985
Put some medicine on.

584
00:24:32,065 --> 00:24:33,586
They're fighting, Mr. Zheng!

585
00:24:34,025 --> 00:24:34,545
I won't go.

586
00:24:34,545 --> 00:24:35,465
Mr. Zheng, please.

587
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:36,166
- Stop.
- Mr. Zheng.

588
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:37,705
If you don't, I'll just live here.

589
00:24:37,765 --> 00:24:39,225
Why are you being so shameless?

590
00:24:39,386 --> 00:24:40,305
I'm this shameless.

591
00:24:40,505 --> 00:24:41,225
If you don't go,

592
00:24:41,225 --> 00:24:43,106
I'll live here and eat your food.

593
00:24:43,326 --> 00:24:45,386
Mr. Zheng, please, help me out, okay?

594
00:24:45,586 --> 00:24:47,705
Otherwise, I can't face them.

595
00:24:49,426 --> 00:24:50,846
Alright, I'll go with you.

596
00:24:51,305 --> 00:24:53,305
But first, take me
to the county committee.

597
00:24:54,705 --> 00:24:55,205
Okay.

598
00:24:55,826 --> 00:24:57,386
Regarding the election for Secretary,

599
00:24:57,465 --> 00:24:59,305
so far, only two candidates remain.

600
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:00,745
Here's what I think.

601
00:25:01,305 --> 00:25:02,106
Mr. Guan.

602
00:25:03,025 --> 00:25:03,946
Mr. Guan.

603
00:25:04,426 --> 00:25:04,985
Mr. Guan.

604
00:25:05,186 --> 00:25:05,946
Is Mr. Guan here?

605
00:25:06,106 --> 00:25:06,680
In a meeting.

606
00:25:07,426 --> 00:25:08,305
Okay, go ahead.

607
00:25:08,545 --> 00:25:09,305
We'll wait.

608
00:25:12,505 --> 00:25:13,106
Mr. Guan.

609
00:25:13,465 --> 00:25:14,505
Keep your voice down!

610
00:25:14,866 --> 00:25:15,666
- Meeting!
- Mr. Guan!

611
00:25:16,785 --> 00:25:17,626
I'm in trouble.

612
00:25:17,826 --> 00:25:19,025
You have to help me, Guan.

613
00:25:19,305 --> 00:25:19,805
What is it?

614
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:22,106
Wait a moment.

615
00:25:22,346 --> 00:25:23,346
We'll talk later.

616
00:25:23,906 --> 00:25:25,065
There's no time!

617
00:25:25,386 --> 00:25:27,256
Many 'monkeys' have gathered
at Zhengjia Village,

618
00:25:27,346 --> 00:25:28,426
all waiting for me.

619
00:25:28,545 --> 00:25:29,505
(Stats Dept.)
Keep your voice down!

620
00:25:29,785 --> 00:25:30,426
Okay,

621
00:25:30,785 --> 00:25:31,346
I will.

622
00:25:32,465 --> 00:25:34,545
I went to Zhengjia Village
before the election.

623
00:25:34,946 --> 00:25:35,866
I exaggerated a bit.

624
00:25:36,146 --> 00:25:37,065
So now,

625
00:25:37,106 --> 00:25:38,985
they all think
I'm the Secretary of Yuehai.

626
00:25:39,826 --> 00:25:42,146
Didn't I report this to you
during the campaign?

627
00:25:42,465 --> 00:25:43,586
You did,

628
00:25:43,866 --> 00:25:45,240
but it doesn't mean it is settled.

629
00:25:45,406 --> 00:25:46,946
I have to criticize you for this.

630
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:48,785
How could you just brag

631
00:25:48,785 --> 00:25:49,946
before it is settled?

632
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,505
You messed it up,

633
00:25:51,666 --> 00:25:52,666
and I clean up your mess?

634
00:25:53,265 --> 00:25:53,765
You wish!

635
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:54,866
Not like that.

636
00:25:54,946 --> 00:25:56,946
How would I dare to let you do that?

637
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:58,465
Look at the register book.

638
00:25:58,785 --> 00:25:59,866
What does it prove?

639
00:26:00,666 --> 00:26:02,666
It proves my plan is viable.

640
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,906
I urge the higher-ups to be decisive.

641
00:26:05,106 --> 00:26:06,146
Just appoint me.

642
00:26:06,626 --> 00:26:07,586
Their signatures

643
00:26:07,785 --> 00:26:09,505
have nothing to do with appointing you.

644
00:26:10,666 --> 00:26:11,666
You're unreasonable.

645
00:26:12,346 --> 00:26:13,826
If you don't go, they also won't go?

646
00:26:15,346 --> 00:26:17,386
If I don't go,
maybe they won't go either.

647
00:26:17,705 --> 00:26:19,785
What do you mean by that? A threat?

648
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:21,785
I swear!

649
00:26:22,186 --> 00:26:23,826
That's definitely not what I mean.

650
00:26:24,346 --> 00:26:26,106
Mr. Guan, look for yourself.

651
00:26:26,146 --> 00:26:27,985
They signed themselves

652
00:26:28,025 --> 00:26:29,805
voluntarily here.

653
00:26:29,946 --> 00:26:31,065
I never forced them!

654
00:26:38,505 --> 00:26:40,426
Zheng Decheng, you're pissing me off!

655
00:26:40,426 --> 00:26:42,626
(Signature Book)
Guan, let me tell you again.

656
00:26:42,985 --> 00:26:44,106
If the county gives money,

657
00:26:44,426 --> 00:26:46,626
anyone can be the Secretary of Yuehai.

658
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,346
But if the county doesn't,

659
00:26:48,626 --> 00:26:49,666
in Pingchuan County,

660
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:51,985
I'm the only one
capable of building a city.

661
00:26:52,465 --> 00:26:53,225
In three years,

662
00:26:53,626 --> 00:26:55,065
I'll build a prosperous city.

663
00:26:55,426 --> 00:26:57,225
Otherwise, I'll accept any punishment.

664
00:26:59,225 --> 00:26:59,866
Are you done?

665
00:27:00,025 --> 00:27:00,525
Yes.

666
00:27:00,946 --> 00:27:01,446
Get out.

667
00:27:01,705 --> 00:27:02,205
Fine.

668
00:27:02,626 --> 00:27:03,186
I'll get out.

669
00:27:06,322 --> 00:27:07,832
(Zheng Family Ancestral Hall)

670
00:27:12,586 --> 00:27:13,505
Mr. Zheng, over here.

671
00:27:13,826 --> 00:27:14,326
He's here.

672
00:27:14,505 --> 00:27:15,346
- He's here.
- Discuss it with the Secretary.

673
00:27:15,606 --> 00:27:16,106
Zheng!

674
00:27:16,106 --> 00:27:17,545
The Secretary's here!

675
00:27:17,705 --> 00:27:18,785
The rumormonger, come out!

676
00:27:19,186 --> 00:27:19,985
Those who hit me?

677
00:27:21,305 --> 00:27:21,985
They're quiet.

678
00:27:21,985 --> 00:27:22,505
Indeed.

679
00:27:22,705 --> 00:27:23,505
That's good.

680
00:27:24,985 --> 00:27:25,946
Where were you guys?

681
00:27:26,086 --> 00:27:27,826
We were out for orders.

682
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:29,785
But the client thinks
our place is remote.

683
00:27:29,946 --> 00:27:31,065
So, he ran away.

684
00:27:31,305 --> 00:27:32,106
Why bring it up?

685
00:27:32,106 --> 00:27:33,866
We really lost several orders
this month.

686
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:34,686
Mr. Zheng,

687
00:27:34,805 --> 00:27:36,426
will Yuehai really be built?

688
00:27:36,785 --> 00:27:37,285
Mr. Zheng,

689
00:27:37,465 --> 00:27:39,065
are you really the Secretary of Yuehai?

690
00:27:39,065 --> 00:27:39,705
Are you?

691
00:27:39,745 --> 00:27:40,626
You're from Jinshan?

692
00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:41,866
- Yeah.
- Why did you come?

693
00:27:42,025 --> 00:27:43,025
Mr. Zheng, I'm here!

694
00:27:43,146 --> 00:27:43,985
Mr. Zheng.

695
00:27:44,106 --> 00:27:44,946
Mr. Zheng.

696
00:27:45,225 --> 00:27:45,725
Mr. Zheng.

697
00:27:45,745 --> 00:27:46,245
Mr. Zheng.

698
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:47,065
Mr. Zheng.

699
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:49,265
Tell us!
Have you become the Secretary of Yuehai?

700
00:27:49,666 --> 00:27:50,166
Have you?

701
00:27:50,946 --> 00:27:53,065
Those who hit me, watch and listen up!

702
00:28:25,785 --> 00:28:26,285
Well...

703
00:28:37,705 --> 00:28:38,785
Today,

704
00:28:39,866 --> 00:28:40,866
I've kept you waiting.

705
00:28:41,146 --> 00:28:41,666
Sit.

706
00:28:41,946 --> 00:28:42,745
Sit.

707
00:28:43,386 --> 00:28:44,346
Quick, sit down.

708
00:28:45,866 --> 00:28:48,225
Although Mr. Zheng arrived late,

709
00:28:48,785 --> 00:28:49,745
finally,

710
00:28:50,586 --> 00:28:52,025
he is here.

711
00:28:52,666 --> 00:28:53,166
Good!

712
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:54,166
Good!

713
00:28:57,025 --> 00:28:57,586
Say something!

714
00:29:24,065 --> 00:29:24,906
So many bikes.

715
00:29:26,946 --> 00:29:27,906
So many people.

716
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:30,106
You just forge boldly ahead.

717
00:29:30,705 --> 00:29:32,505
Don't be afraid
of earning too much money.

718
00:29:32,985 --> 00:29:34,586
Don't be afraid of getting rich fast.

719
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:38,065
If you have the skill,
you can even touch the sky!

720
00:29:40,025 --> 00:29:40,525
The sky!

721
00:29:40,866 --> 00:29:42,406
You're worried you'll miss the chance

722
00:29:42,505 --> 00:29:43,666
to start over, right?

723
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:44,305
Make way please.

724
00:29:44,305 --> 00:29:46,265
- Thank you.
- This is your chance.

725
00:29:46,866 --> 00:29:48,025
In the near future,

726
00:29:48,906 --> 00:29:50,666
you will work with your hands

727
00:29:51,386 --> 00:29:54,906
for a better life.

728
00:29:55,826 --> 00:29:56,626
And Yuehai

729
00:29:56,985 --> 00:29:58,826
is the new starting point for all of us.

730
00:29:59,386 --> 00:30:01,386
- Good!
- Good!

731
00:30:01,426 --> 00:30:02,826
Good!

732
00:30:03,186 --> 00:30:04,065
Well said!

733
00:30:04,065 --> 00:30:05,106
Apologize to me!

734
00:30:05,346 --> 00:30:06,025
Look at him.

735
00:30:06,606 --> 00:30:07,106
Hurry up!

736
00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:07,785
Quite eloquent.

737
00:30:08,745 --> 00:30:10,426
Listen! You guys, apologize to me.

738
00:30:12,906 --> 00:30:14,265
What a great speech!

739
00:30:14,265 --> 00:30:15,705
- Good!
- Good!

740
00:30:15,826 --> 00:30:16,985
Is his speech good?

741
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:18,146
- Yes.
- Yes.

742
00:30:18,146 --> 00:30:18,646
Yes.

743
00:30:18,866 --> 00:30:19,985
But you're going off topic.

744
00:30:20,025 --> 00:30:20,946
I'll say it again.

745
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:22,586
Just tell everyone!

746
00:30:22,785 --> 00:30:24,146
Did you become the Secretary?

747
00:30:24,186 --> 00:30:25,745
- Don't rush!
- We want to know this.

748
00:30:25,785 --> 00:30:27,705
- Yes.
- Yes, this is the key point.

749
00:30:28,065 --> 00:30:29,025
Right?

750
00:30:30,626 --> 00:30:32,632
Yes. Just tell us.
Did you get the position?

751
00:30:32,785 --> 00:30:34,025
Be patient, you guys.

752
00:30:34,186 --> 00:30:35,545
Mr. Zheng, sit!

753
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:36,386
Listen to him.

754
00:30:36,505 --> 00:30:37,225
- Sit down.
- Did you?

755
00:30:37,225 --> 00:30:37,745
Come on.

756
00:30:38,666 --> 00:30:39,305
Well...

757
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:42,705
Well...

758
00:30:43,065 --> 00:30:43,985
Basically...

759
00:30:45,305 --> 00:30:46,225
That is to say...

760
00:30:48,186 --> 00:30:49,186
It's a done deal.

761
00:30:49,386 --> 00:30:49,985
Come on.

762
00:30:50,025 --> 00:30:50,745
Don't talk

763
00:30:50,785 --> 00:30:51,946
- with such dramatic pauses!
- Be straight!

764
00:30:52,146 --> 00:30:54,426
Why not just say yes to them?

765
00:30:54,465 --> 00:30:55,545
That's right.

766
00:30:55,666 --> 00:30:56,906
Don't say maybe.

767
00:30:56,906 --> 00:30:58,586
Is it basically confirmed?

768
00:30:58,906 --> 00:31:00,106
Or is it a done deal?

769
00:31:00,545 --> 00:31:01,586
Yes, what is it?

770
00:31:04,866 --> 00:31:05,586
Just say it.

771
00:31:05,745 --> 00:31:06,245
Exactly!

772
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,440
We're very eager to know.

773
00:31:08,826 --> 00:31:09,346
Mr. Zheng.

774
00:31:30,866 --> 00:31:31,705
Must be a done deal!

775
00:31:32,025 --> 00:31:35,985
- Great!
- Great!

776
00:31:36,745 --> 00:31:37,785
You guys, apologize to me!

777
00:31:37,985 --> 00:31:40,346
- Great!
- Great!

778
00:31:44,866 --> 00:31:45,826
Apologize!

779
00:31:45,866 --> 00:31:47,505
Who told you?

780
00:31:52,705 --> 00:31:53,465
The leaders!

781
00:31:53,505 --> 00:31:54,426
Make way!

782
00:31:54,826 --> 00:31:55,846
Mr. Zhao!

783
00:31:55,846 --> 00:31:56,705
What brings you here?

784
00:31:57,426 --> 00:31:58,906
I'll introduce this man.

785
00:31:59,386 --> 00:32:01,946
This is Mr. Zhao,
Secretary of our county.

786
00:32:03,025 --> 00:32:04,065
- Mr. Xia, County Magistrate.
- Hello.

787
00:32:04,346 --> 00:32:05,946
Minister Guan and Li.

788
00:32:06,106 --> 00:32:08,465
And other leaders.
Let's give them a round of applause!

789
00:32:08,586 --> 00:32:10,065
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

790
00:32:16,505 --> 00:32:17,346
Everyone,

791
00:32:17,386 --> 00:32:18,866
where are you all from?

792
00:32:19,386 --> 00:32:20,505
I'm from Jiangku.

793
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:22,586
Sir, I'm from Jinshan.

794
00:32:23,065 --> 00:32:24,666
Sir, I'm from Beizhen.

795
00:32:24,946 --> 00:32:27,545
We all traveled for hours to get here.

796
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:28,045
True.

797
00:32:28,065 --> 00:32:29,065
We are locals.

798
00:32:29,465 --> 00:32:30,552
From a neighboring village.

799
00:32:30,785 --> 00:32:31,545
It's surprising

800
00:32:31,626 --> 00:32:33,426
that you came all the way here.

801
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:34,616
I have a question.

802
00:32:34,616 --> 00:32:38,745
Why do you follow Zheng Decheng
to Yuehai?

803
00:32:39,745 --> 00:32:41,346
It's very simple.

804
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:42,946
He can lead us to make money.

805
00:32:42,946 --> 00:32:43,946
Of course, we follow him.

806
00:32:44,106 --> 00:32:44,626
- Right?
- He's smart.

807
00:32:44,826 --> 00:32:45,666
- Yes.
- He's smart.

808
00:32:45,826 --> 00:32:47,586
He always thinks of common folks!

809
00:32:47,846 --> 00:32:48,346
Right?

810
00:32:48,346 --> 00:32:49,106
Yes.

811
00:32:49,146 --> 00:32:50,386
Sir, you know what?

812
00:32:50,465 --> 00:32:52,906
I'm timid. But Mr. Zheng is bold.

813
00:32:52,985 --> 00:32:54,025
He is way too bold.

814
00:32:54,025 --> 00:32:55,386
- Yes.
- Be quiet.

815
00:32:55,386 --> 00:32:56,265
Watch your words.

816
00:32:56,666 --> 00:32:57,626
I'm telling the truth.

817
00:32:58,505 --> 00:32:59,005
Be quiet!

818
00:32:59,065 --> 00:33:00,305
Sir, to be honest,

819
00:33:00,465 --> 00:33:02,785
following Mr. Zheng, we feel secure.

820
00:33:02,846 --> 00:33:03,346
Yes.

821
00:33:03,346 --> 00:33:04,386
- True.
- True.

822
00:33:05,106 --> 00:33:06,386
Fellow villagers!

823
00:33:06,705 --> 00:33:09,305
Those wanting to follow Zheng Decheng,
raise your hands.

824
00:33:09,426 --> 00:33:10,106
Yes.

825
00:33:10,386 --> 00:33:12,225
Those who want Mr. Zheng in Yuehai,

826
00:33:12,265 --> 00:33:13,465
raise your hands!

827
00:33:15,186 --> 00:33:15,866
Yes.

828
00:33:16,146 --> 00:33:16,666
Two hands up.

829
00:33:16,826 --> 00:33:19,265
- Surrendering?
- Two hands up.

830
00:33:19,346 --> 00:33:20,186
- Both hands?
- Surrendering?

831
00:33:20,426 --> 00:33:20,985
You disagree?

832
00:33:21,146 --> 00:33:21,826
One hand is fine.

833
00:33:21,826 --> 00:33:22,346
Raise.

834
00:33:32,225 --> 00:33:33,426
Let's discuss it in the car.

835
00:33:34,106 --> 00:33:34,606
Okay.

836
00:33:35,505 --> 00:33:36,946
We do need to discuss this properly.

837
00:33:39,545 --> 00:33:40,045
Decheng.

838
00:33:40,666 --> 00:33:42,446
Wait here and don't leave.

839
00:33:53,842 --> 00:33:57,367
(Get off First)

840
00:33:58,465 --> 00:33:58,985
Decheng.

841
00:34:00,946 --> 00:34:02,505
You're here too.

842
00:34:03,106 --> 00:34:04,626
Well...

843
00:34:04,946 --> 00:34:06,505
I want to talk to you about something.

844
00:34:09,226 --> 00:34:09,726
Sir.

845
00:34:12,545 --> 00:34:13,045
Okay.

846
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:15,025
Just go ahead.

847
00:34:17,426 --> 00:34:17,926
Well...

848
00:34:20,545 --> 00:34:22,226
Yuehai.

849
00:34:22,906 --> 00:34:23,786
Well...

850
00:34:24,426 --> 00:34:25,906
- Well...
- I know.

851
00:34:26,266 --> 00:34:28,786
You want to go to Yuehai too, right?

852
00:34:29,306 --> 00:34:29,906
Decheng.

853
00:34:30,585 --> 00:34:31,625
I must go

854
00:34:32,665 --> 00:34:33,585
to Yuehai.

855
00:34:33,866 --> 00:34:34,906
Look at the three of them.

856
00:34:35,426 --> 00:34:37,976
They still haven't found partners yet.

857
00:34:38,392 --> 00:34:40,185
My eldest son is already 28.

858
00:34:40,346 --> 00:34:41,386
My second son is 25.

859
00:34:42,025 --> 00:34:43,826
My third son is already 18.

860
00:34:44,465 --> 00:34:45,985
If they keep staying in the village,

861
00:34:46,105 --> 00:34:47,866
my family line will die out.

862
00:34:48,465 --> 00:34:49,346
So, I think

863
00:34:49,946 --> 00:34:52,706
if they had urban residency,

864
00:34:53,266 --> 00:34:55,465
it would be easier
for them to find a wife.

865
00:34:59,266 --> 00:34:59,946
Decheng.

866
00:35:02,826 --> 00:35:04,465
Could you

867
00:35:05,706 --> 00:35:07,145
lend me some money?

868
00:35:08,585 --> 00:35:09,906
I'll write you an IOU.

869
00:35:10,665 --> 00:35:11,985
What are you talking about?

870
00:35:12,306 --> 00:35:14,105
If you need money, I'll give it to you.

871
00:35:14,266 --> 00:35:16,985
No, that won't do.
I must write you an IOU.

872
00:35:17,145 --> 00:35:18,226
I'll write it.

873
00:35:18,266 --> 00:35:19,386
No, I'll give it to you.

874
00:35:19,946 --> 00:35:20,786
I'll give it to you.

875
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:22,746
Just listen to me. I'll write the IOU.

876
00:35:23,465 --> 00:35:24,866
I'm begging you.

877
00:35:25,185 --> 00:35:25,786
Write the IOU.

878
00:35:27,665 --> 00:35:29,465
Alright then. I'll listen to you.

879
00:35:29,946 --> 00:35:30,625
Do as you say.

880
00:35:31,025 --> 00:35:32,105
Write the IOU, okay?

881
00:35:32,105 --> 00:35:32,946
That's settled then.

882
00:35:34,145 --> 00:35:34,906
You may leave.

883
00:35:35,185 --> 00:35:35,786
Okay.

884
00:35:36,706 --> 00:35:37,985
We'll get going now.

885
00:35:38,185 --> 00:35:38,706
We're off.

886
00:35:39,266 --> 00:35:40,516
Take our stool.

887
00:35:40,516 --> 00:35:41,266
Leave.

888
00:35:47,065 --> 00:35:47,565
Decheng.

889
00:35:48,426 --> 00:35:49,065
Come here.

890
00:35:54,346 --> 00:35:55,306
Keep this safe.

891
00:35:57,545 --> 00:35:58,306
Thank you.

892
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:01,906
If you build Yuehai well,
I'll bow to you.

893
00:36:02,306 --> 00:36:03,306
I'm humbled.

894
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:04,625
Truly.

895
00:36:15,946 --> 00:36:17,065
What did he mean?

896
00:36:17,665 --> 00:36:18,386
Work hard.

897
00:36:20,505 --> 00:36:22,226
Don't play dumb. It's you.

898
00:36:22,706 --> 00:36:24,145
You'll receive an appointment soon.

899
00:36:42,354 --> 00:36:43,786
(Beloved Wife Ma Suying)

900
00:36:43,786 --> 00:36:44,505
Suying.

901
00:36:46,306 --> 00:36:47,505
Dapeng is grown up now.

902
00:36:50,065 --> 00:36:50,985
Our son

903
00:36:52,145 --> 00:36:52,906
has been good.

904
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:54,185
Rest in peace.

905
00:36:55,866 --> 00:36:56,985
I'm good too.

906
00:36:58,625 --> 00:36:59,426
I came

907
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:02,065
to tell you some good news.

908
00:37:03,585 --> 00:37:04,266
We are

909
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:06,906
building a city in this place.

910
00:37:07,545 --> 00:37:08,786
We will

911
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:12,105
have what big cities have,
like tall buildings,

912
00:37:12,946 --> 00:37:14,025
roads, and cars.

913
00:37:15,386 --> 00:37:16,226
And hospitals.

914
00:37:42,386 --> 00:37:43,386
Where did you get a car?

915
00:37:44,065 --> 00:37:45,112
From the newspaper.

916
00:37:45,112 --> 00:37:47,128
Only I have a license,
so they let me drive it.

917
00:37:52,754 --> 00:37:54,904
(Our daughter lost the election.)

918
00:38:05,145 --> 00:38:07,226
Alright. My parents are home.

919
00:38:08,346 --> 00:38:09,426
My parents are home.

920
00:38:09,426 --> 00:38:10,834
(Our daughter lost the election.)

921
00:38:23,314 --> 00:38:25,826
(Our daughter lost the election.
Happy now?)

922
00:38:25,826 --> 00:38:27,625
They're arguing again?

923
00:38:33,306 --> 00:38:33,826
Mom.

924
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:37,125
Dad.

925
00:38:37,426 --> 00:38:38,346
Du Tao is here.

926
00:38:38,786 --> 00:38:40,665
Sir, madam, I came to see you.

927
00:38:41,545 --> 00:38:42,465
Tao, you're here.

928
00:38:43,386 --> 00:38:45,145
You have a seat. I'll be right there.

929
00:38:45,505 --> 00:38:46,145
Okay.

930
00:38:47,465 --> 00:38:48,185
Tao, you're here.

931
00:38:48,465 --> 00:38:49,266
Yes, sir.

932
00:38:50,585 --> 00:38:51,085
Sir.

933
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:52,125
- Tao.
- Long time no see.

934
00:38:52,226 --> 00:38:53,545
Yes, long time.

935
00:38:53,786 --> 00:38:54,585
Come and sit.

936
00:38:54,826 --> 00:38:55,386
Okay.

937
00:38:55,426 --> 00:38:56,306
Sir.

938
00:38:56,465 --> 00:38:57,786
I brought you some things.

939
00:38:57,946 --> 00:38:59,266
The famous tea, Longjing,

940
00:38:59,746 --> 00:39:02,465
cigarettes, liquor, coffee, and such.

941
00:39:02,585 --> 00:39:03,346
All you like.

942
00:39:03,426 --> 00:39:04,306
Thank you.

943
00:39:04,465 --> 00:39:06,105
I'm glad you could come.

944
00:39:06,826 --> 00:39:07,465
Tao.

945
00:39:08,226 --> 00:39:08,726
Madam.

946
00:39:08,826 --> 00:39:09,665
Long time no see.

947
00:39:09,665 --> 00:39:10,266
Long time.

948
00:39:10,266 --> 00:39:11,505
You look younger.

949
00:39:12,306 --> 00:39:12,946
Hold on.

950
00:39:13,145 --> 00:39:16,585
I brought you a silk scarf
with Suzhou embroidery,

951
00:39:16,946 --> 00:39:19,025
a round fan, and some royal jelly.

952
00:39:19,266 --> 00:39:20,985
- Try them all later.
- Tao,

953
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:21,866
you're so kind.

954
00:39:21,946 --> 00:39:23,266
I love everything you bought.

955
00:39:23,746 --> 00:39:24,426
That's good.

956
00:39:24,545 --> 00:39:25,065
Please sit.

957
00:39:25,226 --> 00:39:26,226
Okay.

958
00:39:27,025 --> 00:39:27,525
Qiuping.

959
00:39:28,226 --> 00:39:28,726
Come.

960
00:39:29,985 --> 00:39:30,786
A gift for me too?

961
00:39:31,025 --> 00:39:31,525
Yes.

962
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:32,286
Look,

963
00:39:33,025 --> 00:39:34,025
my friend helped buy it.

964
00:39:34,145 --> 00:39:36,105
It's tailored to your measurements.

965
00:39:36,226 --> 00:39:36,746
- Really?
- Also,

966
00:39:37,346 --> 00:39:38,625
this bag is for you.

967
00:39:40,065 --> 00:39:40,665
Thank you.

968
00:39:41,065 --> 00:39:41,866
See if you like it.

969
00:39:42,826 --> 00:39:43,465
I like it.

970
00:39:44,545 --> 00:39:45,226
Tao.

971
00:39:45,625 --> 00:39:46,185
Madam.

972
00:39:46,585 --> 00:39:47,985
This fan must be expensive, right?

973
00:39:48,545 --> 00:39:50,465
As long as you like it,
the cost doesn't matter.

974
00:39:50,826 --> 00:39:53,386
Do you think this scarf looks nice?

975
00:39:54,866 --> 00:39:55,786
It suits me perfectly.

976
00:39:56,585 --> 00:39:57,085
I know.

977
00:39:57,545 --> 00:39:59,665
(A three-foot sword hung at his waist.)

978
00:39:59,706 --> 00:40:02,105
(Astride a blue-maned steed,)

979
00:40:02,465 --> 00:40:05,346
(wielding a pair of iron maces.
Standing there,)

980
00:40:05,465 --> 00:40:08,065
(he looks like a vajra
or a smoke-blackened deity.)

981
00:40:08,145 --> 00:40:09,826
(It's Yue Fei's second junior brother.)

982
00:40:10,145 --> 00:40:11,866
(The second brother, Niu Gao.)

983
00:40:12,746 --> 00:40:15,346
(The officer
on the right is nine feet tall,)

984
00:40:15,786 --> 00:40:17,346
(wearing a mottled curled helmet,)

985
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:20,706
(with five back-flags
fluttering in the wind.)

986
00:40:20,746 --> 00:40:23,306
(Clad in golden armor
beneath a blue robe...)

987
00:40:23,346 --> 00:40:24,786
Did you try on that outfit?

988
00:40:25,426 --> 00:40:28,346
You need to dress well
on your first day in the office.

989
00:40:29,185 --> 00:40:30,306
No need to try it.

990
00:40:30,985 --> 00:40:31,906
It's alright.

991
00:40:32,786 --> 00:40:33,505
What?

992
00:40:34,025 --> 00:40:35,505
What a nice outfit!

993
00:40:36,746 --> 00:40:37,560
Leave for a moment.

994
00:40:38,226 --> 00:40:38,726
Okay.

995
00:40:47,306 --> 00:40:48,786
You put it here?

996
00:40:49,585 --> 00:40:50,866
Quite surprising.

997
00:40:51,545 --> 00:40:52,105
Well...

998
00:41:17,665 --> 00:41:20,265
This is all we have. You know it.

999
00:41:20,536 --> 00:41:21,266
Gao Xuemei.

1000
00:41:22,185 --> 00:41:22,685
Yes!

1001
00:41:22,985 --> 00:41:24,226
Shake my hand enthusiastically.

1002
00:41:25,985 --> 00:41:28,706
Mayor Xie, welcome to inspect my work.

1003
00:41:28,906 --> 00:41:29,826
Alright, good.

1004
00:41:31,746 --> 00:41:34,886
I'm about to take office
at the town government.

1005
00:41:35,185 --> 00:41:37,025
So today, I'm formally instructing you.

1006
00:41:37,706 --> 00:41:39,185
You should say, "at your service."

1007
00:41:39,346 --> 00:41:40,145
At your service.

1008
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:43,025
Today,

1009
00:41:43,746 --> 00:41:46,985
I officially appoint you
as director of Chunmei Printery.

1010
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:53,706
But am I qualified?

1011
00:41:53,906 --> 00:41:54,585
Or hand it back.

1012
00:41:55,266 --> 00:41:55,985
I can do it!

1013
00:41:55,985 --> 00:41:56,906
- Can you?
- Yes!

1014
00:41:56,906 --> 00:41:57,505
Can you do it?

1015
00:41:57,786 --> 00:41:59,625
Sure, I can.

1016
00:41:59,625 --> 00:42:00,185
How?

1017
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:02,585
- Well...
- Manage our home well.

1018
00:42:03,665 --> 00:42:06,306
We earned the money together.

1019
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:07,465
- Right?
- Yes.

1020
00:42:07,746 --> 00:42:09,665
Spending money is easy, right?

1021
00:42:10,105 --> 00:42:11,160
Handling money is not.

1022
00:42:11,906 --> 00:42:12,906
Don't worry.

1023
00:42:13,185 --> 00:42:14,866
You charge ahead on the front lines,

1024
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:16,746
while I'll guard the money in the rear.

1025
00:42:17,346 --> 00:42:18,426
Count it every single day!

1026
00:42:18,545 --> 00:42:19,145
Okay.

1027
00:42:20,065 --> 00:42:20,625
By the way,

1028
00:42:21,065 --> 00:42:22,906
since you're becoming the town mayor,

1029
00:42:23,105 --> 00:42:24,746
the salary should increase, right?

1030
00:42:25,985 --> 00:42:28,266
Salary increase?
All you think about is money!

1031
00:42:28,706 --> 00:42:29,826
Are you obsessed with money?

1032
00:42:30,786 --> 00:42:31,826
You're the director.

1033
00:42:32,105 --> 00:42:32,665
- Right?
- Yes.

1034
00:42:32,906 --> 00:42:34,145
Not only are you the director,

1035
00:42:34,306 --> 00:42:36,105
but you're also the town mayor's family.

1036
00:42:36,706 --> 00:42:37,206
Yes.

1037
00:42:37,426 --> 00:42:38,665
Watch your words and actions.

1038
00:42:38,786 --> 00:42:39,826
Okay.

1039
00:42:40,346 --> 00:42:41,226
The password...

1040
00:42:41,465 --> 00:42:42,266
- Listen...
- I know it.

1041
00:42:45,346 --> 00:42:46,386
Our marriage date, right?

1042
00:42:46,985 --> 00:42:48,145
Never change it.

1043
00:42:48,625 --> 00:42:49,185
Lock it.

1044
00:42:50,465 --> 00:42:51,105
Don't worry.

1045
00:42:51,266 --> 00:42:53,665
I won't fail your guidance.

1046
00:42:55,746 --> 00:42:56,386
What guidance?

1047
00:42:57,786 --> 00:42:58,625
You're a natural.

1048
00:42:59,545 --> 00:43:00,984
