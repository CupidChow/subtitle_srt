=Episode 27=

16
00:01:38,418 --> 00:01:39,379
A while back,

17
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:41,338
you secured an eight-million-yuan loan

18
00:01:41,739 --> 00:01:44,179
in the town government's name
for the industrial park.

19
00:01:44,778 --> 00:01:45,659
Is that true?

20
00:01:46,338 --> 00:01:48,938
Sure. Road is a vital component
of urban infrastructure.

21
00:01:49,778 --> 00:01:50,778
Is there an issue?

22
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:52,418
The industrial park

23
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:54,418
was spearheaded by Gao Xuemei,

24
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,099
director of Chunmei Printery
and wife of Xie Chunlai.

25
00:01:58,698 --> 00:02:00,259
So, the town government stepped in

26
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:02,179
to secure the loan and build the road,

27
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:06,058
which must surely be related

28
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:07,578
to Mr. Xie's wife.

29
00:02:07,698 --> 00:02:09,578
Is my understanding correct?

30
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:13,099
If you mean Ms. Gao,
director of the printery, then yes.

31
00:02:13,418 --> 00:02:15,418
But if you mean Mr. Xie's wife,

32
00:02:15,578 --> 00:02:18,018
then no. Frankly, there's no connection.

33
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:24,379
Take a look.

34
00:02:25,138 --> 00:02:27,259
Do you recognize this TV set?

35
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:30,138
Of course.
It belongs to our town government.

36
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:32,779
Qian Changyuan wanted
to give it to the government,

37
00:02:32,779 --> 00:02:34,858
but we all felt it was too valuable.

38
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:37,259
So, the town government paid

39
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:38,939
to buy this TV set.

40
00:02:39,298 --> 00:02:40,184
How much did it cost?

41
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:41,219
800 yuan.

42
00:02:43,738 --> 00:02:44,779
We've done some surveys.

43
00:02:45,178 --> 00:02:45,898
Take a look.

44
00:02:46,339 --> 00:02:49,099
This imported 18-inch color TV set

45
00:02:49,659 --> 00:02:52,458
cost at least 2,000 yuan back then.

46
00:02:53,059 --> 00:02:53,779
So,

47
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:56,458
why did Qian Changyuan
only charge you 800?

48
00:02:57,779 --> 00:02:58,379
Really?

49
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:02,379
But that was the price
Qian Changyuan quoted.

50
00:03:02,499 --> 00:03:03,578
He said it was secondhand.

51
00:03:04,339 --> 00:03:05,018
Ms. Li,

52
00:03:05,499 --> 00:03:07,779
I don't know
if you ever did any market research.

53
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:11,858
Buying this
two-thousand-yuan color TV set

54
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:13,539
required a TV purchase coupon.

55
00:03:14,858 --> 00:03:17,458
Even then,
it was hard to buy it on the market.

56
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:18,939
No secondhand ones at all.

57
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:21,578
I've already stated

58
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:24,219
I truly didn't
know the TV set's actual price.

59
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:26,779
Qian Changyuan is a well-known salesman
in town.

60
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:28,298
He has many sourcing channels.

61
00:03:28,618 --> 00:03:31,219
So we never questioned his word.

62
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:32,339
Of course,

63
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:35,018
if the TV set really cost
what you claimed,

64
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:37,939
it was indeed our oversight
and work error.

65
00:03:38,898 --> 00:03:40,059
Once I figure out the truth,

66
00:03:40,298 --> 00:03:43,339
the town government
will cover the price difference.

67
00:03:46,499 --> 00:03:48,898
This isn't about the difference.
Don't downplay the issue.

68
00:03:49,738 --> 00:03:51,819
Listen, is this
an under-the-table agreement

69
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,379
between Zheng Decheng
and the self-employed individuals?

70
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:56,178
And besides the TV set,

71
00:03:57,578 --> 00:03:58,259
any other stuff?

72
00:03:58,618 --> 00:04:00,138
No under-the-table agreements at all.

73
00:04:00,499 --> 00:04:01,259
Li Qiuping,

74
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:03,898
please be honest.

75
00:04:04,298 --> 00:04:05,499
I've been quite honest.

76
00:04:06,298 --> 00:04:09,018
Mr. Liu Weimin, forgive my bluntness,

77
00:04:09,339 --> 00:04:11,379
but how is
the investigation progressing?

78
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,939
The whole of Yuehai is at a standstill.

79
00:04:14,418 --> 00:04:16,058
Yet you're fixated on a TV set,

80
00:04:16,178 --> 00:04:18,058
relentlessly hounding our government.

81
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:19,979
If this drags on much longer

82
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:22,219
and Yuehai's economy suffers,

83
00:04:22,618 --> 00:04:24,298
can you take responsibility for that?

84
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:34,099
They grilled me
about this TV set for ages.

85
00:04:36,219 --> 00:04:37,208
They asked me too.

86
00:04:39,224 --> 00:04:40,219
They asked everyone.

87
00:04:43,418 --> 00:04:44,579
Who would've thought

88
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:46,938
one TV set could cause so much trouble?

89
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:48,699
So what now?

90
00:04:50,178 --> 00:04:51,539
I can't dismantle it.

91
00:04:54,219 --> 00:04:55,539
Maybe

92
00:04:55,539 --> 00:04:57,240
we could sell the TV set?

93
00:04:58,039 --> 00:04:58,659
Good idea.

94
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:01,738
That would make us look more suspicious.

95
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:05,139
Forget selling it.
We should just watch it.

96
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:07,899
We've only ever watched the news.

97
00:05:08,618 --> 00:05:09,118
Right.

98
00:05:41,418 --> 00:05:42,099
Mr. Zheng.

99
00:05:53,378 --> 00:05:54,779
Ms. Li, I'm sorry

100
00:05:54,858 --> 00:05:55,738
to trouble you.

101
00:05:56,099 --> 00:05:58,258
We can't make it clear on the phone.
What happened?

102
00:05:58,339 --> 00:05:58,938
Is it serious?

103
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:01,738
Dapeng broke Cai Jun's arm,
the son of Director Cai.

104
00:06:01,798 --> 00:06:03,019
He's still hospitalized.

105
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:04,472
What did Director Cai say?

106
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:05,699
Gaokao is around,

107
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,858
so Director Cai is furious.

108
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:09,058
He said
if this affects his son's exam results,

109
00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:10,264
Dapeng won't get off easy.

110
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:12,258
I pleaded every way I could,

111
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:13,818
but Director Cai refused to settle.

112
00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:14,899
Decheng isn't here.

113
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:16,418
I have to ask you for help.

114
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:18,099
Why did Dapeng fight Cai Jun?

115
00:06:18,618 --> 00:06:20,378
Dapeng is quite stubborn.

116
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:21,699
He refused to tell me.

117
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:25,298
Dapeng knows
about Mr. Zheng's situation?

118
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:26,418
He must know.

119
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,539
News has been spread everywhere.

120
00:06:28,738 --> 00:06:29,779
Where is Dapeng now?

121
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:30,659
I locked him in.

122
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:32,339
He's in there.

123
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:34,258
Right here.

124
00:06:39,818 --> 00:06:40,339
Dapeng!

125
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:43,219
Dapeng!

126
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,279
Come on. Chase him!

127
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:49,938
Zheng Dapeng!

128
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:51,699
Zheng Dapeng!

129
00:06:52,298 --> 00:06:52,798
Zheng...

130
00:06:53,498 --> 00:06:53,998
Stop!

131
00:06:54,858 --> 00:06:55,539
Zheng Dapeng!

132
00:06:55,858 --> 00:06:56,358
Stop.

133
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:57,019
Stop there!

134
00:06:57,339 --> 00:06:58,818
Let me go!

135
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,938
You caused trouble and ran away?
Is that what your dad taught you?

136
00:07:01,938 --> 00:07:03,938
Why are you bringing my dad into this?

137
00:07:04,058 --> 00:07:05,298
Now you defend your dad?

138
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,258
What were you thinking when you fought?

139
00:07:07,258 --> 00:07:08,579
Do you realize how serious it is?

140
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:10,459
I'm 18! I'll do whatever I want!

141
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:11,738
Mind your own business!

142
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:13,058
So you know you're 18?

143
00:07:13,418 --> 00:07:16,019
As an adult,
take responsibility for your actions.

144
00:07:16,298 --> 00:07:17,496
If you hit someone, apologize.

145
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:19,178
Don't you
understand such a simple thing?

146
00:07:19,298 --> 00:07:21,258
Do all cadres chatter like you?

147
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:26,839
Get up.

148
00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:27,979
Come on, get up.

149
00:07:28,088 --> 00:07:28,899
Where are you going?

150
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:29,539
- Let go!
- Tell me!

151
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:31,219
Get out of here! I'm not apologizing.

152
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:33,779
Ma Weidong, I'll talk to Dapeng.

153
00:07:34,058 --> 00:07:34,659
You may leave.

154
00:07:34,738 --> 00:07:36,258
Ms. Li, you don't know him well.

155
00:07:36,258 --> 00:07:36,938
He's sly.

156
00:07:37,219 --> 00:07:39,019
You called me here,
yet you don't trust me?

157
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:42,258
Fine, I trust you.

158
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:44,019
You talk to him then.

159
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:46,219
Behave! I mean it.

160
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:49,899
Pick up your textbooks.

161
00:07:54,514 --> 00:07:57,938
(A bad father has a bad son)

162
00:07:57,938 --> 00:07:58,659
Who wrote this?

163
00:07:59,099 --> 00:07:59,938
What's it to you?

164
00:08:00,082 --> 00:08:00,920
(Motherless Child)

165
00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:03,938
Why are you so hostile?

166
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:07,579
You're hurt too.

167
00:08:09,178 --> 00:08:11,099
Tell me what really happened.

168
00:08:11,938 --> 00:08:14,019
What's the point? I still got beaten.

169
00:08:14,418 --> 00:08:15,979
Telling me will help.

170
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:26,899
Mom, this food tastes awful.

171
00:08:28,498 --> 00:08:29,752
Can you peel an apple for me?

172
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:31,899
Peel an apple for our son.

173
00:08:31,938 --> 00:08:33,099
Shut it! Forget about apples!

174
00:08:34,258 --> 00:08:34,758
Get up!

175
00:08:35,778 --> 00:08:36,538
Back off!

176
00:08:39,258 --> 00:08:40,498
Finish your meal!

177
00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:42,179
Couldn't win a fight? No apples for you!

178
00:08:42,618 --> 00:08:43,118
Eat!

179
00:08:59,299 --> 00:08:59,858
Come in.

180
00:09:02,618 --> 00:09:03,299
Mr. Cai.

181
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,138
Ms. Li.

182
00:09:08,099 --> 00:09:08,939
Here to apologize?

183
00:09:09,979 --> 00:09:10,479
No need.

184
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:12,138
I won't accept it.

185
00:09:12,979 --> 00:09:15,419
I've told the school
to deal with this severely.

186
00:09:15,979 --> 00:09:17,179
Gaokao is around.

187
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:18,919
Look,

188
00:09:19,858 --> 00:09:21,339
my son is beaten up like this.

189
00:09:21,819 --> 00:09:23,059
If he can't take the exam,

190
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,600
Zheng Dapeng won't take it, either.

191
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:25,898
Exactly.

192
00:09:26,258 --> 00:09:27,498
You'll get expelled.

193
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:33,378
Mr. Cai, Mrs. Cai,
I think you misunderstood.

194
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:36,579
I didn't bring Dapeng to apologize.

195
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:39,658
Then why are you here?

196
00:09:39,939 --> 00:09:41,018
To make Cai Jun apologize.

197
00:09:42,618 --> 00:09:43,459
Are you crazy?

198
00:09:44,138 --> 00:09:46,099
He beat my son!
Why should my son apologize?

199
00:09:46,538 --> 00:09:47,699
What nonsense!

200
00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:54,378
Shut the door.

201
00:09:59,419 --> 00:10:00,658
As Cai Jun's parents,

202
00:10:01,658 --> 00:10:03,579
(A bad father has a bad son)
you recognize his handwriting, right?

203
00:10:04,658 --> 00:10:06,179
Of course, if you don't recognize it,

204
00:10:06,538 --> 00:10:08,059
we can ask his teacher.

205
00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:10,219
Let's see how many insults

206
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:13,819
on these textbooks were written
by Cai Jun.

207
00:10:14,979 --> 00:10:17,179
Cai Jun has long bullied
and insulted Zheng Dapeng.

208
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:18,618
He spread lies.

209
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:21,179
Eventually,
Dapeng reported him to a teacher.

210
00:10:21,618 --> 00:10:22,778
Cai Jun, mad and humiliated,

211
00:10:23,219 --> 00:10:25,419
incited thugs to beat Zheng Dapeng.

212
00:10:25,738 --> 00:10:26,579
What thugs?

213
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:30,459
Li Qiuping, show me your proof!

214
00:10:30,738 --> 00:10:31,979
You're slandering my son!

215
00:10:33,979 --> 00:10:35,618
Here's testimony from witnesses

216
00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:38,339
(Testimony)
who saw them hitting Zheng Dapeng.

217
00:10:39,018 --> 00:10:41,258
He can confirm the entire event.

218
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:43,979
Of course, if you don't believe us,

219
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:46,618
we can go to the police station
right now to file a report.

220
00:10:47,099 --> 00:10:49,699
We can have the witness testify
in front of the police.

221
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:53,912
(Witness Signature: Zhang Xicai)

222
00:11:02,299 --> 00:11:03,099
Right there.

223
00:11:04,658 --> 00:11:05,378
Beat him!

224
00:11:12,658 --> 00:11:13,158
Buddy.

225
00:11:13,538 --> 00:11:14,378
Pick him up!

226
00:11:18,498 --> 00:11:19,778
What a bold guy!

227
00:11:20,219 --> 00:11:21,498
You told the teacher on me, huh?

228
00:11:25,979 --> 00:11:27,059
Stop looking! Get inside!

229
00:11:27,138 --> 00:11:27,638
Get lost!

230
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:32,758
My hand!

231
00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:00,419
The police...

232
00:12:00,939 --> 00:12:01,819
No, what police?

233
00:12:02,498 --> 00:12:03,498
File a report?

234
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:04,599
By the way,

235
00:12:04,898 --> 00:12:06,778
Cai Jun is already 18, right?

236
00:12:10,658 --> 00:12:12,979
Mr. Cai, as an adult,

237
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:16,258
he should face the consequences
for his actions

238
00:12:16,498 --> 00:12:19,059
and bear the corresponding civil
and criminal liabilities.

239
00:12:19,378 --> 00:12:19,979
Of course,

240
00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:22,538
besides the illegal record
in the public security system,

241
00:12:23,138 --> 00:12:25,699
all of this will also appear
in his permanent record.

242
00:12:26,099 --> 00:12:27,378
It will follow him for life.

243
00:12:27,858 --> 00:12:29,219
A permanent record?

244
00:12:29,738 --> 00:12:30,819
This isn't real, is it?

245
00:12:32,778 --> 00:12:34,419
- Is it true?
- Shut up!

246
00:12:37,979 --> 00:12:38,819
Back off!

247
00:12:44,378 --> 00:12:46,059
Did you write those words in the book?

248
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:48,498
Did you go find those thugs?

249
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:50,618
They're not thugs.

250
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,778
They graduated from my school.

251
00:12:54,099 --> 00:12:54,599
Get down!

252
00:12:55,219 --> 00:12:57,778
No need to wear shoes? Barefoot!

253
00:13:03,018 --> 00:13:03,979
Apologize to Dapeng.

254
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:06,799
Right now!

255
00:13:07,299 --> 00:13:08,419
Or I'll beat you to death!

256
00:13:13,778 --> 00:13:14,299
I'm sorry.

257
00:13:15,979 --> 00:13:16,738
I was wrong.

258
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,179
I won't do it again.

259
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:30,099
Ms. Li,

260
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:31,059
well,

261
00:13:31,658 --> 00:13:33,179
he's just a kid, making a mistake.

262
00:13:34,819 --> 00:13:36,498
Since he's already apologized,

263
00:13:38,538 --> 00:13:39,498
let's just let this go.

264
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:43,898
Mr. Cai, I can't decide.

265
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:46,579
You make the decision.

266
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,858
Whatever you decide, I'll support you.

267
00:13:56,898 --> 00:13:57,498
Ms. Li,

268
00:13:58,299 --> 00:13:59,618
no, Qiuping,

269
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,018
can I call you Qiuping?

270
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:04,258
Sure, but that would
make your dad my uncle.

271
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:06,858
Qiuping, very impressive!

272
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:08,979
You really learned from my dad.

273
00:14:09,219 --> 00:14:11,099
The way you talk

274
00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:12,138
is like your dad.

275
00:14:13,618 --> 00:14:14,579
So, tell me.

276
00:14:15,138 --> 00:14:17,618
Why did you choose
to forgive Cai Jun in the end?

277
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:22,059
Well, when his dad hit him,

278
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:23,459
he looked so pitiful.

279
00:14:23,618 --> 00:14:25,378
But weren't you pitiful too
when he hit you?

280
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:27,138
Your heart softened?

281
00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:28,618
I don't believe that.

282
00:14:31,018 --> 00:14:33,059
My dad told me not
to push a defeated enemy.

283
00:14:33,738 --> 00:14:35,498
Now, I have leverage over Cai Jun.

284
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:37,419
He won't mess with me again.

285
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:39,299
But if I filed a report,

286
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:40,419
giving him a record,

287
00:14:42,018 --> 00:14:44,018
he might become desperate.

288
00:14:44,498 --> 00:14:46,219
Who knows what trouble
he might cause then?

289
00:14:48,099 --> 00:14:49,138
You're right.

290
00:14:50,858 --> 00:14:53,339
So, problem solved now.

291
00:14:53,658 --> 00:14:54,738
I take you back to school?

292
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:56,898
No need. School's closed these days.

293
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,219
I'll study for exams at home.

294
00:15:00,258 --> 00:15:00,939
Qiuping,

295
00:15:02,979 --> 00:15:04,059
can I go to Yuehai?

296
00:15:16,618 --> 00:15:18,939
I bought some reference books
and left them on your desk.

297
00:15:19,498 --> 00:15:21,738
If you need anything else,
I can buy it tomorrow.

298
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:22,939
I don't need anything.

299
00:15:23,219 --> 00:15:24,059
Thanks, Qiuping.

300
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,219
The town cadres have scheduled shifts.

301
00:15:27,378 --> 00:15:29,979
Each person will spare some time
every day to study with you.

302
00:15:30,618 --> 00:15:32,138
If you have any daily needs

303
00:15:32,219 --> 00:15:33,898
or questions about your studies,

304
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,179
you can tell any of them.

305
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:37,138
I have no problem with studying.

306
00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:40,538
Brag after you get into university.

307
00:15:41,898 --> 00:15:43,419
We're done with the construction fee.

308
00:15:44,099 --> 00:15:44,858
Well,

309
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:46,419
once we have the money,

310
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:48,099
we can build the city.

311
00:15:48,979 --> 00:15:49,939
But who'd have thought

312
00:15:50,618 --> 00:15:53,498
building the city
would bring even more trouble?

313
00:15:55,099 --> 00:15:56,819
Mr. Zheng, please stop talking.

314
00:15:57,219 --> 00:15:57,858
We have rules.

315
00:15:58,059 --> 00:16:00,138
During the investigation,
I can't converse with you.

316
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:03,099
So many rules!

317
00:16:04,498 --> 00:16:05,738
Your answer is correct.

318
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:09,059
But there's a small issue, Dapeng.

319
00:16:09,378 --> 00:16:10,179
I'm a neat man.

320
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,258
For some reason, I brush my teeth

321
00:16:13,979 --> 00:16:15,179
twice a day.

322
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:16,559
Sir.

323
00:16:17,138 --> 00:16:20,299
We want to build
a new factory in this area.

324
00:16:20,658 --> 00:16:21,939
This plot is off the table.

325
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:22,459
We...

326
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:23,339
Your mom took it!

327
00:16:23,738 --> 00:16:24,979
Keep arguing!

328
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:25,518
Go on!

329
00:16:25,579 --> 00:16:26,339
Fight!

330
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:27,219
Go on, fight!

331
00:16:27,538 --> 00:16:28,038
Fight!

332
00:16:28,219 --> 00:16:29,219
- Without...
- Grab your weapons.

333
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:30,099
Come on, fight!

334
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:30,898
Use this!

335
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:32,219
Yes, grab your tools!

336
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:33,339
Problem solved.

337
00:16:34,099 --> 00:16:35,339
Fight back!

338
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:36,419
Right?

339
00:16:36,778 --> 00:16:37,278
Right?

340
00:16:38,138 --> 00:16:39,459
I can tell it's serious.

341
00:16:40,898 --> 00:16:42,819
Come on, let me sort this out for you.

342
00:16:43,018 --> 00:16:44,258
Your family

343
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,219
stacked unwanted stuff by the door.

344
00:16:46,419 --> 00:16:46,919
Then,

345
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:49,299
you think his mom took it away, right?

346
00:16:49,378 --> 00:16:50,339
He's talking nonsense!

347
00:16:50,378 --> 00:16:51,299
Yes, his mom took it!

348
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:52,099
That's the truth.

349
00:16:52,099 --> 00:16:53,699
I understand your dispute now.

350
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,538
Xie, listen to me.

351
00:16:55,898 --> 00:16:56,579
It's simple.

352
00:16:56,618 --> 00:16:58,059
Don't waste your breath.

353
00:16:58,419 --> 00:17:00,138
I'll call the city inspectors.

354
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,738
They'll supervise the cleanup
at their doors.

355
00:17:02,738 --> 00:17:03,378
Problem solved.

356
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,338
It's a very small thing.
No need for city inspectors!

357
00:17:06,399 --> 00:17:06,899
Xie.

358
00:17:06,899 --> 00:17:07,619
It's a trifle.

359
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:09,859
Our town government can handle this.

360
00:17:09,979 --> 00:17:11,959
I have my own way of solving problems.

361
00:17:11,979 --> 00:17:12,479
You have to

362
00:17:12,538 --> 00:17:13,899
feed and house city inspectors.

363
00:17:14,058 --> 00:17:15,498
My opinion is simple.

364
00:17:16,018 --> 00:17:16,979
I respect yours.

365
00:17:17,219 --> 00:17:18,098
We'll go back now.

366
00:17:18,098 --> 00:17:19,818
- We've known each other for years.
- We're old neighbors.

367
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:20,619
You came to me.

368
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:21,619
We'll go back now.

369
00:17:21,979 --> 00:17:23,498
The government will solve it for you.

370
00:17:24,219 --> 00:17:26,139
This could be a model case.

371
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:26,838
It's done?

372
00:17:27,058 --> 00:17:28,179
Sure. All settled.

373
00:17:31,498 --> 00:17:32,939
Winning without fighting!

374
00:17:32,979 --> 00:17:33,738
Truly impressive!

375
00:17:34,018 --> 00:17:34,538
Impressive!

376
00:17:35,659 --> 00:17:36,338
No big deal.

377
00:17:36,738 --> 00:17:39,338
Just Tan's usual approach.

378
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:41,058
Look, he and I were just coordinating.

379
00:17:41,818 --> 00:17:42,778
I figured it out.

380
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:44,338
My dad, Qiuping,

381
00:17:44,659 --> 00:17:45,778
you three deputy mayors,

382
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:47,578
plus Meng and Qingtian,

383
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:49,338
you guys are basically...

384
00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:50,619
What?

385
00:17:52,699 --> 00:17:54,139
The seven heroes of Yuehai!

386
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:17,459
Sir, you're awake?

387
00:18:17,699 --> 00:18:18,498
You're all here.

388
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:19,738
Just arrived.

389
00:18:19,738 --> 00:18:20,778
I overslept.

390
00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:24,459
Right now,

391
00:18:25,219 --> 00:18:27,578
let's summarize our findings.

392
00:18:27,778 --> 00:18:28,278
Okay.

393
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:29,058
Come on.

394
00:18:29,058 --> 00:18:29,558
Alright.

395
00:18:30,219 --> 00:18:30,939
- Here.
- Here.

396
00:18:34,659 --> 00:18:35,619
According to...

397
00:18:38,979 --> 00:18:41,139
According to Ma Weidong...

398
00:18:41,498 --> 00:18:43,619
Anyone hungry? Come grab some.

399
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:44,778
- Come on.
- Take one.

400
00:18:44,899 --> 00:18:45,816
You skipped breakfast.

401
00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:48,018
According to Ma Weidong,

402
00:18:49,258 --> 00:18:50,258
Zheng Decheng

403
00:18:50,298 --> 00:18:52,979
sends him money immediately
after getting paid each month.

404
00:18:53,338 --> 00:18:56,699
Part of that money
repays an old debt from turtle farming.

405
00:18:57,139 --> 00:18:59,979
The rest is his son's living expenses.

406
00:19:00,899 --> 00:19:01,859
Other than that,

407
00:19:02,139 --> 00:19:03,480
(Ma Weidong's testimony)
there are no other financial dealings

408
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,578
between them.

409
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:07,179
What did you find out?

410
00:19:09,379 --> 00:19:11,338
Any findings from the residents?

411
00:19:14,538 --> 00:19:15,038
What?

412
00:19:16,659 --> 00:19:17,778
Just say what you found.

413
00:19:18,498 --> 00:19:19,338
Well, sir,

414
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,018
we split into four teams.

415
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:23,379
We randomly interviewed workers
on Binhai Road,

416
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:26,018
residents in the shantytown,
villagers from Yang Village,

417
00:19:26,419 --> 00:19:28,419
and migrant workers from other places.

418
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:30,578
It's 424 people in total.

419
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:33,058
They specifically
mentioned the government

420
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:34,859
providing shelter
for them during typhoons,

421
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:37,979
securing technical job quotas for them,

422
00:19:38,338 --> 00:19:40,419
and participating in sanitation efforts.

423
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:42,219
During the Half-Month Talks,

424
00:19:42,338 --> 00:19:43,619
the people especially emphasized

425
00:19:43,778 --> 00:19:45,738
that Zheng Decheng
listened to their opinions.

426
00:19:46,578 --> 00:19:47,659
So, you're saying

427
00:19:48,738 --> 00:19:50,538
that among the people you interviewed,

428
00:19:52,018 --> 00:19:53,738
no one spoke ill of Zheng Decheng?

429
00:19:54,298 --> 00:19:54,798
Yes.

430
00:19:55,139 --> 00:19:57,899
Not only were there no complaints,
but everyone expressed gratitude.

431
00:19:58,419 --> 00:19:59,098
Sir, look,

432
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,498
this is our compiled interview record.

433
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:06,098
(Interview transcript)

434
00:20:12,818 --> 00:20:14,939
In all my years
doing investigative work,

435
00:20:16,699 --> 00:20:21,338
I've seen spouses turn against each other
and brothers become enemies.

436
00:20:21,979 --> 00:20:24,939
I've even seen fathers
and sons distrust each other,

437
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:27,738
let alone colleagues in the same office,

438
00:20:27,979 --> 00:20:29,939
who share neither kinship nor ties.

439
00:20:31,098 --> 00:20:33,459
But Yuehai is indeed special.

440
00:20:34,459 --> 00:20:36,939
While Zheng Decheng was
under investigation,

441
00:20:37,578 --> 00:20:40,379
all officials, including the deputy,

442
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:42,179
spoke up for him.

443
00:20:45,818 --> 00:20:47,058
Sir, what should we do next?

444
00:20:49,578 --> 00:20:51,699
Compile the findings faithfully,

445
00:20:51,979 --> 00:20:53,578
and then report them to the above.

446
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:54,619
Go for it!

447
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:55,459
(Pingchuan County First High School)
Do what you can first!

448
00:20:55,639 --> 00:20:56,139
Go for it!

449
00:20:56,139 --> 00:20:56,979
- Take it easy!
- Do the easy ones first!

450
00:20:56,979 --> 00:20:57,338
Okay.

451
00:20:57,338 --> 00:20:57,939
- Come on!
- Don't be nervous.

452
00:20:57,939 --> 00:20:58,498
Come on.

453
00:20:58,578 --> 00:20:59,379
Make way.

454
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:00,258
Go for it!

455
00:21:04,098 --> 00:21:04,598
Here.

456
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:05,598
Dapeng.

457
00:21:07,098 --> 00:21:07,818
Get some energy.

458
00:21:10,258 --> 00:21:12,098
You have your exam permit, right?

459
00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:13,379
I forgot it.

460
00:21:13,379 --> 00:21:14,699
What? Pencil and eraser?

461
00:21:15,058 --> 00:21:15,979
Relax, I was kidding.

462
00:21:15,979 --> 00:21:17,498
I'm going in. Too late to confirm now.

463
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:20,939
Trying to scare me, you rascal.

464
00:21:24,058 --> 00:21:26,018
Dapeng, remember what I told you.

465
00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:28,179
May you know all the correct answers.

466
00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:31,119
I'm leaving.

467
00:21:31,219 --> 00:21:31,719
No drink?

468
00:21:32,018 --> 00:21:32,518
No.

469
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:33,258
See you later.

470
00:21:33,778 --> 00:21:35,578
Go for it! Be careful!

471
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:40,939
You can enter now.

472
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:47,058
Sir, do me a favor.

473
00:21:50,298 --> 00:21:50,899
Dapeng.

474
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:55,160
(Wish Zheng Dapeng Immediate Success)

475
00:21:57,592 --> 00:22:04,536
(Tan Guangming, Meng Xiaoli, Yu Qingtian,
Li Qiuping, Xie Chunlai, Lin Dongfu, Zheng, Ma Weidong)

476
00:22:08,179 --> 00:22:08,899
Go for it!

477
00:22:10,659 --> 00:22:11,338
Go for it!

478
00:22:26,338 --> 00:22:28,139
Hello, this is Yuehai Town.

479
00:22:28,778 --> 00:22:29,778
Hello, Ms. Li.

480
00:22:30,939 --> 00:22:31,619
Mr. Zhao.

481
00:22:32,139 --> 00:22:34,338
I'm calling to tell you something.

482
00:22:35,659 --> 00:22:38,419
Frankly, I'm a bit guilty of liberalism.

483
00:22:38,939 --> 00:22:41,859
The investigation
into Zheng Decheng is basically over.

484
00:22:42,338 --> 00:22:44,258
The investigation materials
have been submitted,

485
00:22:44,538 --> 00:22:45,659
just for the record.

486
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,219
Okay, I got it, Mr. Zhao.

487
00:22:48,578 --> 00:22:49,859
Here's one more thing.

488
00:22:50,459 --> 00:22:52,219
I'm being transferred to Nanzhou.

489
00:22:53,578 --> 00:22:55,219
Congratulations on your promotion.

490
00:22:55,738 --> 00:22:57,179
You keep working hard

491
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:58,778
in Yuehai.

492
00:23:00,018 --> 00:23:00,859
Well,

493
00:23:01,419 --> 00:23:03,098
when Zheng Decheng returns,

494
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:05,619
please pass a message to him for me.

495
00:23:06,699 --> 00:23:07,219
Tell him

496
00:23:07,699 --> 00:23:10,538
to think twice before acting.

497
00:23:10,899 --> 00:23:12,498
Discuss things more between yourselves,

498
00:23:13,338 --> 00:23:14,058
and consult Xia.

499
00:23:14,538 --> 00:23:16,818
I've already advised Xia too.

500
00:23:17,098 --> 00:23:19,139
I see. Don't worry, Mr. Zhao.

501
00:23:19,459 --> 00:23:20,219
I know

502
00:23:20,738 --> 00:23:23,459
you've been under tremendous pressure.

503
00:23:23,818 --> 00:23:26,459
But encountering storms
on the path of development is normal.

504
00:23:26,899 --> 00:23:30,139
As long as you don't lose your way,
there's light at the end of the tunnel.

505
00:23:31,419 --> 00:23:32,219
Don't worry.

506
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:34,258
Whether Mr. Zheng or me,

507
00:23:34,419 --> 00:23:36,058
or anyone else in our town government,

508
00:23:36,338 --> 00:23:38,899
we'll remember our original aspirations
and not let you down.

509
00:23:39,219 --> 00:23:39,738
Good.

510
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:42,379
Then, keep in touch!

511
00:23:43,058 --> 00:23:44,399
Goodbye, Mr. Zhao.

512
00:23:44,939 --> 00:23:45,778
Keep in touch!

513
00:23:50,538 --> 00:23:51,139
Ms. Li,

514
00:23:52,179 --> 00:23:53,659
you look so happy. What happened?

515
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:54,659
Good news.

516
00:23:56,258 --> 00:23:57,699
The storm has passed.

517
00:24:15,018 --> 00:24:15,640
You're awake.

518
00:24:18,379 --> 00:24:19,498
Weimin, you're here.

519
00:24:20,699 --> 00:24:21,738
Continue the questioning?

520
00:24:22,538 --> 00:24:24,699
That's great! I'll go wash my face.

521
00:24:26,219 --> 00:24:27,338
Sorry, I can't feel my leg.

522
00:24:34,979 --> 00:24:35,778
Zheng Decheng.

523
00:24:36,818 --> 00:24:38,139
The investigation is over.

524
00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:41,298
You may go.

525
00:24:46,419 --> 00:24:48,018
The investigation is over?

526
00:24:49,538 --> 00:24:50,139
It's done?

527
00:24:53,778 --> 00:24:54,939
Shall we investigate further?

528
00:24:58,818 --> 00:25:01,619
(The investigation into Zheng Decheng
has finally concluded.)

529
00:25:02,818 --> 00:25:04,139
(The investigation results show)

530
00:25:04,338 --> 00:25:06,899
(Zheng Decheng
had no economic misconduct.)

531
00:25:07,818 --> 00:25:10,899
(Comrades from the DIC
explained the reasons and details)

532
00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:13,338
(to Zheng Decheng in full.)

533
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:16,179
(The higher-ups)

534
00:25:16,338 --> 00:25:20,179
(recognized Zheng Decheng's work
and Yuehai's development achievements.)

535
00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:22,899
(Amidst Reform and Opening-up,)

536
00:25:23,659 --> 00:25:25,778
(the nation has repealed
outdated regulations,)

537
00:25:26,699 --> 00:25:30,098
(ushering in the separation
of land ownership and use rights.)

538
00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:33,720
- (seven-up, eight-down became history.)
- Can I try that?

539
00:25:35,442 --> 00:25:35,979
Sure.

540
00:25:35,979 --> 00:25:38,338
(It's a fresh start.)

541
00:25:39,258 --> 00:25:40,098
(From then on,)

542
00:25:40,818 --> 00:25:42,859
(we all truly felt)

543
00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:46,419
(the wings
of development were fully unleashed.)

00:25:54,305 --> 00:25:58,265

Enjoy your meal.

550
00:26:19,939 --> 00:26:22,018
The investigators offered me food,

551
00:26:23,064 --> 00:26:24,088
but the food was bland.

552
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:26,498
The restaurant serves good food.

553
00:26:28,738 --> 00:26:30,139
You waited for me this early

554
00:26:31,498 --> 00:26:33,018
just to treat me to a meal?

555
00:26:36,459 --> 00:26:37,738
Because of my article,

556
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:39,939
you have been investigated for so long.

557
00:26:40,659 --> 00:26:41,338
Sorry about that.

558
00:26:47,459 --> 00:26:49,179
This drink is my apology.

559
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:52,152
To you and to Yuehai.

560
00:27:04,024 --> 00:27:05,498
I wrote the article,

561
00:27:06,538 --> 00:27:07,738
but that wasn't my intention.

562
00:27:08,459 --> 00:27:09,578
I needed that article.

563
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,659
Whatever your motive for writing it,

564
00:27:15,939 --> 00:27:17,538
it caused an investigation into me.

565
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:21,778
It gave me rare quiet time,

566
00:27:22,179 --> 00:27:23,619
so I no longer charged ahead blindly

567
00:27:24,738 --> 00:27:26,058
like before.

568
00:27:27,098 --> 00:27:29,018
I could reflect on the past

569
00:27:29,538 --> 00:27:31,139
and examine my flaws.

570
00:27:32,098 --> 00:27:34,018
I have many shortcomings

571
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:35,818
and even more to improve.

572
00:27:37,498 --> 00:27:37,998
Anyway,

573
00:27:39,379 --> 00:27:39,879
thank you

574
00:27:40,578 --> 00:27:41,738
for giving me thinking time.

575
00:27:47,939 --> 00:27:48,778
I have a question.

576
00:27:50,179 --> 00:27:51,018
You mentioned

577
00:27:52,219 --> 00:27:54,018
you didn't write about me personally.

578
00:27:55,179 --> 00:27:56,419
But you needed the article.

579
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:57,738
Why?

580
00:28:00,139 --> 00:28:01,219
I'll work in Shanghai.

581
00:28:11,578 --> 00:28:12,139
I see.

582
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:15,979
You used Yuehai

583
00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:18,459
as a stepping stone for your career.

584
00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:21,459
You're despicable!

585
00:28:23,419 --> 00:28:25,538
Yes, I'm despicable.

586
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:29,219
But if you hadn't
blocked my first article,

587
00:28:30,219 --> 00:28:31,419
I wouldn't have done this.

588
00:28:32,578 --> 00:28:33,659
We're even now.

589
00:28:34,058 --> 00:28:35,018
Even?

590
00:28:37,498 --> 00:28:39,058
Don't make excuses!

591
00:28:39,619 --> 00:28:42,258
True, I refused your stamp then.

592
00:28:42,979 --> 00:28:44,498
That was my personal debt.

593
00:28:45,139 --> 00:28:46,619
Not Yuehai's debt to you.

594
00:28:47,538 --> 00:28:49,419
You think you only hurt me?

595
00:28:49,899 --> 00:28:51,818
You hurt every resident of Yuehai!

596
00:28:52,459 --> 00:28:53,379
You knew

597
00:28:54,219 --> 00:28:55,818
what we sacrificed to build a city.

598
00:28:56,538 --> 00:28:57,419
You also knew

599
00:28:57,939 --> 00:28:59,338
how hard people struggled

600
00:29:00,058 --> 00:29:02,538
for a better life.

601
00:29:02,738 --> 00:29:04,538
You still think you have a reason?

602
00:29:14,699 --> 00:29:15,219
Forget it.

603
00:29:17,098 --> 00:29:17,899
Whatever.

604
00:29:19,379 --> 00:29:19,979
It's over.

605
00:29:23,098 --> 00:29:23,699
Listen,

606
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:26,859
if you weren't Ms. Li's boyfriend,

607
00:29:29,098 --> 00:29:30,419
I'd have beaten you senseless!

608
00:29:33,018 --> 00:29:33,738
Do it.

609
00:29:36,498 --> 00:29:37,379
She and I

610
00:29:38,738 --> 00:29:39,238
broke up.

611
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:46,338
What?

612
00:29:47,379 --> 00:29:51,219
Didn't I just approve
your marriage application?

613
00:29:51,738 --> 00:29:52,498
Are you serious?

614
00:29:54,699 --> 00:29:55,258
In life,

615
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:57,659
you must learn to choose.

616
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:08,619
So, you mean

617
00:30:10,578 --> 00:30:12,139
you chose your career

618
00:30:13,538 --> 00:30:15,939
over Ms. Li and Yuehai?

619
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:28,738
I'm killing you!

620
00:30:28,738 --> 00:30:30,419
Hit me! Right here! Do it!

621
00:30:32,379 --> 00:30:34,899
As a cadre, I can't hit anyone.

622
00:30:35,338 --> 00:30:38,338
But you're not human!

623
00:30:39,219 --> 00:30:40,379
I'm killing you!

624
00:30:41,738 --> 00:30:43,219
I'm killing you!

625
00:30:43,338 --> 00:30:43,979
Stop it!

626
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:45,699
I'll compensate you.

627
00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:49,578
I'm beating you to death!

628
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:51,818
(A few days later,)

629
00:30:52,498 --> 00:30:55,338
(Du Tao got internal disciplinary action
because of that article.)

630
00:30:56,459 --> 00:30:57,979
(Later, I heard he resigned.)

631
00:30:58,699 --> 00:31:00,258
(We never saw each other again.)

632
00:31:03,219 --> 00:31:04,459
I'm back!

633
00:31:04,538 --> 00:31:05,058
Mr. Zheng!

634
00:31:05,058 --> 00:31:05,859
I'm back!

635
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:07,498
I'm back.

636
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:07,998
I'm back!

637
00:31:08,578 --> 00:31:09,078
Mr. Zheng.

638
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:09,699
Hello.

639
00:31:10,139 --> 00:31:10,818
How's business?

640
00:31:10,818 --> 00:31:11,379
Good.

641
00:31:11,498 --> 00:31:12,498
That's good.

642
00:31:12,979 --> 00:31:13,778
I'm back!

643
00:31:14,859 --> 00:31:15,859
How are you?

644
00:31:15,859 --> 00:31:16,359
I'm fine.

645
00:31:16,498 --> 00:31:17,338
That's good.

646
00:31:17,899 --> 00:31:18,939
Take care.

647
00:31:19,338 --> 00:31:19,838
Okay.

648
00:31:20,538 --> 00:31:21,659
If you need help, tell me.

649
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:22,738
You're finally back!

650
00:31:23,139 --> 00:31:23,659
I'm back.

651
00:31:23,859 --> 00:31:25,018
Will you leave again?

652
00:31:25,338 --> 00:31:26,018
No, I won't.

653
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:26,818
Great.

654
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:27,578
Be steady.

655
00:31:27,778 --> 00:31:28,278
Alright.

656
00:31:28,298 --> 00:31:29,179
Work hard.

657
00:31:29,459 --> 00:31:30,899
Mr. Zheng, you're back.

658
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:31,419
Sure.

659
00:31:31,419 --> 00:31:33,018
We're so happy you're back.

660
00:31:33,379 --> 00:31:35,058
Look, Mr. Zheng is back!

661
00:31:35,258 --> 00:31:36,939
Mr. Zheng is back!

662
00:31:37,659 --> 00:31:38,859
If you need anything,

663
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:39,659
just let me know.

664
00:31:40,258 --> 00:31:40,899
I knew it!

665
00:31:41,058 --> 00:31:42,179
I knew you would be fine.

666
00:31:42,298 --> 00:31:43,018
I told them.

667
00:31:43,179 --> 00:31:45,179
I told you all! Look, Mr. Zheng is back!

668
00:31:45,379 --> 00:31:46,258
Isn't he back?

669
00:31:46,419 --> 00:31:47,058
Didn't I say so?

670
00:31:47,379 --> 00:31:48,818
- I've been learning idioms.
- Good.

671
00:31:49,498 --> 00:31:50,379
I've been learning.

672
00:31:50,379 --> 00:31:50,939
You're back.

673
00:31:51,018 --> 00:31:51,518
Yan.

674
00:31:51,738 --> 00:31:53,058
How's your business doing lately?

675
00:31:53,219 --> 00:31:54,738
Very good, thanks to you.

676
00:31:55,098 --> 00:31:55,859
See you.

677
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:57,139
See you.

678
00:31:59,899 --> 00:32:02,738

Ms. Li,

708
00:34:25,779 --> 00:34:27,819
I just heard from people on the street.

709
00:34:28,538 --> 00:34:31,058
Thank you for taking care of them
during my absence.

710
00:34:32,618 --> 00:34:34,779
Mr. Zheng, you're finally back.

711
00:34:37,459 --> 00:34:40,098
I can finally return Yuehai to you.

712
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:46,259
What's wrong?

713
00:34:46,698 --> 00:34:48,498
Mr. Zheng, my back hurts.

714
00:34:49,138 --> 00:34:49,939
What's wrong?

715
00:34:49,979 --> 00:34:50,578
What's wrong?

716
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:51,339
A back problem?

717
00:34:55,339 --> 00:34:56,379
This really is my fault.

718
00:34:56,379 --> 00:34:57,939
It's not your fault, Mr. Zheng.

719
00:34:57,939 --> 00:34:59,218
You have to take responsibility.

720
00:34:59,218 --> 00:34:59,718
Doctor.

721
00:35:00,979 --> 00:35:03,658
Dr. Jiang, what exactly happened?

722
00:35:03,819 --> 00:35:04,979
How do you feel now?

723
00:35:05,939 --> 00:35:07,939
It's just painful.

724
00:35:08,058 --> 00:35:09,178
Don't move at all!

725
00:35:17,498 --> 00:35:18,779
Ms. Li, rest for a while.

726
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:20,658
Okay. Don't move.

727
00:35:24,058 --> 00:35:25,118
The CT scan shows

728
00:35:25,218 --> 00:35:27,299
she has a lumbar disc protrusion.

729
00:35:27,779 --> 00:35:28,279
What?

730
00:35:29,498 --> 00:35:30,578
How so?

731
00:35:30,618 --> 00:35:32,819
I-I just hugged her once.

732
00:35:33,379 --> 00:35:35,259
Actually, during the investigation,

733
00:35:35,498 --> 00:35:36,419
I exercised a little.

734
00:35:36,618 --> 00:35:37,819
I didn't see this coming.

735
00:35:37,939 --> 00:35:39,459
Don't overstate your own strength.

736
00:35:40,618 --> 00:35:41,118
(Ward 06)
Look here.

737
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:45,859
These two bones
are compressing the nerve.

738
00:35:46,138 --> 00:35:49,259
In theory, every step she takes
should be excruciatingly painful.

739
00:35:49,538 --> 00:35:51,779
I don't know how she's managed
to endure it until now.

740
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:56,419
Is it very serious?

741
00:35:56,939 --> 00:35:57,939
So how do you treat her?

742
00:35:58,098 --> 00:36:00,618
We can't be sure yet.
We need to run a few more tests.

743
00:36:01,379 --> 00:36:03,218
According to the test results,

744
00:36:03,498 --> 00:36:05,698
we can determine
if surgery is necessary.

745
00:36:08,899 --> 00:36:09,618
She needs surgery?

746
00:36:09,939 --> 00:36:10,819
That is a possibility.

747
00:36:11,939 --> 00:36:12,439
Alright.

748
00:36:12,578 --> 00:36:14,618
You all shouldn't stay here.

749
00:36:15,419 --> 00:36:16,979
Just one person needs to stay for care.

750
00:36:17,459 --> 00:36:18,138
Who will it be?

751
00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:19,259
I will.

752
00:36:19,259 --> 00:36:20,178
- You.
- Yes.

753
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:20,779
Be responsible.

754
00:36:21,158 --> 00:36:21,658
Sure.

755
00:36:21,658 --> 00:36:22,538
Well...

756
00:36:22,538 --> 00:36:23,299
I caused this.

757
00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:24,498
You're not suitable.

758
00:36:25,018 --> 00:36:26,058
I think you should stay.

759
00:36:26,658 --> 00:36:29,299
I'll have the nurse
give you specific instructions.

760
00:36:29,538 --> 00:36:30,038
Okay.

761
00:36:40,939 --> 00:36:41,618
Meng.

762
00:36:42,899 --> 00:36:43,979
I want some water.

763
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:45,538
Okay.

764
00:36:47,859 --> 00:36:48,379
Dad.

765
00:36:49,618 --> 00:36:50,118
Qiuping.

766
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:50,839
Mom.

767
00:36:51,939 --> 00:36:53,058
Don't move.

768
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:54,379
What are you doing here?

769
00:36:55,859 --> 00:36:58,218
Mr. Zheng asked us to come.

770
00:37:03,819 --> 00:37:05,098
Why did he ask you to come here?

771
00:37:07,138 --> 00:37:07,939
What's wrong?

772
00:37:10,339 --> 00:37:11,739
Am I dying?

773
00:37:21,658 --> 00:37:22,939
Why are you crying?

774
00:37:23,698 --> 00:37:24,779
As we said,

775
00:37:25,098 --> 00:37:26,739
we won't cry in front of our daughter.

776
00:37:27,259 --> 00:37:28,098
I just feel

777
00:37:29,259 --> 00:37:31,578
we are terrible parents.

778
00:37:32,859 --> 00:37:35,218
Our child thinks we show up

779
00:37:35,658 --> 00:37:36,779
because she's dying.

780
00:37:43,459 --> 00:37:44,259
Stop crying.

781
00:37:44,698 --> 00:37:46,419
Aren't you usually calm?

782
00:37:46,779 --> 00:37:48,018
At this critical moment...

783
00:37:48,259 --> 00:37:49,299
Stop criticizing me again.

784
00:37:50,178 --> 00:37:51,259
Did you do better than me?

785
00:37:52,819 --> 00:37:54,419
That's more like it.

786
00:37:55,138 --> 00:37:57,299
You're better off being angry.

787
00:37:57,698 --> 00:37:59,739
Don't cry before our girl
these next few days.

788
00:38:08,379 --> 00:38:10,779
Don't forget the rules we made before.

789
00:38:12,018 --> 00:38:12,618
Okay.

790
00:38:13,618 --> 00:38:14,538
That's good.

791
00:38:15,859 --> 00:38:18,739
No arguing while our child is sick.

792
00:38:19,618 --> 00:38:20,899
Don't let her worry.

793
00:38:21,498 --> 00:38:23,819
Don't mention her breakup with Du Tao.

794
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:28,138
If she doesn't bring that up,
we won't ask.

795
00:38:30,419 --> 00:38:30,939
Got it.

796
00:38:35,578 --> 00:38:36,098
Dr. Hou.

797
00:38:36,739 --> 00:38:37,259
Dr. Jiang.

798
00:38:37,538 --> 00:38:38,038
Go ahead.

799
00:38:38,138 --> 00:38:41,058
Now, you apply some spray for Ms. Li.

800
00:38:41,259 --> 00:38:42,618
I want to see how she recovers.

801
00:38:42,658 --> 00:38:46,018
Could you ask the nurse to guide her
through some rehabilitation exercises?

802
00:38:46,098 --> 00:38:46,598
Okay?

803
00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:47,839
Sure.

804
00:38:48,299 --> 00:38:48,799
Good.

805
00:38:49,578 --> 00:38:50,138
Ms. Yan.

806
00:38:51,218 --> 00:38:52,498
We just checked on Ms. Li.

807
00:38:53,939 --> 00:38:54,739
I'd like you

808
00:38:54,939 --> 00:38:55,578
- to meet...
- No need.

809
00:38:56,299 --> 00:38:56,939
Dr. Jiang,

810
00:38:57,498 --> 00:39:00,018
I'm Yan Jin, Qiuping's mother.

811
00:39:01,018 --> 00:39:03,299
Ms. Yan,
nice to meet you. I'm Jiang Yun.

812
00:39:05,498 --> 00:39:06,299
Unexpectedly,

813
00:39:09,538 --> 00:39:12,618
after all these years,
we've finally met.

814
00:39:14,739 --> 00:39:15,819
Am I bothering you?

815
00:39:17,018 --> 00:39:18,899
Sorry, I've been too busy.

816
00:39:19,218 --> 00:39:21,739
I should have gone
to Pingchuan to see you much sooner.

817
00:39:29,819 --> 00:39:32,339
Thank you for taking care of Qiuping.

818
00:39:32,739 --> 00:39:33,459
She really

819
00:39:34,779 --> 00:39:37,259
throws herself entirely into her work.

820
00:39:39,819 --> 00:39:42,618
So, while she's in the hospital,
I entrust her to your care.

821
00:39:43,259 --> 00:39:46,018
No problem. This is what I should do.

822
00:39:48,218 --> 00:39:49,098
Ms. Yan,

823
00:39:49,379 --> 00:39:52,259
Tao and Qiuping broke up.

824
00:39:52,819 --> 00:39:54,339
That's Tao's misfortune.

825
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:57,578
I truly like Qiuping.

826
00:39:58,098 --> 00:39:59,178
But for her,

827
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:01,299
it might not be a bad thing.

828
00:40:04,339 --> 00:40:05,058
Tao...

829
00:40:08,578 --> 00:40:09,578
It's just fate, I think.

830
00:40:10,939 --> 00:40:11,538
I have to go.

831
00:40:48,299 --> 00:40:48,939
Mom,

832
00:40:50,299 --> 00:40:51,299
do you and Dad know

833
00:40:51,698 --> 00:40:53,939
that Du Tao and I broke up?

834
00:40:57,939 --> 00:40:58,939
What happened?

835
00:41:00,379 --> 00:41:01,379
Du Tao...

836
00:41:03,379 --> 00:41:04,819
How could he just leave like that?

837
00:41:05,419 --> 00:41:07,098
What exactly happened?

838
00:41:07,578 --> 00:41:10,698
Years of affection ended just like that?

839
00:41:11,419 --> 00:41:13,538
Why torture yourself like this?

840
00:41:14,578 --> 00:41:17,058
Besides, you should've told us earlier.

841
00:41:17,379 --> 00:41:18,578
After all this time,

842
00:41:22,739 --> 00:41:25,176
how did you bear it alone?

843
00:41:25,976 --> 00:41:26,872
I don't know, either.

844
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:30,680
Well,

845
00:41:32,618 --> 00:41:34,379
it was like being cut by a knife.

846
00:41:35,058 --> 00:41:36,339
I didn't even feel the pain.

847
00:41:43,819 --> 00:41:45,299
Too much was happening.

848
00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:47,538
I...

849
00:41:51,178 --> 00:41:52,018
I was exhausted.

850
00:41:52,658 --> 00:41:53,939
I was so tired.

851
00:41:59,538 --> 00:42:00,218
I understand.

852
00:42:03,018 --> 00:42:03,979
What about now?

853
00:42:04,739 --> 00:42:05,459
Now...

854
00:42:08,498 --> 00:42:09,979
Now, the pain is setting in.

855
00:42:13,419 --> 00:42:14,979
The bleeding has started.

856
00:42:20,739 --> 00:42:21,939
But we're here for you.

857
00:42:28,058 --> 00:42:28,558
Mom,

858
00:42:29,498 --> 00:42:31,459
I'd prefer to be alone for now.

859
00:42:33,419 --> 00:42:33,939
Alright.

860
00:42:37,538 --> 00:42:40,859
I'll be right outside.
