Mr. Zheng.

18
00:01:48,626 --> 00:01:49,425
Li, you're here.

19
00:01:49,785 --> 00:01:50,285
Sit.

20
00:01:51,186 --> 00:01:51,785
Are you tired?

21
00:01:53,266 --> 00:01:53,865
Have water.

22
00:01:54,746 --> 00:01:55,345
Thank you.

23
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:56,666
I've registered.

24
00:01:57,225 --> 00:01:57,826
Wait here.

25
00:01:58,225 --> 00:01:59,585
Mr. Zhang is in a meeting inside.

26
00:02:01,585 --> 00:02:02,505
What kind of meeting?

27
00:02:04,585 --> 00:02:06,505
Seems to be about economic affairs.

28
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:11,346
Don't be nervous.

29
00:02:12,106 --> 00:02:12,865
I'm not nervous.

30
00:02:18,106 --> 00:02:19,425
Mr. Zheng, don't be nervous.

31
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:20,185
I'm not nervous.

32
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:21,705
Your leg is shaking.

33
00:02:22,705 --> 00:02:24,386
My leg isn't shaking. Is it?

34
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:28,986
It's not about nerves, just a habit.

35
00:02:30,145 --> 00:02:31,986
I've met more than one senior official.

36
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:36,166
I wasn't even afraid of speaking
in front of thousands of cadres.

37
00:02:36,346 --> 00:02:37,425
Is it the same?

38
00:02:38,946 --> 00:02:39,705
Not really.

39
00:02:41,506 --> 00:02:42,006
True.

40
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:45,240
Tens of thousands
of Yuehai residents are counting on me.

41
00:02:45,816 --> 00:02:48,145
I'm not nervous. I can't be nervous.

42
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,585
I'm not nervous at all.

43
00:02:51,025 --> 00:02:51,905
I can't be nervous.

44
00:02:53,425 --> 00:02:54,386
Then stop shaking.

45
00:02:55,386 --> 00:02:56,585
I'm not shaking.

46
00:03:04,106 --> 00:03:05,865
Are you from Yuehai?

47
00:03:06,826 --> 00:03:07,326
Yes.

48
00:03:07,705 --> 00:03:09,585
I'm Mr. Zhang's secretary.

49
00:03:09,986 --> 00:03:11,025
He is still in session.

50
00:03:11,266 --> 00:03:13,066
He likely won't be available
for a while.

51
00:03:13,346 --> 00:03:15,745
When will the meeting end?

52
00:03:17,946 --> 00:03:18,745
Probably

53
00:03:18,925 --> 00:03:20,346
around 1 PM or 2 PM.

54
00:03:20,745 --> 00:03:22,506
Then that's too late.

55
00:03:22,546 --> 00:03:23,786
The papers are already printed.

56
00:03:25,266 --> 00:03:27,025
Sir, I remember

57
00:03:27,546 --> 00:03:30,185
that economic planning meetings,
before finalizing decisions,

58
00:03:30,386 --> 00:03:32,226
usually reserve half an hour

59
00:03:32,226 --> 00:03:34,305

Could you relay messages to Mr. Zhang?

63
00:03:43,465 --> 00:03:45,786
We just need ten minutes of his time.

64
00:03:45,986 --> 00:03:46,486
Right.

65
00:03:46,546 --> 00:03:47,625
Just ten minutes.

you have
found so much historical material

92

and compiled it.

93

It even
includes my ballad-collecting work.

94
00:06:07,586 --> 00:06:08,466
I'd nearly forgotten.

95
00:06:09,505 --> 00:06:11,625
Mr. Zhang, it's my duty.

96
00:06:13,026 --> 00:06:14,346
I was so young then.

to compile our cultural heritage.

100
00:06:23,346 --> 00:06:25,906
I appreciate this thoughtful gift.

101

Just come straight to the point.

106
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:40,226
Mr. Zhang,

107
00:06:40,745 --> 00:06:41,586
this matter

108
00:06:41,906 --> 00:06:44,385
isn't trivial yet significant,

109
00:06:44,945 --> 00:06:47,185
requiring provincial-level mediation.

110
00:06:47,466 --> 00:06:49,706
We've notified county leadership

111
00:06:50,026 --> 00:06:50,986
before approaching you.

113
00:07:15,106 --> 00:07:17,026

was debated under my direction.

117
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:25,226
However,

118
00:07:26,505 --> 00:07:27,865
you can't expect me to help you

119
00:07:28,385 --> 00:07:29,786
every time something goes wrong.

120
00:07:30,745 --> 00:07:33,546
What you're doing
in Yuehai is meant to spark debate.

121
00:07:34,586 --> 00:07:35,945
If you can't even handle it,

122
00:07:36,825 --> 00:07:37,786
just give up.

123
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,385
Mr. Zhang, here's the thing.

124
00:07:40,906 --> 00:07:43,065
Personally, I'm not afraid.

125
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,986
Taking responsibility?
I can handle that.

126
00:07:46,505 --> 00:07:49,065
I can accept
either demotion or punishment.

127
00:07:49,865 --> 00:07:51,986
But Yuehai is still too fragile.

128
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,745
It's not ready
to face storms like this yet.

129
00:07:55,505 --> 00:07:56,586
It's like an infant.

130
00:07:57,026 --> 00:07:59,065
It can't fight like an adult.

131
00:07:59,305 --> 00:08:01,226
But secrets never stay buried forever.

132
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,305
Yuehai's experiments and experiences

133
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:07,865
will eventually become known outside.

134
00:08:08,505 --> 00:08:09,906
Today, it's "New City Life".

135
00:08:11,185 --> 00:08:13,505
What if another newspaper comes
tomorrow?

136
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:15,346
What will you do?

137
00:08:16,906 --> 00:08:17,656
Come to me again?

138
00:08:18,146 --> 00:08:21,185
Mr. Zhang, we understand your point.

139
00:08:22,106 --> 00:08:23,466
So, Mr. Zheng means

140
00:08:23,825 --> 00:08:26,265
he just hopes for more time.

141
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:28,666
Wait until Yuehai truly grows up

142
00:08:28,986 --> 00:08:30,586
and can withstand any storms.

143
00:08:31,346 --> 00:08:32,865
Then, we'll welcome all coverage.

144
00:08:33,826 --> 00:08:36,466
I understand your concerns.

145
00:08:38,665 --> 00:08:39,986
But I must criticize you.

146
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:43,186
The whole country
is exploring uncharted waters.

147
00:08:45,466 --> 00:08:46,986
Have faith in the people.

148
00:08:48,025 --> 00:08:50,625
Have faith in our future.

149
00:08:53,745 --> 00:08:54,245
Six months.

150
00:08:57,706 --> 00:08:59,665
Mr. Zhang, what do you mean?

151
00:08:59,865 --> 00:09:01,625
Though your methods were flawed,

152
00:09:02,466 --> 00:09:04,625
your intention was for Yuehai's people.

153
00:09:06,106 --> 00:09:07,346
That moves me deeply.

154
00:09:08,346 --> 00:09:09,745
I'll talk with relevant parties.

155
00:09:10,826 --> 00:09:12,265
I'll try to buy you six months.

156
00:09:13,226 --> 00:09:13,944
After six months,

157
00:09:14,226 --> 00:09:16,586
whether "New City Life"
or other publications,

158
00:09:17,025 --> 00:09:19,426
when they research and report on Yuehai,

159
00:09:19,745 --> 00:09:20,306
Yuehai

160
00:09:21,466 --> 00:09:22,346
must cooperate fully,

161
00:09:22,946 --> 00:09:23,665
open its door,

162
00:09:24,505 --> 00:09:26,066
and let people judge.

163
00:09:27,226 --> 00:09:29,265
But I can only try, no guarantees.

164
00:09:30,265 --> 00:09:32,426
The final decision rests
with the authorities.

165
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:33,785
Is that clear?

166
00:09:34,665 --> 00:09:35,426
Sure.

167
00:09:47,785 --> 00:09:49,625
Stop! Stop the presses!

168
00:09:49,986 --> 00:09:52,025
Halt them! Stop right now!

169
00:09:52,306 --> 00:09:53,145
Shut it all down.

170
00:09:56,466 --> 00:09:58,905
Six months? Editor Xiao,
how is that possible?

171
00:09:59,346 --> 00:10:01,066
In six months, similar cases nationwide

172
00:10:01,106 --> 00:10:02,545
will keep emerging endlessly!

173
00:10:02,566 --> 00:10:03,992
By then, my Yuehai features

174
00:10:03,992 --> 00:10:05,745
will completely lose attention!

175
00:10:05,826 --> 00:10:07,145
I know that.

176
00:10:07,426 --> 00:10:10,665
But the decision is final.
It can't be changed.

177
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,785
Editor Xiao, I still
don't understand why!

178
00:10:14,986 --> 00:10:16,826
Didn't you personally
approve my articles?

179
00:10:16,826 --> 00:10:18,745
You told me to write some great pieces.

180
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:19,745
I wrote it.

181
00:10:19,905 --> 00:10:20,586
But in the end...

182
00:10:20,665 --> 00:10:21,586
Du,

183
00:10:22,106 --> 00:10:23,865
when I got the call, I felt the same.

184
00:10:24,186 --> 00:10:25,586
I couldn't accept it either.

185
00:10:26,066 --> 00:10:27,186
But this is life.

186
00:10:27,826 --> 00:10:30,265
You have to face setback after setback,

187
00:10:30,306 --> 00:10:32,066
forcing you to face reality.

188
00:10:33,385 --> 00:10:34,066
But I trust you.

189
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,785
Since you wrote two great articles,

190
00:10:36,946 --> 00:10:40,346
you can write 20
and even 200 better ones!

191
00:10:43,106 --> 00:10:45,066
Editor Xiao, this isn't about trust.

192
00:10:45,426 --> 00:10:46,226
I can't take it.

193
00:10:46,226 --> 00:10:48,145
At least give me a reason!

194
00:10:48,545 --> 00:10:50,505
All I can say is
Zheng Decheng is formidable.

195
00:10:50,745 --> 00:10:53,304
He went straight to Mr. Zhang
of the Provincial Committee.

196
00:10:53,826 --> 00:10:55,466
Mr. Zhang personally gave the order.

197
00:10:59,586 --> 00:11:00,865
He knows Mr. Zhang?

198
00:11:02,306 --> 00:11:04,986
Guess who went
with Zheng Decheng to see Mr. Zhang?

199
00:11:06,545 --> 00:11:07,045
Who?

200
00:11:07,385 --> 00:11:10,905
Yuehai's Town Mayor,
your girlfriend, Li Qiuping.

201
00:11:16,346 --> 00:11:16,946
Du Tao.

202
00:11:17,785 --> 00:11:18,625
- Ms. Li.
- Du Tao.

203
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:20,306
Ms. Li.

204
00:11:21,706 --> 00:11:23,145
Didn't Mr. Du go back?

205
00:11:23,346 --> 00:11:24,865
His colleagues said he came to Yuehai.

206
00:11:25,905 --> 00:11:26,665
He's in Yuehai?

207
00:11:27,745 --> 00:11:28,426
Haven't seen him.

208
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:32,625
He's here?

209
00:11:48,498 --> 00:11:52,370
(Yuehai Column: Seven-up, Eight-down
No Land Sales. What's Next for Yuehai?)

210
00:12:08,306 --> 00:12:09,186
Do you have any idea

211
00:12:10,066 --> 00:12:12,545
how hard it is
to get a new article published?

212
00:12:14,665 --> 00:12:16,385
I watched it roll through the press.

213
00:12:17,226 --> 00:12:18,186
It was already printed.

214
00:12:21,745 --> 00:12:22,346
Sorry.

215
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,186
I truly can't
let your articles get published.

216
00:12:28,586 --> 00:12:29,586
But trust me.

217
00:12:30,665 --> 00:12:31,426
Wait six months.

218
00:12:32,306 --> 00:12:34,306
- After six months, Yuehai...
- Six months?

219
00:12:35,106 --> 00:12:36,665
Will it still be news after six months?

220
00:12:38,545 --> 00:12:40,306
It's pointless to talk about this now.

221
00:12:40,986 --> 00:12:42,625
All because of your concerns,

222
00:12:42,865 --> 00:12:44,265
the Yuehai Column is gone.

223
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:45,865
It's gone.

224
00:12:47,265 --> 00:12:48,346
Is my career

225
00:12:48,346 --> 00:12:50,346
so insignificant in your eyes?

226
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:54,665
Du Tao.

227
00:12:58,186 --> 00:12:58,946
I'm sorry.

228
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,905
But this concerns the entire fate
of Yuehai.

229
00:13:02,986 --> 00:13:04,025
The fate of Yuehai?

230
00:13:04,545 --> 00:13:05,745
Then, what about my fate?

231
00:13:15,385 --> 00:13:16,706
Guess how I felt on the way here?

232
00:13:18,586 --> 00:13:19,706
I was completely dazed.

233
00:13:20,586 --> 00:13:22,706
When I snapped out of it,
I was already in Yuehai.

234
00:13:23,226 --> 00:13:24,346
That's when I realized

235
00:13:24,946 --> 00:13:25,665
all these years,

236
00:13:26,145 --> 00:13:28,120
I'd driven 300 kilometers
to Pingchuan many times.

237
00:13:28,665 --> 00:13:30,745
It's like I've been driving by instinct.

238
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,106
We've been together for ten years.

239
00:13:43,385 --> 00:13:45,545
I've been trying
to cut the long distance between us.

240
00:13:46,186 --> 00:13:47,946
But why are there
always so many obstacles?

241
00:13:49,346 --> 00:13:53,025
After graduation, you couldn't stay
in the provincial capital for your mom.

242
00:13:53,346 --> 00:13:53,986
I understood.

243
00:13:55,025 --> 00:13:56,905
Later, when your family
improved somewhat,

244
00:13:56,905 --> 00:13:58,306
my mom finally got you a job

245
00:13:58,306 --> 00:14:00,385
at the Grain Bureau,
but you didn't want it.

246
00:14:00,946 --> 00:14:01,706
I understood too.

247
00:14:02,826 --> 00:14:03,986
Now, you've come to Yuehai.

248
00:14:04,265 --> 00:14:05,785
Yuehai has your ambitions.

249
00:14:05,865 --> 00:14:06,785
I can understand.

250
00:14:06,905 --> 00:14:08,466
But what about my ambitions?

251
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:12,265
Do you have any idea how much I've put
into the Yuehai Column?

252
00:14:13,306 --> 00:14:15,106
I finally got this opportunity.

253
00:14:15,785 --> 00:14:16,545
Finally.

254
00:14:16,986 --> 00:14:19,265
Why can't you understand me,
just this once?

255
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:27,966
Yes,

256
00:14:29,145 --> 00:14:29,745
I admit

257
00:14:30,586 --> 00:14:31,865
I do have my own motives.

258
00:14:33,385 --> 00:14:34,625
It's because you're too good.

259
00:14:36,545 --> 00:14:38,385
You've always shone so brightly.

260
00:14:39,466 --> 00:14:40,865
I pushed myself so hard

261
00:14:41,665 --> 00:14:43,706
just to stand
shoulder to shoulder with you.

262
00:14:44,265 --> 00:14:45,466
And what did you do?

263
00:14:46,226 --> 00:14:47,505
You destroyed my chance.

264
00:14:51,665 --> 00:14:52,385
Li Qiuping,

265
00:14:53,785 --> 00:14:55,186
how much more do I have to give up?

266
00:14:55,306 --> 00:14:57,306
Do you know
how tiring it is being your boyfriend?

267
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:00,545
Du Tao.

268
00:15:01,426 --> 00:15:03,545
You've been so nice to me.

269
00:15:04,265 --> 00:15:06,745
Your tolerance,
understanding, and support,

270
00:15:06,946 --> 00:15:08,706
I keep all that in mind.

271
00:15:09,025 --> 00:15:10,106
I also want

272
00:15:10,106 --> 00:15:13,106
to help and support you
when you're in need.

273
00:15:15,346 --> 00:15:16,385
But this time,

274
00:15:17,265 --> 00:15:18,706
I have to make this choice.

275
00:15:19,346 --> 00:15:22,385
I don't dare hope
you'll understand me again.

276
00:15:23,706 --> 00:15:24,946
Please don't doubt your place

277
00:15:24,946 --> 00:15:28,186
and importance in my heart, okay?

278
00:15:36,365 --> 00:15:38,265
I have over 300 kilometers to drive.

279
00:15:39,346 --> 00:15:39,986

Hai, you're finally here.

about us.

Look,

00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,545
it's five jiao per person now.

318
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,065
You're one yuan short.

319
00:17:17,226 --> 00:17:18,745
When did the price go up?

320
00:17:23,386 --> 00:17:25,505
Don't pay! I said it's my treat.

321
00:17:29,345 --> 00:17:31,025
We didn't know you raised the price.

322
00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:32,305

Check out.

334
00:17:52,626 --> 00:17:53,386

00:19:22,866 --> 00:19:23,426
Zhiqiang.

374
00:19:23,706 --> 00:19:24,226
Are you okay?

375
00:19:24,226 --> 00:19:24,785
I'm fine.

376
00:19:24,785 --> 00:19:26,545
A thorn on the box pricked my hand.

377
00:19:26,785 --> 00:19:27,626
Let us help you,

378
00:19:27,706 --> 00:19:28,206
Ms. Gao.

379
00:19:28,265 --> 00:19:29,025
No need.

380
00:19:29,305 --> 00:19:30,426
Thank you so much.

381
00:19:30,466 --> 00:19:30,966
Not at all.

382
00:19:31,065 --> 00:19:32,386
- Not at all.
- Watch for thorns!

383
00:19:32,386 --> 00:19:33,386
- One, two, three, lift!
- Careful.

384
00:19:33,745 --> 00:19:35,105
Alright. This is heavy.

385
00:19:35,345 --> 00:19:35,946
Slow down.

386
00:19:36,505 --> 00:19:37,505
To the left.

387
00:19:38,226 --> 00:19:38,745
This way.

388
00:19:39,065 --> 00:19:39,585
This way.

389
00:19:39,866 --> 00:19:40,785
- Thanks.
- Turn.

390
00:19:40,986 --> 00:19:42,146
Slow down. It's too heavy.

391
00:19:42,866 --> 00:19:43,386
Come on.

392
00:19:45,146 --> 00:19:45,825
Thanks.

393
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:46,946
Let's go.

394
00:19:46,946 --> 00:19:47,906
Be careful, please.

395
00:19:47,946 --> 00:19:48,626
Be careful.

396
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:51,585
Thank you.

397
00:19:52,866 --> 00:19:54,345
Thank you so much.

398
00:19:55,186 --> 00:19:56,146
Wait a second.

399
00:19:56,466 --> 00:19:57,065
Well...

400
00:19:59,626 --> 00:20:00,785
A token of appreciation.

401
00:20:03,105 --> 00:20:03,745
Well...

402
00:20:05,785 --> 00:20:06,666
Go buy some ice cream.

403
00:20:09,065 --> 00:20:09,785
Take it. Come on.

404
00:20:10,226 --> 00:20:11,226
Take it.

405
00:20:11,626 --> 00:20:13,386
I really appreciate your help.

406
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:14,466
Thank you, Ms. Gao.

407
00:20:14,585 --> 00:20:15,986
- You're welcome. See you.
- Thanks.

408
00:20:16,386 --> 00:20:16,946
Thanks again.

409
00:20:17,146 --> 00:20:17,706
- Bye.
- Thanks.

Not at all.

411
00:20:24,305 --> 00:20:25,146
Someone, come here.

412
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,825
I just did her a small favor

413
00:20:29,065 --> 00:20:30,105
and earned me

414
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:31,745
nearly half a month's wages.

415
00:20:32,545 --> 00:20:33,505
Wow.

416
00:20:36,186 --> 00:20:37,545
Is this ice cream good?

417
00:20:37,706 --> 00:20:38,866
It's good.

418
00:20:40,986 --> 00:20:41,825
Hello, Ms. Yang.

419
00:20:43,146 --> 00:20:43,906
Ms. Li.

420
00:20:45,866 --> 00:20:46,626
Ping.

421
00:20:47,265 --> 00:20:49,466
Please thank Mr. Lin for me.

422
00:20:50,386 --> 00:20:53,706
This wheelchair is so good for me.

423
00:20:54,025 --> 00:20:54,706
Okay.

424
00:20:55,466 --> 00:20:57,146
Don't worry. I'll definitely tell him.

425
00:20:58,025 --> 00:20:58,545
Ping,

426
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:03,906
being a Town Mayor isn't better
than having an ice cream.

427
00:21:05,946 --> 00:21:07,825
If you have nowhere
to vent your frustrations,

428
00:21:08,105 --> 00:21:09,906
just come find me.

429
00:21:10,426 --> 00:21:12,305
I won't tell anyone else.

430
00:21:15,545 --> 00:21:17,946
It's a deal then.
Please don't find me annoying.

431
00:21:18,186 --> 00:21:19,105
Of course not.

432
00:21:19,626 --> 00:21:22,666
Actually, I'm the same. I have nowhere
to vent my frustrations either.

433
00:21:24,305 --> 00:21:26,426
I'm quite old now.

434
00:21:26,825 --> 00:21:28,345
Who knows how many more times

435
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,906
I can eat such delicious things?

436
00:21:32,265 --> 00:21:32,866
Ping,

437
00:21:34,386 --> 00:21:35,946
I'm nagging you like this

438
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:39,505
because I have something to ask of you.

439
00:21:39,825 --> 00:21:40,505
Go ahead.

440
00:21:41,745 --> 00:21:44,065
Xiaohai has a hard life.

441
00:21:44,545 --> 00:21:46,025
His parents passed away early.

442
00:21:46,265 --> 00:21:47,946
I'm getting old myself.

443
00:21:48,505 --> 00:21:50,386
Who knows when I'll be gone?

444
00:21:51,305 --> 00:21:52,025
So,

445
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:54,906
I hope

446
00:21:56,545 --> 00:21:58,825
you'll look out for him in the future.

447
00:22:00,065 --> 00:22:01,986
Don't worry. I definitely will.

448
00:22:20,626 --> 00:22:21,226
Sir.

449
00:22:22,146 --> 00:22:23,585
Do you need help?

450
00:22:23,745 --> 00:22:24,866
No, thanks.

451
00:22:25,226 --> 00:22:25,946
I'm strong.

452
00:22:26,146 --> 00:22:27,426
I can do it myself.

456

457
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:47,765
Got it!

458
00:22:48,745 --> 00:22:51,025
Buddy, come and help.

459
00:22:51,585 --> 00:22:52,426
Sure, sir.

460
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:55,545
Be careful!

461
00:22:55,785 --> 00:22:56,585
Handle it gently.

462
00:22:57,426 --> 00:22:59,466
Sun Xiaoyan reported to me today

463
00:23:00,025 --> 00:23:01,825
that her home had likely been burgled

464
00:23:02,265 --> 00:23:03,585
for several nights recently.

465
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:05,426
This is intolerable!

466
00:23:06,946 --> 00:23:08,146
So, starting today,

467
00:23:08,265 --> 00:23:10,866
our main patrol area

468
00:23:11,065 --> 00:23:11,946
will be Ping'an Road.

Everyone, be thorough.

470
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:15,226
Don't overlook any corner.

471
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:17,666
Also, be extremely careful.

472
00:23:17,906 --> 00:23:19,105
Do not alert the suspect.

473
00:23:19,545 --> 00:23:20,065
- Yes!
- Yes!

474
00:23:20,105 --> 00:23:20,706
Good.

475
00:23:21,065 --> 00:23:21,585
Move out!

476
00:23:21,825 --> 00:23:22,666
Turn left!

477
00:23:23,825 --> 00:23:24,706
March!

478
00:25:09,386 --> 00:25:10,986
Catch the thief!

479
00:25:12,825 --> 00:25:14,626
- Freeze!
- Freeze!

480
00:25:14,866 --> 00:25:16,146
- Freeze!
- Freeze!

481
00:25:16,386 --> 00:25:18,186
- Catch the bad guy!
- Catch him!

482
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:20,886
Don't move!

483
00:25:21,065 --> 00:25:21,785
Don't move!

484
00:25:22,065 --> 00:25:22,785
Thanks, Mr. Tan.

485
00:25:22,825 --> 00:25:23,426
Catch him!

486
00:25:23,626 --> 00:25:24,585
- Catch him!
- Thank you.

487
00:25:24,585 --> 00:25:26,025
Let me go!

488
00:25:33,585 --> 00:25:35,025
What's wrong with you?

489
00:26:03,946 --> 00:26:04,866
Go to sleep!

490
00:26:05,505 --> 00:26:06,146
Go back!

491
00:26:07,785 --> 00:26:09,906
Mr. Xie, you made it.

492
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:11,825
Your shirt...

493
00:26:12,545 --> 00:26:13,825
It's Ms. Gao's, isn't it?

494
00:26:21,426 --> 00:26:22,186
- I'm fine.
- Lin.

495
00:26:23,025 --> 00:26:24,345
I just strained my back.

496
00:26:29,545 --> 00:26:30,186
Lin,

497
00:26:31,105 --> 00:26:32,426
what were you thinking?

498
00:26:32,706 --> 00:26:34,585
I thought you were really over this.
But you...

499
00:26:36,186 --> 00:26:37,466
You haven't moved on at all.

500
00:26:39,626 --> 00:26:40,825
I can't believe you, Lin.

501
00:26:43,025 --> 00:26:44,866
You know perfectly well

502
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:48,025
she's the spouse
of an active-duty soldier.

503
00:26:48,626 --> 00:26:51,105
You almost broke the criminal law.

504
00:26:51,545 --> 00:26:52,986
Luckily, nothing serious happened.

505
00:26:53,305 --> 00:26:55,545
Otherwise, it would be illegal!

506
00:26:56,186 --> 00:26:57,146
To be frank,

507
00:26:57,986 --> 00:26:58,986
the root of this problem

508
00:27:00,345 --> 00:27:01,745
lies with Li.

509
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:05,386
Me?

510
00:27:08,345 --> 00:27:09,426
Let me lay it out for you.

511
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:11,146
Look,

512
00:27:12,386 --> 00:27:13,825
Li failed

513
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:16,866
to investigate the whole thing
thoroughly at the start,

514
00:27:17,626 --> 00:27:20,305
so it caused a misunderstanding
between Lin Dongfu

515
00:27:20,545 --> 00:27:21,666
and Sun Xiaoyan.

516
00:27:23,626 --> 00:27:24,585
As a result,

517
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:26,706
Lin hasn't moved on yet.

518
00:27:27,825 --> 00:27:28,825
Also,

519
00:27:29,226 --> 00:27:30,466
an honest man like him

520
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:33,226
nearly broke the law.

521
00:27:34,305 --> 00:27:35,146
What do you say?

522
00:27:36,226 --> 00:27:38,545
So you're saying

523
00:27:38,666 --> 00:27:41,025
I almost led him astray?

524
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:43,065
Well, maybe not entirely...

525
00:27:43,065 --> 00:27:45,025
I really have moved on!

526
00:27:45,305 --> 00:27:46,265
It's just that

527
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:47,946
I noticed

528
00:27:47,946 --> 00:27:49,745
Sun Xiaoyan's street cart had a problem.

529
00:27:50,065 --> 00:27:51,186
So, I wanted

530
00:27:51,426 --> 00:27:53,706
to figure out a way
to help her improve it.

531
00:27:54,345 --> 00:27:56,706
Then, it'll be easy for her to open up

532
00:27:56,866 --> 00:27:58,025
or close her stall.

533
00:27:58,386 --> 00:27:59,466
I meant nothing else.

534
00:28:00,025 --> 00:28:02,226
There is no need
for you to go every night.

535
00:28:02,345 --> 00:28:03,545
That's inappropriate.

536
00:28:03,626 --> 00:28:04,585
I was measuring it!

537
00:28:04,585 --> 00:28:06,226
How could I do it when she's using it?

538
00:28:06,305 --> 00:28:07,906
Why didn't you measure others' carts?

539
00:28:07,906 --> 00:28:09,186
You just haven't let go.

540
00:28:09,305 --> 00:28:10,706
Your heart is still full of her.

541
00:28:11,146 --> 00:28:13,666
Seriously, I'm touched. I feel for you!

542
00:28:13,706 --> 00:28:14,906
You're so devoted.

543
00:28:14,906 --> 00:28:16,825
- If I were her...
- I want a closure

544
00:28:16,825 --> 00:28:17,986
for myself, alright?

545
00:28:18,466 --> 00:28:20,186
Mr. Hailuo,

546
00:28:20,906 --> 00:28:22,146
has Mr. Lin gotten over it?

547
00:28:22,946 --> 00:28:23,866
Sure, he has.

548
00:28:24,386 --> 00:28:25,825
How could a man like him

549
00:28:25,825 --> 00:28:27,226
bury something like this inside?

550
00:28:28,505 --> 00:28:29,626
I'm sure he hasn't moved on.

551
00:28:29,745 --> 00:28:30,466
Be quiet!

552
00:28:32,146 --> 00:28:33,906
You're still young.
You don't understand.

553
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:35,065
Lin,

554
00:28:35,265 --> 00:28:36,345
you really shouldn't think

555
00:28:36,345 --> 00:28:38,466
we're criticizing or lecturing you.

556
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:39,065
- Okay!
- You...

557
00:28:39,065 --> 00:28:40,906
I promise! I swear!

558
00:28:41,906 --> 00:28:43,305
From now on,

559
00:28:44,226 --> 00:28:46,146
I'll have nothing
to do with Sun Xiaoyan!

560
00:28:46,305 --> 00:28:46,986
Okay.

561
00:28:47,146 --> 00:28:48,386
We all know that.

562
00:28:48,825 --> 00:28:49,906
Calm down.

563
00:28:49,946 --> 00:28:50,466
Hey.

564
00:28:50,466 --> 00:28:51,105
Calm down.

565
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:51,825
Don't be mad.

566
00:28:51,906 --> 00:28:52,785
It's fine.

567
00:28:52,825 --> 00:28:53,706
It'll be over soon.

568
00:28:57,626 --> 00:29:01,785
Don't eat so much meat,
or you'll get fat.

569
00:29:02,785 --> 00:29:04,906
Come on. Get some meat.

570
00:29:05,386 --> 00:29:06,866
Fine! Meat.

571
00:29:07,025 --> 00:29:08,065
Get some meat.

572
00:29:08,345 --> 00:29:09,785
Look how fat you are now!

573
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:25,906
Mr. Lin,

574
00:29:25,986 --> 00:29:27,345
I made some...

575
00:29:30,986 --> 00:29:32,545
You're almost done.

576
00:29:41,305 --> 00:29:42,505
I can only cook this,

577
00:29:42,545 --> 00:29:44,785
so I made you some wontons.

578
00:29:45,146 --> 00:29:45,745
Well,

579
00:29:46,226 --> 00:29:48,226
I want to thank you
for changing a wheel for me.

580
00:29:48,545 --> 00:29:49,745
It works great. Thanks.

581
00:29:51,186 --> 00:29:51,785
Okay.

582
00:29:52,065 --> 00:29:52,565
Well...

583
00:29:54,265 --> 00:29:55,105
As long as it works.

584
00:30:06,265 --> 00:30:06,765
Well...

585
00:30:07,186 --> 00:30:08,065
Then...

586
00:30:08,545 --> 00:30:09,345
Oh, right.

587
00:30:13,906 --> 00:30:14,426
Oh,

588
00:30:15,226 --> 00:30:15,785
I'm sorry.

589
00:30:16,545 --> 00:30:17,304
For bothering you.

590
00:30:17,906 --> 00:30:18,585
Never mind.

591
00:30:20,065 --> 00:30:20,565
Well...

592
00:30:39,785 --> 00:30:40,626
Well...

593
00:30:44,025 --> 00:30:44,545
Well,

594
00:30:46,866 --> 00:30:47,866
how's your husband doing?

595
00:30:56,666 --> 00:30:57,345
Who?

596
00:30:58,626 --> 00:30:59,226
My husband?

597
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,466
Well...

598
00:31:04,706 --> 00:31:05,206
You...

599
00:31:05,386 --> 00:31:05,906
Xiaoyan.

600
00:31:07,186 --> 00:31:07,706
Ms. Li.

601
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:08,946
May I have a word with you?

602
00:31:16,706 --> 00:31:18,025
Her husband?

603
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:25,906
Xiaoyan, I made a mistake.

604
00:31:26,065 --> 00:31:28,545
I didn't investigate clearly,
causing a misunderstanding.

605
00:31:28,706 --> 00:31:30,545
Now, we fully understand the situation.

606
00:31:30,986 --> 00:31:33,226
Something like this
will never happen again.

607
00:31:33,986 --> 00:31:36,866
Also, Mr. Lin is an honest person,

608
00:31:37,386 --> 00:31:38,626
but he is kind of stubborn.

609
00:31:39,265 --> 00:31:41,545
Once he falls for someone,
it's hard for him to let go.

610
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:45,345
So he means no harm.
Please don't blame him.

611
00:31:48,585 --> 00:31:52,386
Ms. Li, I'm still a bit confused.

612
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:54,345
What exactly happened?

613
00:32:00,866 --> 00:32:03,025
Sun Xiaoyan never got married.

614
00:32:03,706 --> 00:32:06,345
As a woman doing business,
it was inconvenient.

615
00:32:07,345 --> 00:32:08,986
She was constantly harassed.

616
00:32:09,226 --> 00:32:10,785
So she found a photo

617
00:32:10,946 --> 00:32:13,545
and made up a story as self-protection.

618
00:32:13,866 --> 00:32:14,626
Understand now?

619
00:32:15,866 --> 00:32:16,906
Have I made it clear?

620
00:32:17,065 --> 00:32:17,785
Of course.

621
00:32:17,825 --> 00:32:18,545
That's good news!

622
00:32:18,545 --> 00:32:19,045
Good news.

623
00:32:19,065 --> 00:32:20,105
So it's all clear?

624
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:20,666
Sure.

625
00:32:20,745 --> 00:32:21,626
Sure, we all got it.

626
00:32:22,265 --> 00:32:25,126
I wasn't thorough enough in my work,
was I?

627
00:32:25,745 --> 00:32:26,706
Sure, Ms. Li.

628
00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:28,626
I'm about to criticize Xie Chunlai.

629
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:30,986
Listen, learn from Ms. Li.

630
00:32:31,105 --> 00:32:32,065
She inquired thoroughly

631
00:32:32,065 --> 00:32:34,305
and revealed the most accurate result
to everyone.

632
00:32:34,466 --> 00:32:36,946
Look, this is what wisdom comes
from listening widely.

633
00:32:36,946 --> 00:32:38,265
You acted on one-sided messages.

634
00:32:38,265 --> 00:32:40,946
You can't just
believe one side of the story.

635
00:32:40,946 --> 00:32:41,825
I meant well.

636
00:32:42,305 --> 00:32:43,426
- Yes.
- Yet it caused trouble.

637
00:32:43,585 --> 00:32:44,226
True, yeah.

638
00:32:44,305 --> 00:32:47,146
But your mind is always set
on finding fault.

639
00:32:47,345 --> 00:32:47,986
Shouldn't we

640
00:32:47,986 --> 00:32:49,545
be happy for Lin Tofu?

641
00:32:49,545 --> 00:32:50,065
Of course.

642
00:32:50,065 --> 00:32:50,785
What's wrong?

643
00:32:50,946 --> 00:32:51,545
Nothing.

644
00:32:52,265 --> 00:32:53,065
Shouldn't we tell

645
00:32:53,065 --> 00:32:53,986
- Lin Tofu...
- Mr. Xie,

646
00:32:54,065 --> 00:32:55,105
don't blame Tan.

647
00:32:55,825 --> 00:32:59,386
It was my carelessness
and romantic view that messed things up.

648
00:32:59,626 --> 00:33:01,305
Yes, that's what Mr. Zheng meant.

649
00:33:01,545 --> 00:33:02,545
Yes.

650
00:33:05,825 --> 00:33:08,065
Look at me, how foolish I am.

651
00:33:08,265 --> 00:33:09,505
The older I get,

652
00:33:09,505 --> 00:33:10,505
the stupider I become.

653
00:33:10,706 --> 00:33:11,785
Such an important file.

654
00:33:11,785 --> 00:33:13,305
I should've delivered it myself.

655
00:33:13,626 --> 00:33:14,226
I forgot.

656
00:33:14,265 --> 00:33:14,986
(File Box)
Almost.

657
00:33:15,466 --> 00:33:16,345
I'll go deliver it.

658
00:33:16,785 --> 00:33:18,025
Mr. Zheng, this is mine.

659
00:33:18,146 --> 00:33:18,986
You didn't bring it.

660
00:33:19,025 --> 00:33:19,626
Not your file.

661
00:33:19,626 --> 00:33:20,585
It's not your file.

662
00:33:20,585 --> 00:33:21,626
- Sit down.
- Not mine?

663
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:22,626
Keep peeling the shrimp.

664
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:23,386
Not your file.

665
00:33:23,386 --> 00:33:23,946
Keep peeling.

666
00:33:25,825 --> 00:33:27,105
What's your take, Mr. Zheng?

667
00:33:28,146 --> 00:33:28,646
Yes.

668
00:33:28,825 --> 00:33:29,545
Go on.

669
00:33:32,906 --> 00:33:33,406
Right,

670
00:33:33,585 --> 00:33:35,986
I actually have something to say to you.

671
00:33:37,585 --> 00:33:38,085
Ms. Li,

672
00:33:38,505 --> 00:33:40,706
on this matter, I have to criticize you.

673
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:41,986
Look,

674
00:33:42,466 --> 00:33:44,906
within the entire government,

675
00:33:45,105 --> 00:33:46,466
you're the one I trust most.

676
00:33:46,866 --> 00:33:49,886
But how could you
not believe in yourself?

677
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,785
If you believe what you think is right,

678
00:33:51,986 --> 00:33:52,825
you must insist

679
00:33:53,345 --> 00:33:54,426
that you are right,

680
00:33:54,545 --> 00:33:55,906
while the rest of us are wrong.

681
00:33:56,265 --> 00:33:58,265
If you give up easily,

682
00:33:58,505 --> 00:33:59,545
shouldn't you

683
00:33:59,825 --> 00:34:01,386
reflect on yourself?

684
00:34:02,105 --> 00:34:02,605
Right?

685
00:34:03,065 --> 00:34:03,626
Alright.

686
00:34:03,785 --> 00:34:04,466
Then, Mr. Zheng,

687
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:06,906
don't come to me
for this kind of matter anymore.

688
00:34:07,065 --> 00:34:08,185
I won't intervene anymore.

689
00:34:08,786 --> 00:34:10,225
You can come to me.

690
00:34:10,306 --> 00:34:10,986
Ms. Li.

691
00:34:12,105 --> 00:34:12,665
Ms. Li,

692
00:34:12,665 --> 00:34:13,426
don't be angry.

693
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:14,185
I'm not angry.

694
00:34:14,505 --> 00:34:15,386
You look angry.

695
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,105
We all meant well.

696
00:34:16,105 --> 00:34:16,866
What's so funny?

697
00:34:17,025 --> 00:34:17,525
You...

698
00:34:18,266 --> 00:34:20,306
Who put the shrimp heads in here?

699
00:34:20,346 --> 00:34:20,846
Xie!

700
00:34:20,906 --> 00:34:22,306
Are you all blind?

701
00:34:29,065 --> 00:34:31,346
Yan, this is yours.

702
00:34:31,585 --> 00:34:32,826
I'm giving it back for Mr. Lin.

703
00:34:33,346 --> 00:34:35,185
Ms. Li,
you don't have to do it personally.

704
00:34:35,225 --> 00:34:36,386
I could've gotten it back.

705
00:34:36,665 --> 00:34:38,105
Same as usual? Ten wontons, right?

706
00:34:38,705 --> 00:34:40,426
No, I won't have the wontons.

707
00:34:40,786 --> 00:34:42,505
I'd like to say something to you.

708
00:34:42,906 --> 00:34:44,466
Anyway, you're not busy now.

709
00:34:44,826 --> 00:34:45,592
Let's sit and talk.

710
00:34:45,705 --> 00:34:46,346
Alright.

711
00:34:54,466 --> 00:34:55,185
Here's the thing.

712
00:34:56,225 --> 00:34:58,826
Regarding cadres' personal issue,

713
00:34:59,866 --> 00:35:00,946
like finding a partner,

714
00:35:01,585 --> 00:35:02,746
sometimes,

715
00:35:03,025 --> 00:35:04,426
we, as comrades, need to

716
00:35:04,466 --> 00:35:06,346
step in and help resolve it.

717
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:12,466
Well, Lin Dongfu

718
00:35:12,585 --> 00:35:15,545
excels in character and ability.

719
00:35:16,585 --> 00:35:17,746
We're quite concerned

720
00:35:18,346 --> 00:35:20,266
about his personal life.

721
00:35:23,906 --> 00:35:26,185
So I want to introduce him to you.

722
00:35:26,705 --> 00:35:28,306
I'd like to get your opinion.

723
00:35:29,746 --> 00:35:30,826
To me?

724
00:35:30,986 --> 00:35:31,585
Yes.

725
00:35:35,346 --> 00:35:36,105
It's fine.

726
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:37,665
If you feel he is not suitable,

727
00:35:37,986 --> 00:35:39,786
I'll just introduce him
to another woman.

728
00:35:41,145 --> 00:35:44,466
Ever since Mr. Lin was featured
in the newspaper,

729
00:35:44,746 --> 00:35:46,665
many women have shown interest in him.

730
00:35:47,306 --> 00:35:49,585
They've come to us
to ask about his personal details.

731
00:35:49,906 --> 00:35:51,866
It puts us in a difficult position.

732
00:35:52,306 --> 00:35:53,185
So I plan

733
00:35:53,386 --> 00:35:55,426
to prioritize his date
based on his preferences.

734
00:35:57,225 --> 00:35:58,185
- Madam.
- So I...

735
00:35:58,306 --> 00:35:59,145
Two bowls of wontons.

736
00:35:59,786 --> 00:36:00,346
Okay.

737
00:36:38,545 --> 00:36:39,105
Alright then.

738
00:36:39,145 --> 00:36:41,065
I've understood your thoughts.

739
00:36:42,145 --> 00:36:44,306
So I'll quickly
arrange another blind date for him.

740
00:36:50,746 --> 00:36:51,386
Ms. Li.

741
00:36:54,266 --> 00:36:54,906
Yes?

742
00:36:57,505 --> 00:36:58,946
Mr. Lin is a good man.

743
00:36:59,826 --> 00:37:02,306
Honestly,
I never considered this before.

744
00:37:02,866 --> 00:37:04,225
As you know, I have a child.

745
00:37:04,786 --> 00:37:05,866
Don't worry about that.

746
00:37:06,505 --> 00:37:09,225
I've already talked to Mr. Lin about it.

747
00:37:09,266 --> 00:37:10,306
He doesn't mind at all.

748
00:37:12,786 --> 00:37:13,346
So?

749
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:15,346
What's your decision?

750
00:37:17,946 --> 00:37:19,105
I'll follow your arrangement.

751
00:37:21,386 --> 00:37:21,886
Alright.

752
00:37:22,705 --> 00:37:24,665
I'll make arrangements right away.

753
00:37:29,786 --> 00:37:31,346
One moment, you look at me.

754
00:37:33,065 --> 00:37:33,986
Don't look at me.

755
00:37:33,986 --> 00:37:35,346
You write it down.

756
00:37:35,826 --> 00:37:36,866
It's a form of expression.

757
00:37:37,746 --> 00:37:41,585
One moment, you look at me.

758
00:37:41,986 --> 00:37:42,486
Yes.

759
00:37:42,986 --> 00:37:45,185
Then, you look at the clouds.

760
00:37:45,786 --> 00:37:46,946
Who exactly should she watch?

761
00:37:47,225 --> 00:37:48,065
The clouds.

762
00:37:48,346 --> 00:37:49,786
Don't rush, Mr. Tan.

763
00:37:50,105 --> 00:37:50,746
Well, it...

764
00:37:51,225 --> 00:37:51,725
Alright.

765
00:37:51,806 --> 00:37:52,306
Let's start

766
00:37:52,306 --> 00:37:53,505
from the last paragraph.

767
00:37:54,386 --> 00:37:56,946
I've crossed bridges in many places.

768
00:37:57,545 --> 00:37:58,786
I've...

769
00:37:58,866 --> 00:38:00,505
What bridge is this?

770
00:38:02,665 --> 00:38:04,426
Come on. Does it matter?

771
00:38:04,585 --> 00:38:05,906
That's not the point.

772
00:38:05,906 --> 00:38:08,346
Here's the point. I only love you,

773
00:38:08,946 --> 00:38:11,545
who have blue skies in your eyes.

774
00:38:12,786 --> 00:38:13,786
Blue skies in eyes?

775
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:14,826
Don't be silly.

776
00:38:14,906 --> 00:38:15,866
Your eyes are black.

777
00:38:15,906 --> 00:38:16,946
You're not a foreigner.

778
00:38:16,966 --> 00:38:18,585
Mr. Tan, it's a figurative expression.

779
00:38:18,585 --> 00:38:20,585
Misty poetry!
Don't you understand misty poetry?

780
00:38:20,705 --> 00:38:23,065
Yan has blue skies

781
00:38:25,545 --> 00:38:26,705
in her eyes.

782
00:38:31,065 --> 00:38:32,185
Then,

783
00:38:32,225 --> 00:38:33,505
do you dare to say

784
00:38:33,786 --> 00:38:35,545
that line to her face?

785
00:38:38,786 --> 00:38:39,505
You don't, huh?

786
00:38:40,105 --> 00:38:42,306
What's so hard? Come on.

787
00:38:42,306 --> 00:38:43,625
Listen, Chinese people

788
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:44,826
prefer subtle expressions.

789
00:38:44,826 --> 00:38:45,585
I'm not an expert,

790
00:38:45,625 --> 00:38:46,705
but I think Chinese people

791
00:38:46,906 --> 00:38:49,906
express affection indirectly.

792
00:38:51,225 --> 00:38:52,312
Classical poetry is good.

793
00:38:52,966 --> 00:38:53,466
Right.

794
00:38:53,466 --> 00:38:54,986
I just thought of something.

795
00:38:56,065 --> 00:38:58,786
The romantic poem,
A Male Phoenix Seeks His Mate, is great.

796
00:38:59,426 --> 00:38:59,926
What?

797
00:39:00,145 --> 00:39:02,466
A Male Phoenix Seeks His Mate.

798
00:39:02,466 --> 00:39:05,266
There is a beauty.

799
00:39:06,065 --> 00:39:08,105
There is a beauty.

800
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:10,545
I've seen and never forgotten.

801
00:39:11,065 --> 00:39:13,065
Well...

802
00:39:13,386 --> 00:39:14,025
I've...

803
00:39:19,746 --> 00:39:20,746
Hello, Mr. Lin.

804
00:39:21,145 --> 00:39:22,585
Hello, Mr. Lin.

805
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:23,466
Hello.

806
00:39:35,826 --> 00:39:36,625
How can I help you?

807
00:39:38,906 --> 00:39:39,906
No, thanks.

808
00:39:51,866 --> 00:39:53,585
So beautiful.

809
00:39:56,306 --> 00:39:56,866
Lili,

810
00:39:58,225 --> 00:40:00,025
isn't this excessive?

811
00:40:00,105 --> 00:40:01,145
No, trust me.

812
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:03,386
This style was designed just for you.

813
00:40:03,426 --> 00:40:04,505
It suits you perfectly.

814
00:40:04,866 --> 00:40:05,826
Just be patient.

815
00:40:08,346 --> 00:40:09,786
Maybe I should quit.

816
00:40:10,025 --> 00:40:10,866
Don't.

817
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:12,625
Wait a moment. It'll be done soon!

818
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:14,466
There is a beauty.

819
00:40:15,266 --> 00:40:15,766
I've seen...

820
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:16,466
Lili.

821
00:40:17,025 --> 00:40:17,786
Don't move!

822
00:40:17,866 --> 00:40:18,906
- Don't move!
- You leave.

823
00:40:19,065 --> 00:40:19,826
Wait!

824
00:40:19,826 --> 00:40:20,505
No time!

825
00:40:20,665 --> 00:40:21,306
Come on!

826
00:40:21,665 --> 00:40:22,165
You leave.

827
00:40:22,306 --> 00:40:22,946
It's too late.

828
00:40:22,986 --> 00:40:23,826
I'm taking it off.

829
00:40:23,946 --> 00:40:25,065
I'll take it off.

830
00:40:30,505 --> 00:40:31,225
This way.

831
00:40:31,665 --> 00:40:32,306
My stuff...

832
00:40:32,466 --> 00:40:33,225
I'll give it back.

833
00:40:33,266 --> 00:40:33,866
