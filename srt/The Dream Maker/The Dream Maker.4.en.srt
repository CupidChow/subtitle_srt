=Episode 4=

16
00:01:38,706 --> 00:01:39,747
The economy is struggling.

17
00:01:40,506 --> 00:01:42,168
We have no money
for building Yuehai City.

18
00:01:42,426 --> 00:01:42,946
So,

19
00:01:43,706 --> 00:01:44,946
the town Part committee

20
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:47,146
has decided to impose

21
00:01:47,506 --> 00:01:48,506
a city construction fee.

22
00:01:49,226 --> 00:01:49,827
Mr. Zheng,

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,426
(Land Use Certificate)
what about the land use certificates?

24
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:55,346
Mr. Cai,

25
00:01:56,187 --> 00:01:58,387
is there an issue
with these land use certificates?

26
00:01:58,706 --> 00:01:59,667
From what I understand,

27
00:02:00,586 --> 00:02:01,907
our County Land Bureau

28
00:02:01,946 --> 00:02:04,146
has never issued such certificates.

29
00:02:04,786 --> 00:02:06,426
Who designed these certificates?

30
00:02:07,992 --> 00:02:09,592
Those who paid the city construction fee

31
00:02:09,906 --> 00:02:11,107
and got household registration

32
00:02:11,547 --> 00:02:13,107
need a certificate from us.

33
00:02:13,706 --> 00:02:16,306
So we designed
these land use certificates.

34
00:02:16,947 --> 00:02:17,947
But don't worry,

35
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:20,827
we've applied to the County Land Bureau.

36
00:02:21,227 --> 00:02:22,186
Once approved,

37
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:24,547
we'll replace them
with official land certificates.

38
00:02:28,466 --> 00:02:30,146
Regardless
of the certificate's compliance,

39
00:02:30,586 --> 00:02:34,067
collecting money from farmers
is land selling.

40
00:02:34,586 --> 00:02:35,947
This so-called 'construction fee'

41
00:02:36,107 --> 00:02:38,426
is just a pretext or an excuse

42
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:39,947
circumventing the Constitution.

43
00:02:40,306 --> 00:02:40,866
Mr. Zheng,

44
00:02:41,466 --> 00:02:42,827
the nature is different.

45
00:02:42,947 --> 00:02:44,706
This is illegal. Do you understand?

46
00:02:46,067 --> 00:02:47,787
Are you here to investigate

47
00:02:48,107 --> 00:02:49,466
or to frame our cadres?

48
00:02:50,706 --> 00:02:52,227
I refuse this investigation.

49
00:02:52,827 --> 00:02:53,827
I'm going to the county.

50
00:02:54,186 --> 00:02:56,026
Someone in charge needs to hear us out.

51
00:02:56,267 --> 00:02:57,947
No one can help you, Mr. Zheng.

52
00:02:58,067 --> 00:03:00,507
Your actions constitute land selling.

53
00:03:04,067 --> 00:03:06,586
Higher authorities
gave Yuehai no construction funds.

54
00:03:07,026 --> 00:03:08,987
Do you know
how massive the expenses are?

55
00:03:09,626 --> 00:03:11,067
Do you have better solutions?

56
00:03:11,426 --> 00:03:13,987
You don't understand the difficulties.

57
00:03:14,426 --> 00:03:16,387
We know construction is challenging,

58
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,520
but constitutional violations

59
00:03:18,746 --> 00:03:20,186
could halt the entire project.

60
00:03:20,547 --> 00:03:22,667
Your anger solves nothing, Mr. Zheng.

61
00:03:23,107 --> 00:03:25,706
Surely you didn't want this outcome?

62
00:03:26,186 --> 00:03:29,466
You must explain
the city construction fee.

63
00:03:37,626 --> 00:03:39,067
I have nothing to explain.

64
00:03:40,827 --> 00:03:41,947
I didn't sell any land.

65
00:03:43,507 --> 00:03:45,227
Then answer another question.

66
00:03:45,787 --> 00:03:48,626
You planned to collect city construction fees
from the 'monkeys.'

67
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:50,787
Yet credit union records show

68
00:03:51,186 --> 00:03:52,387
you borrowed 300,000 yuan

69
00:03:52,547 --> 00:03:54,107
before collecting any fees.

70
00:03:54,507 --> 00:03:55,626
How do you explain this?

71
00:03:56,146 --> 00:03:56,646
Yes,

72
00:03:57,626 --> 00:03:59,267
I intended to collect
from the 'monkeys,'

73
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:01,146
but it takes a good nest

74
00:04:01,387 --> 00:04:02,586
to attract the phoenix.

75
00:04:03,626 --> 00:04:04,746
So we took loans

76
00:04:05,387 --> 00:04:06,866
to build proper roads

77
00:04:07,466 --> 00:04:09,947
to entice the 'monkeys.'

78
00:04:10,706 --> 00:04:11,206
Right?

79
00:04:14,507 --> 00:04:16,107
Yu, are the markers set?

80
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,006
All set.

81
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,266
Help me steady this stake.

82
00:04:18,787 --> 00:04:19,907
- Okay.
- It isn't stable.

83
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:21,667
Coming.

84
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:23,566
Seriously,

85
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:24,806
leader,

86
00:04:25,707 --> 00:04:28,467
don't we have theodolites
or rangefinders?

87
00:04:29,752 --> 00:04:31,096
(Deep ranging)
No budget for those.

88
00:04:31,096 --> 00:04:32,547
I'm doing fieldwork with you.

89
00:04:32,826 --> 00:04:33,626
We're short-staffed.

90
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:35,587
This will take forever.

91
00:04:35,987 --> 00:04:36,907
Less talking.

92
00:04:36,907 --> 00:04:37,626
Hold it steady.

93
00:04:38,207 --> 00:04:39,746
We need to finish before dark.

94
00:04:40,186 --> 00:04:41,407
Got it.

95
00:04:42,107 --> 00:04:42,607
Come on.

96
00:04:43,987 --> 00:04:44,506
Hold it.

97
00:04:44,587 --> 00:04:45,087
Holding.

98
00:04:47,347 --> 00:04:49,977
I wonder if Mr. Zheng and Xie
can get the loan

99
00:04:50,104 --> 00:04:51,027
from the credit union.

100
00:05:51,946 --> 00:05:54,626
So all 300,000 went to roads?

101
00:05:55,386 --> 00:05:59,147
And you plan to repay it
with money from the 'monkeys'?

102
00:05:59,587 --> 00:06:00,107
Of course.

103
00:06:01,066 --> 00:06:02,787
That's the optimal outcome.

104
00:06:03,306 --> 00:06:05,147
So you've traded land for cash?

105
00:06:06,787 --> 00:06:07,547
What are you doing?

106
00:06:12,907 --> 00:06:13,547
Is lunch

107
00:06:14,626 --> 00:06:15,547
happening today?

108
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:19,987
It's about time.

109
00:06:21,787 --> 00:06:22,287
Lunch.

110
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,886
Nobody move. No one eats.

111
00:06:26,506 --> 00:06:27,107
Nobody move.

112
00:06:29,186 --> 00:06:29,987
Lunch is a must.

113
00:06:30,227 --> 00:06:32,707
We can skip it, but Lin must eat.

114
00:06:32,946 --> 00:06:34,744
His low blood sugar can't handle it.

115
00:06:35,287 --> 00:06:36,946
My job is ensuring nobody moves.

116
00:06:37,907 --> 00:06:38,626
Nobody move.

117
00:06:39,547 --> 00:06:40,107
Chief Tian,

118
00:06:40,426 --> 00:06:43,027
if it complies with regulations,
let him eat first.

119
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:44,167
Well,

120
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:46,506
it does comply.

121
00:06:47,347 --> 00:06:48,347
Alright then, Li.

122
00:06:48,707 --> 00:06:49,987
He can eat alone first.

123
00:06:50,107 --> 00:06:50,667
Alright?

124
00:06:50,707 --> 00:06:51,467
Okay.

125
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:53,587
Alright, you eat first then.

126
00:06:53,907 --> 00:06:54,626
But don't leave.

127
00:07:07,907 --> 00:07:09,907
You haven't answered
my question, Mr. Zheng.

128
00:07:10,707 --> 00:07:12,027
If not land for money,

129
00:07:12,506 --> 00:07:13,347
then what for?

130
00:07:17,266 --> 00:07:19,066
(Free Clinics for All)
Someone asked just now.

131
00:07:19,746 --> 00:07:21,946
(Making the New City Healthy)
If we build our own houses,

132
00:07:22,147 --> 00:07:23,787
(Yuehai Plan)
4,000 or 5,000 yuan is enough.

133
00:07:24,227 --> 00:07:25,667
Why pay extra?

134
00:07:26,347 --> 00:07:27,987
But have you considered this?

135
00:07:28,386 --> 00:07:29,667
If you build that house,

136
00:07:29,707 --> 00:07:31,306
it's just a house.

137
00:07:31,707 --> 00:07:33,506
There is nothing around it.

138
00:07:33,907 --> 00:07:34,746
Is there a hospital?

139
00:07:35,147 --> 00:07:36,107
- No.
- No.

140
00:07:36,227 --> 00:07:37,306
Is there a school?

141
00:07:37,547 --> 00:07:38,467
No.

142
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:40,587
Most importantly, are there roads?

143
00:07:41,186 --> 00:07:42,027
- No.
- No.

144
00:07:42,266 --> 00:07:44,866
Our town government
will handle all these things.

145
00:07:45,227 --> 00:07:47,866
We promise
to build them properly and beautifully.

146
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:50,467
Then everyone's property value
will increase.

147
00:07:50,626 --> 00:07:51,946
It'll become valuable, right?

148
00:07:52,266 --> 00:07:53,066
What's the value?

149
00:07:53,066 --> 00:07:54,227
Really?

150
00:07:55,066 --> 00:07:55,987
It's a scam, isn't it?

151
00:07:55,987 --> 00:07:56,787
Really?

152
00:07:56,787 --> 00:07:58,066

created this for all of you.

157
00:08:07,147 --> 00:08:09,112
(Land Use Certificate)
a temporary land use certificate.

158
00:08:09,112 --> 00:08:10,264
It's stamped.

159
00:08:10,426 --> 00:08:12,266
After everyone pays,

160
00:08:12,707 --> 00:08:15,266
we'll go to the county and exchange them

161
00:08:15,547 --> 00:08:18,707

land use certificates.

Great. Stop.

166
00:08:51,427 --> 00:08:51,947
Stop.

167
00:08:54,026 --> 00:08:55,107
Stop. Okay, take a break.

168
00:08:55,266 --> 00:08:56,707
Take a break. Have some water.

169
00:08:57,947 --> 00:08:59,386
Alright.

It's good.

by gathering you all at this place,

175
00:09:07,467 --> 00:09:08,307
I want to tell you

176

the Yuehai city construction

177
00:09:11,827 --> 00:09:13,067
will be the real good show.

178
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:14,506
Just wait and see.

179
00:09:14,746 --> 00:09:17,766
Since we're all gathered here today,

180
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,386
as the deputy mayor,

181
00:09:19,587 --> 00:09:20,666
I'd like to invite you all

182
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:22,746
to go into the city together. Okay?

183
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,026
We want the show.

184
00:09:24,026 --> 00:09:24,947
Get down now.

185
00:09:25,347 --> 00:09:27,347
- Hurry down. Get down.
- Get down.

186
00:09:27,347 --> 00:09:27,866
Okay.

187
00:09:28,146 --> 00:09:29,666
Right, let's watch the show.

00:09:31,187 --> 00:09:31,827
The show.

00:09:32,487 --> 00:09:32,987
The show.

191
00:09:32,987 --> 00:09:34,227
You want the show, don't you?

192
00:09:34,546 --> 00:09:35,046
Alright.

193
00:09:35,227 --> 00:09:36,626
Come on. Watch the show.

194
00:09:36,626 --> 00:09:37,347
Get down.

195
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:39,786
Is it good?

196
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:41,626
If it's good, sign up quickly.

197
00:09:41,947 --> 00:09:43,906
We were clear in our publicity.

198
00:09:44,786 --> 00:09:45,987
This is a construction fee.

199
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,187
For Yuehai's entire development.

200
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:50,746
As for usage details,

201
00:09:51,626 --> 00:09:53,107
we're completely transparent.

202
00:09:53,587 --> 00:09:54,666
I get it, Mr. Zheng.

203
00:09:55,107 --> 00:09:55,987
But frankly speaking,

204
00:09:56,307 --> 00:09:58,187
you're using city construction
as an excuse

205
00:09:58,386 --> 00:10:01,427
to collect an extra
'city construction fee.'

206
00:10:02,187 --> 00:10:03,546
That's twisting definitions.

207
00:10:04,506 --> 00:10:06,107
How am I twisting definitions?

208
00:10:06,347 --> 00:10:07,746
We have theoretical backing.

209
00:10:07,746 --> 00:10:08,347
Sit down.

210
00:10:09,386 --> 00:10:10,467
I can slam tables too.

211
00:10:10,707 --> 00:10:12,427
What's your theoretical backing?
Explain.

212
00:10:16,506 --> 00:10:18,026
I won't explain to you.

213
00:10:18,746 --> 00:10:20,967
I'll talk to someone reasonable.

214
00:10:21,626 --> 00:10:22,427
Zheng Decheng, stop.

215
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:26,187
Xie, give me the motorcycle keys.
I'm going to the county committee.

216
00:10:26,187 --> 00:10:26,827
Mr. Zheng.

217
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:27,546
What's up?

218
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:28,546
The talk failed?

219
00:10:28,546 --> 00:10:29,227
Zheng Decheng...

220
00:10:29,266 --> 00:10:30,386
Hold the fort. Wait for me.

221
00:10:30,707 --> 00:10:31,546
What's this about?

222
00:10:31,546 --> 00:10:32,427
Tian, watch them.

223
00:10:32,427 --> 00:10:33,976
Said he'll visit the county committee.

224
00:10:33,976 --> 00:10:35,160
To see the leadership

225
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,227
(Yuehai Town People's Government)
and report things.

226
00:10:36,227 --> 00:10:36,760
Right?

227
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:42,488
What are you doing?

228
00:10:42,488 --> 00:10:44,344
Returning to the county to report work.

229
00:10:46,987 --> 00:10:49,546
Li, men and women
shouldn't be overly familiar.

230
00:10:49,752 --> 00:10:52,166
It's not appropriate for you
to ride on my motorcycle, okay?

231
00:10:52,546 --> 00:10:53,666
I know it's not appropriate.

232
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:54,827
But I have no choice.

233
00:10:55,266 --> 00:10:56,706
They didn't assign us a vehicle.

234
00:10:56,706 --> 00:10:57,707
Mr. Zhao instructed us

235
00:10:57,707 --> 00:11:00,347
to return to the county
to report before sunset.

236
00:11:00,746 --> 00:11:02,067
So, let's go, Mr. Zheng.

237
00:11:04,427 --> 00:11:06,207
Then what about Mr. Cai
and the other one?

238
00:11:06,546 --> 00:11:07,896
They'll figure it out themselves.

239
00:11:11,786 --> 00:11:12,286
Fine.

240
00:11:12,827 --> 00:11:14,187
But let me be blunt upfront.

241
00:11:14,626 --> 00:11:17,146
If anything happens,
I won't take responsibility.

242
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:20,866
You actually need
to be responsible for my safety.

243
00:11:26,948 --> 00:11:28,268
(Yuehai Town People's Government)

244
00:11:28,268 --> 00:11:29,528
(The CPC Yuehai Town Committee)

245
00:11:37,227 --> 00:11:38,026
Li,

246
00:11:38,347 --> 00:11:40,347
is it because you
lost the competition to me

247
00:11:40,786 --> 00:11:41,987
that you resent me a bit?

248
00:11:43,906 --> 00:11:46,427
Zheng, saying that makes you petty.

249
00:11:46,987 --> 00:11:48,866
I'm only concerned
about the people of Yuehai.

250
00:11:49,307 --> 00:11:50,746
Afraid you'll burden them.

251
00:11:52,987 --> 00:11:53,947
Burden them how?

252
00:11:54,386 --> 00:11:55,427
I've told you already.

253
00:11:55,786 --> 00:11:56,827
We didn't sell any land.

254
00:12:06,467 --> 00:12:07,026
Mr. Zheng.

255
00:12:09,427 --> 00:12:09,947
Mr. Zheng.

256
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,146
Eat something, alright?

257
00:12:13,707 --> 00:12:15,546
What exactly are you looking for?

258
00:12:15,626 --> 00:12:16,587
Theoretical backing.

259
00:12:18,386 --> 00:12:19,067
To sell land?

260
00:12:19,427 --> 00:12:20,626
No. It's illegal.

261
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:21,626
We can't do that.

262
00:12:21,626 --> 00:12:23,347
Really, Mr. Zheng. We absolutely can't.

263
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:25,386
Tan.

264
00:12:26,266 --> 00:12:28,467
I would never do anything illegal.

265
00:12:29,546 --> 00:12:30,046
Okay.

266
00:12:30,107 --> 00:12:31,427
When I first formed the team,

267
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:31,967
I hired you

268
00:12:31,987 --> 00:12:33,307
precisely to rein me in a bit.

269
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:34,546
Right.

270
00:12:34,707 --> 00:12:35,786
I am reining you in.

271
00:12:35,866 --> 00:12:37,528
Listen to my advice.

272
00:12:37,528 --> 00:12:38,616
We absolutely can't do that

273
00:12:39,067 --> 00:12:39,906
or think about it.

274
00:12:40,187 --> 00:12:41,506
How am I not listening to you?

275
00:12:42,266 --> 00:12:42,766
Alright.

276
00:12:43,546 --> 00:12:44,707
Come up with an idea for me.

277
00:12:45,026 --> 00:12:46,427
How can we collect money

278
00:12:46,947 --> 00:12:49,026
and allocate land
to the 'monkeys' to build houses

279
00:12:49,546 --> 00:12:51,227
without violating the Constitution?

280
00:12:51,786 --> 00:12:52,286
Tell me.

281
00:12:54,786 --> 00:12:56,107
Then... Then how about...

282
00:12:56,107 --> 00:12:56,607
I...

283
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,626
I'll join you
in finding the theoretical backing.

284
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:00,646
Come on.

285
00:13:01,587 --> 00:13:02,467
(The Story of Hardoon)
Have you read this book?

286
00:13:03,506 --> 00:13:04,006
No.

287
00:13:05,626 --> 00:13:06,707
Hardoon said...

288
00:13:06,866 --> 00:13:08,587
The very Hardoon here.

289
00:13:09,067 --> 00:13:10,666
He said, after buying land,

290
00:13:11,146 --> 00:13:12,467
his first choice

291
00:13:12,467 --> 00:13:14,266
was to lease the entire land to others.

292
00:13:14,786 --> 00:13:16,187
He not only collected rent,

293
00:13:16,307 --> 00:13:18,866
but also, after the contract expired,

294
00:13:19,128 --> 00:13:21,400
he could reclaim both the land
and the buildings on it.

295
00:13:21,906 --> 00:13:22,947
What does that mean?

296
00:13:23,026 --> 00:13:23,736
Wait, Mr. Zheng.

297
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,107
What that means doesn't matter.

298
00:13:25,546 --> 00:13:26,427
How could we

299
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:28,347
possibly follow what Hardoon did?

300
00:13:28,546 --> 00:13:29,506
We're in a new era now.

301
00:13:29,646 --> 00:13:30,146
Well,

302
00:13:30,146 --> 00:13:32,067
the theory in this book
absolutely won't do.

303
00:13:32,307 --> 00:13:32,947
Drop the idea.

304
00:13:33,026 --> 00:13:34,386
Let's look in another book.

305
00:13:34,746 --> 00:13:36,026
As useful as saying nothing.

306
00:13:36,906 --> 00:13:39,386
But you haven't found
the theoretical backing.

307
00:13:40,146 --> 00:13:41,307
It's not that easy.

308
00:13:43,386 --> 00:13:45,467
So isn't this
still circumventing the Constitution?

309
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:46,827
Think whatever you want.

310
00:13:47,347 --> 00:13:49,016
I know the Constitution better.

311
00:13:52,827 --> 00:13:55,427
Article 10 of the Constitution
of the People's Republic of China.

312
00:13:55,427 --> 00:13:57,146
Land in the cities
is owned by the state.

313
00:13:57,467 --> 00:13:59,307
The state holds ownership of the land

314
00:13:59,427 --> 00:14:00,707
and has the right to manage

315
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:02,168
and utilize it according to law.

316
00:14:02,168 --> 00:14:03,480
No organization or individual

317
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,947
may appropriate, buy, sell,

318
00:14:05,307 --> 00:14:07,866
or otherwise transfer land
by unlawful means.

319
00:14:17,587 --> 00:14:18,187
Zheng Decheng,

320
00:14:19,704 --> 00:14:21,080
you've memorized the Constitution?

321
00:14:21,304 --> 00:14:23,256
You're like someone
from Journey to the West.

322
00:14:23,626 --> 00:14:24,187
Sun Wukong.

323
00:14:24,626 --> 00:14:26,264
I sent you to Yuehai to build a city,

324
00:14:26,264 --> 00:14:28,707
not to turn it into a lawless place.

325
00:14:29,107 --> 00:14:30,307
Do you take us for fools

326
00:14:30,347 --> 00:14:31,546
from the county committee?

327
00:14:31,827 --> 00:14:32,587
See for yourself.

328
00:14:33,146 --> 00:14:35,347
Anyone can see you're inventing excuses.

329
00:14:36,026 --> 00:14:36,526
Look.

330
00:14:36,746 --> 00:14:38,386
Mr. Zhao, your misunderstanding

331
00:14:38,506 --> 00:14:39,587
is huge.

332
00:14:40,067 --> 00:14:40,567
I...

333
00:14:40,786 --> 00:14:42,866
How could you possibly look like a fool?

334
00:14:43,187 --> 00:14:44,386
You're a man of great wisdom.

335
00:14:44,906 --> 00:14:46,146
Even if I were Sun Wukong,

336
00:14:46,187 --> 00:14:48,026
I couldn't escape your grasp, could I?

337
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:49,347
I admit it.

338
00:14:49,866 --> 00:14:51,266
This matter does look

339
00:14:51,587 --> 00:14:52,947
somewhat like land trading.

340
00:14:53,427 --> 00:14:54,827
But there's a key difference.

341
00:14:55,347 --> 00:14:57,427
It's based on my rigorous research.

342
00:14:59,626 --> 00:15:00,626
What rigorous research?

343
00:15:10,987 --> 00:15:11,587
Tan.

344
00:15:13,227 --> 00:15:14,266
I thought of another term.

345
00:15:14,746 --> 00:15:15,347
Listen.

346
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,307
Land transfer fee.

347
00:15:21,746 --> 00:15:23,506
Land transfer fee?

348
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:24,166
How is it?

349
00:15:24,987 --> 00:15:25,506
No.

350
00:15:25,746 --> 00:15:26,666
Absolutely not.

351
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:27,746
This won't do.

352
00:15:27,987 --> 00:15:30,227
Nothing ever seems to be allowed.

353
00:15:30,546 --> 00:15:31,786
You just keep discouraging me.

354
00:15:32,146 --> 00:15:32,906
You think of one.

355
00:15:35,307 --> 00:15:37,386
I can't think of anything right now.

356
00:15:38,026 --> 00:15:40,146
But Mr. Zheng,
I'm reading this book set now.

357
00:15:40,146 --> 00:15:41,227
There must be an answer.

358
00:15:46,482 --> 00:15:47,608
(Das Kapital, Marx)

359
00:15:53,427 --> 00:15:54,307
Das Kapital?

360
00:15:59,347 --> 00:16:00,107
Das Kapital?

361
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:02,087
Yes.

362
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,824
Why did I think of
the city construction fee?

363
00:16:04,824 --> 00:16:06,187
It came from Das Kapital.

364
00:16:06,587 --> 00:16:08,626
Das Kapital
provides the theoretical backing.

365
00:16:10,187 --> 00:16:11,947
There's one thing I don't understand.

366
00:16:12,307 --> 00:16:15,026
Which volume of Das Kapital
provided the theoretical backing?

367
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:18,666
How could I remember that?

368
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:19,352
Too many volumes.

369
00:16:19,987 --> 00:16:20,587
But it's there.

370
00:16:21,266 --> 00:16:21,786
Really.

371
00:16:23,266 --> 00:16:24,906
There are three volumes in Das Kapital.

372
00:16:25,227 --> 00:16:27,626
Volume one examines
the production process of capital.

373
00:16:27,707 --> 00:16:30,026
Volume two studies
the circulation process of capital.

374
00:16:30,427 --> 00:16:33,626
Volume three describes
capitalist production's overall process.

375
00:16:33,906 --> 00:16:34,546
Mr. Zheng,

376
00:16:35,067 --> 00:16:37,227
which volume
does your theoretical backing come from?

377
00:16:37,546 --> 00:16:38,427
Have you decided?

378
00:16:46,827 --> 00:16:47,626
Yes.

379
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:51,146
At first, it did come from Das Kapital.

380
00:16:51,506 --> 00:16:53,827
But upon closer examination,
it didn't hold up.

381
00:16:54,107 --> 00:16:55,146
So actually, Das Kapital

382
00:16:55,386 --> 00:16:57,187
didn't solve the final problem for me.

383
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:01,187
Then how was it solved in the end?

384
00:17:15,187 --> 00:17:18,147
Attention, residents!

385
00:17:18,346 --> 00:17:21,947
We're about to witness
the founding of Yuehai City.

386
00:17:22,387 --> 00:17:23,026
Yuehai,

387
00:17:23,387 --> 00:17:27,026
a land that carries
both nature and civilization,

388
00:17:27,387 --> 00:17:29,627
will soon be revitalized.

389
00:17:29,907 --> 00:17:34,227
We must work together to build Yuehai.

390
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:36,867
Build!

391
00:17:41,947 --> 00:17:42,746
Don't rush.

392
00:17:43,546 --> 00:17:44,467
No problem.

393
00:17:44,826 --> 00:17:47,106
Some difficulties are perfectly normal.

394
00:17:48,106 --> 00:17:51,266
Attention, residents!

395
00:17:51,387 --> 00:17:55,147
We're about to witness
the founding of Yuehai City.

396
00:17:55,427 --> 00:17:56,346
It's too noisy.

397
00:17:56,746 --> 00:17:59,867
A land that carries
both nature and civilization...

398
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:02,227
- Turn it down.
- Mr. Zheng is angry.

399
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:03,826
Turn it down.

400
00:18:03,867 --> 00:18:04,786
I want him to listen.

401
00:18:04,786 --> 00:18:07,586
Work together to build Yuehai.

402
00:18:07,746 --> 00:18:11,187
Build!

403
00:18:24,306 --> 00:18:25,306
Who was on the broadcast?

404
00:18:26,387 --> 00:18:27,147
Who was it?

405
00:18:27,187 --> 00:18:28,106
Mr. Zheng.

406
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:28,606
Not me.

407
00:18:28,867 --> 00:18:30,066
I know it was your voice.

408
00:18:30,147 --> 00:18:31,346
He was just doing his job.

409
00:18:31,346 --> 00:18:32,707
What did you say?

410
00:18:32,867 --> 00:18:33,506
Work together.

411
00:18:33,586 --> 00:18:34,387
Be quiet.

412
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:35,187
Not that part.

413
00:18:35,224 --> 00:18:35,907
Something else.

414
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:36,947
Build Yuehai.

415
00:18:37,026 --> 00:18:38,746
Just be quiet. Alright?

416
00:18:42,106 --> 00:18:42,627
Mr. Zheng.

417
00:18:44,026 --> 00:18:44,947
You've figured it out?

418
00:18:45,867 --> 00:18:46,947
Have you figured it out?

419
00:18:49,306 --> 00:18:49,987
Great.

420
00:18:52,427 --> 00:18:53,147
Great.

421
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:56,707
Great. You've figured it out.

422
00:18:56,947 --> 00:18:57,506
Great.

423
00:19:01,546 --> 00:19:02,947
Great.

424
00:19:07,066 --> 00:19:08,746
So that's how you came up

425
00:19:08,867 --> 00:19:10,266
(Secretary's Office)
with the city construction fee?

426
00:19:10,627 --> 00:19:12,066
Yes. Mr. Zhao,

427
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:14,506
the state has no money.

428
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,506
It's the biggest challenge we face
in Yuehai's development.

429
00:19:17,987 --> 00:19:20,306
That's why
I proposed the 'city construction fee.'

430
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:21,947
I believe with this fee in place,

431
00:19:22,266 --> 00:19:23,506
we can start building Yuehai.

432
00:19:25,546 --> 00:19:27,387
So the people were willing to pay?

433
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:28,947
It's not that simple.

434
00:19:30,467 --> 00:19:34,346
Yuehai Town Master Plan.

435
00:19:34,826 --> 00:19:38,546
This is the blueprint

436
00:19:38,546 --> 00:19:39,867
(Yuehai Town Master Plan)
for our prosperous future life.

437
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:40,766
Right.

438
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,427
At first glance,
it seems to have everything.

439
00:19:44,106 --> 00:19:45,026
Wait a minute.

440
00:19:45,427 --> 00:19:46,667
We must be in the wrong place.

441
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:47,506
Something's wrong.

442
00:19:47,627 --> 00:19:48,227
It can't be it.

443
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:49,546
We're not lost.

444
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:50,907
Look carefully.

445
00:19:51,746 --> 00:19:52,427
This is the spot.

446
00:19:53,227 --> 00:19:53,727
See?

447
00:20:02,627 --> 00:20:03,127
But...

448
00:20:03,306 --> 00:20:04,586
T-This is a reed marsh.

449
00:20:04,586 --> 00:20:05,528
To build houses here?

450
00:20:05,528 --> 00:20:07,000
What's wrong with a reed marsh?

451
00:20:07,346 --> 00:20:09,227
It just means
more initial construction work.

452
00:20:09,387 --> 00:20:10,907
It'll be done with some money.

453
00:20:11,306 --> 00:20:12,106
But... Well...

454
00:20:12,786 --> 00:20:14,586
How can we build on a marsh?

455
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:15,746
Of course, we can.

456
00:20:16,187 --> 00:20:17,387
We can build on a marsh.

457
00:20:18,306 --> 00:20:20,066
I think we should pick somewhere else.

458
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:22,947
Changyuan, I need to go. Bye.

459
00:20:23,218 --> 00:20:25,094
(Pay Here)

460
00:20:39,346 --> 00:20:45,136
(Pay Here)

461
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:51,641
(Consult Here)

462
00:20:54,106 --> 00:20:55,066
Coming through.

463
00:20:56,227 --> 00:20:57,786
Stop pushing.

464
00:20:57,826 --> 00:20:58,326
Excuse me.

465
00:20:58,627 --> 00:21:00,106
Can we choose our own plot?

466
00:21:00,586 --> 00:21:02,026
Probably not.

467
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:03,867
To ensure fairness,

468
00:21:04,026 --> 00:21:06,227
we'll decide by lottery.

469
00:21:06,467 --> 00:21:08,306
Okay? Any other questions?

470
00:21:11,947 --> 00:21:12,667
Rest assured.

471
00:21:12,786 --> 00:21:15,026
Yuehai offers the best conditions.

472
00:21:15,826 --> 00:21:17,066
After you pay, the money

473
00:21:17,586 --> 00:21:18,907
will go to Yuehai's construction.

474
00:21:19,066 --> 00:21:20,987
So Yuehai will keep getting better,

475
00:21:21,106 --> 00:21:21,987
with more residents.

476
00:21:22,346 --> 00:21:24,707
And Yuehai's future will be very bright.

477
00:21:25,586 --> 00:21:26,187
So many people?

478
00:21:28,627 --> 00:21:30,207
How's it going, Mr. Tan?

479
00:21:30,506 --> 00:21:31,627
Exhausted? So many people.

480
00:21:34,546 --> 00:21:36,086
Wait, where's the money?

481
00:21:37,106 --> 00:21:38,907
All these people, and not one paid?

482
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,026
They're here to consult the Secretary.

483
00:21:41,346 --> 00:21:43,546
Not a single one comes to pay.

484
00:21:45,586 --> 00:21:49,066
With such good policies and conditions,

485
00:21:50,346 --> 00:21:52,786
'monkeys' should be lining up to pay.

486
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:55,147
Where's the problem?

487
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:57,947
Who'd come for reeds land?

488
00:22:01,746 --> 00:22:02,306
Nothing.

489
00:22:06,066 --> 00:22:08,106
Your Xuemei said
to lead by example and pay.

490
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:09,400
Where is she?

491
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,136
- Yeah.
- Right.

492
00:22:10,867 --> 00:22:11,467
What?

493
00:22:11,546 --> 00:22:12,667
Stop it. Did she pay?

494
00:22:12,907 --> 00:22:13,467
Not yet?

495
00:22:13,786 --> 00:22:14,826
Doesn't she listen to you?

496
00:22:15,147 --> 00:22:15,867
Of course.

497
00:22:16,187 --> 00:22:17,187
I told her several times,

498
00:22:17,467 --> 00:22:18,786
"Hurry up and pay!"

499
00:22:19,106 --> 00:22:21,387
She insisted on earning
a few more days of bank interest.

500
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:23,147
Just for few bank interest?

501
00:22:23,387 --> 00:22:25,187
How much interest
could that possibly be?

502
00:22:29,867 --> 00:22:31,266
Seems we need to give them a push.

503
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:33,346
How?

504
00:22:33,627 --> 00:22:34,127
Quiet!

505
00:22:35,746 --> 00:22:36,427
He is thinking.

506
00:22:43,746 --> 00:22:45,227
Set a deadline.

507
00:22:45,987 --> 00:22:47,427
No payments accepted after that.

508
00:22:48,106 --> 00:22:50,667
Go and tell those
who are interested in joining,

509
00:22:51,227 --> 00:22:51,907
"Now or never."

510
00:22:57,147 --> 00:22:58,627
So did anyone pay in the end?

511
00:22:58,947 --> 00:23:01,627
Li, don't rush.

512
00:23:11,058 --> 00:23:15,314

Closes at 6 PM today)

Secretary, your idea might not work.

515
00:24:00,306 --> 00:24:00,806
Right?

516
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:02,826
Look at the time. It's almost dark.

517
00:24:03,266 --> 00:24:04,427
The credit union is closing.

518
00:24:06,467 --> 00:24:06,967
I'm hungry.

519
00:24:14,867 --> 00:24:15,367
Go back.

00:26:49,867 --> 00:26:51,227
to come early tomorrow.

564
00:26:51,506 --> 00:26:52,746
Am I dreaming?

565
00:26:55,187 --> 00:26:55,826
Guys.

566
00:26:57,147 --> 00:26:58,707
We have the money to build the city!

567
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:01,266
Yuehai!

568
00:27:09,826 --> 00:27:10,746
So you won the bet?

569
00:27:11,586 --> 00:27:12,086
Exactly.

570
00:27:13,586 --> 00:27:15,187
Zhang, pass me those biscuits.

571
00:27:15,387 --> 00:27:16,106
Okay, Secretary.

572
00:27:17,546 --> 00:27:19,128
(After hearing Zheng Decheng's words,)

573
00:27:19,128 --> 00:27:21,066
(I was deeply shocked and moved.)

574
00:27:22,227 --> 00:27:24,187
(This little man
truly taught me a lesson.)

575
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:26,000
(He showed me what it means)

576
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,248
(to build the city
for the people and by the people.)

577
00:27:29,368 --> 00:27:31,468
(We are at the forefront
of Reform and Opening-up.)

578
00:27:31,707 --> 00:27:32,867
(If what we want to do)

579
00:27:32,867 --> 00:27:34,826
(benefits the people
and promotes development,)

580
00:27:35,346 --> 00:27:36,667
(then practicing before theory)

581
00:27:37,147 --> 00:27:39,227
(can also be a valuable attempt.)

582
00:27:39,746 --> 00:27:40,266
(Secretary's Office)
Li, here.

583
00:27:40,266 --> 00:27:40,947
Good stuff.

584
00:27:45,066 --> 00:27:47,306
Zheng Decheng, I didn't expect

585
00:27:47,306 --> 00:27:49,176
you went through a lot
before opening the city.

586
00:27:49,826 --> 00:27:52,106
You're clever and bold.

587
00:27:53,867 --> 00:27:55,467
But you must understand

588
00:27:56,026 --> 00:27:57,707
this matter carries real risks.

589
00:28:09,786 --> 00:28:10,346
Secretary,

590
00:28:11,746 --> 00:28:13,467
having worked
at the grassroots for years,

591
00:28:14,106 --> 00:28:16,026
I know what can and can't be done.

592
00:28:16,627 --> 00:28:18,867
I specifically studied
the Constitution for this,

593
00:28:19,187 --> 00:28:21,026
especially the articles concerning land.

594
00:28:21,346 --> 00:28:23,387
What is the core principle
of our Land Law?

595
00:28:24,106 --> 00:28:27,667
I believe it's state ownership of land
and private ownership is prohibited.

596
00:28:28,266 --> 00:28:30,586
So, as long as
we don't violate this core principle,

597
00:28:30,987 --> 00:28:32,826
and the land remains state-owned,

598
00:28:33,306 --> 00:28:35,546
whether we collect
city construction fees

599
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:37,187
or issue land use certificates,

600
00:28:37,546 --> 00:28:38,746
we aren't breaking the law.

601
00:28:41,907 --> 00:28:42,546
Go on.

602
00:28:44,147 --> 00:28:44,826
Get numb legs?

603
00:28:46,627 --> 00:28:47,147
Secretary.

604
00:28:48,586 --> 00:28:49,586
No matter what,

605
00:28:49,987 --> 00:28:51,106
you must support us.

606
00:28:51,746 --> 00:28:52,627
If you refuse,

607
00:28:53,147 --> 00:28:55,427
even if I had superpower,

608
00:28:56,106 --> 00:28:57,746
I still couldn't accomplish my task.

609
00:28:58,187 --> 00:28:59,506
If someone offers a better idea,

610
00:28:59,867 --> 00:29:01,106
I'll step aside immediately.

611
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:03,827
(Secretary's Office)

612
00:29:05,867 --> 00:29:07,546
Zheng Decheng, and you, Li.

613
00:29:07,667 --> 00:29:08,266
With you here,

614
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:10,266
I'll say this behind closed doors.

615
00:29:10,907 --> 00:29:13,987
Like you, I've been constantly thinking
about the funding issue.

616
00:29:14,826 --> 00:29:15,707
But I didn't think of

617
00:29:15,786 --> 00:29:17,266
charging city construction fee

618
00:29:18,066 --> 00:29:19,947
or issuing land use certificates.

619
00:29:20,506 --> 00:29:21,306
Your idea

620
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:24,106
could indeed solve
the city construction funding issue.

621
00:29:25,707 --> 00:29:26,266
However...

622
00:29:29,066 --> 00:29:29,566
However...

623
00:29:30,387 --> 00:29:31,147
And then?

624
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,427
Whether you can collect
the city construction fee,

625
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,990
whether you get disciplinary action,

626
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:39,350
it depends on
the County Standing Committee.

627
00:29:42,786 --> 00:29:44,266
D-Disciplinary action?

628
00:29:45,746 --> 00:29:47,467
A-Alright then.

629
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:48,746
Can you speed it up?

630
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:50,066
How can I speed it up?

631
00:29:50,907 --> 00:29:51,826
We need to discuss it

632
00:29:51,867 --> 00:29:53,506
in the Standing Committee meeting.

633
00:29:53,546 --> 00:29:55,506
This is a major issue, not a minor one.

634
00:29:55,947 --> 00:29:56,447
Yes.

635
00:29:57,467 --> 00:29:57,967
Right.

636
00:29:58,387 --> 00:29:59,106
I-I understand.

637
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:00,746
You need to think carefully,

638
00:30:01,147 --> 00:30:03,266
only then can you decide.

639
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:04,167
Then,

640
00:30:05,346 --> 00:30:06,627
I'll wait in the courtyard.

641
00:30:09,387 --> 00:30:10,427
Then I'll go.

642
00:30:10,907 --> 00:30:12,147
I'll go to the courtyard.

643
00:30:12,947 --> 00:30:14,147
Go have some water.

644
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:14,647
Okay.

645
00:30:17,546 --> 00:30:18,187
Li, stay.

646
00:30:20,147 --> 00:30:20,647
Alright.

647
00:30:22,227 --> 00:30:22,727
Li.

648
00:30:23,786 --> 00:30:25,987
I'd like to hear your thoughts on this.

649
00:30:27,786 --> 00:30:31,187
Collecting city construction fee
truly has no precedent.

650
00:30:31,586 --> 00:30:33,026
Our investigation team believes

651
00:30:33,427 --> 00:30:37,066
this approach is inconsistent
with the Constitution.

652
00:30:37,907 --> 00:30:41,147
However, Zheng Decheng
granted city construction fee

653
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:42,586
to 1,214 farming households

654
00:30:42,627 --> 00:30:44,266
with the city construction fee.

655
00:30:44,786 --> 00:30:48,106
This aligns
with the No. 1 Central Document.

656
00:30:49,346 --> 00:30:52,467
Yuehai collected
a total of 9.49 million yuan.

657
00:30:52,707 --> 00:30:54,106
The accounts are in order.

658
00:30:55,826 --> 00:30:57,586
So, what's your thought on his approach?

659
00:31:00,106 --> 00:31:01,586
I think his approach

660
00:31:02,506 --> 00:31:03,546
is quite bold

661
00:31:04,667 --> 00:31:05,667
and cunning.

662
00:31:07,106 --> 00:31:08,786
But since he managed
to come up with this,

663
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:10,867
he's quite impressive.

664
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:26,712
(Forestry Dept)

665
00:31:33,786 --> 00:31:34,667
You bureaucrat.

666
00:31:38,026 --> 00:31:38,667
What's wrong?

667
00:31:39,627 --> 00:31:40,187
Is it gone?

668
00:31:40,467 --> 00:31:41,147
What's gone?

669
00:31:41,506 --> 00:31:43,026
They say a fright can stop hiccups.

670
00:31:44,026 --> 00:31:44,826
It worked.

671
00:31:50,066 --> 00:31:51,346
She scared me?

672
00:31:51,907 --> 00:31:53,346
This violates policy.

673
00:31:53,487 --> 00:31:53,987
Won't work.

674
00:31:53,987 --> 00:31:54,907
We might get punished.

675
00:31:54,907 --> 00:31:55,786
He acts recklessly.

676
00:31:55,907 --> 00:31:57,147
I really think it won't work.

677
00:31:58,947 --> 00:31:59,506
What is this?

678
00:31:59,506 --> 00:32:01,506
Can we stop with these fancy ideas?

679
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,147
Exactly.

680
00:32:02,346 --> 00:32:04,506
Collecting city construction fee is new,

681
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:05,586
but it isn't illegal.

682
00:32:05,746 --> 00:32:06,546
At least, I found

683
00:32:06,707 --> 00:32:08,106
no article in law

684
00:32:08,187 --> 00:32:09,867
that prohibits to it.

685
00:32:10,147 --> 00:32:13,026
Yuehai collecting city construction fee
is a big deal.

686
00:32:13,266 --> 00:32:14,826
Honestly, isn't this like selling land?

687
00:32:15,546 --> 00:32:16,627
Everyone, think about it.

688
00:32:16,947 --> 00:32:18,026
If people don't pay,

689
00:32:18,266 --> 00:32:19,467
they won't get the land.

690
00:32:19,987 --> 00:32:21,306
Getting the land after paying.

691
00:32:21,586 --> 00:32:22,826
Isn't that just selling land?

692
00:32:22,987 --> 00:32:24,227
It's just a change in form,

693
00:32:24,506 --> 00:32:25,266
but not in content.

694
00:32:25,667 --> 00:32:26,627
I disagree with you.

695
00:32:26,826 --> 00:32:27,627
Liu is right.

696
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:29,667
If higher-ups investigate this,

697
00:32:30,266 --> 00:32:31,266
we'd take a great risk.

698
00:32:31,487 --> 00:32:32,546
- Yes.
- Secretary Zhao.

699
00:32:32,987 --> 00:32:34,106
We can't take this risk.

700
00:32:34,346 --> 00:32:35,467
I also agree with Liu.

701
00:32:37,746 --> 00:32:39,187
Xia, speak up.

702
00:32:43,106 --> 00:32:43,667
I think

703
00:32:46,106 --> 00:32:47,306
everyone has made a point.

704
00:32:47,786 --> 00:32:50,546
But regarding this matter,
I still have reservations.

705
00:32:51,106 --> 00:32:51,707
It's true

706
00:32:51,826 --> 00:32:54,707
that collecting city construction fee
isn't explicitly illegal,

707
00:32:55,147 --> 00:32:57,586
but there's no policy backing it.

708
00:32:57,987 --> 00:32:58,487
Right?

709
00:32:58,786 --> 00:32:59,826
This is too novel.

710
00:33:00,867 --> 00:33:01,947
Is our Pingchuan County

711
00:33:02,746 --> 00:33:04,667
really going to be that adventurous?

712
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,500
County Magistrate is right.

713
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,306
We should study it further.

714
00:33:08,867 --> 00:33:10,586
Secretary Zhao, regarding this...

715
00:33:12,187 --> 00:33:14,066
Today's meeting is quite productive.

716
00:33:14,707 --> 00:33:16,427
All of you have spoken your minds

717
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:17,506
without holding back.

718
00:33:18,066 --> 00:33:19,586
Regarding the question Xia raised,

719
00:33:19,707 --> 00:33:20,746
I've also asked myself.

720
00:33:21,746 --> 00:33:23,066
Our Pingchuan

721
00:33:23,427 --> 00:33:24,627
is such a small county.

722
00:33:25,627 --> 00:33:27,187
Do we need to be the first to try it?

723
00:33:30,546 --> 00:33:32,066
But building a city from scratch

724
00:33:32,227 --> 00:33:33,586
is an adventurous thing.

725
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:36,667
Building a city without money
is even more like it.

726
00:33:38,746 --> 00:33:39,246
Okay.

727
00:33:40,786 --> 00:33:41,586
We need money.

728
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:43,627
Zheng Decheng charged

729
00:33:44,026 --> 00:33:44,907
city construction fee

730
00:33:45,667 --> 00:33:47,066
and issued land use certificates.

731
00:33:47,627 --> 00:33:48,546
He solved this problem,

732
00:33:49,746 --> 00:33:50,667
and it's not illegal.

733
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:52,786
Isn't it good?

734
00:33:53,707 --> 00:33:56,266
Some say this is just
a change in form but not in content.

735
00:33:56,746 --> 00:33:57,826
It's just selling the land.

736
00:33:58,387 --> 00:33:59,266
But I don't think so.

737
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:02,707
I think he did change the content.

738
00:34:03,746 --> 00:34:06,467
It is a brand-new concept.

739
00:34:10,987 --> 00:34:11,867
Just earlier,

740
00:34:11,987 --> 00:34:13,586
before the meeting started,

741
00:34:14,626 --> 00:34:16,066
I had a conversation

742
00:34:16,747 --> 00:34:18,186
with Zheng Decheng.

743
00:34:20,506 --> 00:34:22,427
He said to me,

744
00:34:23,026 --> 00:34:23,747
"Secretary,

745
00:34:24,747 --> 00:34:26,546
I just want to use

746
00:34:26,968 --> 00:34:28,984
the funds from Pingchuan's
six thousand 'monkeys'

747
00:34:29,387 --> 00:34:31,307
to build a prosperous city

748
00:34:31,666 --> 00:34:34,146
that can rank among the top in China."

749
00:34:34,586 --> 00:34:35,987
"My dream is

750
00:34:36,586 --> 00:34:38,907
to multiply Pingchuan's economy
several times over."

751
00:34:39,347 --> 00:34:41,546
This Zheng Decheng is no ordinary man.

752
00:34:41,626 --> 00:34:42,867
In my conversation with him,

753
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:45,050
I was greatly inspired and enlightened.

754
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,666
So, as the Secretary
of county committee,

755
00:34:46,666 --> 00:34:47,947
I fully support him.

756
00:34:48,226 --> 00:34:50,427
I support Yuehai collecting
the city construction fee.

757
00:34:58,987 --> 00:35:01,146
Secretary Zhao, shall we
stick to the usual procedure?

758
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:01,907
Let's vote.

759
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:02,566
Okay.

760
00:35:04,267 --> 00:35:05,307
Secretary Zhao.

761
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:06,827
I abstain.

762
00:35:07,666 --> 00:35:08,186
Okay.

763
00:35:09,026 --> 00:35:09,706
Me too.

764
00:35:13,867 --> 00:35:15,307
Any other abstaining?

765
00:35:18,987 --> 00:35:20,506
If not, we'll vote by a show of hands.

766
00:35:22,296 --> 00:35:24,952
Those in favor of Yuehai collecting
the city construction fee,

767
00:35:25,336 --> 00:35:26,072
raise your hands.

768
00:35:43,826 --> 00:35:46,648
Five votes in favor,
two against, two abstentions.

769
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,347
The resolution on

770
00:35:48,664 --> 00:35:51,747
collecting city construction fee
in Yuehai has been officially approved.

771
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:10,354
(Beyond the Horizon)

772
00:36:38,186 --> 00:36:40,626
When can I leave this place?

773
00:37:04,026 --> 00:37:04,666
You play well.

774
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:06,807
Secretary.

775
00:37:07,146 --> 00:37:09,427
(Ignore me)
Don't wear this to work.

776
00:37:10,626 --> 00:37:11,586
But today...

777
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,120
(Ignore me)
I'm off.

778
00:37:15,427 --> 00:37:17,307
Please make an exception
and take the money.

779
00:37:17,387 --> 00:37:18,267
D-Don't give it to me.

780
00:37:18,267 --> 00:37:18,987
Exception? I...

781
00:37:19,224 --> 00:37:20,184
The deadline's due.

782
00:37:20,267 --> 00:37:21,267
I can't take it.

783
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:23,387
I finally raised this money.

784
00:37:23,427 --> 00:37:23,987
Why don't you

785
00:37:23,987 --> 00:37:24,827
- take it?
- You said...

786
00:37:24,827 --> 00:37:26,106
Who said you can't pay?

787
00:37:26,907 --> 00:37:27,586
M-Mr. Zheng.

788
00:37:27,626 --> 00:37:28,706
- Secretary.
- Secretary.

789
00:37:29,586 --> 00:37:30,106
Back off.

790
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:32,146
Secretary is here. Listen to him.

791
00:37:32,566 --> 00:37:33,066
Secretary.

792
00:37:33,066 --> 00:37:33,907
Is it really okay?

793
00:37:34,427 --> 00:37:34,927
Take it.

794
00:37:35,347 --> 00:37:38,267
What do you mean?
The deadline has passed.

795
00:37:38,626 --> 00:37:39,347
Exactly.

796
00:37:39,947 --> 00:37:41,026
The first phase has closed.

797
00:37:41,586 --> 00:37:43,146
We have the second and third phases.

798
00:37:43,787 --> 00:37:46,427
We must view this matter
with a development perspective.

799
00:37:46,827 --> 00:37:48,267
Yuehai will only get better,

800
00:37:48,626 --> 00:37:50,626
and the construction fee
will only get higher.

801
00:37:50,987 --> 00:37:53,066
Paying now is still
at the cheapest price.

802
00:37:53,186 --> 00:37:54,586
Right, we'll pay now.

803
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:55,626
- We pay now.
- Pay now.

804
00:37:55,867 --> 00:37:57,226
It's not appropriate.

805
00:37:57,387 --> 00:37:58,467
What's wrong with it?

806
00:37:58,827 --> 00:38:00,267
In Yuehai, I have the final say.

807
00:38:03,506 --> 00:38:04,226
This Zheng Decheng

808
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,987
is now running wild in Yuehai.

809
00:38:07,666 --> 00:38:09,747
Secretary, you must intervene.

810
00:38:11,387 --> 00:38:12,506
What do you mean?

811
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:14,387
Zheng Decheng is too bold

812
00:38:14,747 --> 00:38:15,267
and greedy.

813
00:38:15,787 --> 00:38:17,626
You should get someone to restrain him.

814
00:38:17,827 --> 00:38:19,626
Can't let him have his own way.

815
00:38:19,947 --> 00:38:21,387
We must handle problem critically.

816
00:38:21,867 --> 00:38:22,546
I think this way

817
00:38:22,706 --> 00:38:25,987
would be beneficial
for the future development of Yuehai.

818
00:38:26,827 --> 00:38:29,666
Actually, Zheng Decheng
has approached me several times.

819
00:38:30,186 --> 00:38:30,686
He wants

820
00:38:30,947 --> 00:38:32,106
to team up with Xie Chunlai.

821
00:38:32,827 --> 00:38:34,546
I've also looked into Xie Chunlai.

822
00:38:34,907 --> 00:38:35,706
He's highly capable.

823
00:38:36,307 --> 00:38:36,827
Furthermore,

824
00:38:37,688 --> 00:38:39,228
he knows how to deal with the people.

825
00:38:39,626 --> 00:38:41,787
And his wife
is a representative of the 'monkeys'.

826
00:38:42,226 --> 00:38:44,347
This will benefit
the future city-building work.

827
00:38:44,907 --> 00:38:47,026
Moreover, he has two capable men
under his command.

828
00:38:47,546 --> 00:38:48,586
One is named Lin Dongfu,

829
00:38:48,907 --> 00:38:52,106
upright and steady,
not much of a talker, a doer.

830
00:38:52,787 --> 00:38:54,026
Another is named Tan Guangming,

831
00:38:54,427 --> 00:38:56,626
meticulous and highly politically aware,

832
00:38:57,066 --> 00:38:58,267
also an outstanding cadre.

833
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,186
Secretary.

834
00:38:59,666 --> 00:39:02,186
I know the three guys
that Guan mentioned.

835
00:39:02,747 --> 00:39:04,467
They were Zheng Decheng's subordinates,

836
00:39:04,867 --> 00:39:06,347
and cooperative with his work.

837
00:39:06,775 --> 00:39:09,345
Either becomes the Town Mayor
won't achieve our goal.

838
00:39:09,907 --> 00:39:10,936
None of them is suitable.

839
00:39:12,506 --> 00:39:13,347
Who then?

840
00:39:14,506 --> 00:39:15,186
Cai Gang.

841
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:18,666
Cai Gang is steady
and has a broad perspective.

842
00:39:19,586 --> 00:39:21,467
Regarding Zheng Decheng's
working methods,

843
00:39:21,546 --> 00:39:22,626
he has certain doubts.

844
00:39:22,867 --> 00:39:24,307
He could serve as a mirror,

845
00:39:24,506 --> 00:39:26,267
constantly monitoring on Zheng Decheng.

846
00:39:26,787 --> 00:39:27,506
Mr. Xia,

847
00:39:28,146 --> 00:39:29,106
in my opinion,

848
00:39:29,626 --> 00:39:32,307
if two people
are working completely out of sync,

849
00:39:33,467 --> 00:39:36,026
it won't benefit the future development.

850
00:39:37,106 --> 00:39:38,066
In my opinion,

851
00:39:38,467 --> 00:39:40,907
Cai Gang isn't the best candidate.

852
00:39:42,106 --> 00:39:42,606
You...

853
00:39:43,226 --> 00:39:44,467
Both of you made good points.

854
00:39:45,387 --> 00:39:46,506
They have their strengths,

855
00:39:47,026 --> 00:39:49,347
but neither is the best candidate.

856
00:39:50,586 --> 00:39:51,947
Then, Secretary,

857
00:39:52,467 --> 00:39:54,666
do you already have

858
00:39:55,066 --> 00:39:56,427
someone in mind?

859
00:39:57,226 --> 00:39:57,947
There is one.

860
00:40:00,787 --> 00:40:03,467
Really? You've become the Town Mayor?

861
00:40:03,787 --> 00:40:05,706
Yes! I'm so excited!

862
00:40:06,546 --> 00:40:08,747
B-But my parents...

863
00:40:09,626 --> 00:40:11,467
Ms. Liu, you're the only one
who can help me.

864
00:40:12,066 --> 00:40:12,787
I got this.

865
00:40:14,066 --> 00:40:14,947
Wang!

866
00:40:15,606 --> 00:40:16,506
- Coming.
- Ms. Liu.

867
00:40:16,506 --> 00:40:18,146
Help me trace this lace pattern.

868
00:40:18,146 --> 00:40:18,747
Okay, Ms. Liu.

869
00:40:18,787 --> 00:40:19,626
Where are you off to?

870
00:40:19,706 --> 00:40:20,632
Saving someone.

871
00:40:20,632 --> 00:40:21,682
("Five Do's and Four Upliftings"
in Fresh Bloom)

872
00:40:21,682 --> 00:40:24,114
(General Affairs Dept, Archives)

873
00:40:25,307 --> 00:40:27,467
Really? Impossible!

874
00:40:28,506 --> 00:40:29,586
Where did you hear that?

875
00:40:30,467 --> 00:40:31,506
Where did I hear it?

876
00:40:33,307 --> 00:40:34,146
Not your business.

877
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:36,987
But the news is reliable.

878
00:40:37,347 --> 00:40:38,546
I can't do this job anymore.

879
00:40:39,907 --> 00:40:41,706
Here. Take it.

880
00:40:41,987 --> 00:40:43,706
What's wrong with you?

881
00:40:43,907 --> 00:40:45,546
Even a donkey needs a carrot

882
00:40:45,626 --> 00:40:47,867
dangled in front to keep moving, right?

883
00:40:48,787 --> 00:40:49,666
Without motivation,

884
00:40:51,146 --> 00:40:51,827
who'd work hard?

885
00:40:52,706 --> 00:40:53,347
Lin, enough.

886
00:40:53,347 --> 00:40:55,267
Don't listen to Xie's nonsense.

887
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,240
Appointing the Town Mayor
is a major matter.

888
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,467
It'd definitely be the Secretary
who knows it first.

889
00:40:59,506 --> 00:41:00,467
Why would he know first?

890
00:41:00,506 --> 00:41:01,467
You don't understand me.

891
00:41:01,706 --> 00:41:02,546
Know what?

892
00:41:03,907 --> 00:41:04,907
Talking behind my back?

893
00:41:05,146 --> 00:41:05,787
Xie.

894
00:41:06,666 --> 00:41:07,166
Ask him.

895
00:41:10,546 --> 00:41:12,066
Well, he's leaving.

896
00:41:20,226 --> 00:41:22,747
Here are the main gate
and side gate keys.

897
00:41:24,307 --> 00:41:26,186
This is the safe key.

898
00:41:26,666 --> 00:41:29,146
This is important, the archive room key.

899
00:41:34,907 --> 00:41:35,747
The warehouse key?

900
00:41:38,827 --> 00:41:39,706
Here it is.

901
00:41:40,987 --> 00:41:42,026
This is my

902
00:41:42,546 --> 00:41:43,546
private property.

903
00:41:43,987 --> 00:41:44,787
Motorcycle key.

904
00:41:46,467 --> 00:41:46,967
The seal.

905
00:41:48,026 --> 00:41:49,146
The county government seal

906
00:41:49,267 --> 00:41:49,767
is here.

907
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:52,646
Wait, what's wrong with you, Xie?

908
00:41:54,066 --> 00:41:55,467
Secretary, nothing wrong with me.

909
00:41:57,907 --> 00:41:59,506
Secretary, the county

910
00:41:59,747 --> 00:42:01,586
is sending Li Qiuping

911
00:42:01,907 --> 00:42:03,427
to be Yuehai Town Mayor.

912
00:42:04,026 --> 00:42:05,267
Good news, but I won't stay.

913
00:42:05,267 --> 00:42:07,307
T-This is nonsense!

914
00:42:08,186 --> 00:42:09,146
I am the Secretary.

915
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,700
If higher-ups were sending
Li Qiuping as Town Mayor,

916
00:42:12,146 --> 00:42:13,186
they'd notify me first.

917
00:42:13,747 --> 00:42:14,666
I haven't heard it.

918
00:42:14,987 --> 00:42:16,106
Impossible!

919
00:42:16,947 --> 00:42:17,907
Think I talk nonsense?

920
00:42:18,026 --> 00:42:18,947
- Heard it?
- Heard it?

921
00:42:18,947 --> 00:42:20,226
It is Li Qiuping.

922
00:42:20,307 --> 00:42:22,026
The one and only Li Qiuping.

923
00:42:23,186 --> 00:42:25,427
Secretary, I've been a deputy chief

924
00:42:26,387 --> 00:42:27,146
for nine years.

925
00:42:27,186 --> 00:42:31,307
These nine years, I've worked tirelessly
for the village and town.

926
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,626
At least I gave it my all.

927
00:42:33,626 --> 00:42:34,387
We often hear it,

928
00:42:34,387 --> 00:42:35,267
but it's the truth.

929
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:37,867
I've never made any demands
to the Party.

930
00:42:40,526 --> 00:42:41,026
Yes.

931
00:42:41,026 --> 00:42:41,907
A-All these years,

932
00:42:41,947 --> 00:42:42,987
I haven't slacked off.

933
00:42:42,987 --> 00:42:44,546
I've done so much for the town,

934
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:46,616
