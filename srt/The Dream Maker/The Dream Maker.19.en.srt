The typhoon is coming.
It's too dangerous. Let's go.

Mr. Lin,

23
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:11,586
I know it's wrong for me
to come back suddenly.

24
00:02:12,026 --> 00:02:13,592
Leave me alone. Just go.

00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,746
Are you crazy?

26
00:02:18,026 --> 00:02:19,447
People matter more. Let's go.

27
00:02:20,146 --> 00:02:21,026
Mr. Lin!

28

00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:29,107
You should go.

33
00:02:32,146 --> 00:02:33,186
Fine. Go in. I'll do it.

34
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:42,626

Let's get into the hospital.

39

Let's go.

Where is it, Mr. Zheng?

45
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:24,746
See? I told you the wind was coming.

46
00:03:27,347 --> 00:03:28,267
And it's not small.

47
00:03:28,586 --> 00:03:30,547

Oh no.

63

be jammed from the outside?

74
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:14,987
Scared?

(Emergency)
I'm an atheist. I'm not scared at all.

76
00:06:19,147 --> 00:06:20,147

77
00:06:20,306 --> 00:06:21,186
with strong winds,

78
00:06:21,587 --> 00:06:24,547
it's absurd that we're trapped here.

79
00:06:24,946 --> 00:06:27,027

will last for a while.

80
00:06:27,306 --> 00:06:28,306
It may last a day or two.

81
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:31,386
I doubt anyone will rescue us now.

82
00:06:31,866 --> 00:06:33,987
Don't worry about outside.

83
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:36,107

has done so.

84
00:06:36,386 --> 00:06:38,987

for all the residents.

85
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:45,506
This thing is precious.

86
00:06:46,186 --> 00:06:47,987
Mr. Lin made this himself.

87
00:06:48,547 --> 00:06:50,506
What a waste if it gets waterlogged.

88
00:06:51,707 --> 00:06:53,667
Mr. Zheng, you were looking
for this all along?

89
00:06:58,587 --> 00:07:01,547
Ms. Li, well, let's rest.

90
00:07:02,587 --> 00:07:03,587
Anyway, we're stuck here.

91
00:07:03,866 --> 00:07:05,506
Rest properly now.

92
00:07:06,107 --> 00:07:07,266
We're here. Let's accept it.

93
00:07:08,066 --> 00:07:09,626
Lie down and relax.

94
00:07:10,027 --> 00:07:11,186
Let's wait the typhoon out.

95
00:07:12,787 --> 00:07:14,907
Honestly, it's quite comfortable here.

96
00:07:17,626 --> 00:07:18,266
Mr. Zheng,

97
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:22,027
why do you care so much
about this sign and the hospital?

98
00:07:23,707 --> 00:07:24,907
Because of my wife.

99
00:07:26,467 --> 00:07:30,707
Many years ago,
Yuehai was just marshland.

100
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:34,386
My wife taught
at a village school nearby then.

101
00:07:35,426 --> 00:07:37,907
One night, she got sudden stomach pains.

102
00:07:38,866 --> 00:07:40,626
So I took her to the clinic.

103
00:07:41,907 --> 00:07:43,946
But those young medics
didn't know anything.

104
00:07:44,787 --> 00:07:46,306
They suggested the county hospital.

105
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,426
So I rushed her to the county hospital.

106
00:07:51,707 --> 00:07:53,066
But before we got there,

107
00:07:54,227 --> 00:07:55,186
she was gone.

108
00:08:00,626 --> 00:08:02,227
It wasn't even a serious illness.

109
00:08:03,587 --> 00:08:04,907
Just acute appendicitis.

110
00:08:05,987 --> 00:08:08,907
Any surgeon
could've performed the surgery.

111
00:08:10,587 --> 00:08:12,186
I... I'm sorry.

112
00:08:12,707 --> 00:08:13,207
It's fine.

113
00:08:15,386 --> 00:08:16,587
So,

114
00:08:18,266 --> 00:08:21,426
after coming to Yuehai,
I vowed to build a hospital.

115
00:08:23,107 --> 00:08:24,347
A proper hospital.

116
00:08:26,826 --> 00:08:29,186
It can cure illnesses
and perform surgeries.

117
00:08:30,587 --> 00:08:31,707
And it needs

118
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:33,906
to have an emergency sign

119
00:08:34,987 --> 00:08:38,786
hung high and bright.

120
00:08:40,427 --> 00:08:43,067
So people who need it
can spot it from afar

121
00:08:43,947 --> 00:08:47,666
in critical moments.

122
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:50,746
In this life,

123
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,067
you can overcome anything.

124
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:55,227
Really.

125
00:09:15,987 --> 00:09:16,707
Coming through.

126
00:09:35,227 --> 00:09:36,026
Thanks, Xiaoyu.

127
00:09:37,386 --> 00:09:38,626
I should be thanking you.

128
00:09:39,026 --> 00:09:40,408
Let me know if you need anything.

129
00:09:40,987 --> 00:09:41,487
Okay.

130
00:09:43,347 --> 00:09:44,666
Drink up. Don't catch a cold.

131
00:09:48,266 --> 00:09:48,766
Here.

132
00:09:49,107 --> 00:09:50,786
Here, Xiaohai, your carrying fee.

133
00:09:51,427 --> 00:09:54,467
Ms. Gao, I didn't help carry anything.
I can't take this money.

134
00:09:54,626 --> 00:09:56,026
But you carried me.

135
00:09:57,067 --> 00:09:59,347
Just showing up in this weather
is helping enough.

136
00:10:00,107 --> 00:10:01,707
Consider it an advance.

137
00:10:01,906 --> 00:10:04,026
Help me carry things
after the typhoon, okay?

138
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:04,746
Well...

139
00:10:04,786 --> 00:10:05,286
Take it.

140
00:10:06,427 --> 00:10:06,927
Alright.

141
00:10:07,146 --> 00:10:09,187
All of you, drink some
to prevent catching a chill.

142
00:10:09,347 --> 00:10:10,107
Thank you all.

143
00:10:10,546 --> 00:10:12,266
Xiaoyu, add some more water.

144
00:10:13,786 --> 00:10:14,467
Mr. Zheng.

145
00:10:17,587 --> 00:10:18,187
Mr. Zheng.

146
00:10:21,307 --> 00:10:23,347
How... how did I fall asleep?

147
00:10:24,107 --> 00:10:26,257
This bed really is different, isn't it?

148
00:10:26,456 --> 00:10:28,187
Lying here brings me complete peace.

149
00:10:28,266 --> 00:10:29,307
It just flew by.

150
00:10:31,626 --> 00:10:33,987
I mean, I slept right through.

151
00:10:35,146 --> 00:10:35,646
Okay.

152
00:10:41,587 --> 00:10:43,786
You're not bad. Quite nimble.

153
00:10:44,506 --> 00:10:45,107
Not bad.

154
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:55,746
Ms. Li.

155
00:10:57,026 --> 00:10:58,227
Can I ask you a question?

156
00:11:01,386 --> 00:11:04,347
Do you regret coming to Yuehai?

157
00:11:07,746 --> 00:11:08,786
Why would you ask that?

158
00:11:10,266 --> 00:11:11,467
Look,

159
00:11:12,227 --> 00:11:14,347
before the county decided

160
00:11:15,386 --> 00:11:16,587
to build Yuehai into a city,

161
00:11:16,866 --> 00:11:18,587
it was a place no one would want.

162
00:11:18,987 --> 00:11:20,067
You're an educated person,

163
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:21,827
respectable and nice-looking.

164
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:24,746
Why volunteer to come here and suffer?

165
00:11:25,987 --> 00:11:28,026
You're right. I deeply regret it.

166
00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:29,567
Right?

167
00:11:30,546 --> 00:11:32,947
When I first came to Yuehai,
I was full of passion.

168
00:11:33,746 --> 00:11:36,987
But I didn't expect
to face so many difficulties at work.

169
00:11:38,067 --> 00:11:40,906
Many things were new to me.
I was handling them for the first time.

170
00:11:41,626 --> 00:11:43,786
But I had to grit my teeth
and do them anyway.

171
00:11:45,427 --> 00:11:48,626
All this back and forth
left me no time to visit my parents.

172
00:11:49,266 --> 00:11:50,347
Most importantly,

173
00:11:53,347 --> 00:11:55,266
I couldn't properly talk with my friend.

174
00:12:04,467 --> 00:12:05,746
Friend, well...

175
00:12:06,307 --> 00:12:09,087
People come and go.
That's perfectly normal, right?

176
00:12:09,266 --> 00:12:11,866
You're still young, lacking experience.

177
00:12:12,427 --> 00:12:13,107
Look at me.

178
00:12:13,347 --> 00:12:14,936
I loved drinking and fighting as a kid.

179
00:12:15,427 --> 00:12:16,546
Then I met my wife.

180
00:12:16,906 --> 00:12:19,067
I promised her
I'd quit drinking and fighting.

181
00:12:19,626 --> 00:12:22,746
Overnight, all my friends vanished.

182
00:12:25,187 --> 00:12:28,827
I remember reading an essay in school.

183
00:12:29,427 --> 00:12:30,506
It left a deep impression.

184
00:12:33,707 --> 00:12:37,026
Friends are merely fellow travelers

185
00:12:37,386 --> 00:12:38,827
on life's lonely journey.

186
00:12:40,107 --> 00:12:41,266
Once a certain part is done,

187
00:12:41,906 --> 00:12:44,227
it's their freedom to turn.

188
00:12:44,746 --> 00:12:46,347
But while walking together,

189
00:12:47,386 --> 00:12:49,026
if you fall, they help you up.

190
00:12:49,746 --> 00:12:52,067
If wild beasts attack,
you resist together.

191
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:54,026
That's only natural.

192
00:12:54,947 --> 00:12:57,427
Once paths diverge,
you may care for each other,

193
00:12:58,107 --> 00:13:00,307
but you can no longer lend aid.

194
00:13:00,987 --> 00:13:01,987
But then,

195
00:13:02,467 --> 00:13:05,987
new fellow travelers may come along.

196
00:13:09,827 --> 00:13:10,386
Mr. Zheng,

197
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,427
how do you know an essay
like that by heart?

198
00:13:14,067 --> 00:13:14,866
So,

199
00:13:15,146 --> 00:13:17,506
I believe life's journey is long.

200
00:13:17,906 --> 00:13:20,187
You make friends
for each chapter of life.

201
00:13:20,626 --> 00:13:23,266
If interests align,
you walk together longer, right?

202
00:13:23,546 --> 00:13:25,307
If interests differ, just drop it.

203
00:13:25,947 --> 00:13:26,786
Part ways amicably.

204
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:29,807
Anyone can live without anyone else
in this world, right?

205
00:13:30,307 --> 00:13:31,107
Therefore,

206
00:13:31,506 --> 00:13:34,227
friends are merely fellow travelers

207
00:13:34,506 --> 00:13:36,187

Don't worry.

When you look at me, it feels distant.

No. When you look at me, it's far.

236
00:16:21,506 --> 00:16:22,866
But the clouds feel close.

237

No. Is it completely out of battery?

No way, at this critical moment?

If it weren't for her,

327

forget being a secretary,

328
00:24:08,066 --> 00:24:09,786
I'd probably be in prison by now.

00:24:14,187 --> 00:24:15,306
Yes, Pavel Korchagin.

330
00:24:17,026 --> 00:24:19,947

332

is life.

333
00:24:29,306 --> 00:24:32,066
Life is given to us

334
00:24:33,586 --> 00:24:34,467
only once.

335
00:24:37,947 --> 00:24:39,147
A man's life

336
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:43,026
should be lived

337
00:24:45,586 --> 00:24:47,187
so that when he looks back,

338
00:24:49,227 --> 00:24:50,546
he won't regret

339
00:24:53,387 --> 00:24:54,147
years wasted

340
00:24:56,346 --> 00:24:57,746
or feel shame

341
00:25:03,467 --> 00:25:04,427

00:25:12,546 --> 00:25:13,586
So I believe

345
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:15,546
the greatest meaning

346
00:25:16,467 --> 00:25:17,467
of my life

347
00:25:18,147 --> 00:25:19,106
should be

348
00:25:21,227 --> 00:25:23,506
to devote my limited life

349
00:25:24,586 --> 00:25:28,106
to unlimited service for the people.

350
00:25:32,867 --> 00:25:33,907

351
00:25:36,427 --> 00:25:37,106
I'm afraid

352
00:25:38,546 --> 00:25:39,506
I can no longer

353
00:25:42,346 --> 00:25:43,427

354
00:26:02,987 --> 00:26:03,586
Ms. Li,

355
00:26:04,707 --> 00:26:06,106
now tell me about your regrets.

356
00:26:08,786 --> 00:26:10,707
I think everyone needs opportunities.

357
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,947
They need to stand
on the shoulders of giants.

358
00:26:18,947 --> 00:26:20,907
I think Yuehai is a giant.

359
00:26:21,707 --> 00:26:24,106
I haven't had the chance
to stand on the giant's shoulders

360
00:26:24,707 --> 00:26:27,826
to turn potential into opportunity
and to make hope become reality.

361

362

not having had
a proper conversation with Du Tao.

363
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:38,667
I feel that we shouldn't end this way.

364
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:42,947
I'm only thirty.

365
00:26:43,907 --> 00:26:45,786
There's still so much I haven't done.

366

Ms. Li,

367
00:27:10,586 --> 00:27:12,667

370
00:27:16,586 --> 00:27:17,667
So much time ahead of me.

371
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:19,586
I have so many things left undone.

00:27:19,746 --> 00:27:21,746
Am I really going to drown here?

373
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:23,546
Right.

374
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:32,147
Mr. Zheng, the water
seems to have stopped rising.

375
00:27:32,306 --> 00:27:33,266
Copy that.

376
00:27:33,546 --> 00:27:35,306
This is Zheng Decheng.

377
00:27:35,546 --> 00:27:36,826
Is everyone safe?

378
00:27:37,627 --> 00:27:39,306
Zheng Decheng, you scoundrel!

379

(Actively Promote the Five Do's,
Four Upliftings, and Three Loves)

380
00:27:58,667 --> 00:27:59,546
Slow down, Mr. Tan.

381
00:27:59,867 --> 00:28:00,707
It's okay.

382
00:28:03,746 --> 00:28:05,627
Come on, everyone. Give us a hand.

383
00:28:05,907 --> 00:28:08,707
Move that bigger tree aside. Move it.

384
00:28:09,106 --> 00:28:10,566
Yes, open the gate. Open it.

385
00:28:11,727 --> 00:28:12,227
Right.

386
00:28:12,227 --> 00:28:13,467
Move the big ones to the side.

387
00:28:13,867 --> 00:28:14,667
To the side.

388
00:28:17,187 --> 00:28:19,187
Mr. Zheng, this is Xie Chunlai.

389
00:28:19,227 --> 00:28:21,227
I'm at Chunmei Printery.
All's normal here.

390
00:28:21,586 --> 00:28:22,346
Here. Take this.

391
00:28:23,427 --> 00:28:26,106
Mr. Zheng, Meng and I
are both at the town government.

392
00:28:26,266 --> 00:28:26,907
How are you?

393
00:28:27,106 --> 00:28:29,467
This is Lin Dongfu. I'm on my way
to the town government.

394
00:28:31,786 --> 00:28:33,506
Ms. Li and I are in the hospital morgue.

395
00:28:34,066 --> 00:28:34,746
Morgue?

396
00:28:34,987 --> 00:28:37,026
Mr. Zheng and Ms. Li, you got

397
00:28:37,346 --> 00:28:38,867
an early appointment with Marx?

398
00:28:39,546 --> 00:28:40,746
How can he talk like that?

399
00:28:41,187 --> 00:28:41,687
Yes.

400
00:28:41,826 --> 00:28:44,667
We are currently
in the hospital basement morgue.

401
00:28:44,826 --> 00:28:46,147
We request support.

402
00:28:46,707 --> 00:28:48,506
Do you copy? We request support.

403
00:28:49,647 --> 00:28:51,147
I'll send people over immediately.

404
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,867
- Don't panic.
- I'm coming for you.

405
00:28:53,227 --> 00:28:54,707
Bai, take people

406
00:28:54,826 --> 00:28:55,987
to the hospital morgue now.

407
00:28:56,387 --> 00:28:57,346
Okay, Mr. Tan.

408
00:28:57,387 --> 00:28:58,187
Let's go.

409
00:28:58,187 --> 00:28:58,746
Follow me.

410
00:28:58,746 --> 00:29:00,066
Mr. Zheng, help is on its way.

411
00:29:00,147 --> 00:29:00,826
Don't worry.

412
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:04,947
Lin said he's almost back?

413
00:29:05,467 --> 00:29:06,147
He's on the way.

414
00:29:08,627 --> 00:29:09,266
Mr. Zheng,

415
00:29:10,066 --> 00:29:12,106
what happened today in the morgue

416
00:29:12,746 --> 00:29:14,106
stays here.

417
00:29:17,066 --> 00:29:18,346
Then you better be nice to me.

418
00:29:23,627 --> 00:29:24,346
Seriously,

419
00:29:25,546 --> 00:29:26,106
Ms. Li,

420
00:29:26,786 --> 00:29:28,066
once we get out of here,

421
00:29:29,227 --> 00:29:30,947
let's finish everything we need to do

422
00:29:31,467 --> 00:29:32,546
and leave no more regrets.

423
00:29:33,746 --> 00:29:35,546
You've been with Mr. Du for years.

424
00:29:36,026 --> 00:29:38,927
Maintaining a relationship
isn't easy, right?

425
00:29:39,147 --> 00:29:40,907
Go to the provincial capital

426
00:29:41,427 --> 00:29:42,586
and talk with Mr. Du.

427
00:29:43,467 --> 00:29:45,826
And tell him I'm sorry
while you're at it.

428
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:55,427
Such a mess.

429
00:29:55,947 --> 00:29:56,746
They're back.

430
00:29:58,667 --> 00:29:59,506
Stop.

431
00:30:17,506 --> 00:30:18,346
Stop laughing.

432
00:30:21,627 --> 00:30:22,187
Mr. Lin,

433
00:30:22,586 --> 00:30:25,586
you're the most reliable
and responsible man I've ever met.

434
00:30:26,147 --> 00:30:26,867
Stop it.

435
00:30:27,066 --> 00:30:28,667
Everyone heard that, alright?

436
00:30:29,306 --> 00:30:30,106
- Stop.
- Right?

437
00:30:31,147 --> 00:30:32,546
Don't waste electricity.

438
00:30:34,227 --> 00:30:37,387

are in the canteen.

00:37:58,562 --> 00:37:59,416
Okay.

I didn't mean that.

536
00:38:24,586 --> 00:38:27,186
I meant the flooding issue.

537
00:38:27,566 --> 00:38:29,146
Even if a water pipe burst,

538
00:38:29,226 --> 00:38:30,747
it shouldn't have flooded that badly.

539
00:38:31,066 --> 00:38:33,506
The root cause
is an inadequate drainage system.

540
00:38:35,347 --> 00:38:37,987
Mr. Zheng and Ms. Li,
I failed in my duties.

541
00:38:38,546 --> 00:38:41,146
Once the hospital drains,
I'll fix it immediately.

542
00:38:41,506 --> 00:38:42,347
It's not your fault.

543
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:45,586
It's your fault, but not entirely.

544
00:38:46,506 --> 00:38:48,307
We can't have all the work in Yuehai

545
00:38:48,546 --> 00:38:51,307
piled on Lin and Yu.
That's just not fair.

546
00:38:51,747 --> 00:38:52,867
They're overwhelmed.

547
00:38:53,347 --> 00:38:55,467
So we need to recruit
some specialized professionals.

548
00:38:55,827 --> 00:38:57,546

I also think our cadres' energy

551
00:39:02,267 --> 00:39:03,686
should be freed up a bit, right?

552
00:39:03,827 --> 00:39:05,307
Ideally, we should mainly focus

553
00:39:05,506 --> 00:39:08,006
on supervision and management
in the future, right?

554
00:39:08,066 --> 00:39:09,747
Yes, recruit them immediately.

that's 64 new tentacles.

558
00:39:16,546 --> 00:39:18,427
But given Yuehai's current conditions,

559
00:39:18,506 --> 00:39:20,586
I'm afraid those talents
won't want to come here.

560
00:39:20,706 --> 00:39:21,347
Mr. Zheng,

561
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:23,347
I just called a few schools.

562
00:39:23,626 --> 00:39:26,506
They're all willing to provide us
with technical personnel right away.

563
00:39:27,387 --> 00:39:28,626
You see? Come on!

564
00:39:29,146 --> 00:39:29,907
Ms. Li

565
00:39:30,787 --> 00:39:32,066
- is impressive, right?
- Great.

566
00:39:32,066 --> 00:39:33,146
I haven't mentioned it yet.

567
00:39:33,146 --> 00:39:34,387
She's thought about it ahead.

568
00:39:34,867 --> 00:39:36,106
We all should learn from her.

569
00:39:36,226 --> 00:39:37,307
She's the mayor after all.

570
00:39:38,546 --> 00:39:39,480
You are the secretary.

571
00:39:41,186 --> 00:39:41,747
Xie,

572
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:44,427
are you play-acting
like a gangster boss in here?

573
00:39:46,747 --> 00:39:47,546
It's cold.

574
00:39:47,867 --> 00:39:49,467
Mr. Zheng and Ms. Li,

575
00:39:49,867 --> 00:39:51,666
the county relief supply truck is here.

576
00:39:53,427 --> 00:39:53,947
Let's go see.

577
00:39:54,506 --> 00:39:55,006
Really?

578
00:39:57,026 --> 00:39:57,747
Help me down.

579
00:39:58,186 --> 00:40:00,186
Sorry, we're late.

580
00:40:00,747 --> 00:40:01,787
We had some car trouble.

581
00:40:01,987 --> 00:40:03,827
Luckily, some kind people helped fix it.

582
00:40:04,186 --> 00:40:05,307
Or we wouldn't have made it.

583
00:40:05,666 --> 00:40:06,666
Thank you.

584
00:40:06,747 --> 00:40:07,247
Thank you.

585
00:40:07,247 --> 00:40:07,747
Come on.

586
00:40:07,747 --> 00:40:09,387
Everyone, come help.
Unload these things.

587
00:40:10,267 --> 00:40:12,632
You don't need to help.
The females shouldn't lift anything.

588
00:40:13,186 --> 00:40:14,026
Come on.

589
00:40:14,026 --> 00:40:15,026
- Okay.
- Careful.

590
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:16,747
Okay, one, two, three. Down.

591
00:40:17,186 --> 00:40:17,787
Got it.

592
00:40:17,827 --> 00:40:18,387
Good.

593
00:40:18,387 --> 00:40:18,887
Come on.

594
00:40:18,947 --> 00:40:19,787
Need a man up here.

595
00:40:20,827 --> 00:40:21,706
(After the typhoon,)

596
00:40:22,026 --> 00:40:24,586
(county relief supplies and aid
arrived promptly.)

597
00:40:25,387 --> 00:40:26,586
(Surprisingly...)

598
00:40:27,907 --> 00:40:28,827
We even have medicine.

599
00:40:54,738 --> 00:40:56,099
(Cold Relief Granules)

600
00:41:00,586 --> 00:41:01,867
Watch your hands.

601
00:41:02,066 --> 00:41:02,827
You too.

602
00:41:03,387 --> 00:41:04,066
Watch your step.

603
00:41:05,307 --> 00:41:05,987
Move to the left.

604
00:41:09,202 --> 00:41:10,776
(Cold Relief Granules)

605
00:41:12,267 --> 00:41:12,767
Okay.

606
00:41:15,106 --> 00:41:16,106
Just stir it up.

607
00:41:21,307 --> 00:41:22,546
Here, take this.

608
00:41:23,467 --> 00:41:24,506
One cup each.

609
00:41:24,506 --> 00:41:25,427
Okay. Thanks.

610
00:41:25,526 --> 00:41:26,787
- Cold medicine?
- Yes, cold medicine.

611
00:41:26,787 --> 00:41:27,467
Drink it up.

612
00:41:27,586 --> 00:41:28,387
Warm yourselves up.

613
00:41:28,387 --> 00:41:29,026
Preventative.

614
00:41:29,146 --> 00:41:30,506
Careful, it's a bit hot.

615
00:41:30,546 --> 00:41:31,546
- Okay.
- Slowly.

616
00:41:31,706 --> 00:41:33,146
Come on, have some of this.

617
00:41:33,186 --> 00:41:34,066
Don't catch a cold.

618
00:41:34,066 --> 00:41:34,787
Careful. It's hot.

619
00:41:35,842 --> 00:41:37,112
Enough! Over there.

620
00:41:38,307 --> 00:41:39,307
- Careful!
- It's fine.

621

(Orthopedic Instruments)

622
00:42:12,666 --> 00:42:13,706
Do you need help?

623
00:42:26,026 --> 00:42:27,546
How did you meet the rescue team?

624
00:42:28,186 --> 00:42:29,626
I was doing an interview in Nanzhou.

625
00:42:29,907 --> 00:42:31,907
I heard the typhoon would land here.

626
00:42:31,907 --> 00:42:33,347
So I rushed over.

627
00:42:38,787 --> 00:42:39,467
I'm sorry,

628
00:42:43,907 --> 00:42:44,427
Qiuping,

629
00:42:45,427 --> 00:42:47,352
the typhoon is over now.

630
00:42:54,456 --> 00:42:55,867
