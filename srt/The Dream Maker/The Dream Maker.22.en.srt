Desheng, lying for him

17
00:01:42,696 --> 00:01:43,735
is not good for him.

18
00:01:53,095 --> 00:01:56,455
Decheng, I've never lied to you.

19
00:02:05,255 --> 00:02:05,975
Okay.

20
00:02:08,096 --> 00:02:08,655
I believe you.

21
00:02:15,055 --> 00:02:15,816
I'm telling you.

22
00:02:16,256 --> 00:02:18,495
Don't mess around outside anymore.

23
00:02:19,175 --> 00:02:20,136
Find yourself a job.

24
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,080
Do you hear me?

25
00:02:22,816 --> 00:02:24,175
I've told you many times.

26
00:02:31,224 --> 00:02:31,832
Sister-in-law.

27
00:02:32,256 --> 00:02:33,016
Misunderstanding.

28
00:02:33,256 --> 00:02:33,775
It's alright.

29
00:02:34,215 --> 00:02:34,895
That's good.

30
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,175
Stay for dinner.

31
00:02:36,215 --> 00:02:36,976
No, thanks.

32
00:02:37,136 --> 00:02:38,335
I've got some work to handle.

33
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:39,096
I have to go.

34
00:02:39,215 --> 00:02:39,935
Desheng, I'm off.

35
00:02:39,935 --> 00:02:40,735
- Leaving now?
- Yes.

36
00:02:40,735 --> 00:02:41,576
- Take care.
- Bye.

37
00:02:41,735 --> 00:02:43,696
However busy you are, remember to eat.

38
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:49,455
You brat!

39
00:02:49,816 --> 00:02:50,895
Got some nerve now, huh?

40
00:02:51,576 --> 00:02:52,816
Tell the truth or not?

41
00:02:52,895 --> 00:02:54,696
Say it!

42
00:02:54,856 --> 00:02:56,096
Tell me the truth!

43
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:57,136
Tell me.

44
00:02:57,215 --> 00:02:58,935
You came back so late last night.

45
00:02:58,976 --> 00:03:00,055
Was it you?

46
00:03:01,016 --> 00:03:02,136
I've told you.

47
00:03:02,775 --> 00:03:03,816
It wasn't me.

48
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:05,935
I didn't do any one
of those he mentioned!

49
00:03:06,016 --> 00:03:07,495
Then why did he say it was you?

50
00:03:07,536 --> 00:03:08,775
How would I know? Go ask him!

51
00:03:08,816 --> 00:03:10,016
I'm asking you right now!

52
00:03:10,455 --> 00:03:11,215
You won't say it?

53
00:03:11,296 --> 00:03:12,416
You brat!

54
00:03:12,495 --> 00:03:13,495
Dad, stop hitting him.

55
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,775
Zhiqiang says it wasn't him!

56
00:03:14,856 --> 00:03:15,696
- Dad!
- Dad!

57
00:03:15,735 --> 00:03:16,895
You'll hurt him!

58
00:03:16,935 --> 00:03:17,775
You, kneel down!

59
00:03:18,096 --> 00:03:19,696
All of you, kneel down!

60
00:03:21,455 --> 00:03:23,905
Anything happens to him,
none of you will get away with it.

61
00:03:24,536 --> 00:03:25,048
Got it?

62
00:03:25,368 --> 00:03:25,895
Say it!

63
00:03:30,968 --> 00:03:31,495
Right.

64
00:03:32,696 --> 00:03:34,816
In his eyes,
every bad thing is my fault.

65
00:03:35,576 --> 00:03:37,215
Just because I beat up 'monkeys' before.

66
00:03:37,816 --> 00:03:39,136
He is just a 'monkey' secretary!

67
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,016
Zhiqiang!

68
00:03:40,296 --> 00:03:41,576
Dad!

69
00:03:41,816 --> 00:03:42,376
Stop hitting!

70
00:03:42,576 --> 00:03:43,775
Stop hitting! Stop!

71
00:03:43,816 --> 00:03:44,696
Didn't I warn you?

72
00:03:44,775 --> 00:03:45,735
Didn't I tell you?

73
00:03:45,935 --> 00:03:47,096
Never talk like that!

74
00:03:47,136 --> 00:03:47,735
Zhiqiang!

75
00:03:47,976 --> 00:03:48,416
Zhiqiang!

76
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:49,136
You, kneel down.

77
00:03:49,256 --> 00:03:50,296
He thinks he's tough now?

78
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:51,064
What does he want?

79
00:03:51,672 --> 00:03:52,696
Zhiqiang, put it down.

80
00:03:52,935 --> 00:03:53,495
Please, stop.

81
00:03:53,536 --> 00:03:54,495
Mom, stay out of this.

82
00:03:57,464 --> 00:03:58,392
Where are you going?

83
00:03:58,655 --> 00:03:59,215
Zhiqiang!

84
00:03:59,696 --> 00:04:00,615
Are you crazy?

85
00:04:01,816 --> 00:04:03,136
What are you trying to do?

86
00:04:03,175 --> 00:04:03,935
Zhiqiang!

87
00:04:06,655 --> 00:04:07,976
Nothing I say matters anyway.

88
00:04:09,455 --> 00:04:10,335
If you don't trust me,

89
00:04:10,895 --> 00:04:12,016
just kill me!

90
00:04:25,816 --> 00:04:27,095
I'm asking you one last time.

91
00:04:27,215 --> 00:04:28,295
Tell me the truth.

92
00:04:29,415 --> 00:04:31,295
Why did you come back

93
00:04:32,136 --> 00:04:33,295
so late last night?

94
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:34,715
I...

95
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,136
I was drinking
and playing cards with Xiaohai.

96
00:04:40,936 --> 00:04:41,895
I fell asleep.

97
00:04:44,775 --> 00:04:45,655
When I woke up,

98
00:04:45,696 --> 00:04:46,535
I came back.

99
00:04:51,936 --> 00:04:53,855
You brat!

100
00:04:54,496 --> 00:04:55,616
Got some nerve now, huh?

101
00:04:56,335 --> 00:04:57,496
Dare wave a knife around!

102
00:05:02,855 --> 00:05:03,448
Darling.

103
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,295
Go get some bruise oil.

104
00:05:06,816 --> 00:05:07,295
Okay.

105
00:05:07,655 --> 00:05:08,095
Get up.

106
00:05:30,616 --> 00:05:32,056
I've told you already.

107
00:05:33,535 --> 00:05:35,376
You can't talk about Decheng like that.

108
00:05:35,775 --> 00:05:36,936
He's the Secretary.

109
00:05:38,295 --> 00:05:40,056
He's the secretary for all of us.

110
00:05:40,655 --> 00:05:42,215
What Secretary?

111
00:05:43,975 --> 00:05:44,696
Dad, just think...

112
00:05:47,775 --> 00:05:48,816
Think about it.

113
00:05:50,415 --> 00:05:51,936
All these years in Yuehai,

114
00:05:52,256 --> 00:05:53,415
have we got any benefit?

115
00:05:53,775 --> 00:05:55,455
Aren't we still struggling?

116
00:06:01,775 --> 00:06:04,895
Dad, I'm your own son.

117
00:06:05,855 --> 00:06:07,016
Don't you know?

118
00:06:07,895 --> 00:06:09,736
I wouldn't dare hurt anyone.

119
00:06:09,775 --> 00:06:11,095
How could you suspect me?

120
00:06:12,816 --> 00:06:13,335
Zhiqiang.

121
00:06:16,215 --> 00:06:17,176
You two, get back!

122
00:06:18,056 --> 00:06:19,736
Never say a word about tonight, got it?

123
00:06:19,895 --> 00:06:20,616
Go back!

124
00:06:20,736 --> 00:06:21,256
Get up.

125
00:06:21,295 --> 00:06:21,775
Go back.

126
00:06:21,855 --> 00:06:23,376
Get up.

127
00:06:24,655 --> 00:06:25,136
Let's go.

128
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,048
(Cinema)

129
00:07:09,048 --> 00:07:10,415
(No Credit)

130
00:07:10,415 --> 00:07:10,895
Hello.

131
00:07:19,855 --> 00:07:21,655
(He only spoke out against tyranny,)

132
00:07:22,056 --> 00:07:23,696
(and exposed those speculators)

133
00:07:23,895 --> 00:07:24,535
(and swindlers.)

134
00:07:24,816 --> 00:07:25,696
(He's surely guilty!)

135
00:07:26,376 --> 00:07:27,056
(Shut her up.)

136
00:07:30,176 --> 00:07:31,016
(Enough, miss.)

137
00:07:32,895 --> 00:07:34,335
(Ten lashes for extortion.)

138
00:07:35,376 --> 00:07:37,215
(Malicious slander and defamation...)

139
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:37,895
Hai.

140
00:07:38,736 --> 00:07:39,136
Hai.

141
00:07:56,568 --> 00:07:57,784
How did you know I was here?

142
00:07:58,136 --> 00:07:58,736
Let me ask you.

143
00:07:59,376 --> 00:08:01,455
Was it you who did that to Mr. Tan?

144
00:08:08,816 --> 00:08:09,335
No.

145
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,016
Then why do you keep dodging me?

146
00:08:31,975 --> 00:08:32,815
- (From now on,)
- From now on,

147
00:08:32,895 --> 00:08:34,376
- (we won't beat innocent people.)
- we won't beat innocent people.

148
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,616
- (We'll show you fair justice.)
- We'll show you fair justice.

149
00:08:46,016 --> 00:08:46,976
I have no choice.

150
00:08:48,575 --> 00:08:49,175
Qiang.

151
00:08:49,895 --> 00:08:51,256
Why did you do this?

152
00:08:51,575 --> 00:08:52,096
For money.

153
00:08:56,175 --> 00:08:57,175
Hai, I won't lie to you.

154
00:08:57,736 --> 00:09:00,575
I've figured out the timing,
supply, and sales channels.

155
00:09:01,096 --> 00:09:02,016
If you join us,

156
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:03,695
we'll make a fortune.

157
00:09:04,376 --> 00:09:05,815
Do you know what this is?

158
00:09:06,336 --> 00:09:07,415
It's robbery.

159
00:09:07,736 --> 00:09:08,256
A crime!

160
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:08,976
So what?

161
00:09:12,775 --> 00:09:15,136
You think those 'monkeys'
earn their money clean?

162
00:09:15,575 --> 00:09:17,496
We're robbing the rich to help the poor.

163
00:09:17,976 --> 00:09:19,216
The bolder you are,

164
00:09:19,256 --> 00:09:20,976
the more you get. Hai.

165
00:09:21,976 --> 00:09:24,016
Besides, I'm not doing this forever.

166
00:09:24,336 --> 00:09:26,336
Just make some big ones, and save up.

167
00:09:27,496 --> 00:09:29,856
I'll open a factory myself
and become a 'monkey' too.

168
00:09:29,935 --> 00:09:31,695
Who'd dare look down on us then?

169
00:09:35,216 --> 00:09:36,456
I'm serious.

170
00:09:37,175 --> 00:09:39,055
Keep doing this, you'll get caught.

171
00:09:40,096 --> 00:09:40,655
Stop now.

172
00:09:41,016 --> 00:09:41,655
Stop?

173
00:09:42,775 --> 00:09:43,815
(I'll spare your life.)

174
00:09:44,096 --> 00:09:45,415
Then what should I do?

175
00:09:47,496 --> 00:09:48,815
I work at a state-owned factory.

176
00:09:49,175 --> 00:09:49,935
I'm doing fine.

177
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,415
I'll ask my master

178
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,775
to find you a job there.

179
00:09:54,775 --> 00:09:55,895
Hai.

180
00:09:56,376 --> 00:09:58,695
You've been worked there for long.

181
00:10:00,136 --> 00:10:01,376
What do they pay you monthly?

182
00:10:03,216 --> 00:10:03,935
36 yuan.

183
00:10:05,935 --> 00:10:07,575
You know how much I make each time?

184
00:10:08,456 --> 00:10:09,016
How much?

185
00:10:12,456 --> 00:10:13,055
8,000 yuan.

186
00:10:14,736 --> 00:10:16,695
8,000 yuan, one time.

187
00:10:17,935 --> 00:10:19,336
Ever seen that much money?

188
00:10:20,856 --> 00:10:22,016
(Fight me again.)

189
00:10:22,695 --> 00:10:24,736
(Forgotten? I'm a bandit.)

190
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,056
- (Bandits don't care)

that Xiaohai and those punks
would never reform.

Lower your voice.

218
00:11:49,856 --> 00:11:52,055
Forgotten he's Mr. Zheng's nephew?

219
00:11:53,415 --> 00:11:54,216
What's that?

220
00:11:54,935 --> 00:11:56,535
Yang Xiaohai and those punks

221
00:11:56,736 --> 00:11:57,616

I-I know.

235
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:46,976
I just wanted to ask...

236
00:12:47,456 --> 00:12:52,016
How long might he get?

237
00:12:58,736 --> 00:12:59,288
Well...

238
00:13:00,248 --> 00:13:02,775
The court hasn't ruled yet.

239
00:13:03,376 --> 00:13:04,575
We've consulted documents.

240
00:13:05,456 --> 00:13:06,415
According to the law,

241
00:13:07,695 --> 00:13:08,895
Zhiqiang

242
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,295
may...

243
00:13:18,136 --> 00:13:19,096
get several years.

244
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:23,895
That long?

245
00:13:26,376 --> 00:13:27,000
Then...

246
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:28,856
Can it be less?

247
00:13:30,055 --> 00:13:32,935
If he behaves well,
he could be released earlier.

248
00:13:37,655 --> 00:13:42,616
I really wonder
what the conditions are there?

249
00:13:46,016 --> 00:13:48,376
Desheng, I don't know either.

250
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:57,895
Decheng.

251
00:14:01,935 --> 00:14:03,055
You're the Secretary.

252
00:14:04,935 --> 00:14:05,695

253
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:07,864
Could you...

254
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:09,976
Could you...

255
00:14:12,815 --> 00:14:14,415
Put in a word for him?

256
00:14:15,575 --> 00:14:17,216
Help him, please.

257
00:14:36,055 --> 00:14:36,695
Desheng.

258
00:14:39,096 --> 00:14:40,895
He committed a crime.

259
00:14:43,976 --> 00:14:44,616
Decheng.

260
00:14:46,775 --> 00:14:48,695
I've never asked you
for anything before.

261
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:51,456
Never asked you.

262
00:14:53,136 --> 00:14:56,575
Zhiqiang committed
such a serious offense.

263
00:14:57,935 --> 00:14:58,295
You...

264
00:15:04,736 --> 00:15:06,295
I'm begging you today.

265
00:15:06,336 --> 00:15:07,295
Desheng, stop.

266
00:15:07,336 --> 00:15:09,096
No, I'm begging you.

267
00:15:09,136 --> 00:15:09,736
Desheng.

268
00:15:09,815 --> 00:15:10,856
Please, I beg you.

269
00:15:10,895 --> 00:15:12,976
Help him, won't you?

270
00:15:13,376 --> 00:15:13,976
Desheng.

271
00:15:14,216 --> 00:15:15,016
Get up.

272
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:17,535
Desheng, I know.

273
00:15:17,815 --> 00:15:18,856
Desheng, I know.

274
00:15:20,136 --> 00:15:20,856
I know, Desheng.

275
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,736
I know it's difficult for you.

276
00:15:26,815 --> 00:15:28,976
I know Zhiqiang did make a mistake.

277
00:15:29,655 --> 00:15:32,856
That day, I beat him at home.

278
00:15:33,575 --> 00:15:35,736
He realized he was wrong.

279
00:15:37,535 --> 00:15:42,136
Zhiqiang has been closest to you
since he was little.

280
00:15:43,456 --> 00:15:44,935
Now he's in trouble.

281
00:15:45,336 --> 00:15:47,775
You can't just abandon him.

282
00:15:51,655 --> 00:15:55,216
Desheng. I really want to help.

283
00:15:59,295 --> 00:16:01,216
If you'd told me earlier,

284
00:16:03,016 --> 00:16:05,096
I would've taken him to turn himself in.

285
00:16:06,016 --> 00:16:07,704
T-Then, things...

286
00:16:08,472 --> 00:16:10,216
Things wouldn't be this bad.

287
00:16:11,216 --> 00:16:11,736
You're right.

288
00:16:13,935 --> 00:16:15,136
It's all my fault.

289
00:16:16,415 --> 00:16:18,575
It's all my fault.

290
00:16:18,616 --> 00:16:21,336
I'm not a good dad.

291
00:16:22,336 --> 00:16:25,496
I ruined my own son.

292
00:16:25,535 --> 00:16:26,856
No, Desheng.

293
00:16:28,935 --> 00:16:30,055
It's not your fault.

294
00:16:30,096 --> 00:16:31,935
I destroyed my own son.

295
00:16:32,096 --> 00:16:32,976
It's not your fault.

296
00:16:34,775 --> 00:16:35,655

I'm telling you.

369
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:55,615
We shouldn't have come here.

370

You see this old house?

There's even your height marked.

372
00:22:12,575 --> 00:22:15,775
Living here, I sometimes dream of Mom.

373

We followed you here.

375
00:22:26,896 --> 00:22:29,535
A-And you sent Zhiqiang to jail.

376
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:32,936
Desheng.

377
00:22:33,815 --> 00:22:35,896
Did I send him in?

378
00:22:37,016 --> 00:22:38,216
He committed a crime.

379
00:22:38,855 --> 00:22:41,815
He must be punished by law.

380
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:44,256
When I came here that night,

381
00:22:44,535 --> 00:22:45,936
you shouldn't have covered for him.

382
00:22:46,256 --> 00:22:47,775
You should've told me the truth.

383
00:22:47,976 --> 00:22:50,135
He's your nephew!

384
00:22:51,135 --> 00:22:51,736
Let me ask you.

385
00:22:52,736 --> 00:22:54,256
Since we came to Yuehai,

386
00:22:54,736 --> 00:22:56,256
have I ever asked you for anything?

387
00:22:58,256 --> 00:23:01,656
We came here for a better life.

388
00:23:02,575 --> 00:23:04,696
Did we get any help from you?

389
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:08,375
No. Never!

390
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:11,535
Zhiqiang's fate is bad.

391
00:23:11,696 --> 00:23:12,575
He deserves it.

392
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:17,055
If it was 10,000-yuan household,
you'd do everything you could to help.

393
00:23:17,656 --> 00:23:18,736
Zhiqiang was right.

394
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:21,368
Y-You're just...

395
00:23:22,488 --> 00:23:24,855
A 'monkey' secretary.

396
00:24:31,055 --> 00:24:31,696
Mr. Zheng.

397
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:37,335
Why are you here?

398
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:42,976
I-I came to report to you.

399
00:24:44,535 --> 00:24:45,575
Look at you.

400
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:48,295
I climbed all the way up here

401
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,535
just to be alone.

402
00:24:51,135 --> 00:24:53,176
And you climbed up to report.

403
00:24:53,696 --> 00:24:55,216
Trying to dodge me?

404
00:24:55,736 --> 00:24:56,696
You wish!

405
00:24:57,815 --> 00:24:59,256
I should've brought my camera

406
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:00,976
to take you a photo.

407
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,696
A secretary

408
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,575
drinks this much during work hours.

409
00:25:04,815 --> 00:25:05,855
Is that proper?

410
00:25:14,135 --> 00:25:14,815
My fault.

411
00:25:16,055 --> 00:25:17,135
You can report now.

412
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:20,815
I went to Yang Village and Wang Village,

413
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:25,135
visited all the families
of the sentenced guys,

414
00:25:25,535 --> 00:25:27,815
and recorded their needs.

415
00:25:29,055 --> 00:25:29,575
Good.

416
00:25:31,456 --> 00:25:32,896
I also visited Zheng Desheng.

417
00:25:47,936 --> 00:25:52,176
So you also think
I'm a 'monkey' secretary?

418
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,656
'Monkey' secretary?

419
00:26:05,176 --> 00:26:06,696
Desheng is barely literate.

420
00:26:08,095 --> 00:26:09,736
But I think he's right.

421
00:26:10,295 --> 00:26:11,656
I am indeed a 'monkey' secretary.

422
00:26:13,176 --> 00:26:15,295
Yuehai needs money to develop.

423
00:26:15,928 --> 00:26:16,984
Where is the money from?

424
00:26:17,736 --> 00:26:18,256
'Monkeys'.

425
00:26:18,896 --> 00:26:19,696
The roads.

426
00:26:20,295 --> 00:26:21,216
The houses.

427
00:26:22,016 --> 00:26:24,815
Everything in Yuehai is built

428
00:26:25,575 --> 00:26:26,135
by 'monkeys'.

429
00:26:27,128 --> 00:26:28,216
City construction fees.

430
00:26:28,896 --> 00:26:29,775
Seven-up, eight-down.

431
00:26:30,295 --> 00:26:30,976
Binhai Road.

432
00:26:31,855 --> 00:26:32,656
I was disciplined.

433
00:26:34,264 --> 00:26:35,815
I went to the leaders again and again.

434
00:26:36,135 --> 00:26:37,456
I offended every cadre.

435
00:26:37,496 --> 00:26:38,335
Who did I do it for?

436
00:26:38,775 --> 00:26:39,375
'Monkeys'.

437
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:43,855
I care for nobody but 'monkeys'.

438
00:26:44,632 --> 00:26:46,335
If I'm not a 'monkey' secretary,
what am I?

439
00:27:01,176 --> 00:27:01,775
Ms. Li.

440
00:27:06,055 --> 00:27:07,335
I didn't think about others.

441
00:27:09,656 --> 00:27:10,736
Maybe I did.

442
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:17,575
But I felt they only needed enough
to eat and drink.

443
00:27:21,855 --> 00:27:22,976
I never thought it through.

444
00:27:24,135 --> 00:27:26,295
I never seriously thought

445
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:28,256
about their desires

446
00:27:29,736 --> 00:27:30,656
and development.

447
00:27:31,976 --> 00:27:33,496
All I cared about were the 'monkeys'.

448
00:27:42,736 --> 00:27:43,936
I'm a secretary.

449
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:46,976
But when my nephew committed a crime,

450
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,375
and went to jail,

451
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,295
I couldn't do a thing.

452
00:27:52,535 --> 00:27:53,095
Mr. Zheng.

453
00:27:53,335 --> 00:27:54,656
It has nothing to do with you.

454
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:57,016
They weren't sent in by you.

455
00:27:57,815 --> 00:27:58,736
That may be true.

456
00:28:00,176 --> 00:28:02,135
But I should've
paid attention to them earlier.

457
00:28:03,216 --> 00:28:03,815
Mr. Zheng.

458
00:28:04,775 --> 00:28:05,896
Since we build the city,

459
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:09,295
you've paid great attention
to the people.

460
00:28:09,696 --> 00:28:11,575
You fought for job opportunities

461
00:28:11,936 --> 00:28:12,815
and quotas for them.

462
00:28:13,335 --> 00:28:16,216
The town government even
gives them monthly subsidies.

463
00:28:16,656 --> 00:28:18,535
Zheng Zhiqiang is an individual case.

464
00:28:18,575 --> 00:28:20,016
It's not a group issue.

465
00:28:20,575 --> 00:28:23,775
Yuehai has never been a place
just for 'monkeys'.

466
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:28,896
We still haven't done enough.

467
00:28:30,135 --> 00:28:31,535
They went down the wrong path

468
00:28:32,055 --> 00:28:34,176
because they were poor
and had no guidance.

469
00:28:35,016 --> 00:28:37,656
We must speed up development

470
00:28:38,575 --> 00:28:40,256
to narrow the wealth gap.

471
00:28:40,656 --> 00:28:43,135
If you think that way,
you're being too impatient.

472
00:28:43,456 --> 00:28:46,696
Our city has developed very rapidly
since its founding.

473
00:28:47,416 --> 00:28:48,896
In the process of development,

474
00:28:49,095 --> 00:28:51,335
problems are inevitable.

475
00:28:52,016 --> 00:28:56,896
As a secretary, you should be thinking
about the path forward,

476
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:59,496
not blaming yourself over one person.

477
00:29:11,535 --> 00:29:12,055
So...

478
00:29:14,775 --> 00:29:17,656
You don't think
I'm a 'monkey' secretary?

479
00:29:20,055 --> 00:29:20,696
Of course not.

480
00:29:22,216 --> 00:29:24,976
People in our position
will always be criticized.

481
00:29:26,416 --> 00:29:28,375
We just need to do what's right.

482
00:29:28,936 --> 00:29:30,375
That's enough.

483
00:29:51,535 --> 00:29:52,176
Mr. Zheng.

484
00:29:53,335 --> 00:29:54,375
Come take a look.

485
00:30:02,896 --> 00:30:03,775

00:30:12,815 --> 00:30:13,615

we're holding a small lighting ceremony

00:32:07,496 --> 00:32:10,416
at this intersection.

514
00:32:11,335 --> 00:32:12,976
This isn't an ordinary intersection.

515
00:32:13,375 --> 00:32:14,855
For Yuehai,

516
00:32:15,256 --> 00:32:18,176
it is a historic one.

517
00:32:18,936 --> 00:32:20,295
It signifies that Yuehai

518
00:32:20,535 --> 00:32:23,335
has entered a new era.

519
00:32:23,535 --> 00:32:25,575

- Great!

00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:27,976
Is it impressive?

521
00:32:28,016 --> 00:32:29,095
Yes!

522
00:32:29,295 --> 00:32:30,696
Are you happy?

523
00:32:30,775 --> 00:32:31,896
Yes!

524
00:32:32,416 --> 00:32:33,135
Great!

525
00:32:33,256 --> 00:32:33,815
Leader.

526
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:35,936
What is this thing?

527
00:32:36,456 --> 00:32:37,736
Can't you tell?

528
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:39,375
Look at the red...

529
00:32:40,016 --> 00:32:41,656
This is called a traffic signal light.

530
00:32:41,855 --> 00:32:42,335
What light?

531
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:43,375
A traffic signal light.

532
00:32:43,416 --> 00:32:44,976
Do you see the color?

533
00:32:45,016 --> 00:32:46,016
No, Mr. Xie.

534
00:32:46,095 --> 00:32:47,976
Everyone, listen to me.

535
00:32:48,295 --> 00:32:51,216
Its official name is "traffic signal."

536
00:32:51,335 --> 00:32:52,615
Back in 1988,

537
00:32:52,656 --> 00:32:57,615
the Road Traffic Management Regulations
are issued.

538
00:32:57,896 --> 00:33:00,335
Article 9 of Chapter 2 stipulates...

539
00:33:00,496 --> 00:33:01,775
I don't understand.

540
00:33:02,535 --> 00:33:03,696
Too technical.

541
00:33:04,496 --> 00:33:05,736
Simply, it's a traffic light.

542
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:06,456
Traffic light.

543
00:33:06,456 --> 00:33:06,896
Alright.

544
00:33:07,535 --> 00:33:08,535
You country bumpkins.

545
00:33:08,536 --> 00:33:09,976
Haven't you been to the county town?

546
00:33:10,135 --> 00:33:12,295
They've had these for ages.

547
00:33:12,535 --> 00:33:14,976
How is that black lump a light?

548
00:33:14,976 --> 00:33:15,736
Listen to me.

549
00:33:16,055 --> 00:33:17,216
No rush.

550
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:18,736
I'll explain it slowly.

551
00:33:18,736 --> 00:33:20,376
- Turn the light on first.
- It's simple.

552
00:33:20,855 --> 00:33:22,375
Okay. Turn the light on.

553
00:33:22,535 --> 00:33:22,936
Yu.

554
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:24,095
Turn the light on.

555
00:33:24,216 --> 00:33:25,016
Li.

556
00:33:25,335 --> 00:33:26,456
Turn on the red light!

557
00:33:30,016 --> 00:33:31,696
Stop at red.

558
00:33:32,295 --> 00:33:33,936
Stop at red.

559
00:33:33,976 --> 00:33:35,696
Go at green.

560
00:33:35,976 --> 00:33:37,575
Go at green.

561
00:33:37,936 --> 00:33:39,615
Stop at red.

562
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,615
Stop at red.

563
00:33:41,815 --> 00:33:43,456
Go at green.

564
00:33:43,696 --> 00:33:45,456
Go at green.

565
00:33:46,936 --> 00:33:49,055
Watch your step.

566
00:33:51,416 --> 00:33:51,896
Okay?

567
00:33:54,696 --> 00:33:57,535
Hello, I'm the Town Mayor, Li Qiuping.

568
00:33:58,216 --> 00:34:02,135
Yuehai's development
needs everyone's suggestions.

569
00:34:02,295 --> 00:34:04,055
Please leave a message after the beep.

570
00:34:07,095 --> 00:34:10,296
Ms. Li, you could sound a bit warmer.

571
00:34:11,175 --> 00:34:12,655
Smile and show more enthusiasm.

572
00:34:12,976 --> 00:34:13,255
Okay.

573
00:34:13,255 --> 00:34:13,976
Let's try again.

574
00:34:17,735 --> 00:34:20,255
Hello, I'm the Town Mayor, Li Qiuping.

575
00:34:20,936 --> 00:34:24,976
Yuehai's development
needs everyone's suggestions.

576
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:26,456
Please...

577
00:34:27,055 --> 00:34:29,896
Ms. Li, still not enough warm.

578
00:34:30,055 --> 00:34:31,615
Could you bring a bit more?

579
00:34:34,264 --> 00:34:35,032
What are you doing?

580
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:36,535
Where did everyone go?

581
00:34:36,695 --> 00:34:39,000
They are all
at the traffic light ceremony.

582
00:34:41,615 --> 00:34:42,175
Mr. Zheng.

583
00:34:42,575 --> 00:34:44,695
If you're free today,
go to the hospital.

584
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,055
I'm not sick. Why go to the hospital?

585
00:34:48,095 --> 00:34:49,016
Just go. You'll see.

586
00:34:50,896 --> 00:34:51,535
Go.

587
00:34:56,816 --> 00:34:57,376
Fine.

588
00:35:00,735 --> 00:35:01,376
Let's try again.

589
00:35:02,648 --> 00:35:03,352
Be enthusiastic.

590
00:35:03,735 --> 00:35:04,376
Okay.

591
00:35:07,576 --> 00:35:12,330
(Emergency)

592
00:35:42,513 --> 00:35:45,175
(Outpatient Department)

593
00:35:45,175 --> 00:35:47,255
Our hospital is finally built. Right?

594
00:35:47,456 --> 00:35:48,655
It's a trial run now.

595
00:35:48,735 --> 00:35:50,735
Why not be the first
to try it ourselves?

596
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:51,896
The facilities are ready.

597
00:35:51,976 --> 00:35:54,535
We should take better care
of our health.

598
00:35:54,856 --> 00:35:55,735
This is good stuff.

599
00:35:56,535 --> 00:35:59,255
(Injection Room)
Xuemei worked hard to get it.

600
00:35:59,416 --> 00:36:00,336
Everyone has a dose.

601
00:36:00,456 --> 00:36:01,095
No rush.

602
00:36:01,255 --> 00:36:01,655
Okay.

603
00:36:01,936 --> 00:36:02,816
Xie, you haven't said

604
00:36:02,856 --> 00:36:04,095
what this medicine is.

605
00:36:04,135 --> 00:36:05,615
Is it safe to inject?

606
00:36:05,896 --> 00:36:06,840
Even you don't know?

607
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,776
A little nervous.

608
00:36:07,776 --> 00:36:08,184
A little.

609
00:36:08,184 --> 00:36:08,896
Immune human...

610
00:36:13,336 --> 00:36:14,376
Well... Protein...

611
00:36:14,615 --> 00:36:15,055
Protein.

612
00:36:15,095 --> 00:36:15,575
Protein.

613
00:36:16,016 --> 00:36:16,856
Yeah. "Lost"...

614
00:36:16,976 --> 00:36:17,735
What protein?

615
00:36:17,816 --> 00:36:18,535
It's "lost"...

616
00:36:18,655 --> 00:36:19,416
"Get lost" protein.

617
00:36:19,535 --> 00:36:20,896
It tells the viruses to get lost.

618
00:36:21,856 --> 00:36:23,456
It's human immunoglobulin.

619
00:36:23,535 --> 00:36:24,535
Boosts your immunity.

620
00:36:24,728 --> 00:36:25,976
Boosts your immunity.

621
00:36:26,055 --> 00:36:26,936
Yes, that's right.

622
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:28,976
One shot equals eating a hundred eggs.

623
00:36:29,016 --> 00:36:30,456
College grad, wonderful.

624
00:36:30,456 --> 00:36:31,095
Plain talk.

625
00:36:31,095 --> 00:36:32,336
We should study more.

626
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:32,936
Correct.

627
00:36:32,936 --> 00:36:33,416
Right?

628
00:36:34,376 --> 00:36:35,016
Yes.

629
00:36:35,615 --> 00:36:36,336
Wait.

630
00:36:36,376 --> 00:36:36,896
Don't rush.

631
00:36:36,896 --> 00:36:37,896
Why isn't Lin here?

632
00:36:38,215 --> 00:36:39,055
Lin isn't coming.

633
00:36:39,175 --> 00:36:39,856
I called him.

634
00:36:39,936 --> 00:36:41,144
He said eating eggs is enough.

635
00:36:42,615 --> 00:36:43,615
Still stubborn as ever.

636
00:36:44,016 --> 00:36:44,936
We must trust science.

637
00:36:44,976 --> 00:36:45,655
Leaders,

638
00:36:46,008 --> 00:36:46,735
we can start now.

639
00:36:46,776 --> 00:36:47,856
Okay.

640
00:36:48,016 --> 00:36:48,376
Start.

641
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:48,816
Okay.

642
00:36:49,776 --> 00:36:51,296
Lin's quite stubborn sometimes.

643
00:36:51,296 --> 00:36:51,976
Please.

644
00:36:53,496 --> 00:36:54,168
Take it easy.

645
00:36:57,255 --> 00:36:57,936
Shots hurt.

646
00:36:57,936 --> 00:36:58,856
Let me take a look.

647
00:36:59,016 --> 00:36:59,816
Just endure it.

648
00:36:59,816 --> 00:37:00,615
It hurts, right?

649
00:37:01,376 --> 00:37:02,095
That's normal.

650
00:37:02,456 --> 00:37:03,376
Don't move!

651
00:37:03,376 --> 00:37:04,055
Seriously?

652
00:37:04,095 --> 00:37:05,296
You've poked so many times!

653
00:37:05,296 --> 00:37:05,896
Sorry.

654
00:37:06,336 --> 00:37:07,296
Call the head nurse.

655
00:37:07,376 --> 00:37:08,255
Look what you did.

656
00:37:08,296 --> 00:37:09,336
Head nurse!

657
00:37:09,496 --> 00:37:09,936
What's up?

658
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,352
Veins are too small. Won't work.

659
00:37:11,615 --> 00:37:12,135
Check it out.

660
00:37:12,175 --> 00:37:12,776
It's okay.

661
00:37:13,575 --> 00:37:14,336
Come here, sweetie.

662
00:37:14,376 --> 00:37:15,336
Let me take a look.

663
00:37:15,376 --> 00:37:15,976
Let me check.

664
00:37:16,255 --> 00:37:17,936
Exactly, kids have thinner veins.

665
00:37:18,776 --> 00:37:19,575
For adults,

666
00:37:19,615 --> 00:37:21,575
we have to pat and pat
to make the veins show.

667
00:37:21,655 --> 00:37:22,456
For kids, not easy.

668
00:37:22,456 --> 00:37:23,416
Head nurse can do it.

669
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:25,496
Good boy.

670
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:26,215
See?

671
00:37:26,575 --> 00:37:26,936
Done.

672
00:37:26,936 --> 00:37:27,535
Done.

673
00:37:27,776 --> 00:37:28,856
Learn from her.

674
00:37:29,272 --> 00:37:29,735
It's done.

675
00:37:29,735 --> 00:37:30,376
Exactly.

676
00:37:30,575 --> 00:37:32,135
It's okay.

677
00:37:32,135 --> 00:37:32,735
Sorry.

678
00:37:33,055 --> 00:37:34,655
Liu, handle the rest.

679
00:37:35,135 --> 00:37:36,575
Kids' veins are hard to find.

680
00:37:36,575 --> 00:37:37,255
Absolutely.

681
00:37:37,336 --> 00:37:37,816
Yes.

682
00:37:37,856 --> 00:37:39,336
Mommy, it hurts.

683
00:37:40,344 --> 00:37:41,055
It's swelling up.

684
00:37:41,055 --> 00:37:42,416
Look at this!

685
00:37:42,416 --> 00:37:43,336
Are you professional?

686
00:37:43,376 --> 00:37:44,695
Swelling is serious.

687
00:37:44,856 --> 00:37:45,535
Sorry.

688
00:37:45,535 --> 00:37:46,095
Swelling up.

689
00:37:46,095 --> 00:37:48,016
Sorry. I'll get another nurse to do it.

690
00:37:48,095 --> 00:37:49,255
No need!

691
00:37:49,296 --> 00:37:50,575
Pull it out now! We're leaving.

692
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:51,215
Let's go.

693
00:37:51,255 --> 00:37:52,095
Pull it out.

694
00:37:52,416 --> 00:37:53,535
He's suffering enough.

695
00:37:53,735 --> 00:37:54,680
We're done here.

696
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,215
Don't watch.

697
00:37:55,215 --> 00:37:56,135
Calm down.

698
00:37:56,296 --> 00:37:58,095
They've switched nurses.

699
00:37:58,816 --> 00:37:59,535
I saw it.

700
00:38:00,016 --> 00:38:01,856
You don't even know
how to give injections.

701
00:38:02,776 --> 00:38:03,856
This place is awful!

702
00:38:03,856 --> 00:38:04,336
I'm sorry.

703
00:38:04,695 --> 00:38:05,376
Don't say that.

704
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:06,856
Rest for a bit. Calm down.

705
00:38:06,856 --> 00:38:07,575
We'll handle it.

706
00:38:07,735 --> 00:38:08,496
Take a break.

707
00:38:09,255 --> 00:38:09,912
Seriously?

708
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:10,680
Aren't you a nurse?

709
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,095
His veins are too thin.

710
00:38:14,296 --> 00:38:15,296
It hurts!

711
00:38:15,936 --> 00:38:17,055
Are you giving shots

712
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:18,255
(Injection Room)
or killing people?

713
00:38:18,655 --> 00:38:19,856
This is way too painful.

714
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:25,135
Who hired you people?

715
00:38:25,976 --> 00:38:26,896
With skills like this?

716
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:28,535
Did you even get proper training?

717
00:38:29,095 --> 00:38:30,336
And you dare to give shots?

718
00:38:32,336 --> 00:38:33,695
I'm calling your director

719
00:38:33,856 --> 00:38:34,896
to get you all fired!

720
00:38:40,135 --> 00:38:41,016
Am I dreaming?

721
00:38:42,055 --> 00:38:43,615
I saw Ms. Li lose it.

722
00:38:44,416 --> 00:38:45,016
Xie.

723
00:38:45,016 --> 00:38:46,296
Is that medicine legit?

724
00:38:46,456 --> 00:38:48,896
I think the medicine is fine.

725
00:38:49,615 --> 00:38:50,936
But Ms. Li might not.

726
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:52,615
Why do I suddenly feel dizzy?

727
00:38:53,615 --> 00:38:54,776
Maybe I should go.

728
00:38:54,816 --> 00:38:56,095
Let's head back.

729
00:38:56,336 --> 00:38:57,376
Wait, Mr. Zheng.

730
00:38:57,456 --> 00:38:58,575
You're next.

731
00:38:58,695 --> 00:38:59,135
Eat eggs.

732
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:00,175
Yes, eggs will help.

733
00:39:00,896 --> 00:39:01,655
Meng is the next.

734
00:39:02,095 --> 00:39:03,255
I'll see how skilled she is.

735
00:39:04,095 --> 00:39:05,016
Give her a shot first.

736
00:39:05,336 --> 00:39:06,695
Mr. Hailuo, you go first.

737
00:39:07,128 --> 00:39:07,735
(Town Mayor's Office)
You first.

738
00:39:07,896 --> 00:39:08,896
Ms. Li.

739
00:39:09,215 --> 00:39:11,535
The dentist today was so unprofessional.

740
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:15,095
I want to extract my wisdom tooth,
but he extracted my molar instead!

741
00:39:16,336 --> 00:39:17,856
They charged one yuan to register,

742
00:39:17,936 --> 00:39:19,175
and then kept asking me

743
00:39:19,336 --> 00:39:20,615
why I was uncomfortable.

744
00:39:20,856 --> 00:39:22,535
If I knew the reason,

745
00:39:22,575 --> 00:39:23,575
why would I come there?

746
00:39:23,615 --> 00:39:25,296
Yuehai Hospital is a mess.

747
00:39:25,456 --> 00:39:26,456
I had stomach pain,

748
00:39:26,615 --> 00:39:28,695
and the pharmacy gave me
the wrong medicine!

749
00:39:28,735 --> 00:39:29,456
I want a refund!

750
00:39:29,976 --> 00:39:31,055
I did a bunch of tests.

751
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:32,248
I went to get the results.

752
00:39:32,248 --> 00:39:34,575
But they told me they lost my sample.

753
00:39:34,655 --> 00:39:35,296
Ms. Li.

754
00:39:35,535 --> 00:39:37,416
I've been taking the medicine
for half a month,

755
00:39:37,735 --> 00:39:40,016
but still sick,
even have diarrhea every day.

756
00:39:40,416 --> 00:39:41,575
Is this a scam?

757
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:44,416
This hospital feels useless.

758
00:39:44,856 --> 00:39:47,016
At best, they can handle a cold.

759
00:39:47,296 --> 00:39:50,055
For others, we still have
to go to the county or city hospital.

760
00:39:53,336 --> 00:39:54,655
Let's congratulate Cao.

761
00:39:56,336 --> 00:39:56,735
Thanks.

762
00:39:57,135 --> 00:39:57,976
Thank you.

763
00:39:58,016 --> 00:40:00,296
Cao, you should treat us
for your first big story.

764
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,055
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

765
00:40:02,095 --> 00:40:03,735
Okay. No problem.

766
00:40:04,215 --> 00:40:05,496
Soup dumplings, all you can eat.

767
00:40:06,376 --> 00:40:07,735
- That won't do!
- That won't do!

768
00:40:08,095 --> 00:40:09,535
Don't be so stingy, Cao.

769
00:40:09,776 --> 00:40:11,480
When Reporter Du
got his first big story,

770
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:14,095
he treated us to West Lake vinegar fish
and braised duck.

771
00:40:14,416 --> 00:40:15,856
- Right?
- Exactly!

772
00:40:15,896 --> 00:40:17,255
Well, I can't compete with Mr. Du.

773
00:40:17,936 --> 00:40:18,776
Mr. Du, you're here.

774
00:40:19,575 --> 00:40:20,655
Got reader letters again?

775
00:40:21,135 --> 00:40:21,535
Yes.

776
00:40:21,936 --> 00:40:22,456
Du.

777
00:40:22,896 --> 00:40:23,976
Cao is your junior, right?

778
00:40:24,695 --> 00:40:26,055
He joined later,

779
00:40:26,416 --> 00:40:28,095
but now he's ahead of you.

780
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:30,255
Step up your game.

781
00:40:30,456 --> 00:40:30,816
Yes.

782
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:31,896
You're right.

783
00:40:32,016 --> 00:40:32,896
I'll work harder.

784
00:40:33,016 --> 00:40:33,376
No.

785
00:40:33,695 --> 00:40:35,535
Thanks to Mr. Du
helping me check things.

786
00:40:35,672 --> 00:40:36,936
He got me that headline.

787
00:40:36,936 --> 00:40:37,336
No.

788
00:40:37,456 --> 00:40:39,215
Your topic choice was good.

789
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:41,695
I-I'll get the call.

790
00:40:41,776 --> 00:40:42,336
You continue.

791
00:40:45,095 --> 00:40:46,135
Alright.

792
00:40:46,215 --> 00:40:47,535
Tonight, dinner's on me.

793
00:40:48,055 --> 00:40:49,055
- Great!
- Great!

794
00:40:52,615 --> 00:40:53,144
Hello?

795
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:54,680
Qiuping.

796
00:40:54,896 --> 00:40:57,016
Du Tao, are you free this weekend?

797
00:40:58,392 --> 00:40:59,896
I'd like to treat your mom to dinner.

798
00:41:00,655 --> 00:41:01,976
Okay, I'll arrange it.

799
00:41:02,328 --> 00:41:02,816
Good.

800
00:41:03,615 --> 00:41:04,896
Let's say 6 PM then.

801
00:41:04,976 --> 00:41:06,135
Let's go together after work.

802
00:41:06,215 --> 00:41:07,535
- Alright.
- Alright.

803
00:41:08,456 --> 00:41:08,976
Senior.

804
00:41:09,655 --> 00:41:11,535
You should take the Jeep.

805
00:41:11,856 --> 00:41:13,095
Your reporting covers more.

806
00:41:13,135 --> 00:41:13,976
You travel further.

807
00:41:14,376 --> 00:41:15,535
No need. I'm fine.

808
00:41:15,655 --> 00:41:16,135
Thanks.

809
00:41:23,255 --> 00:41:23,936
Qiuping.

810
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:26,175
Need my help?

811
00:41:28,936 --> 00:41:29,976
Yes, Madam.

812
00:41:30,215 --> 00:41:31,456
I do need your help.

813
00:41:31,776 --> 00:41:32,575
Let me tell you.

814
00:41:33,095 --> 00:41:34,816
People have been talking a lot

815
00:41:35,215 --> 00:41:37,735
that Yuehai Town Hospital is finished.

816
00:41:38,175 --> 00:41:39,695
It's quite large

817
00:41:40,055 --> 00:41:41,776
and has advanced equipment, right?

818
00:41:42,575 --> 00:41:44,215
Madam, you've heard about it?

819
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:44,776
Yes.

820
00:41:44,936 --> 00:41:45,535
That's right.

821
00:41:45,695 --> 00:41:48,456
Yuehai's hospital just opened, so...

822
00:41:49,175 --> 00:41:51,336
Waiter, please.

823
00:41:52,535 --> 00:41:52,976
Hello.

824
00:41:53,095 --> 00:41:53,936
I'd like to ask.

825
00:41:53,976 --> 00:41:57,095
Is this called
the "Whole Roast Chicken"?

826
00:41:57,456 --> 00:41:58,016
Yes.

827
00:41:58,376 --> 00:42:00,936
Are you sure this is one whole chicken?

828
00:42:01,735 --> 00:42:02,615
Isn't it?

829
00:42:03,215 --> 00:42:03,856
Look.

830
00:42:04,615 --> 00:42:08,735
The metacarpal and shoulder bones
on each side are different sizes.

831
00:42:09,135 --> 00:42:10,456
And these drumsticks,

832
00:42:10,535 --> 00:42:12,135
one's bigger, one's smaller.

833
00:42:12,336 --> 00:42:14,735
This chicken's been pieced together.

834
00:42:16,215 --> 00:42:17,735
Shall I call the manager over?

835
00:42:17,816 --> 00:42:18,856
I'm not finished yet.

836
00:42:19,175 --> 00:42:21,135
This dish, the vinegar-braised cabbage.

837
00:42:21,575 --> 00:42:22,535
This dish

838
00:42:22,575 --> 00:42:24,416
is sweet but not sour.

839
00:42:24,896 --> 00:42:29,416
It's all about the layers,
soy, sugar, and vinegar, in that order.

840
00:42:29,816 --> 00:42:31,175
Tell your head chef.

841
00:42:31,535 --> 00:42:32,776
His skills need improvement.

842
00:42:33,816 --> 00:42:36,296
I'll order the whole chicken
every time I come.

843
00:42:36,376 --> 00:42:38,655
Next time, don't serve one like this.

844
00:42:38,735 --> 00:42:39,376
Right.

845
00:42:39,535 --> 00:42:40,896
Well, my mom's a food connoisseur.

846
00:42:40,976 --> 00:42:42,776
Just make it better next time.

847
00:42:42,976 --> 00:42:43,376
Go.

848
00:42:43,376 --> 00:42:43,695
Okay.

849
00:42:43,695 --> 00:42:44,856
So sorry about this.

850
00:42:45,376 --> 00:42:46,215
By the way, Qiuping.

851
00:42:46,816 --> 00:42:48,175
Where were we just now?

852
00:42:49,535 --> 00:42:50,055
Yuehai.

853
00:42:51,055 --> 00:42:51,535
Right.

854
00:42:51,655 --> 00:42:53,655
Well, we're all close here.

855
00:42:53,976 --> 00:42:55,016
No formalities between us.

856
00:42:55,976 --> 00:42:57,535
If you want me to go to your hospital,

857
00:42:59,215 --> 00:43:00,215
I'm afraid I can't.
