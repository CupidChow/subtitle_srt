1
00:00:00,166 --> 00:00:01,481
Can I stay here for a while?

2
00:00:01,481 --> 00:00:03,914
Hang in there. I'm here for you always.

3
00:00:03,914 --> 00:00:07,132
This is probably the last clip of the Movie Seer page.

4
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:07,809
- What are you doing?
- I just finished "10 Things I Hate about You."

5
00:00:07,809 --> 00:00:10,357
- What are you doing?
- I just finished "10 Things I Hate about You."

6
00:00:10,357 --> 00:00:12,668
The lead listed out all the flaws of her crush.

7
00:00:12,668 --> 00:00:14,170
I'm going to list Khai's.

8
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,111
The only way to forget about your old love is to find someone who loves you.

9
00:00:17,111 --> 00:00:19,190
- Is this what you call love?
- Yes!

10
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:19,818
- Is this what you call love?
- Yes!

11
00:00:19,818 --> 00:00:22,190
I'm sorry I didn't see a film with you the other day.

12
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,852
It's not commonly available.

13
00:00:23,852 --> 00:00:25,105
It's a shame we didn't see it the other day.

14
00:00:25,105 --> 00:00:26,502
So, I thought I should have a special screening here.

15
00:00:26,502 --> 00:00:28,451
Mr. Boriphat. Do you know him?

16
00:00:28,451 --> 00:00:30,848
His name is Bone.

17
00:01:01,506 --> 00:01:04,614
What are you doing calling me now? I was having a good dream.

18
00:01:04,614 --> 00:01:06,286
You are about to have a very bad dream.

19
00:01:06,286 --> 00:01:08,782
The new professor is giving you an F.

20
00:01:08,782 --> 00:01:11,351
What? An F? I missed only a few classes.

21
00:01:11,351 --> 00:01:12,685
A few classes, my ass.

22
00:01:12,685 --> 00:01:15,142
You've skipped 4 weeks in a row ever since she started.

23
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:17,105
Hang in there.

24
00:01:17,105 --> 00:01:20,496
You can retake this class when we graduate.

25
00:01:20,496 --> 00:01:22,849
I need to go now. The class is about to start. Bye.

26
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,472
Two!

27
00:01:24,472 --> 00:01:26,369
Shit!

28
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,866
Here he comes, Professor. Boriphat is here.

29
00:01:34,866 --> 00:01:36,314
Boriphat, who has been skipping my class?

30
00:01:36,314 --> 00:01:38,014
Yes.

31
00:01:55,072 --> 00:01:56,686
Please have a seat.

32
00:01:56,686 --> 00:01:59,265
I'm about to start the class.

33
00:01:59,265 --> 00:02:02,904
What are you doing standing there looking stunned? Have a seat.

34
00:02:02,904 --> 00:02:06,269
Still stunned? Come here now.

35
00:02:12,249 --> 00:02:15,742
Today, we're going to learn about cutaway.

36
00:02:15,742 --> 00:02:18,238
We'll talk about how we can use it,

37
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:21,336
and when we should use it.

38
00:02:21,336 --> 00:02:23,668
Let me give you an example.

39
00:02:23,668 --> 00:02:26,110
If we are telling a story about a concert...

40
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,356
It's a concert scene.

41
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:36,741
Okay, that's it for today.

42
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:41,295
Please review what I've taught today. We will cover a new topic next week.

43
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:44,829
Okay, students?

44
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,354
Stunned, huh?

45
00:02:59,354 --> 00:03:02,039
Are you stunned by the professor's beauty?

46
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:05,408
I told you... she's your type.

47
00:03:05,408 --> 00:03:07,968
You should've come to class a long time ago.

48
00:03:11,034 --> 00:03:14,411
- Third, what are you doing next?
- Nothing.

49
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:16,811
Come with me then. I need to buy something.

50
00:03:17,553 --> 00:03:18,540
Okay.

51
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,887
Can we use your car? I didn't bring Chawee today.

52
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:30,292
I'm trying my hardest to be a good friend to him, like I've always been.

53
00:03:30,292 --> 00:03:35,249
Just being in his life is enough for me.

54
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:16,250
[Theory of Love]

55
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,160
[Ep.06: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]

56
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:22,870
Khai, what are you buying really?

57
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,130
I want to get a lipstick for my girl.

58
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,595
But I don't know much about it. So, I need your help.

59
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,943
Do you think I know anything about it?

60
00:05:30,943 --> 00:05:33,087
Come on, let's try.

61
00:05:33,087 --> 00:05:36,791
The only information I have is that she likes pink.

62
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:41,328
Then, we look at a pink color and that's it. Let's go.

63
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,817
This is not as easy as we think.

64
00:05:47,817 --> 00:05:51,022
There are several shades of pink.

65
00:05:51,022 --> 00:05:52,122
What do we do?

66
00:05:52,122 --> 00:05:54,752
I don't know. You pick.

67
00:06:07,109 --> 00:06:09,697
What the hell are you doing?

68
00:06:09,697 --> 00:06:12,351
- Stay still, Third.
- No!

69
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:13,443
Third!

70
00:06:13,443 --> 00:06:14,883
Be still.

71
00:06:17,381 --> 00:06:19,562
Stop.

72
00:06:19,562 --> 00:06:21,210
This looks nice.

73
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,765
- Let's try another color.
- No!

74
00:06:22,765 --> 00:06:24,134
No!

75
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,748
You try. You're the one who brought me here.

76
00:06:25,748 --> 00:06:27,894
Why are you so mean? It's me, your friend.

77
00:06:27,894 --> 00:06:29,697
She's yours, not mine.

78
00:06:29,697 --> 00:06:31,945
Let me pick another color.

79
00:06:31,945 --> 00:06:33,670
Is this pink? Let's try.

80
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:36,873
Turn your face to me. Third, try it.

81
00:06:36,873 --> 00:06:40,906
Third. You are so mean. Just give it a try.

82
00:06:40,906 --> 00:06:42,869
You picked the same color as me.

83
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:46,133
Be still. Let's try this on you, and you can look in the mirror.

84
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:47,589
Why am I letting you do this?

85
00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:49,139
- Who is this for?
- My girl.

86
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:50,456
That's right.

87
00:06:50,456 --> 00:06:51,591
Wow!

88
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:52,973
- How is it?
- This color is great.

89
00:06:52,973 --> 00:06:55,767
- You need to try another shade.
- No, I'm good.

90
00:06:55,767 --> 00:06:57,908
You try it.

91
00:06:57,908 --> 00:06:59,292
No.

92
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:01,012
Third.

93
00:07:12,913 --> 00:07:16,855
This slate necklace is nice. Do you want it?

94
00:07:16,855 --> 00:07:20,056
I think it's too expensive. Let's go.

95
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:38,659
See you tomorrow. Don't forget to turn in the movie critique assignment.

96
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:51,710
Why are you still here?

97
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,430
I haven't given you a thank you gift yet.

98
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,714
A thank you gift for what?

99
00:07:56,714 --> 00:07:59,625
For coming with me today.

100
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:03,528
I noticed that you wanted it, so I got it for you.

101
00:08:08,107 --> 00:08:09,621
I won't take it.

102
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:13,130
Why? I think it suits us.

103
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,428
How?

104
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:17,730
A slate syncs visuals and sounds together.

105
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:24,379
You write a screenplay to create visuals. And I record sounds from the visuals you create.

106
00:08:27,644 --> 00:08:31,775
Gosh, I want our world to have a memory eraser like in "MIB."

107
00:08:31,775 --> 00:08:35,840
I want to erase all the memories of when he treated me badly,

108
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:42,455
leaving only the good ones like this one now.

109
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:45,854
Give me your hand. Take it.

110
00:08:46,572 --> 00:08:48,253
I'm going to go.

111
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:01,311
Is it good or bad that we don't have a memory eraser like in "MIB"?

112
00:09:07,318 --> 00:09:08,861
Here.

113
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,993
Perplexed, huh?

114
00:09:12,993 --> 00:09:15,844
How did I find this French film?

115
00:09:15,844 --> 00:09:18,620
I practically begged my friend for it.

116
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:24,455
Now, you can watch this film with your girl privately.

117
00:09:24,455 --> 00:09:28,682
What's your problem? You were very eager to have it earlier.

118
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:43,127
Guys, today is the birthday of our department's president, Shane.

119
00:09:43,127 --> 00:09:44,713
Let's give him a big hand.

120
00:09:44,713 --> 00:09:46,611
To Shane!

121
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,091
Shane?

122
00:09:51,795 --> 00:09:53,669
Do you want me to speak?

123
00:09:53,669 --> 00:09:56,428
- Hello, everyone.
- Turn that way.

124
00:09:56,428 --> 00:09:58,035
Just kidding.

125
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,910
Take this.

126
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,300
Good.

127
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:07,569
Thank you for coming to my birthday party.

128
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:13,680
This is an opportunity for me to give back to you all.

129
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:20,794
Let me invite all our relatives, parents, siblings, and the members of the Faculty of Comm Arts

130
00:10:20,794 --> 00:10:25,600
to come together to make a musical for our Faculty of Comm Arts this year

131
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,830
in the occasion that I am the director.

132
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,620
Yeah!

133
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,293
How's that? Clap your hands.

134
00:10:33,293 --> 00:10:35,109
That's right.

135
00:10:35,109 --> 00:10:37,530
Thank you.

136
00:10:38,272 --> 00:10:41,548
Who'd be stupid enough to do this? It's a lot of work.

137
00:10:41,548 --> 00:10:45,766
- What did you just say, Khai?
- Hey, my friend is drunk. I'm sorry.

138
00:10:46,995 --> 00:10:50,303
What are we waiting for? Let's give P'Shane a big applause.

139
00:10:50,303 --> 00:10:51,877
P'Shane! P'Shane!

140
00:10:51,877 --> 00:10:54,335
Raise your glass.

141
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:58,198
P'Shane! P'Shane!

142
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,180
P'Shane! Big applause.

143
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:04,090
Yay, P'Shane!

144
00:11:14,753 --> 00:11:17,630
Hey, are you busy these days?

145
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:21,719
I am very busy. Are you trying to get me to work on the play?

146
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:23,806
Let me tell you now... I'm not going to do it.

147
00:11:23,806 --> 00:11:25,805
No, not the play.

148
00:11:25,805 --> 00:11:27,915
I want you to do an advert with me.

149
00:11:27,915 --> 00:11:30,561
I'm still not available.

150
00:11:30,561 --> 00:11:33,509
I have a retouch job I need to finish.

151
00:11:33,983 --> 00:11:35,769
Don't give me an excuse.

152
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:39,729
Don't forget I'm holding your secret.

153
00:11:40,561 --> 00:11:42,349
What do you mean?

154
00:11:43,117 --> 00:11:45,570
I mean...

155
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:50,274
Lynn... Lynn... Lynn.

156
00:11:50,274 --> 00:11:53,051
Hey, this is not funny.

157
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,460
Khai, are you dead?

158
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,851
You're taking too long to pee.

159
00:12:09,369 --> 00:12:14,858
Wait a moment. I can't pee.

160
00:12:24,225 --> 00:12:25,920
Are you okay?

161
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,568
Like this... I'm totally fine.

162
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,976
I think you're out of it.

163
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:41,666
Go home. I'll give you a lift.

164
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:45,310
Hey, I told you... I'm fine.

165
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:48,539
This is nothing. No problem.

166
00:12:49,126 --> 00:12:51,610
You are not fine.

167
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,510
I am.

168
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,930
I think you're drunk.

169
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,069
Let's go home, trust me.

170
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:24,570
When you're watching a romance film,

171
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:28,142
you feel elated when you see the guy kiss the girl.

172
00:13:28,142 --> 00:13:31,330
It's cute. It's beautiful. It's romantic.

173
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:38,856
So, why, now that I'm kissing Khai, don't I feel that way?

174
00:13:39,728 --> 00:13:41,037
Khai... you...

175
00:13:41,037 --> 00:13:42,708
Praew.

176
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:46,310
It feels like a hammer hits me in the head.

177
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:50,001
Even though I'm standing here and now,

178
00:13:50,001 --> 00:13:52,959
he calls out the name of some girl.

179
00:14:06,531 --> 00:14:08,868
I love you, Praew.

180
00:14:14,097 --> 00:14:17,627
I know I'm not worth that much to him,

181
00:14:17,627 --> 00:14:23,480
but I want to be nice to him no matter how badly he treats me.

182
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,365
But look at what someone stupid like me gets.

183
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:32,754
At least, when you kiss me, can you call me by my name?

184
00:14:45,547 --> 00:14:47,123
Finally, you're here.

185
00:14:47,123 --> 00:14:48,999
Sorry, I'm hungover.

186
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:51,651
How did I get home last night?

187
00:14:51,651 --> 00:14:55,133
The last thing I remember is when I gave birthday wishes to P'Shane.

188
00:14:55,133 --> 00:14:56,422
Wishes?

189
00:14:56,422 --> 00:14:59,006
He almost beat us up because you were being an ass.

190
00:14:59,006 --> 00:15:02,332
Third gave you a ride home.

191
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:05,455
Thank you, Third.

192
00:15:09,013 --> 00:15:10,911
Where is the professor, anyway?

193
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:12,706
I paid the tuition fee to learn.

194
00:15:12,706 --> 00:15:14,725
Look at the time. How can he be so late?

195
00:15:14,725 --> 00:15:18,128
Khai, you idiot. The class finished a while ago.

196
00:15:18,128 --> 00:15:19,879
Before you worry about your tuition fee,

197
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:23,997
worry about your mom and dad for having you as a son.

198
00:15:25,144 --> 00:15:28,374
- I think we should just go home. I'm so tired.
- That's right.

199
00:15:28,374 --> 00:15:31,803
Wait! Stop!

200
00:15:31,803 --> 00:15:33,274
I've made it all the way here.

201
00:15:33,274 --> 00:15:35,274
At least eat lunch with me.

202
00:15:35,274 --> 00:15:39,332
Please, Bone, Two, Third... my dear friends.

203
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,357
Third, what's wrong?

204
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,829
Nothing.

205
00:15:53,932 --> 00:15:55,351
Hey!

206
00:15:58,404 --> 00:16:01,820
Have a seat.

207
00:16:02,648 --> 00:16:04,413
Who's she?

208
00:16:04,413 --> 00:16:07,746
This is Praew, my girlfriend.

209
00:16:07,746 --> 00:16:09,347
Hello.

210
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:21,086
This is Praew. We've known each other since high school.

211
00:16:21,086 --> 00:16:23,970
But we weren't close then.

212
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:28,078
I just found out that she also goes to school here, and we started talking.

213
00:16:28,719 --> 00:16:30,958
And now we're dating.

214
00:16:31,784 --> 00:16:34,854
Can I get you anything to eat?

215
00:16:34,854 --> 00:16:36,863
I'm not that hungry. I'm good.

216
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:41,702
We should have some desserts this afternoon. Bingsu?
(Korean shaved ice dessert)

217
00:16:41,702 --> 00:16:43,314
Will it make me fat?

218
00:16:43,314 --> 00:16:46,465
How would that be possible? You're tiny.

219
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:47,905
I've put on weight, though.

220
00:16:47,905 --> 00:16:50,908
That's fine. You'd still be cute at 100 kg.

221
00:16:50,908 --> 00:16:52,058
- Is that a promise?
- Sure.

222
00:16:52,058 --> 00:16:53,447
Even though I get so big like an elephant?

223
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:54,680
That wouldn't be good, would it?

224
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:59,692
Guys, I forgot to return some books to the library. I have to go.

225
00:16:59,692 --> 00:17:02,017
- I can go with you.
- That's fine.

226
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:04,908
Eat your lunch.

227
00:17:28,228 --> 00:17:30,910
Third! Third!

228
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,620
I...

229
00:17:40,776 --> 00:17:42,548
I want to tell you something.

230
00:17:46,814 --> 00:17:51,187
Thank you for calling me on my inability to love anyone for real.

231
00:17:51,856 --> 00:17:54,905
It made me want to be in a serious relationship.

232
00:17:54,905 --> 00:17:57,289
And I found Praew.

233
00:17:57,289 --> 00:17:58,959
Thanks to you.

234
00:18:00,016 --> 00:18:03,249
I'm happy for you.

235
00:18:04,825 --> 00:18:09,129
This is the best words I can give him.

236
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:12,380
Thanks. I have to go.

237
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,055
See you.

238
00:18:16,747 --> 00:18:18,362
Khai.

239
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,389
What?

240
00:18:21,915 --> 00:18:23,950
I love you.

241
00:18:27,515 --> 00:18:31,351
Your girlfriend is beautiful.

242
00:18:33,284 --> 00:18:36,368
I love you. Do you hear me?

243
00:18:37,168 --> 00:18:40,918
I know. Thanks. See you.

244
00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:46,957
I love you,

245
00:18:46,957 --> 00:18:48,830
but I can't say it.

246

♫ But the more I do it, it's like you don't care ♫

247

[WH30 Store]

257
00:20:06,925 --> 00:20:08,400
Why do you close early today?

258
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,894
We normally close at this time.

259
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:12,877
Paan.

260
00:20:13,852 --> 00:20:16,054
Why do you look so shocked?

261
00:20:17,522 --> 00:20:21,959
I didn't think you'd come here anymore.

262
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:23,849
I need to.

263
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:27,598
I have something to discuss with you.

264
00:20:29,402 --> 00:20:31,503
It's about your absence from class.

265
00:20:31,503 --> 00:20:32,884
Well...

266
00:20:32,884 --> 00:20:37,254
Your friends told me you're very good at editing.

267
00:20:37,254 --> 00:20:39,275
But no matter how good you are,

268
00:20:39,275 --> 00:20:41,980
if you're irresponsible,

269
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,607
for me, it means you're not.

270
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:51,111
Submit all the past assignments to me in the next class.

271
00:20:51,111 --> 00:20:54,360
And don't skip class again. Got it?

272
00:20:55,831 --> 00:20:57,567
Yes, Professor.

273
00:21:18,245 --> 00:21:21,339
Why are you taking so long to set this up? Are you going to shoot tomorrow?

274
00:21:21,339 --> 00:21:24,171
I need a minute. This is a difficult frame.

275
00:21:27,576 --> 00:21:30,886
- Are you done?
- I got it. Take a look.

276
00:21:37,034 --> 00:21:41,288
I think the background and the prop have too similar colors.

277
00:21:41,288 --> 00:21:42,888
Fix it.

278
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,348
You can ask the staff to help you.

279
00:21:45,348 --> 00:21:48,615
You're a DP. You know the angle. Fix it.

280
00:21:48,615 --> 00:21:50,691
But it's not my job.

281
00:21:51,864 --> 00:21:54,691
Two, do you have a problem?

282
00:21:58,564 --> 00:22:00,888
You are an asshole.

283
00:22:04,433 --> 00:22:05,707
A bit to the left.

284
00:22:05,707 --> 00:22:06,990
I think this is good.

285
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:09,072
Come have a look at the monitor.

286
00:22:10,113 --> 00:22:11,613
The ladder.

287
00:22:13,814 --> 00:22:14,872
The color...

288
00:22:14,872 --> 00:22:16,831
The model's hair.

289
00:22:18,531 --> 00:22:19,437
That's enough.

290
00:22:19,437 --> 00:22:22,273
The lighting is not balanced. That one is brighter than this one.

291
00:22:22,273 --> 00:22:23,973
Fix it.

292
00:22:29,962 --> 00:22:31,784
Two.

293
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:33,330
What now?

294
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,857
Come here.

295
00:22:36,645 --> 00:22:38,252
I'm thirsty.

296
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,610
What the hell?

297
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,510
I don't want to get it myself.

298
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,247
This is too much.

299
00:22:44,247 --> 00:22:47,408
I'm the DP, not your slave.

300
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:50,454
If you are messing with me, I'm out of here.

301
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,410
Hello, Lynn.

302
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:02,382
Let's continue with the shoot.

303
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:04,130
That's not so hard. Right?

304
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,759
Hey, Two.

305
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,970
There you are.

306
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:24,430
I stopped by the studio where you and Un were working.

307
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,857
You're quite good. You can do everything.

308
00:23:26,857 --> 00:23:29,500
Shooting. Lighting.

309
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,981
Why don't you come and help me out?

310
00:23:30,981 --> 00:23:34,700
We are at a nearby studio. We still have many days of shooting.

311
00:23:35,383 --> 00:23:38,573
I barely survive as it is.

312
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:41,022
Hang in there.

313
00:23:41,022 --> 00:23:43,508
Un puts a lot of effort into this job.

314
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:49,517
P'Shane, are you close to P'Un?

315
00:23:49,517 --> 00:23:53,554
Of course, we are best friends.

316
00:23:53,554 --> 00:23:57,640
Do you know if he has any vulnerabilities?

317
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,656
Why do you ask?

318
00:23:59,656 --> 00:24:00,972
Will you use it to lord over him?

319
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:06,158
No. I just want to know. I want to be careful, trying not to make him mad.

320
00:24:07,185 --> 00:24:10,890
Make sure the lights stay on during the shoot.

321
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,701
Why?

322
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:17,920
One time, I was working with him in a studio.

323
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,449
The lights went out.

324
00:24:19,449 --> 00:24:24,419
When they're back on, I saw him sitting there trembling for hours.

325
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:28,155
I asked him what's wrong, but he wouldn't tell me.

326
00:24:28,155 --> 00:24:32,588
I suspect that he's scared of the dark.

327
00:24:34,662 --> 00:24:36,095
Okay.

328
00:24:36,832 --> 00:24:39,491
Don't let the lights go out.

329
00:24:39,491 --> 00:24:41,391
Of course not.

330
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,510
Shit! Why did the light go out?

331
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:06,370
Where's the flashlight? Help! Where's the flashlight?

332
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:08,508
I'm scared of the dark!

333
00:25:15,754 --> 00:25:17,136
How is it going?

334
00:25:17,136 --> 00:25:20,686
Hold on a minute. I'm downloading the file. Calm down.

335
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,274
I'm not here to rush you.

336
00:25:22,274 --> 00:25:25,954
I just want to ask if you're hungry.

337
00:25:34,987 --> 00:25:37,882
You've been working me hard all day,

338
00:25:37,882 --> 00:25:40,240
and now you're bringing me here to thank me?

339
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,469
As they say, the older the restaurant looks, the better the food is.

340
00:25:44,469 --> 00:25:45,869
You'll see.

341
00:25:46,568 --> 00:25:48,291
Here you go.

342
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:52,057
Doesn't it look yummy?

343
00:25:55,573 --> 00:25:57,188
Thank you.

344
00:25:58,421 --> 00:25:59,990
Thank you.

345
00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:07,746
Come on, let's eat.

346
00:26:07,746 --> 00:26:10,668
If it's not good, I'll let you kick me in the face.

347
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:12,669
Here.

348
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,310
For you.

349
00:26:23,719 --> 00:26:25,357
Go on.

350
00:26:26,664 --> 00:26:28,500
Wow, it is yummy.

351
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,811
See? I told you.

352
00:26:31,593 --> 00:26:33,256
But it's very spicy.

353
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,090
Where have I been?

354
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,996
Why didn't I know about this place?

355
00:26:50,996 --> 00:26:54,048
Do you and P'Shane come here a lot?

356
00:26:55,648 --> 00:26:57,548
No.

357
00:26:57,548 --> 00:27:00,370
You're the first person I've brought here.

358
00:27:03,596 --> 00:27:06,437
Go on. Eat it while it's hot.

359
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:29,206
The next film is quite legendary, a classic.

360
00:27:29,206 --> 00:27:35,800
At that time, it was the highest-grossing film, and continued to be...

361
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,206
Where is Third?

362
00:27:37,206 --> 00:27:40,252
I don't know, but he left with me this morning.

363
00:27:47,645 --> 00:27:52,480
It may be a little late, but from here on out

364
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,685
Third will be the head of the writing team.

365
00:27:58,396 --> 00:27:59,917
He's very good at it.

366
00:27:59,917 --> 00:28:02,613
You're too kind.

367
00:28:02,613 --> 00:28:04,342
Hello, guys.

368
00:28:04,342 --> 00:28:05,893
Hello.

369
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:07,449
Let's get started.

370
00:28:07,449 --> 00:28:12,596
I asked the team to come up with some general concepts.

371
00:28:12,596 --> 00:28:14,318
Take it away, Yee.

372
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:18,694
We discussed concepts that we haven't touched on yet.

373
00:28:18,694 --> 00:28:22,951
For example, Egypt... that's interesting.

374
00:28:23,881 --> 00:28:26,757
Umm... no.

375
00:28:26,757 --> 00:28:32,552
Or a Chinese action film. Action to the max.

376
00:28:36,088 --> 00:28:39,065
How about ancient Korea like Kingdom?

377
00:28:39,065 --> 00:28:41,092
No, I don't think these are good.

378
00:28:41,092 --> 00:28:44,664
Year after year, it's always the same.

379
00:28:44,664 --> 00:28:48,365
Extravagant production but not a lot of depth in the script.

380
00:28:48,365 --> 00:28:52,690
Let's do something simple, easily accessible.

381
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:56,795
Like love in this modern age.

382
00:28:56,795 --> 00:28:58,770
Are you sure it's a good idea?

383
00:28:58,770 --> 00:28:59,776
Of course.

384
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:05,017
We make this for the audience. If they're into it, then it's good.

385
00:29:05,017 --> 00:29:06,896
I'm afraid I won't be into it.

386
00:29:06,896 --> 00:29:09,114
I'm not into love lately.

387
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:12,283
That's your problem. Other people are into it.

388
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:13,551
This is your challenge.

389
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:16,759
Come up with a good idea about love.

390
00:29:17,651 --> 00:29:19,153
Okay?

391
00:29:20,753 --> 00:29:24,828
Third, are you going to do the play for real?

392
00:29:28,723 --> 00:29:31,064
I want to find something new to do.

393
00:29:31,064 --> 00:29:34,374
I think there's going to be a lot of work.

394
00:29:37,214 --> 00:29:40,425
Two, are you going to cough or talk to Third? Just pick one.

395
00:29:40,425 --> 00:29:42,656
Close your mouth. We don't want your germs.

396
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:45,508
Sorry, dude. I haven't been sleeping much lately.

397
00:29:45,508 --> 00:29:48,709
I have to retouch photos for my client until dawn.

398
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:52,766
You should go home and get some sleep.

399
00:29:52,766 --> 00:29:55,992
The books you found for me should be enough.

400
00:29:55,992 --> 00:29:59,211
That's fine. I can sleep right here.

401
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,800
That's right! That's it! That's it!

402
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:14,515
Actually, it may not be enough.

403
00:30:14,515 --> 00:30:16,379
I'll look for more books.

404
00:30:16,379 --> 00:30:18,805
You guys stay here.

405
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:42,214
Here you go.

406
00:30:42,214 --> 00:30:43,789
Thanks.

407
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,775
Are you okay?

408
00:30:47,775 --> 00:30:50,196
I'm fine. I got this from Two.

409
00:30:50,196 --> 00:30:52,596
He's way worse than me.

410
00:30:52,596 --> 00:30:54,756
Here's your change.

411
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,650
P'Un.

412
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,745
I heard you're sick.

413
00:31:23,745 --> 00:31:26,165
I got you porridge and some medicines.

414
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,498
Here.

415
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,790
Take it.

416
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:37,911
Are you capable of caring about other people?

417
00:31:37,911 --> 00:31:39,695
I don't care about you.

418
00:31:39,695 --> 00:31:42,006
I'm afraid you'll be dead.

419
00:31:42,006 --> 00:31:44,988
Wow, thanks so much.

420
00:31:45,746 --> 00:31:47,680
Do you want to come in?

421
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,840
That is, if you're not afraid to get the cold from me.

422
00:32:15,335 --> 00:32:17,143
Are these your boogers?

423
00:32:29,163 --> 00:32:33,010
You look like crap. Why don't you get some sleep?

424
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:36,754
I want to, but the deadline won't let me.

425
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:39,648
I have to submit this tomorrow morning.

426
00:32:58,422 --> 00:33:00,668
Shit! My work!

427
00:33:03,917 --> 00:33:07,789
I saw you asleep like the dead, so I did it for you.

428
00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:08,872
Just finished.

429
00:33:08,872 --> 00:33:10,340
Huh?

430
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,170
It is finished.

431
00:33:17,513 --> 00:33:19,419
How did you do it?

432
00:33:19,419 --> 00:33:21,130
It's not that hard.

433
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:24,559
I looked at the work you've done.

434
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,971
Think of this as my way to repay your help on my work.

435
00:33:28,971 --> 00:33:31,388
I thank you very much.

436
00:33:31,388 --> 00:33:34,657
Let me export the files.

437
00:33:34,657 --> 00:33:36,158
Go ahead.

438
00:33:59,147 --> 00:34:03,791
Shit, you've watched this?

439
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,759
I like it, too.

440
00:34:07,139 --> 00:34:08,893
"The Perks of Being a Wallflower"?

441
00:34:08,893 --> 00:34:11,052
Yes.

442
00:34:11,052 --> 00:34:12,774
Emma Watson was amazing in this film.

443
00:34:12,774 --> 00:34:14,914
Hold on, stop right there.

444
00:34:14,914 --> 00:34:18,251
Don't get any ideas about this one. She's mine.

445
00:34:18,251 --> 00:34:20,348
Sure, she's yours.

446
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,477
Anyway, I like this movie.

447
00:34:23,477 --> 00:34:29,337
I remember the line "We accept the love we think we deserve."

448
00:34:29,337 --> 00:34:31,950
You remember the line. How many times have you watched it?

449
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:36,207
Several times until my DVD was broken.

450
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:39,450
Do you want to borrow mine? Just take it.

451
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:41,711
- Really?
- Yeah.

452
00:34:42,867 --> 00:34:44,557
Thanks.

453
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,167
So, what do you have for me?

454
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,086
I...

455
00:35:00,543 --> 00:35:03,411
I want to pull out from the writing team.

456
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,746
Calm down. What's up?

457
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:11,215
I've tried everything.

458
00:35:11,215 --> 00:35:15,559
I've read the books, searched the web.

459
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:17,935
But I'm still not into it.

460
00:35:17,935 --> 00:35:20,959
I've kind of lost faith in love.

461
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,548
I don't think I'm cut out for this.

462
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,651
You can write about this.

463
00:35:31,651 --> 00:35:33,151
Huh?

464
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:38,305
A person who doesn't believe in love, but needs to write about love.

465
00:35:38,305 --> 00:35:40,907
A person who doesn't believe in love, but needs to write about love.

466
00:35:40,907 --> 00:35:44,632
Tell a story of someone who tries to understand love.

467
00:35:44,632 --> 00:35:48,771
He goes to the library to find books about love.

468
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:51,653
But he never really gets or believes in it.

469
00:35:51,653 --> 00:35:55,707
Tell this story to the audience.

470
00:35:56,890 --> 00:36:03,532
Who knows? After you write it, you may find the answer you've been looking for.

471
00:36:03,532 --> 00:36:08,852
I'm not sure if my heart can handle this.

472
00:36:08,852 --> 00:36:12,357
Love is not guided only by the heart.

473
00:36:12,357 --> 00:36:14,496
You use the brain, too.

474
00:36:14,496 --> 00:36:18,028
Come on! You can do it. I believe in you.

475
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,037
Let's do it.

476
00:36:23,037 --> 00:36:24,065
I agree.

477
00:36:24,065 --> 00:36:26,465
Yes.

478
00:36:26,465 --> 00:36:30,131
Third, are you not staying with Two any longer?

479
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:33,476
I'm lucky that my old apartment is still vacant.

480
00:36:33,476 --> 00:36:35,132
So, I'm going back there.

481
00:36:35,132 --> 00:36:37,986
Are you okay financially?

482
00:36:37,986 --> 00:36:41,570
My dad has sorted this out. Don't worry.

483
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:45,729
Thank you all for taking care of me these past few months.

484
00:36:45,729 --> 00:36:48,578
I need to go back to writing the script.

485
00:36:48,578 --> 00:36:50,354
See you later.

486
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:14,110
♫ I already know that our love is impossible ♫

487
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:19,010
♫ No matter how much effort I put into it ♫

488
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:25,610
♫ I probably won't be able to change your mind ♫

489
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:36,510
♫ Because I understand that your whole heart has him in it ♫

490
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:41,310

492

515
00:39:53,637 --> 00:39:56,034
Khai, are you dead?

516
00:39:56,034 --> 00:39:58,534
You've been gone for weeks.

517
00:39:59,102 --> 00:40:00,908
I'm at home. Don't worry.

518
00:40:00,908 --> 00:40:04,068
I'll return once I sort out my business here.

519
00:40:24,717 --> 00:40:28,188
Can you tell me now why you came all this way to see me?

520
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:33,290
Where do I begin?

521
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:41,827
I had a close friend named Third.

522
00:40:42,834 --> 00:40:46,853
One day, I had this suspicion that he had feelings for me.

523
00:40:46,853 --> 00:40:48,995
So, I tested him.

524
00:41:10,771 --> 00:41:14,146
But he didn't show any signs.

525
00:41:14,146 --> 00:41:16,668
Then, he got mad at me for no reason.

526
00:41:16,668 --> 00:41:19,368
I didn't know what to do.

527
00:41:20,912 --> 00:41:25,268
That day, I used his computer.

528
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:29,360
He's the man. Just let him do it. Let's go.

529
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:54,700
[Third Techapol: The movie, "Crazy, Stupid, Love."

530
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,540
[Only me]

531
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:09,962
This is probably the last clip of the Movie Seer page.

532
00:42:09,962 --> 00:42:13,008
Today, I'm going to review quite an oldie.

533
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:16,630
The film I'm reviewing today is

534
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:23,045
"Crazy, Stupid, Love."

535
00:42:24,783 --> 00:42:31,957
I selected this film because it speaks to what I'm feeling now.

536
00:42:31,957 --> 00:42:35,248
I feel crazy and stupid because of love.

537
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,647
I've secretly loved my best friend.

538
00:42:48,178 --> 00:42:50,752
We are in the same gang.

539
00:42:52,696 --> 00:42:58,108
But friendship stops us from going any further.

540
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:03,005
Khai...

541
00:43:10,328 --> 00:43:14,385
I'm sorry for loving you.

542
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:22,959
I'm sorry.

543
00:43:23,953 --> 00:43:26,957
I tried to keep this a secret.

544
00:43:28,264 --> 00:43:30,808
But it's my fault.

545
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:37,055
When I found out you tested me, I couldn't handle it.

546
00:43:38,016 --> 00:43:40,747
Because I'd already felt so good about it.

547
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:46,388
I'm afraid everything will crumble down.

548
00:43:49,883 --> 00:43:51,887
I'm sorry.

549
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:58,048
It's impossible for me to tell you...

550
00:44:00,249 --> 00:44:03,031
because I'd be left with nothing,

551
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:06,809
without you.

552
00:44:09,811 --> 00:44:13,129
It felt like I was slapped in the face.

553
00:44:15,766 --> 00:44:21,859
So, I thought I had to do something for him to make him feel better as much as possible.

554
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:25,711
Then, forget about me in the most hurtful way.

555
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,157
Hello, Praew.

556
00:44:29,157 --> 00:44:33,413
I have a favor to ask.

557
00:44:33,413 --> 00:44:36,113
Can you be my fake girlfriend?

558
00:44:36,113 --> 00:44:39,026
This is Praew, my girlfriend.

559
00:44:39,026 --> 00:44:41,934
Hello.

560
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:45,890
Praew,

561
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:49,670
I love you.

562
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:55,808
I was hurt, saying it.

563
00:44:56,379 --> 00:45:01,283
Third must have felt so bad that he could never love me again.

564
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:08,017
I thought we could go back to being friends.

565
00:45:08,017 --> 00:45:10,364
Have meals together like before.

566
00:45:11,197 --> 00:45:13,349
Watch a movie together like before.

567
00:45:14,105 --> 00:45:16,366
Hang out together like before.

568
00:45:17,674 --> 00:45:19,730
But I was wrong.

569
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,567
Third has disappeared from my life.

570
00:45:27,905 --> 00:45:30,925
This made me realize how important he is to me.

571
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:37,927
He has been with me in every moment of my life.

572
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:08,270
I want him to come back,

573
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,020
but I'm scared.

574
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:15,628
I'm scared that I'll hurt him again.

575
00:46:16,249 --> 00:46:22,029
The reason you came here is to get drunk and find out what you should do next, huh?

576
00:46:26,919 --> 00:46:29,429
I think I have feelings for him.

577
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:56,341
The opportunity that you've lost may never return.

578
00:46:56,341 --> 00:46:58,122
Where have you been?

579
00:46:58,122 --> 00:47:01,707
I've taken some time off to reflect on my life.

580
00:47:01,707 --> 00:47:04,911
Or do I really have feelings for Third?

581
00:47:04,911 --> 00:47:05,882
Huh?

582
00:47:05,882 --> 00:47:08,673
I had a good friend by my side, but I didn't see it.

583
00:47:08,673 --> 00:47:11,221
Thanks for joining the auction.

584
00:47:11,221 --> 00:47:12,863
The next film is "Flipped."

585
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:15,745
Don't you remember I got that for you as your birthday gift?

586
00:47:15,745 --> 00:47:17,290
You're not serious about it, are you?

587
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:18,629
Hello, P'Un.

588
00:47:18,629 --> 00:47:20,394
What are you going to do next?

589
00:47:20,394 --> 00:47:21,674
I'm going to chase after Third.
