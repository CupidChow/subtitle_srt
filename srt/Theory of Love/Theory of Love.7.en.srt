1
00:00:01,006 --> 00:00:02,403
Khai... you...

2
00:00:02,403 --> 00:00:03,142
Praew.

3
00:00:03,142 --> 00:00:05,649
- This is Praew, my girlfriend.
- Hello.

4
00:00:05,649 --> 00:00:06,835
- Khai.
- What?

5
00:00:06,835 --> 00:00:08,657
Your girlfriend is beautiful.

6
00:00:08,657 --> 00:00:10,917
Are you stunned by the professor's beauty?

7
00:00:10,917 --> 00:00:14,315
If you're irresponsible, for me, it means you're not any good.

8
00:00:14,315 --> 00:00:16,357
I had a close friend named Third.

9
00:00:16,357 --> 00:00:19,388
One day, I had this suspicion that he had feelings for me.

10
00:00:19,388 --> 00:00:21,687
I'm sorry for loving you.

11
00:00:21,687 --> 00:00:25,077
So, I thought I had to do something for him to feel good as much as possible.

12
00:00:25,077 --> 00:00:26,781
Then, forget about me in the most hurtful way.

13
00:00:26,781 --> 00:00:27,875
But I was wrong.

14
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:30,459
Third has disappeared from my life.

15
00:00:31,027 --> 00:00:35,590
When we select a film to watch, what criteria do we use?

16
00:00:36,068 --> 00:00:40,888
Content, director, how famous the actors are...

17
00:00:40,888 --> 00:00:45,394
But if you ask me, I choose it based on my preference.

18
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:52,221
A senior told me once that selecting a film is like choosing a partner.

19
00:00:52,221 --> 00:00:55,044
We hardly see a film in a genre we don't like.

20
00:00:55,044 --> 00:00:57,792
We make an assumption that it will not be good.

21
00:00:57,792 --> 00:01:03,725
We don't welcome it with open arms even though it might be good once we've watched it.

22
00:01:03,725 --> 00:01:05,822
I think I have feelings for him.

23
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,352
Whoa!

24
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,448
Are you sure?

25
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:17,050
A dude like you is into another dude? That's hard to believe.

26
00:01:20,822 --> 00:01:24,598
Maybe you're just feeling lonely now that Third is busy with the play.

27
00:01:24,598 --> 00:01:26,827
Think it over.

28
00:01:29,809 --> 00:01:32,058
I don't know.

29
00:01:33,502 --> 00:01:35,218
I can't help you with this.

30
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,642
We can talk later. Now, I need to get back to the bar to prepare for tonight.

31
00:01:39,642 --> 00:01:42,910
It's my bar's second anniversary.

32
00:01:43,758 --> 00:01:47,115
Join me tonight. The girls are hot.

33
00:01:48,455 --> 00:01:51,871
I mean, does that still work for you?

34
00:01:53,215 --> 00:01:54,969
Maybe not.

35
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:58,110
Come see me later. I'll be at the bar.

36
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,118
Everyone, can I please have your attention?

37
00:02:12,118 --> 00:02:16,203
This is my friend, Khai. Freshly heart-broken.

38
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:20,149
Anyone who wants to fix his heart, show your hands!

39
00:02:21,918 --> 00:02:25,083
You won't get out of here alive. Go!

40
00:02:27,921 --> 00:02:30,349
Can I take a picture with you?

41
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:49,589
What's wrong?

42
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,710
Nothing.

43
00:02:55,468 --> 00:02:57,069
Drink?

44
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,482
Maybe later.

45
00:03:44,775 --> 00:03:47,850
Hey, are you all right?

46
00:03:49,235 --> 00:03:51,212
A little headache.

47
00:03:51,212 --> 00:03:53,547
I may have had too much to drink.

48
00:03:56,453 --> 00:03:59,665
Hey, can I ask you something?

49
00:03:59,665 --> 00:04:01,821
Why did you decide to open a bar here so far away?

50
00:04:01,821 --> 00:04:05,269
Your family has a business waiting for you to run in Bangkok.

51
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:07,430
I like the sea.

52
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:14,270
But the main reason I came here is because I heard that Korean girls liked to come here.

53
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,696
Hot girls. You know my type.

54
00:04:16,696 --> 00:04:19,680
Fair skin, beautiful, cute, and Korean.

55
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,788
Correct. That's why I came.

56
00:04:21,788 --> 00:04:27,468
I like Korean girls, like Lisa from the band Blackpink.

57
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:28,878
Isn't she Thai?

58
00:04:28,878 --> 00:04:30,487
Don't interrupt me.

59
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:32,062
Back to my story.

60
00:04:32,062 --> 00:04:35,067
When I first came here, all I met was western girls.

61
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:37,541
Then, I suddenly had one more friend.

62
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:38,967
Bummed out, huh?

63
00:04:38,967 --> 00:04:41,253
Not really. Why would I be?

64
00:04:41,253 --> 00:04:44,649
She's nice, cute, and friendly.

65
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:48,429
I never made a move on her because she was not my type.

66
00:04:48,437 --> 00:04:53,227
Then, she went back to her country, and I found out that

67
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:57,110
I lost the one thing that meant the most to me.

68
00:04:57,984 --> 00:05:03,655
After I graduated, I came back here, hoping to meet her one more time.

69
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:07,749
So, did she ever come back?

70
00:05:18,967 --> 00:05:22,292
An opportunity once lost...

71
00:05:23,576 --> 00:05:26,165
may never return.

72
00:05:26,165 --> 00:05:32,636
You are lucky that you know your heart when it's not too late.

73
00:05:35,763 --> 00:05:39,487
So, do whatever you want now.

74
00:05:40,401 --> 00:05:42,556
Don't mess it up like I did.

75
00:05:49,787 --> 00:05:51,969
But I don't exactly know my heart.

76
00:05:51,969 --> 00:05:54,469
Third is my friend.

77
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:57,434
And he's a guy.

78
00:05:57,434 --> 00:05:58,948
So?

79
00:05:58,948 --> 00:06:01,258
A film may look like it's something you wouldn't like.

80
00:06:01,258 --> 00:06:04,089
But you end up liking it after you watch it.

81
00:06:07,298 --> 00:06:09,510
Let me tell you something.

82
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:14,459
No matter how long you sit here, you won't get an answer.

83
00:06:15,637 --> 00:06:18,290
The answer is with Third.

84
00:06:19,591 --> 00:06:24,912
Go back to him and face the question you have.

All right, now that everyone's here...

92
00:08:26,244 --> 00:08:29,770
Man, how long do we have to keep this up for Khai?

93
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,372
If the teacher catches us, we'll be in a lot of trouble.

94
00:08:32,372 --> 00:08:35,086
He's been gone for a long time. Did something happen to him?

95
00:08:35,086 --> 00:08:39,104
It's possible. He has the tendency to do bad shit.

96
00:08:39,104 --> 00:08:41,203
I don't think we have anything to worry about.

97
00:08:41,203 --> 00:08:44,230
He may be busy trying to get with some girl like he usually does.

98
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:07,127
Wait! Am I really into Third?

99
00:09:07,127 --> 00:09:09,395
I can't imagine what our date would be like.

100
00:09:09,395 --> 00:09:11,872
Usually when I'm on date with a girl, I...

101
00:09:11,872 --> 00:09:14,281
- Is it good?
- Yes.

102
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:15,935
Let me carry that for you.

103
00:09:15,935 --> 00:09:17,050
Thank you.

00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,028

- There.

- Where?
- There.

106
00:09:20,445 --> 00:09:22,258
Okay. Let's go.

107
00:09:25,421 --> 00:09:27,335
If I'm on a date with Third...

108
00:09:27,335 --> 00:09:30,757
Let me carry that for you.

109
00:09:31,956 --> 00:09:33,501
Do you want anything else?

Sure thing. It's over there. Right?

112
00:09:40,127 --> 00:09:42,461
And if we're holding hands...

113
00:09:59,287 --> 00:10:02,349
Or having cute moments like in a K-drama...

114
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:23,658
Shit! Just thinking about it makes my skin crawl.

115
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,627
But I do want to eat ice cream with Third.

116
00:10:29,231 --> 00:10:32,958
What's wrong with me?

117
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,830
Do I really have feelings for him?

Don't "what's up" me. You finally picked up.

121
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,287
We thought you'd be dead by now.

122
00:10:46,287 --> 00:10:48,446
Not dead yet. I'm back.

123
00:10:48,446 --> 00:10:51,530
Do not be mad at me.

124

I'm buying you drinks tonight.

125
00:10:53,947 --> 00:10:55,858
I was about to contact a temple to arrange for your funeral.

126

Why did you come back?

127
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,635
Jerk, I'm still alive. Stop wishing me death.

128
00:10:59,635 --> 00:11:03,228
So, are you going to tell us where you were?

129
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:08,123
It's a long story. I'll save it for later.

130
00:11:08,123 --> 00:11:10,388
Where is Third?

131
00:11:10,388 --> 00:11:12,132
He's working on the play.

132
00:11:12,132 --> 00:11:14,869
He hardly has any time to hang out with us.

133
00:11:16,206 --> 00:11:17,651
Yeah?

134
00:11:18,501 --> 00:11:21,664
I'm going to go pee for a second. Don't start your story yet.

135
00:11:21,664 --> 00:11:22,708
I'll go with you.

136
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:26,210

Khai.

138
00:11:41,687 --> 00:11:46,832
In this second, I am not entirely sure what's happening.

139
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:49,123
It may be because I haven't seen him in a while.

140
00:11:49,123 --> 00:11:52,554
Or my feelings for him have changed.

141
00:11:52,554 --> 00:11:55,353
My heart was racing so fast.

142

Do you know any dog named Khai?

00:12:11,265 --> 00:12:12,760
Right.

We finished early, so I'm here.

148
00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:21,549
What about you? Where have you been?

149
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:27,269
I've taken some time off to reflect on my life.

150
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,658
Reflect on your life?

151
00:12:30,455 --> 00:12:32,329
Did you have a fight with Praew?

152
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,259
Not really.

153
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,729
I broke up with her.

154
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,869
You said you'd take this relationship seriously.

155
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:49,709
I was a jerk. I was insatiable.

156
00:12:51,822 --> 00:12:55,849
Are you okay now? Is that why you've come back?

157
00:13:03,212 --> 00:13:06,259
Is this the script you've written?

158
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:09,308
Yeah, it still needs a few more drafts to improve.

159
00:13:09,308 --> 00:13:11,109
Can I have a read?

160
00:13:28,827 --> 00:13:30,730
Hey, I like this sentence.

161
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,538
Which one?

162
00:13:32,538 --> 00:13:35,813

00:13:39,969 --> 00:13:44,140
no matter how many people come into your life,

166
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,770
you will always see me watching from the same place?"

167
00:13:50,754 --> 00:13:52,985
"Will you believe me if I say

168
00:13:52,985 --> 00:13:56,871
no matter how many people come into my life,

169
00:13:57,591 --> 00:14:01,149
I will always see you watching from the same place?"

170
00:14:10,532 --> 00:14:13,391
Third, you've made it here!

171
00:14:13,391 --> 00:14:15,490
All of us gangstas are here.

172
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:19,220
Let me tell you! It's going to be a long night. We will not go home until we shut this place down.

173
00:14:20,532 --> 00:14:22,332
Drink!

174
00:14:22,332 --> 00:14:24,558
You drink it.

175
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:35,400
Are you asking me to supervise the editing of the Film Department's video presentation?

176
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,493
That's right.

177
00:14:36,493 --> 00:14:39,427
If we can have someone of your caliber to do this,

178
00:14:39,427 --> 00:14:42,151
I know that the clip will be widely shared.

179
00:14:42,151 --> 00:14:46,935
And next year we will get so many applications from prospective students.

180
00:14:46,935 --> 00:14:49,612
You are too kind.

181
00:14:49,612 --> 00:14:53,252
Have you assigned anyone to do the editing?

182
00:14:53,252 --> 00:14:56,723
I'm thinking we'll assign one of our students to take this on.

183
00:14:56,723 --> 00:14:59,890
As far as you can tell, do you have anyone in mind?

184
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:04,027
Excuse me, I'd like to submit the past assignments.

185
00:15:13,344 --> 00:15:15,760
Professor, why do I have to do this?

186
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,227
I'm attending class. I've submitted all the past assignments.

187
00:15:19,227 --> 00:15:21,155
You're looking at this all wrong.

188
00:15:21,155 --> 00:15:23,077
This is not a punishment.

189
00:15:23,077 --> 00:15:26,649
Anyone would be thrilled to have this job.

190
00:15:27,203 --> 00:15:30,549
Are you saying you've chosen me because of my skills?

191
00:15:31,712 --> 00:15:33,758
Of course.

192
00:15:34,324 --> 00:15:36,695
Stop here.

193
00:15:36,695 --> 00:15:39,378
Go back one step. Bring this one forward.

194
00:15:39,378 --> 00:15:41,436
- But...
- No, swap it now. Trust me.

195
00:15:41,436 --> 00:15:42,790
Swap it.

196
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,387
There you go.

197
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,255
That's right.

198
00:15:47,255 --> 00:15:49,258
Let's play it again.

199
00:15:50,606 --> 00:15:53,422
After that, she worked me into the ground.

200
00:15:53,422 --> 00:15:55,730
There's this one scene. She said it's too cliché.

201
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:58,067
What was I supposed to do? That's what we got, right?

202
00:15:58,067 --> 00:16:00,112
In the end, we had to redo everything.

203
00:16:00,112 --> 00:16:01,995
So, now I'm stuck with this.

204
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:04,139
Come on! You're doing this for the good of the faculty.

205
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:08,409
They will show this video during the film's auction event.

206
00:16:08,409 --> 00:16:10,089
What auction?

207
00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:12,404
Right... you haven't been to class.

208
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:16,281
This year, they asked us to auction off DVDs to raise funds for the department.

209
00:16:16,281 --> 00:16:20,337
Some proceeds will fund the play. Do you want to go?

210
00:16:21,295 --> 00:16:24,287
This doesn't sound like my thing.

211
00:16:24,287 --> 00:16:26,275
What about you, Third? Are you going?

212
00:16:26,275 --> 00:16:29,358
I am. I'm working on PR for the play as well.

213
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,058
Let me come with you then.

214
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:35,253
You just said you're not going to go.

215
00:16:35,253 --> 00:16:39,224
I...

216
00:16:39,224 --> 00:16:41,389
I've changed my mind.

217
00:16:42,003 --> 00:16:45,588
Come to think of it, I have a big collection of DVDs.

218
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:48,083
Bone borrowed a dozen.

219
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:51,772
Hey, Bone, you can auction off any films you borrowed.

220
00:16:51,772 --> 00:16:55,890
Remind me again later. I'm swamped with Prof Paan's work.

221
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,181
The fourth draft is finished.

222
00:17:21,181 --> 00:17:22,889
Let me see.

223
00:17:30,336 --> 00:17:33,160
I think this draft has really improved.

224
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,299
There are just a few minor points to be fixed.

225
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:37,792
Before we go into the climax,

226
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:41,102
we should tell the story from the point of view of students more.

227
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:43,347
But this is intended to be from the point of view of teachers.

228
00:17:43,347 --> 00:17:46,089
To fix it, we have to redo everything.

229
00:17:46,089 --> 00:17:50,499
I understand. But it will give depth to the characters.

230
00:17:50,499 --> 00:17:55,212
This is just a PR clip, not an Oscar movie. It doesn't need to be that deep.

231
00:17:55,212 --> 00:17:59,228
Any task that falls under your responsibility is important.

232
00:17:59,228 --> 00:18:03,149
If it's important, you wouldn't use it to torture me.

233
00:18:05,475 --> 00:18:06,884
What do you mean?

234
00:18:06,884 --> 00:18:09,865
It is obvious that you want to get back at me

235
00:18:09,865 --> 00:18:12,846
for skipping your class and the thing at the coffee shop.

236
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:18,018
If you're going to be serious about this, I'll drop your class tomorrow,

237
00:18:18,018 --> 00:18:20,020
so we won't have to see each other again.

238
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:33,997
Iced espresso for you.

239
00:18:33,997 --> 00:18:37,158
Thanks, hotshot.

240
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,767
What do you mean?

241
00:18:38,767 --> 00:18:42,123
For getting the editing job for the video presentation.

242
00:18:42,123 --> 00:18:44,280
The seniors were fighting to get this job,

243
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,658
but the professor chose you.

244
00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:50,566
I think she's just trying to torture me.

245
00:18:50,566 --> 00:18:53,831
What are you talking about? She's serious about it.

246
00:18:53,831 --> 00:18:56,874
I went to submit my work at the teacher's lounge.

247
00:18:56,874 --> 00:18:59,545
I saw her looking at your old works.

248
00:18:59,545 --> 00:19:03,949
These are the editing works of the third-year students.

249
00:19:07,517 --> 00:19:11,446
Who did this one?

250
00:19:12,053 --> 00:19:15,765
Boriphat's group. Why?

251
00:19:16,992 --> 00:19:22,418
I think his timing stands out from the other students.

252
00:19:22,418 --> 00:19:25,613
It may be even better than some professionals.

253
00:19:25,613 --> 00:19:28,266
I think this kid is talented.

254
00:19:30,012 --> 00:19:34,194
She chose you because of your talent.

255
00:19:34,194 --> 00:19:37,967
Who would use this serious job to torture you?

256
00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:41,530
Have you drunk that?

257
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,326
Can I have it?

258
00:19:43,326 --> 00:19:45,329
Bone! My coffee!

259
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:08,029
Here's a coffee for you.

260
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:15,959
Thank you.

261
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:28,850
Did you do this on your own?

262
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,517
The deadline is approaching.

263
00:20:32,517 --> 00:20:35,990
There's not enough time to bring in a new editor.

264
00:20:37,086 --> 00:20:39,353
I'm sorry.

265
00:20:43,398 --> 00:20:44,868
It's okay.

266
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:48,487
It's my fault, too, for taking it too seriously.

267
00:20:51,948 --> 00:20:56,670
Would you mind if I asked you if I could come back to this project?

268
00:20:59,105 --> 00:21:02,360
Of course not. That's wonderful.

269
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,089
I was looking at this scene.

270
00:21:04,089 --> 00:21:08,469
I wanted to make the cutting at the end sharper than this.

271
00:21:09,926 --> 00:21:13,760
I think we should move the flying birds scene to the end

272
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,189
to suggest freedom of living.

273
00:21:18,145 --> 00:21:21,127
Great! I'm sold.

274
00:21:21,127 --> 00:21:23,224
Let's try this now.

275
00:21:23,224 --> 00:21:25,289
Play it back to me.

276
00:21:37,979 --> 00:21:42,189
Going twice, and sold!

277
00:21:45,456 --> 00:21:51,989
Thank you for bidding in this auction event aimed to raise funds for the Film Department.

278
00:21:53,481 --> 00:21:56,107
Give her a round of applause.

279
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:05,228
Next item has been submitted by our handsome third-year film student,

280
00:22:05,228 --> 00:22:08,586
Khunphol also known as Khai.

281
00:22:13,102 --> 00:22:16,407
Bone, which film did you pick to auction off?

282
00:22:16,407 --> 00:22:19,856
Don't worry. I selected only the best.

283
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:25,130
This is a hot item indeed. 100% satisfaction guaranteed.

284
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:31,090
This is a series of 4 Japanese porno starring Yui-chan with a total length of 5 hours.

285
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:38,108
It features her since when she's a newcomer until she's old enough to be your mother.

286
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:41,221
Bone, why did you submit porn films in my name?

287
00:22:41,221 --> 00:22:43,880
You told me any film was fine.

288
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,677
I meant a regular film, not pornography, dude.

289
00:22:47,677 --> 00:22:50,748
Third, this is not mine.

290
00:22:50,748 --> 00:22:52,545
Two gave it to me.

291
00:22:52,545 --> 00:22:54,065
- Me?
- It's you.

292
00:22:54,065 --> 00:22:56,064
4,000.

293
00:22:56,064 --> 00:23:01,387
Going once, going twice, sold!

294
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:07,915
The highest bidding price we've had so far.

295
00:23:07,915 --> 00:23:11,098
At least it brings in quite a large sum of money to the department.

296
00:23:16,508 --> 00:23:22,750
The next item is from another third-year film major, Third.

297
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,930
It's "Flipped."

298
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:34,043
The starting price is 100 baht.

299
00:23:34,043 --> 00:23:36,527
Third?

300
00:23:36,527 --> 00:23:39,469
I've watched it so many times that I'm sick of it, so I auctioned it off.

301
00:23:40,363 --> 00:23:44,345
Don't you remember I got that for you as your birthday gift?

302
00:23:44,345 --> 00:23:46,130
You're not serious about it, are you?

303
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,773
Come on, it's for the faculty.

304
00:23:51,391 --> 00:23:55,629
200 baht bid, 300, now 400.

305
00:23:55,629 --> 00:23:57,504
Any higher bidder?

306
00:23:57,504 --> 00:23:59,527
- 1,000.
- Khai for 1,000.

307
00:23:59,527 --> 00:24:01,163
1,500.

308
00:24:01,963 --> 00:24:05,556
Un for 1,500.

309
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:09,079
- What are you doing?
- Anyone want to go higher?

310
00:24:10,527 --> 00:24:13,965
I've heard that Third likes this movie. I just want to watch it.

311
00:24:14,665 --> 00:24:16,670
2,000.

312
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:17,835
3,000.

313
00:24:17,835 --> 00:24:19,170
4,000.

314
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:21,154
7,000.

315
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,956
10,000.

316
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:32,003
10,000 baht bid? A big spender.

317
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:33,416
Un, do you want to go higher?

318
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:34,751
No.

319
00:24:34,751 --> 00:24:39,524
10,000 baht bid, going once, going twice, sold!

320
00:24:46,093 --> 00:24:49,997
Khunphol really loves the faculty.

321
00:24:49,997 --> 00:24:55,307
Besides auctioning off his collection of porn, he bid 10,000 baht for the faculty.

322
00:24:55,307 --> 00:24:56,846
Let's take a picture.

323
00:24:56,846 --> 00:24:58,955
What a loyal student!

You bid for it, you take it.

No, I bid for it to give it back to you.

329

Don't use me as an excuse. You just wanted to beat P'Un.

330

Don't tell me that you are mad at Third because he auctioned off the DVD you bought him.

Yes, wouldn't you?

359
00:27:21,175 --> 00:27:23,444
You buy something for someone, but they don't care about it.

Why would you be mad?

I've thrown away a lot of your stuff. I don't see you ever getting mad.

He's got a point.

363
00:27:29,834 --> 00:27:35,289
In this type of situation, you only get mad when a girl throws away your stuff.

You're right.

365
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:42,803
Or do I really have feelings for Third?

00:27:42,803 --> 00:27:44,390
Huh?

367
00:27:54,053 --> 00:27:57,107
P'Ton told me to come to Third to find the answer.

368
00:27:57,107 --> 00:28:00,520
But I've only liked girls all my life, you know.

369

And he's my best friend.

370
00:28:02,834 --> 00:28:06,221
This makes me so confused about the way I feel.

371
00:28:06,221 --> 00:28:09,052
Then, he threw away the stuff I gave to him.

372
00:28:09,643 --> 00:28:14,229
That made me realize that I have real feelings for him.

373
00:28:14,825 --> 00:28:16,949
So, what are you gonna do next?

374
00:28:18,984 --> 00:28:22,778
I'm going to chase after Third.

375

No, I won't allow it.

376
00:28:27,726 --> 00:28:29,988
But I'm serious this time around.

377
00:28:29,988 --> 00:28:33,057
Third has finally gotten over you.

378
00:28:33,057 --> 00:28:37,489
From what happened today, you can see that he's moved on.

379
00:28:37,489 --> 00:28:41,339
If you really love him, let him go.

380
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:43,647
He's cried enough tears for you.

381

Can't I have another chance?

382
00:28:50,831 --> 00:28:55,649
How can you guarantee that you won't hurt him again?

383
00:28:56,674 --> 00:28:58,823
I can't.

384

But I trust my feelings.

385
00:29:01,849 --> 00:29:06,870
Third is the first person who has made me want a good partner in life.

386
00:29:09,638 --> 00:29:13,369
In that case, let's start with step one.

387
00:29:13,369 --> 00:29:19,810
If you really love him, send all of your girl contacts over to me and Bone.

388
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:21,434
Great idea.

390
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:30,813
You need to delete all of your contacts who are women from your phone now.

391
00:29:30,813 --> 00:29:33,495
Shit, I don't think he'll do it.

392
00:29:33,495 --> 00:29:36,327
Each of the girls on his phone is super fine.

393
00:29:36,327 --> 00:29:41,558
If you can't do such a simple task, then don't say you're going to chase after Third.

394

00:37:42,521 --> 00:37:44,121
Wait, Third!

488
00:37:44,969 --> 00:37:47,305
Serves you right.

489
00:37:47,305 --> 00:37:49,773
I told you Third wouldn't get swept off his feet.

490
00:37:49,773 --> 00:37:52,284
He might as well hate you for it.

491
00:37:52,284 --> 00:37:55,523
How could he hate me? I'm his best friend.

492
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,548
What have you done for your best friend?

493
00:37:57,548 --> 00:37:59,666
Nothing good.

494
00:38:00,176 --> 00:38:03,003
That's right. He's been treated badly all this time.

495
00:38:03,003 --> 00:38:06,662
He just gave you a little taste of your own medicine.

496
00:38:06,662 --> 00:38:10,158
Therefore, cut it out.

497
00:38:10,158 --> 00:38:12,765
- Fine, I will cut.
- Cut out the chase?

498
00:38:12,765 --> 00:38:15,914
Cut out the caption, so he won't be mad.

499
00:38:15,914 --> 00:38:19,624
Me chasing after him... I won't give up on that.

500
00:38:19,624 --> 00:38:23,187
I have a secret weapon to make him fall in love with me.

501
00:38:23,187 --> 00:38:25,787
I respect your determination, Khunphol.

502
00:38:36,409 --> 00:38:38,059
Please, Third.

503
00:38:38,059 --> 00:38:40,410
I was just teasing you. I didn't mean to make you mad.

504
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:42,284
I know.

505
00:38:42,284 --> 00:38:44,983
Have you forgiven me?

506
00:38:44,983 --> 00:38:48,671
Not really? I'm just annoyed by you.

507
00:38:48,671 --> 00:38:52,907
This is where I leave you. I have a meeting about the play.

508
00:38:52,907 --> 00:38:55,492
Wait! Let me come with you.

509
00:38:55,492 --> 00:38:57,170
Why would you want to come?

510
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:59,447
Go chase after some girl. Don't follow me.

511
00:38:59,447 --> 00:39:00,973
I'm not following you.

512
00:39:00,973 --> 00:39:03,473
I just want to sign up for a job in the sound division.

513
00:39:30,536 --> 00:39:34,554
Give me your evil look.

514
00:39:34,554 --> 00:39:36,547
Imagine a bad guy.

515
00:39:38,665 --> 00:39:40,950
Is this your evil look?

516
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,890
Try again. You haven't got it yet.

517
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:47,710
Give me evil, as evil as you can.

518
00:39:49,461 --> 00:39:52,107
Come on. More. More.

519
00:39:52,107 --> 00:39:54,549
Give me mean eyes.

520
00:39:54,549 --> 00:39:58,250
You're angry, so angry you want to kill someone.

521
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:01,520
Let's do a player look instead.

522
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,727
You see a woman walking by. You look at her.

523
00:40:04,727 --> 00:40:06,656
You want to hit on her.

524
00:40:10,434 --> 00:40:12,659
Is this you being a player?

525
00:40:17,087 --> 00:40:18,651
I think we're done.

526
00:40:18,651 --> 00:40:20,558
Thanks. You can go home.

527
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,000
What's the problem?

528
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,021
As you just saw, people who've come to audition are so nice.

529
00:40:34,021 --> 00:40:40,187
I want someone who is rich, good-looking,

530
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:43,366
a big-time womanizer

531
00:40:43,366 --> 00:40:49,749
who does shitty things to hurt people without feeling any remorse.

532
00:40:51,972 --> 00:40:53,756
That sounds very difficult.

533
00:40:55,092 --> 00:40:57,872
But don't worry, Third. I'll help you find this guy.

534
00:40:58,443 --> 00:41:00,952
But does that kind of person even exist?

535
00:41:00,952 --> 00:41:02,464
A major asshole by nature.

536
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:05,797
Comes from a rich family, good-looking, big-time womanizer.

537
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:10,044
Does shitty things to hurt people without feeling any remorse.

538
00:41:10,044 --> 00:41:11,907
Who could it be?

539
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,086
Why are you guys looking at me for?

540
00:41:21,086 --> 00:41:23,309
What grade did you get for acting?

541
00:41:25,246 --> 00:41:31,275
Since you're auditioning, let's do a major scene when the male lead

542
00:41:31,275 --> 00:41:33,540
- hits on the female lead at the library.
- Yes.

543
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:38,489
The girl is annoyed and she walks away.

544
00:41:39,089 --> 00:41:42,429
- Let's read that one.
- Okay.

545
00:41:47,293 --> 00:41:50,803
Trust me, Khai can't do it.

546
00:41:50,803 --> 00:41:55,000
Let's give him a shot. We don't have a better choice.

547
00:41:56,778 --> 00:42:01,309
You read lines with him as the female lead.

548
00:42:01,794 --> 00:42:04,315
Why me? Anyone can do it.

549
00:42:04,315 --> 00:42:06,090
You wrote it.

550
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:08,881
You understand the characters the best.

551
00:42:08,881 --> 00:42:12,954
You are also his close friend. This should help him relax.

552
00:42:15,314 --> 00:42:16,760
- Khai.
- Yes.

553
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:21,150
If you're ready, let's get started.

554
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:23,606
Third will read lines with you.

555
00:42:23,606 --> 00:42:25,050
Okay.

556
00:42:39,084 --> 00:42:40,634
Action.

557
00:42:40,634 --> 00:42:42,857
Third, no, you.

558
00:42:43,496 --> 00:42:45,367
Are you still single?

559
00:42:46,984 --> 00:42:48,709
What's your problem?

560
00:42:50,004 --> 00:42:52,752
I see you read books about love.

561
00:42:53,376 --> 00:42:59,509
If you want to understand it, why don't you experience love yourself?

562
00:43:01,948 --> 00:43:06,754
I can study love through what I read.

563
00:43:07,527 --> 00:43:10,307
It's better than falling in love with a player.

564
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:14,329
Not all guys are players.

565
00:43:14,329 --> 00:43:16,889
He may just be easy going.

566
00:43:17,652 --> 00:43:22,458
90% of guys who say this are players.

567
00:43:23,991 --> 00:43:27,724
P'Shane, according to the script, the guy lets the girl go.

568
00:43:27,724 --> 00:43:29,424
Just let it play out.

569
00:43:33,032 --> 00:43:36,150
If you say 90% of guys are players,

570
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,929
I might just be the other 10%.

571
00:43:46,397 --> 00:43:51,086
Someone told me, "Don't judge a book by its cover."

572
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:53,586
Before you judge me,

573
00:43:54,307 --> 00:43:56,555
why don't you try reading it first?

574
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:01,379
P'Shane, Khai went off script.

575
00:44:01,379 --> 00:44:03,422
He did.

576
00:44:03,422 --> 00:44:05,481
He took it beyond the script.

577
00:44:05,481 --> 00:44:08,865
He took the script and made it his own.

578
00:44:08,865 --> 00:44:11,909
This is exactly the bad-guy male lead that I want.

579
00:44:13,569 --> 00:44:16,366
What are we waiting for? Give him a big hand.

580
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:22,759
Pleasure to work with you, Mr. Playwright.

581
00:44:44,102 --> 00:44:46,702
Is Paan here?

582
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:49,435
Everyone knows that you're into Lynn.

583
00:44:49,435 --> 00:44:51,869
I just broke up with P'Phon.

584
00:44:52,515 --> 00:44:53,992
You asshole!

585
00:44:53,992 --> 00:44:55,412
Stop it!

586
00:44:55,412 --> 00:44:58,320
Are you and P'Un hanging out together all the time?

587
00:44:59,013 --> 00:45:01,040
- Why are you here?
- To pick up Third.

588
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,150
Why are you there?

589
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:04,074
- To pick up...
- A girl?

590
00:45:04,074 --> 00:45:08,333
I'm asking you... Give Un a chance to win Third over.
