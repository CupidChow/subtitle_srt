1
00:00:00,162 --> 00:00:01,193
Trust me.

2
00:00:01,193 --> 00:00:04,471
I will create opportunities for you to confess your love to him.

3
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:06,959
Did you just come up with a way for me to make up with Nong Milk?

4
00:00:06,959 --> 00:00:09,093
Sorry, I'm not looking for a relationship right now.

5
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:11,570
You've run out of money to pay rent?

6
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,852
Hey, you can come to my place. Bone's room is too small.

7
00:00:13,852 --> 00:00:16,699
Dude, if you're going to use all of my stuff, give me your body in exchange.

8
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:18,930
Just the body? Don't you want my heart, too?

9
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,230
Is it closed?

10
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,106
I just want a cup of coffee.

11
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:24,310
- Can I have your nickname, please?
- Paan.

12
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:25,859
Nice to meet you.

13
00:00:26,522 --> 00:00:29,627
Hey, dude! Won't you just stop smiling?

14
00:00:29,627 --> 00:00:32,270
That girl rented a movie from you last night.

15
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:33,808
Stop daydreaming!

16
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:35,605
Now, I want to meet her in person.

17
00:00:35,605 --> 00:00:39,482
Who is the girl who makes our friend fall head over heels?

18
00:00:39,482 --> 00:00:41,514
But you know what I'm feeling right now?

19
00:00:41,514 --> 00:00:42,505
What?

20
00:00:42,505 --> 00:00:43,893
I'm hungry!

21
00:00:43,893 --> 00:00:46,082
Third! When will we get to eat?

22
00:00:46,082 --> 00:00:49,745
It's done, but I can't find the plates.

23
00:00:49,745 --> 00:00:51,653
Are these the only two plates you have?

24
00:00:51,653 --> 00:00:54,436
Yes, I lived alone. Why would I need more?

25
00:00:54,436 --> 00:00:57,369
Khai, I've been trying to tell you.

26
00:00:57,369 --> 00:01:00,252
Buy more household goods.

27
00:01:00,252 --> 00:01:03,073
You never think twice when you buy silly shit.

28
00:01:03,073 --> 00:01:05,028
But you never buy things that are useful.

29
00:01:05,028 --> 00:01:07,970
Look at this. What the hell?

30
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:11,017
You cut the bottle to use as a glass.

31
00:01:11,017 --> 00:01:15,436
The sharp edge cuts my lip, dude.

32
00:01:15,436 --> 00:01:17,316
Towels, too.

33
00:01:17,316 --> 00:01:18,836
Buy proper ones.

34
00:01:18,836 --> 00:01:22,527
You can't use a cleaning towel as a mat, too. Gross!

35
00:01:22,527 --> 00:01:25,366
And the dishes! Are you mad?

36
00:01:25,366 --> 00:01:27,612
You make me eat from a plastic bag every time I come here.

37
00:01:27,612 --> 00:01:28,762
Every time!

38
00:01:28,762 --> 00:01:30,265
And he reuses that bag.

39
00:01:30,265 --> 00:01:33,705
- Disgusting!
- Hey, hey, hey! Stop!

40
00:01:33,705 --> 00:01:35,505
I'll buy them.

41
00:01:35,505 --> 00:01:37,713
- You'll stop if I buy them. Right?
- Yes.

42
00:01:37,713 --> 00:01:40,196
Fine, I'll buy the stuff.

43
00:01:40,196 --> 00:01:42,390
Stop complaining already.

44
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:48,041
What did I say? You, idiot!

45
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,306
Serves you right.

46
00:01:49,306 --> 00:01:51,590
How's that? Did it cut your lip? Are you bleeding?

47
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,926
- There's the blood.
- Same thing that happened to me.

48
00:01:54,888 --> 00:01:58,476
I get why you need to buy all this stuff because of Two and Bone.

49
00:01:58,476 --> 00:02:00,014
But why do I need to come?

50
00:02:00,014 --> 00:02:05,555
Don't whine. You're living with me now. You need to help me choose.

51
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,550
I want this spoon.

52
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,389
It's too big. How can you use it?

53
00:02:18,332 --> 00:02:21,874
- Welcome to our happy home.
- Want to watch TV?

54
00:02:21,874 --> 00:02:25,420
Hey, the TV must be broken. The screen is black.

55
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,852
- Why don't you switch a channel?
- It must be broken for real.

56
00:02:29,796 --> 00:02:34,012
How many times have I told you to remove the tag after purchase?

57
00:02:34,012 --> 00:02:36,653
Stop playing. I'm hungry!

58
00:02:36,653 --> 00:02:39,368
Fix me something to eat. Come on!

59
00:02:45,556 --> 00:02:48,473
I'm starving. What are you going to cook for me?

60
00:02:48,473 --> 00:02:51,576
Here it is! Roasted chicken.

61
00:02:51,576 --> 00:02:53,377
Wow!

62
00:02:53,377 --> 00:02:55,117
Aren't your hands burning?

63
00:02:56,137 --> 00:02:58,148
It's freaking hot!

64
00:02:58,883 --> 00:03:02,153
How long has been it roasted? It feels hard.

65
00:03:02,153 --> 00:03:03,854
Have a bite. It's yummy.

66
00:03:03,854 --> 00:03:05,200
No!

67
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,930
I'm going to get some sleep. I'm tired.

68
00:03:09,126 --> 00:03:10,473
Wait for me!

69
00:03:10,473 --> 00:03:12,040
Come on!

70
00:03:24,063 --> 00:03:26,611
- Lie down.
- I can't.

71
00:03:26,611 --> 00:03:28,308
Why?

72
00:03:29,153 --> 00:03:32,054
Some strangers are staring at us.

73
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:45,729
So soft. This must be what it feels like to lie down on a good bed.

74
00:03:47,017 --> 00:03:48,829
I like this.

75
00:03:50,172 --> 00:03:52,028
Like what?

76
00:03:53,162 --> 00:03:55,328
What we did earlier.

77
00:03:55,328 --> 00:03:58,154
It's like a scene in "500 Days of Summer."

78
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:02,028
When the two main characters go shopping together.

79
00:04:02,028 --> 00:04:04,228
It's so romantic.

80
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,959
Let's move on.

81
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:18,316
I think we've got everything. Let's pay.

82
00:04:18,316 --> 00:04:20,016
Hold on.

83
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:24,116
You don't have mugs at your place. Let me have a look.

84
00:04:26,334 --> 00:04:28,808
Let's get this print.

85
00:04:31,636 --> 00:04:34,588
Good! It comes in two pieces.

86
00:04:35,164 --> 00:04:37,393
Why do I need to use the other one in the pair?

87
00:04:37,393 --> 00:04:41,450
Because I want this one, and it comes in two.

88
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,770
I don't care. I'm taking them.

89
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,892
Heading to the cashier.

90
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:25,470
[Theory of Love]

91
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,680
[Ep.03: Friends with Benefits]

92
00:06:28,963 --> 00:06:32,187
Shit! Matching mugs.

93
00:06:32,187 --> 00:06:37,754
You two are becoming like a married couple.

94
00:06:37,754 --> 00:06:40,626
What are you talking about? We're just regular roommates.

95
00:06:40,626 --> 00:06:42,147
Really?

96
00:06:42,989 --> 00:06:46,648
Hey, Two. Pass me the sauce on the table.

97
00:06:53,182 --> 00:06:54,755
This is what I'm talking about.

98
00:06:54,755 --> 00:06:57,837
You're cooking for him when he gets home.

99
00:06:59,537 --> 00:07:01,830
You're even wearing an apron.

100
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:05,362
You're either a husband or a wife for sure.

101
00:07:07,497 --> 00:07:09,070
I think I should go.

102
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,456
People in love stink.

103
00:07:13,511 --> 00:07:15,357
Hey, Third.

104
00:07:19,801 --> 00:07:21,700
I hope you get some!

105
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,996
Get what?

106
00:07:22,996 --> 00:07:25,489
Get the hell out of here, Two!

107
00:07:35,348 --> 00:07:37,668
Did you forget something, Two?

108
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:40,756
Two?

109
00:07:41,703 --> 00:07:45,054
You're back. Food will be ready in a few minutes.

110
00:07:47,274 --> 00:07:49,631
I forgot to tell you.

111
00:07:50,347 --> 00:07:53,529
I invited Fahsai to join us for dinner.

112
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:59,045
Fahsai, please sit here. Let me get the chair.

113
00:08:02,694 --> 00:08:04,700
Are you hungry?

114
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,340
- What do you want to eat?
- Whatever is fine.

115
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,912
Really? You got it.

116
00:08:11,612 --> 00:08:16,229
I don't know how moving in with Khai will end.

117
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:23,509
What I do know is that my life is at a big turning point.

118
00:08:44,601 --> 00:08:48,219
You said you're done with being in a relationship.

119
00:08:48,219 --> 00:08:50,574
I'm done with the high-maintenance type.

120
00:08:50,574 --> 00:08:54,309
I followed what Two suggested; finding a good one close to me.

121
00:08:54,309 --> 00:08:57,455
Nong Fahsai is on the honor roll.

122
00:08:57,455 --> 00:09:00,694
Her condo is also close to mine.

123
00:09:00,694 --> 00:09:04,734
A good one close to me; she fits the description.

124
00:09:04,734 --> 00:09:10,145
A good one close to you that Two mentioned is me! You, idiot!

125
00:09:10,145 --> 00:09:15,848
I've seen this many times; Khai bringing a girl home.

126
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:22,909
But I don't know why, when I'm his roommate, this gets to me more than ever.

127
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:25,369
Too bad we don't have dessert.

128
00:09:25,369 --> 00:09:28,809
Third, please buy some ice-cream next time.

129
00:09:29,348 --> 00:09:32,509
I'll buy some after I do the dishes.

130
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,268
Let me help you with this.

131
00:09:35,268 --> 00:09:37,002
- That's okay. I'll do it.
- Let me help.

132
00:09:37,002 --> 00:09:38,994
That's fine...

133
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:46,758
Fahsai, are you all right? Did you get hurt by any of the shards?

134
00:09:46,758 --> 00:09:50,900
Before you're worried about her, think about my mug.

135
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,540
I'm fine.

136
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:57,648
Please move to the sofa. Let Third handle this.

137
00:09:58,261 --> 00:10:00,208
I'm sorry.

138
00:10:11,002 --> 00:10:13,709
Third, I'm sorry.

139
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:17,081
That's fine. It's my fault, too.

140
00:10:17,081 --> 00:10:19,248
I didn't mean the mug.

141
00:10:19,248 --> 00:10:21,350
Umm...

142
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,970
Can you please go somewhere else?

143
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:26,636
Why?

144
00:10:26,636 --> 00:10:28,678
Fahsai is a good girl.

145
00:10:28,678 --> 00:10:31,665
She'll be tense if you're around and won't talk to me.

146
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:33,565
You get me, right?

147
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:40,472
I do. I get that talking won't be the only thing you'll do.

148
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,260
Good that you get it.

149
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,245
Use this money to hang out somewhere.

150
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,445
I'll text you when I'm done.

151
00:10:49,611 --> 00:10:51,905
But it might be a while.

152
00:10:51,905 --> 00:10:55,727
You know I'm Mr. Khai who can go all night long.

153
00:11:00,488 --> 00:11:04,942
Yes, you can hurt me deeply all night long.

154
00:11:04,942 --> 00:11:09,469
Shit, a conflict has occurred in my heart.

155
00:11:10,097 --> 00:11:14,455
I think I've made the wrong decision moving in with him.

156
00:11:22,696 --> 00:11:24,450
Third!

157
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,902
Come here!

158
00:11:25,902 --> 00:11:27,801
I've booked a big table for us.

159
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:30,965
I was so lonely.

160
00:11:30,965 --> 00:11:32,922
You've come all this way to see me. What's up?

161
00:11:32,922 --> 00:11:35,566
Khai is busy tonight. I want to know if I can...

162
00:11:35,566 --> 00:11:38,027
P'Two! Hi.

163
00:11:38,027 --> 00:11:39,266
Hi!

164
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:41,623
Do you remember me? I modeled for you once.

165
00:11:41,623 --> 00:11:45,748
Of course, I do. How can I forget such a pretty face?

166
00:11:46,429 --> 00:11:48,505
- You're...
- Donut.

167
00:11:48,505 --> 00:11:50,910
That's right. Donut.

168
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,490
I forgot your name, but now it's coming back to me.

169
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,868
I miss you.

170
00:12:04,509 --> 00:12:06,170
Hello.

171
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:09,384
What's up?

172
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:16,955
Nothing. Talk to you later.

173
00:12:20,123 --> 00:12:21,449
Do you have a camera with you?

174
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,682
I want to be photographed.

175
00:12:23,682 --> 00:12:25,611
Oh, yeah?

176
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:27,786
I don't have a camera with me.

177
00:12:27,786 --> 00:12:30,282
If you want to be photographed, you need to come to my place.

178
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:33,319
Well... let's go.

179
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:38,590
Oh, Third. So, what do you want?

180
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:42,278
Nothing. I'm going to go.

181
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:45,830
Okay, see you later. Bye.

182
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,753
Good night.

183
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,090
When I spend time with this friend of mine,

184
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:53,240
I feel that she's so lively...

185
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,300
and very cute.

186
00:13:03,979 --> 00:13:05,595
I...

187
00:13:08,373 --> 00:13:10,111
like...

188
00:13:14,665 --> 00:13:16,476
you.

189
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:23,080
Joe, don't do this.

190
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,348
I don't think it'll work.

191
00:13:28,868 --> 00:13:32,050
Hey, can you switch to an action movie?

192
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:34,569
I want to see "Transformers".

193
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,707
One Hainanese chicken rice, please.

194
00:13:45,707 --> 00:13:48,349
We're out of rice. Only chicken left.

195
00:13:50,281 --> 00:13:52,392
Just the chicken is fine.

196
00:14:05,556 --> 00:14:08,536
Shit, it's 3:00 a.m., and you're still declining my call.

197
00:14:08,536 --> 00:14:10,300
How many rounds can you go?

198
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,529
Are you repressed much?

199
00:14:14,343 --> 00:14:17,211
Safe trip home. Sorry, I'm not able to give you a lift.

200
00:14:17,211 --> 00:14:20,347
- That's fine. Bye.
- Bye.

201
00:14:20,347 --> 00:14:22,032
Text me when you get home.

202
00:14:22,032 --> 00:14:23,231
Okay.

203
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,795
Bye.

204
00:14:32,548 --> 00:14:34,275
Hey, Third.

205
00:14:34,275 --> 00:14:37,988
Here you are. I was going to text you.

206
00:14:39,381 --> 00:14:42,101
What are you doing standing there? Come on.

207
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:53,029
Sorry, she wouldn't leave. What could I do?

208
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:56,821
- What do we have for breakfast?
- Feet.

209
00:14:56,821 --> 00:14:59,238
- Chicken feet?
- Mine.

210
00:14:59,238 --> 00:15:02,459
I'm going to get dressed. I have a morning class.

211
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:05,308
He's cranky.

212
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:08,362
A photographer once said,

213
00:15:08,362 --> 00:15:10,611
one of the most important things about photography is that

214
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:13,943
we don't need to describe what we see with words.

215
00:15:13,943 --> 00:15:16,984
This is our lesson for today.

216
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:19,878
Expressing feelings through photos.

217
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:24,126
I will bring today's challenge to you.

218
00:15:26,518 --> 00:15:30,524
Last time, he was so indy he gave us a water bottle to photograph.

219
00:15:30,524 --> 00:15:32,910
Will it be an appendix this time?

220
00:15:33,537 --> 00:15:35,552
That's funny.

221
00:15:35,552 --> 00:15:38,348
This is exciting.

222
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,550
This is a challenge for today.

223
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:04,542
Photographing a model using your feelings and make the photos look as good as possible.

224
00:16:04,542 --> 00:16:08,009
Our model is called Lynn. She's a Comm Arts student like you.

225
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:10,509
But she's a broadcasting major.

226
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,255
Hello.

227
00:16:21,002 --> 00:16:24,060
Whoa! Is she the Broadcasting's Princess?

228
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,929
This makes me want to switch my major.

229
00:16:25,929 --> 00:16:30,289
Hold on, you said you wouldn't date someone from your faculty.

230
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:33,448
Look, she just smiled at me.

231
00:16:33,448 --> 00:16:35,390
How's that?

232
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,355
She smiled at Two.

233
00:16:41,532 --> 00:16:44,780
Two, how do you know her?

234
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:47,870
Don't tell me she's "modeled" for you before.

235
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,381
Don't even go there.

236
00:16:49,381 --> 00:16:51,420
Lynn is my friend from high school.

237
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:56,549
How come you never told us that you were friends with someone this hot?

238
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,949
She's lovely.

239
00:17:13,716 --> 00:17:19,670
As mentioned, photography is about recording your emotions into pictures.

240
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:26,121
Both the model's and the photographer's feelings are stored in pictures in an honest way.

241
00:17:26,121 --> 00:17:29,154
It does not lie to the audience.

242
00:17:32,069 --> 00:17:35,051
The more you feel about the subject of your shot,

243
00:17:35,051 --> 00:17:38,636
the more the photo will express those feelings.

244
00:17:38,636 --> 00:17:42,138
Remember to bring your feelings into the shots.

245
00:17:42,138 --> 00:17:45,060
That's how good photos come about.

246
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:48,871
Okay, this is the end of the class.

247
00:17:48,871 --> 00:17:53,989
Gather all the files of your shots today and bring them to my office.

248
00:17:54,577 --> 00:17:56,535
Goodbye.

249
00:17:57,426 --> 00:17:59,570
Let's get lunch. If we're late, we'll have to wait in a queue.

250
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:02,513
You guys go ahead. I need to gather the files.

251
00:18:02,513 --> 00:18:04,048
I need 20 minutes.

252
00:18:04,048 --> 00:18:05,796
Okay, we're heading to lunch first.

253
00:18:05,796 --> 00:18:07,568
Follow us there after you're done.

254
00:18:07,568 --> 00:18:10,240
I'm a punctual person. I need my food at 12:00 on the dot.

255
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,688
We're going. See you later soon.

256
00:18:25,573 --> 00:18:27,290
Two.

257
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:30,370
What are you doing?

258
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,732
Lynn, you're still here.

259
00:18:32,732 --> 00:18:34,367
I just finished changing my clothes.

260
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,725
What are you still doing here?

261
00:18:35,725 --> 00:18:39,396
I need to gather all the photo files for the professor.

262
00:18:39,396 --> 00:18:42,819
How are they? I want to see. Are they good?

263
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,154
You guys are good.

264
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,868
Wait.

265
00:18:55,896 --> 00:18:58,960
- What is it?
- You took this shot. Right?

266
00:19:01,022 --> 00:19:02,190
Yes.

267
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,348
I knew it!

268
00:19:05,532 --> 00:19:07,452
How do you know that?

269
00:19:08,349 --> 00:19:11,075
I don't know. I can feel it.

270
00:19:11,075 --> 00:19:15,489
It may be because I've liked your photography since back then.

271
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,091
There, you took this one, too.

272
00:19:20,085 --> 00:19:22,374
I can tell.

273
00:19:22,374 --> 00:19:24,388
This one is yours, too.

274
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,488
This one isn't yours. Right?

275
00:19:39,817 --> 00:19:41,171
P'Third.

276
00:19:41,171 --> 00:19:42,643
Fahsai, what's up?

277
00:19:42,643 --> 00:19:44,613
Where is P'Khai?

278
00:19:44,613 --> 00:19:46,578
I don't know. Have you called him?

279
00:19:46,578 --> 00:19:48,930
I've called. I've texted. He won't respond.

280
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,274
I'm asking you. Where is P'Khai?

281
00:19:53,676 --> 00:19:56,523
I don't have a clue. He didn't tell me where he was going.

282
00:19:56,523 --> 00:19:59,182
I don't believe you. How can you not know? You're his best friend.

283
00:19:59,182 --> 00:20:01,455
You sleep at his condo.

284
00:20:01,455 --> 00:20:03,808
Are you hiding something?

285
00:20:03,808 --> 00:20:05,273
No, of course not.

286
00:20:05,273 --> 00:20:07,082
Let me see your phone.

287
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:08,494
I want to know what you've talked about.

288
00:20:08,494 --> 00:20:10,393
Nothing of your concern. He didn't tell me anything.

289
00:20:10,393 --> 00:20:12,840
- If there's nothing, give it to me.
- I'm telling you, there's nothing. Let it go.

290
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,438
- What are you hiding?
- This is mine.

291
00:20:14,438 --> 00:20:16,370
- Who do you think you are?
- I am P'Khai's girlfriend.

292
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:17,543
- Give it back to me.
- What, I must see it.

293
00:20:17,543 --> 00:20:19,215
Give it back. I told you, give it back.

294
00:20:19,215 --> 00:20:20,431
- Give it to me.
- Let it go!

295
00:20:20,431 --> 00:20:22,870
- Give it to me!
- I told you let it go!

296
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,505
I don't know what your problem is with him.

297
00:20:25,505 --> 00:20:28,556
But you clear it with him and leave me the hell alone.

298
00:20:53,013 --> 00:20:56,901
Khai, I told you to look after your girl.

299
00:20:56,901 --> 00:21:00,406
I met Fahsai today. She was asking me about you.

300
00:21:00,406 --> 00:21:04,009
Shit, I didn't make the goal.

301
00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:05,668
Khai!

302
00:21:15,227 --> 00:21:17,205
Are you listening?

303
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,783
This is a snack for good people. You do not earn it.

304
00:21:26,783 --> 00:21:28,035
Listen to me.

305
00:21:28,035 --> 00:21:30,189
I'm listening.

306
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:32,083
I've been avoiding her.

307
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:35,422
I thought if I was with a nice one, I wouldn't find trouble.

308
00:21:35,422 --> 00:21:37,614
Little did I know that she's the worst of all.

309
00:21:37,614 --> 00:21:41,126
If you see her again, keep her far away from me.

310
00:21:41,126 --> 00:21:44,289
You asshole! Why wouldn't you do it yourself?

311
00:21:44,314 --> 00:21:48,462
I'm not available these days. I've got other things to take care of.

312
00:21:56,785 --> 00:22:00,288
Nong Miguel, you're here just in time.

313
00:22:00,288 --> 00:22:02,987
Let's watch a movie tonight.

314
00:22:02,987 --> 00:22:06,839
Pick whatever you want to see.

315
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:08,916
I've got a wide range of options for you.

316
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:13,363
Sitting over there is my friend. Don't mind him.

317
00:22:13,363 --> 00:22:15,956
Take your time to pick it out.

318
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:21,389
I'd rather go back to the old way.

319
00:22:21,389 --> 00:22:23,478
Quick in, quick out.

320
00:22:23,478 --> 00:22:26,201
No headache, unlike the nice ones.

321
00:22:26,201 --> 00:22:30,195
Can you please make dinner?

322
00:22:30,195 --> 00:22:32,595
Make it the best you can.

323
00:22:32,595 --> 00:22:34,586
Hopefully, she'll come here often.

324
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:36,309
Thanks.

325
00:22:37,627 --> 00:22:41,328

00:38:51,878 --> 00:38:53,390
Our coffee is expensive.

486
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:56,790
For the price of every cup, I take it out of your paycheck.

487
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:58,222
Why do you look like you want to go the bathroom?

488
00:38:58,222 --> 00:39:00,812
Not just look. I have to go.

489
00:39:00,812 --> 00:39:03,328
Civet coffee makes you poop.

490
00:39:03,849 --> 00:39:05,586
Go to the bathroom, then.

491
00:39:05,586 --> 00:39:09,428
I'm afraid I won't see her if she comes.

492
00:39:10,863 --> 00:39:12,539
But it's good that you're here.

493
00:39:12,539 --> 00:39:14,679
If she comes, try to make her stay longer.

494
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:16,510
Sure thing.

495
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:18,222
- Don't forget.
- Sure.

496
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:20,803
Liquid, I guess. Here it comes.

497
00:39:20,803 --> 00:39:22,510
Here's a hot latte for you.

498
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:25,168
Self-serve water station is right over there.

499
00:39:28,777 --> 00:39:33,211
Bone, do you want good news or bad news first?

500
00:39:35,467 --> 00:39:36,637
Don't tell me...

501
00:39:36,637 --> 00:39:37,686
Yes.

502
00:39:37,686 --> 00:39:41,440
The good news is the girl you like came.

503
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,720
The bad news is she's in a hurry, so I couldn't hold her for long.

504
00:39:45,315 --> 00:39:46,839
I entrusted you with this one task.

505
00:39:46,839 --> 00:39:50,479
Calm down. Don't yell at me just yet.

506
00:39:50,479 --> 00:39:55,567
At least she brought some DVDs for her membership.

507
00:39:55,567 --> 00:39:58,000
So? That's normal.

508
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,649
Think about it. You gave her "Notting Hill."

509
00:40:02,649 --> 00:40:07,567
And she gave you "My Best Friend's Wedding."

510
00:40:08,604 --> 00:40:10,311
So?

511
00:40:10,829 --> 00:40:12,291
Are you really a film student?

512
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:15,961
In "Notting Hill," the guy approaches Julia Roberts.

513
00:40:15,961 --> 00:40:20,397
But in "My Best Friend's Wedding," Julia Roberts approaches the guy.

514
00:40:20,397 --> 00:40:24,407
This means that she likes you.

515
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,910
- Really?
- You need to interpret the meaning.

516
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:33,547
Using movies to make a move. So romantic.

517
00:40:51,875 --> 00:40:55,126
What about Two and Bone?

518
00:40:55,126 --> 00:40:56,536
They're coming.

519
00:40:56,536 --> 00:40:57,925
The usual?

520
00:40:57,925 --> 00:41:00,190
You know me so well.

521
00:41:10,113 --> 00:41:11,662
For you.

522
00:41:12,488 --> 00:41:13,851
What?

523
00:41:13,851 --> 00:41:15,507
Open it.

524
00:41:31,061 --> 00:41:32,820
I had it fixed.

525
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:36,205
It may not be the same, but it's usable.

526
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:39,458
Thank you.

527
00:41:44,299 --> 00:41:46,610
Since I moved in with you,

528
00:41:47,485 --> 00:41:49,757
I've caused you trouble, haven't I?

529
00:41:51,058 --> 00:41:54,992
Didn't you hear what I said to Fahsai this morning?

530
00:41:56,543 --> 00:41:59,188
You said you cared about me more.

531
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,928
Did you say that to kick her out?

532
00:42:01,928 --> 00:42:05,071
What do you take me for?

533
00:42:05,071 --> 00:42:06,494
An asshole.

534
00:42:06,494 --> 00:42:10,750
Bastard! You know whom I'd choose between a girl and a friend.

535
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:12,590
- Friend?
- Girl.

536
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:14,643
Why would you ask me that question, then?

537
00:42:14,643 --> 00:42:17,493
I asked because I'm saying that it's different.

538
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:20,108
With girls, I use my body.

539
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:24,831
With you, I use my heart. You can't compare them.

540
00:42:29,912 --> 00:42:34,207
After today, I won't bring anyone home.

541
00:42:34,207 --> 00:42:36,949
I don't want what happened today to happen again.

542
00:42:37,825 --> 00:42:40,856
That's fine. I don't think...

543
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,406
No more talking. I've thought this through.

544
00:42:56,779 --> 00:42:59,004
Cheers!

545
00:42:59,004 --> 00:43:03,810
To the best short film crew of our class.

546
00:43:05,028 --> 00:43:08,036
Not of our class. Of the faculty.

547
00:43:08,036 --> 00:43:12,610
No, of the world!

548
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:15,348
Khai, you're delusional.

549
00:43:15,348 --> 00:43:17,929
I'm not delusional. Stop it.

550
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:22,386
My dream is to set up a company with you.

551
00:43:22,386 --> 00:43:25,132
I've heard him say this a million times.

552
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:29,787
Two, you're the camera guy.

553
00:43:30,397 --> 00:43:33,611
Bone, you're the editing guy.

554
00:43:34,204 --> 00:43:37,395
Third, you're the screenwriter.

555
00:43:37,395 --> 00:43:38,835
And I'm the director.

556
00:43:38,835 --> 00:43:41,164
We'll submit our film to the Oscars.

557
00:43:41,164 --> 00:43:44,424
Working with you guys makes me very happy.

558
00:43:44,424 --> 00:43:47,368
I fucking love you.

559
00:43:47,938 --> 00:43:49,740
Khai, you're so drunk.

560
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:53,728
I think you're "on the knock".

561
00:43:53,728 --> 00:43:55,466
Khai.

562
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,967
Khai.

563
00:44:01,565 --> 00:44:03,445
Khai.

564
00:44:03,445 --> 00:44:06,328
I think he's gone. Let's go home.

565
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,011
What are you going todo tonight with the moving out?

566
00:44:13,011 --> 00:44:15,558
We'll see. I'll have to drop him off anyway.

567
00:44:15,558 --> 00:44:19,180
After you drop him off, you can come to my place.

568
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:21,269
Whatever makes you happy.

569
00:44:25,772 --> 00:44:27,384
This one is knocked out as well.

570
00:44:27,384 --> 00:44:28,645
Bone!

571
00:44:28,645 --> 00:44:30,145
Yes, sir!

572
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,186
Let's go home.

573
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:14,434
Did you bring me home last night, Third?

574
00:45:18,616 --> 00:45:20,112
Third?

575
00:45:23,268 --> 00:45:24,712
Third.

576
00:45:25,855 --> 00:45:27,859
Where is he?

577
00:45:29,571 --> 00:45:31,056
Third.

578
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:35,556
Third.

579
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,953
Where are you?

580
00:45:46,672 --> 00:45:49,371
Third, are you in there?

581
00:45:55,066 --> 00:45:57,068
Where did you go?

582
00:45:57,068 --> 00:46:00,031
I went out to buy some food for you.

583
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:17,254
How could I find a better girl than you?

584
00:46:17,802 --> 00:46:19,330
Don't be dramatic.

585
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:23,882
I don't know if I made the right call to stay with Khai.

586
00:46:23,882 --> 00:46:28,767
After this, he may do a shitty thing that hurts me again.

587
00:46:28,767 --> 00:46:32,725
Even then, I'm willing to take a risk.

588
00:46:33,328 --> 00:46:35,059
Why?

589
00:46:50,533 --> 00:46:52,228
Third.

590
00:46:55,695 --> 00:46:58,628
Stay with me for a while.

591
00:47:02,408 --> 00:47:04,833
Remember this.

592
00:47:04,844 --> 00:47:08,055
With girls, I use my body.

593
00:47:08,845 --> 00:47:11,655
With you, I use my heart.

594
00:47:37,192 --> 00:47:39,837
Why didn't you tell me you didn't bring your car? Come with me.

595
00:47:39,837 --> 00:47:42,764
You said Chawee is for your girl only.

596
00:47:42,764 --> 00:47:45,617
You're living with me like you're mine anyway.

597
00:47:45,617 --> 00:47:49,940
If you buy 200, you can kiss the person who feeds you for free.

598
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:53,431
You ate the sausage. You'll have to kiss me on the cheek.

599
00:47:53,928 --> 00:47:56,450
Although there are gaps in this movie,

600
00:47:56,450 --> 00:48:00,131
if you watch it with your heart, I still like it anyway.

601
00:48:00,554 --> 00:48:02,559
I like it, too.

602
00:48:03,423 --> 00:48:06,757
This might be his plan to confess his love to you.
