So, you are worried.

It may sound stupid, but I have a gut feeling.

147
00:12:47,244 --> 00:12:49,269
There's something about her.

148
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,337
Actually, I've heard a few things about her.

149

She's quite something.

150
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,895
In what way?

151
00:12:59,895 --> 00:13:02,200
Seduction.

152
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,007
No one escapes her.

153
00:13:05,007 --> 00:13:10,332
Actually, I don't want to say this because I don't want to upset you.

154
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,140
And here you are,

155

156
00:13:16,617 --> 00:13:19,110
That's why I brought you here.

157
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,550

160
00:13:24,462 --> 00:13:27,056
We're having a party upstairs. Come and join us.

161
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,174
Khai is also here. Come on.

162
00:13:29,174 --> 00:13:30,752
We'll join you in a sec.

163
00:13:30,752 --> 00:13:33,458
- Okay.
- See you soon.

164
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,002
You brought me to the place where Khai's party is held?

00:13:40,002 --> 00:13:41,180
Yes, I did.

166
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:45,489
If you're upset, you go up and check on him now.

167
00:13:45,489 --> 00:13:47,089
No.

168
00:13:49,092 --> 00:13:52,729
You said no, but you're quick to stand up.

169
00:13:52,729 --> 00:13:54,129
I'm getting beers.

170
00:13:54,129 --> 00:13:56,429
You can order the staff, you know.

171
00:13:58,323 --> 00:14:00,238
I've ordered only two.

172
00:14:00,238 --> 00:14:02,989
The guy bought you more.

173
00:14:12,954 --> 00:14:16,025
Hello, you're not a regular here.

174
00:14:16,025 --> 00:14:18,250
I come here often.

175
00:14:19,115 --> 00:14:20,572
Really?

176
00:14:20,572 --> 00:14:23,790
Who do you come with?

177
00:14:25,099 --> 00:14:26,730
Friends.

178
00:14:27,365 --> 00:14:31,660
I guess that means you're single.

179
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,637
May I drink with you then?

180
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:43,073
I'm sorry.

181
00:14:43,073 --> 00:14:44,578
I'm taken.

182
00:14:44,578 --> 00:14:47,777
I came with my friends to wait for my boyfriend.

183
00:14:47,777 --> 00:14:49,500
And he's here now.

184
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,412
Excuse me.

185
00:15:35,909 --> 00:15:38,473
Hey, kiss me.

186
00:15:39,095 --> 00:15:42,152
- I told you to kiss me.
- Kiss?

187
00:15:42,152 --> 00:15:44,661
- Kiss me now!
- What?

188
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,152
What the fuck?

189
00:15:55,152 --> 00:15:57,433
What the hell is wrong with you, Third?

190
00:15:57,433 --> 00:16:01,609
Go ahead! Punch me! Punch me hard!

191
00:16:03,007 --> 00:16:05,230
And this ends now.

192
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:08,437
I don't want to love you anymore. It hurts!

193
00:16:10,124 --> 00:16:11,358
You saw?

194
00:16:11,358 --> 00:16:12,932
Yes!

195
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:17,369
I'm sorry.

196
00:16:17,369 --> 00:16:19,735
I wish I could be like you.

197
00:16:19,735 --> 00:16:21,242
You never love anyone.

198
00:16:21,242 --> 00:16:24,838
You're never sad when you lose someone.

199
00:16:24,838 --> 00:16:28,190
Did you feel sad when you lost me?

200
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:31,486
Did you feel sad when I was kissing someone else?

201
00:16:31,486 --> 00:16:34,104
- Third!
- Don't say another word!

202
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,959
I'm like this...

203
00:16:39,188 --> 00:16:41,539
because I love you.

204
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,968
I'm an idiot.

205
00:16:44,968 --> 00:16:47,189
I'm such an idiot.

206
00:16:48,284 --> 00:16:50,850
I thought you could be different.

207
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,993
But in the end,

208
00:16:53,724 --> 00:16:56,671
you destroyed everything.

209
00:17:34,963 --> 00:17:40,629
Third, I think you should stop drinking.

210
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,238
Here's some water.

211
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:25,262
I'm going to go get something for you to eat to sober you up.

212
00:18:50,624 --> 00:18:52,509
You're back already.

213
00:18:53,275 --> 00:18:54,875
Third.

214
00:19:01,084 --> 00:19:03,143
Why are you here?

215
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:05,353
I want to clear this up with you.

216
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:08,204
I have nothing to say to you. Get out.

217
00:19:08,204 --> 00:19:11,646
- Listen to me, Third.
- I told you, get out!

218
00:19:14,076 --> 00:19:15,426
Calm down.

219
00:19:15,426 --> 00:19:17,569
- Get out! I've got nothing to say to you.
- Third!

220
00:19:17,569 --> 00:19:19,664
Get out! Get out!

221
00:19:19,664 --> 00:19:21,829
- Just calm down!
- Get out!

222
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:24,610
- Third!
- Get out!

223
00:19:26,944 --> 00:19:28,953
Get out!

224
00:19:28,953 --> 00:19:31,560
Calm down! Listen to me!

225
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,537
Listen!

226
00:19:32,537 --> 00:19:35,175
Just listen!

227
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,192
Listen!

228
00:19:37,192 --> 00:19:39,352
What's up with you?

229
00:19:40,878 --> 00:19:42,700
Third!

230
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,323
- Two, please step out.
- My ass. You get out of here.

231
00:19:45,323 --> 00:19:47,428
I told you to get out.

232
00:19:48,704 --> 00:19:50,533
I'm begging you.

233
00:19:52,475 --> 00:19:56,149
Third, call me if you need me.

234
00:20:23,133 --> 00:20:24,909
Does it hurt?

235
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:32,089
Not as much as what you did to me.

236
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:31,536
Don't even try.

237
00:21:32,735 --> 00:21:34,838
I'm not Ching Ching.

238
00:21:38,842 --> 00:21:40,939
What do you mean?

239
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:45,441
If you're trying to have sex with me

240
00:21:45,441 --> 00:21:50,069
just because you're not getting with her tonight, leave now.

241
00:21:50,069 --> 00:21:54,153
No. I have never seen you as an object.

242
00:21:55,051 --> 00:21:57,529
But you do it with everyone.

243
00:21:57,529 --> 00:21:59,560
Not with you.

244
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:05,389
Let me ask you something.

245
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:12,434
If I were to tell you I'm not in love with you, I just want to get the best of you?

246
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:16,635
That's not you.

247
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,678
You know me so well, huh?

248
00:22:18,678 --> 00:22:24,090
Yes. The Third I know loves me.

249
00:22:26,115 --> 00:22:28,238
But the Khai I know...

250
00:22:29,018 --> 00:22:31,109
loves no one but himself.

251
00:22:46,197 --> 00:22:50,238
Let's talk when the tempers cool down a bit.

252
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,270
But I just want you to know that...

253
00:22:56,983 --> 00:22:58,815
I love you.

254
00:23:50,925 --> 00:23:53,593
- Nattaporn.
- Present.

255
00:23:53,593 --> 00:23:55,909
- Monruedee.
- Present.

256
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,080
Thanachat.

257
00:23:59,648 --> 00:24:01,442
Boriphat.

258
00:24:09,894 --> 00:24:11,625
Wilailak.

259
00:24:12,344 --> 00:24:15,241
- Pongset.
- Present.

260
00:24:15,241 --> 00:24:16,933
Okay.

261
00:24:21,124 --> 00:24:24,334
Hey, Two. Good that you're here.

262
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,159
Playbill for the play.

263
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,384
If there are any errors, let me know right away.

264
00:24:31,384 --> 00:24:35,090
Sure. After I finish proofreading, I'll send it to the group chat.

265
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,987
Thanks.

266
00:24:36,987 --> 00:24:42,769
Okay, stage people, inform the cast to get ready to rehearse on the stage.

267
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:12,525
P'Shane, can I talk to you?

268
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:20,984
What does Un's message mean?

269
00:26:20,984 --> 00:26:22,730
What message?

270
00:26:28,466 --> 00:26:31,129
Despite its brevity,

271
00:26:32,202 --> 00:26:36,749
this play gives me a lot of memories.

272
00:26:36,749 --> 00:26:42,424
It's unfortunate that I won't get to see it play out on the stage with everyone.

273
00:26:42,424 --> 00:26:46,349
But I will take this feeling with me.

274
00:26:46,349 --> 00:26:52,527
Although my body is not in Thailand, my heart is with you all always.

275
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,230
Un.

276
00:27:00,732 --> 00:27:04,863
Oh, he's going to do his internship overseas.

277
00:27:04,863 --> 00:27:07,832
That's why he won't be here for the play.

278
00:27:09,764 --> 00:27:13,334
Stunned? I was stunned, too, when I found out.

279
00:27:13,334 --> 00:27:16,307
He wasn't going to go at first,

280
00:27:16,307 --> 00:27:19,138
but he somehow changed his mind.

281
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:22,297
He also said he's going to continue to work there.

282
00:27:22,297 --> 00:27:24,537
It sounds like he may not come back.

283
00:27:27,061 --> 00:27:28,442
It's good that you're here.

284
00:27:28,442 --> 00:27:31,513
He gave me something to return to you.

285
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:36,149
Here you go.
[The Perks of Being a Wallflower]

286
00:27:38,443 --> 00:27:40,667
Good film.

287
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,050
I'm leaving.

288
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:52,687
[The Perks of Being a Wallflower]

289
00:28:07,464 --> 00:28:12,207
Third, I'm going out to shop for our beach trip. Would you like to come?

290
00:28:22,824 --> 00:28:24,764
I'm fine with the latest draft.

291
00:28:24,764 --> 00:28:26,780
No further comments.

292
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:30,614
Okay, I'll insert the sounds and effects so you can have a better picture.

293
00:28:30,614 --> 00:28:33,329
Great, I can wait.

294
00:28:43,486 --> 00:28:45,978
Is Professor Paan not coming today?

295
00:28:45,978 --> 00:28:48,420
She's not feeling well.

296
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:51,335
So, I came to look at the presentation instead.

297
00:28:51,335 --> 00:28:53,285
Do you have any business with her?

298
00:28:53,285 --> 00:28:56,007
No, I was just asking.

299
00:28:56,007 --> 00:28:57,741
Okay.

300
00:29:11,192 --> 00:29:12,750
Hello.

301
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:19,532
I can't talk right now.

302
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,335
I told you I can't.

303
00:29:25,804 --> 00:29:29,459
Okay. I'm going downstairs now.

304
00:29:34,707 --> 00:29:37,930
Bone, something urgent has come up.

305
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:41,290
Can you please send the work to my email when you're done?

306
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,746
I'll comment on that one later.

307
00:29:42,746 --> 00:29:43,851
Okay.

308
00:29:43,851 --> 00:29:46,333
Please excuse me.

309
00:30:29,764 --> 00:30:31,664
Fai.

310
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:33,519
Have you waited long?

311
00:30:39,687 --> 00:30:44,600
I told you not to call me like that.

312
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,144
I don't want Paan to find out about us.

313
00:30:47,826 --> 00:30:52,520
What about me? Don't you feel anything for me?

314
00:30:54,025 --> 00:30:56,837
Things between us ended a long time ago.

315
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:03,130
And you know that I'm getting married.

316
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:05,338
But I love you.

317
00:31:06,408 --> 00:31:09,571
Can't we just continue our affair?

318
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:14,215
I don't think this is going anywhere.

319
00:31:14,215 --> 00:31:18,739
I promise I won't let her know.

320
00:31:19,683 --> 00:31:22,432
I don't want to lose you.

321
00:31:23,822 --> 00:31:26,537
Please don't leave me.

322
00:31:29,032 --> 00:31:30,695
Fai.

323
00:31:34,527 --> 00:31:36,638
I've chosen Paan.

324
00:31:39,427 --> 00:31:41,004
Fine.

325
00:31:42,245 --> 00:31:46,129
I will tell your girlfriend about us.

326
00:32:01,707 --> 00:32:04,143
Bone, is something wrong?

327
00:32:04,143 --> 00:32:05,943
This is quite late.

328
00:32:05,943 --> 00:32:09,707
I've brought you the edited presentation.

329
00:32:12,065 --> 00:32:17,669
Bone, that's fine.

330
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:20,038
I don't want to see it.

Please.

333

This is the interview section that P'Gap wanted me to delete,

334
00:32:43,786 --> 00:32:46,734
but I just want to show it to you.

335
00:32:53,178 --> 00:32:57,469
Where did we first met?

336
00:32:57,469 --> 00:33:01,715
If I'm not wrong, it must be at the coffee shop.

337
00:33:01,715 --> 00:33:08,824
It's such a coincidence. Our coffee cups got mixed up.

338
00:33:08,824 --> 00:33:11,469
I must confess right now.

339
00:33:11,469 --> 00:33:16,290
It's no coincidence that our coffee cups were swapped.

340
00:33:16,847 --> 00:33:19,587
I used to go to the coffee shop.

341
00:33:19,587 --> 00:33:22,040
When I saw Paan,

342
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,239
that's when I knew I fell in love at first sight.

343
00:33:25,239 --> 00:33:28,440
But I was too afraid to approach her

344
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:35,844
until the owner pitied me so much that he swapped the cups.

345
00:33:35,844 --> 00:33:39,070
That's when we first talked.

346
00:33:39,748 --> 00:33:46,230
Even these days I still can't believe that I'm marrying her.

347
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:52,031
I've often thought that she could be better off with someone more deserving.

348
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:55,769
But it also makes me realize that I can't live...

349
00:33:56,306 --> 00:33:58,128
without her.

350
00:33:58,128 --> 00:34:03,656
This gives me the drive to be a better man,

351
00:34:03,656 --> 00:34:05,908
a more deserving man,

352
