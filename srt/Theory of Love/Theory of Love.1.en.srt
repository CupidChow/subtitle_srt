00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:03,290
"I love you."

3
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,960
I was practically cheering for Khaiyoi.

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,523
I felt relieved for him.

5
00:00:07,523 --> 00:00:09,639
He was finally brave enough to confess his love to Dakanda.

6
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:12,118
Although it was a little too late,

7
00:00:12,118 --> 00:00:15,280
it's not that easy... confessing your love to your friend.

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,840
For someone as handsome as Khaiyoi, it still took him four years.

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,153
But as they say...

10
00:00:21,153 --> 00:00:24,205
Hey, are you done?

11
00:00:24,853 --> 00:00:26,918
I like how Flipped...

12
00:00:26,918 --> 00:00:29,182
It's Flipped, not Flip-ped.

13
00:00:29,182 --> 00:00:33,482
I like how this film tells the same story through two points of views.

14
00:00:33,482 --> 00:00:37,269
Two people, who are close friends, have feelings for each other.

15
00:00:37,269 --> 00:00:42,699
But they won't say it until they end up hurting each other without knowing.

16
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:48,849
Sorry.

17
00:00:49,932 --> 00:00:53,666
The characters in "My Best Friend's Wedding" are realistic.

18
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:57,991
Every time Julianne sees Michael getting lovey-dovey with his girl, she gets jealous.

19
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:00,893
Like, it's itching when you see people in love.

20
00:01:00,893 --> 00:01:02,607
Yes. I miss you.

21
00:01:02,607 --> 00:01:04,607
- Hold on, a minute.
- Shit, Khai! Don't run!

22
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:07,341
My camera just moved, can't you see?

23
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,925
That feeling is as real as it gets.

24
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,539
The main reason why it's hard to confess your love to a friend

25
00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:18,792
is in this film, "Love, Rosie."

26
00:01:18,792 --> 00:01:21,750
It's the fear of rejection.

27
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,799
At least, it's better to be friends than nothing at all.

28
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,788
After a failed relationship,

29
00:01:29,788 --> 00:01:34,269
Joel in "Eternal Sunshine" finds a way to forget about his love

30
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:36,652
by erasing his memories of the relationship.

31
00:01:36,652 --> 00:01:40,500
However, while the brain may forget, the heart remembers.

32
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,066
He, then, falls in love with his ex all over again.

33
00:01:43,066 --> 00:01:44,580
Well, there you go.

34
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:50,237
Nothing is harder than getting over someone while you still love them with all your heart,

35
00:01:50,237 --> 00:01:53,077
even though your brain tells you that it's not possible.

36
00:01:54,004 --> 00:01:57,831
Are you trying to do a movie review or hosting a relationship talk show?

37
00:01:57,831 --> 00:02:00,130
So emotional and dramatic.

38
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,872
All your fans have switched channels.

39
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:05,020
Try to close as quickly as I do.

40
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,698
Get to it, close, and that's it.

41
00:02:07,698 --> 00:02:09,561
Then, part.

42
00:02:10,101 --> 00:02:13,870
Is that your style of movie review, or how to get with a girl?

43
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,223
If you think you're damn good, help me with the clip.

I want to know everything about the guy in the back.

54
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:48,317
Don't even think about it, Third.

55
00:02:48,317 --> 00:02:52,558
Don't jump on my celebrity bandwagon. I'm not a nice, cute guy for you.

No, I'm not. I already have plans.

This is my friend, Third.

As you can see, this dude is called Khai.

He's my best friend.

71

Born a smart ass, he has weird habits that give me a headache.

There's no time to go to another shop. It's almost 12:00.

105

There's one faculty, though, that I'd never date.

Khai is not possessive of his things in general.

But there's one thing he won't share.

It's the name of my new motorbike. His nickname is Chawee. Full name is Charles.

What kind of nickname is longer than the full name?

So, are we seeing a film tonight?

not once has he ever looked back at me.

148
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,554
Maybe it's because I don't have the courage to tell him.
