00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,331
No.

170
00:12:40,331 --> 00:12:42,560
What? But I need to leave now.

171
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,448
The forecast says the storm is coming.

172
00:12:44,448 --> 00:12:45,825
What about that boat?

173
00:12:45,825 --> 00:12:47,434
That's the last one.

174
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,482
This can't be.

175
00:12:49,485 --> 00:12:51,608
I need to go now.

176
00:12:51,608 --> 00:12:53,043
Hey!

177
00:12:53,043 --> 00:12:54,960
Two!

178
00:13:09,494 --> 00:13:11,477
How did you get here?

179
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:20,407
I want to ask for your advice for the last time before I go.

180
00:13:22,184 --> 00:13:23,979
About what?

181
00:13:25,581 --> 00:13:28,179
There's this person I like so much.

182
00:13:28,931 --> 00:13:32,080
But the closer I try to get to him,

183
00:13:32,794 --> 00:13:35,507
the further away he gets from me.

184
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:41,906
Do you think I should get over him?

185
00:13:46,153 --> 00:13:53,139
Do you know why Charlie and Sam aren't together at the end?

186
00:13:54,114 --> 00:13:58,306
Sam moved away to study in another city.

187
00:13:59,017 --> 00:14:01,659
I hate this kind of ending.

188
00:14:02,354 --> 00:14:07,660
I want to change the ending so that they are together before they are apart.

189
00:14:08,285 --> 00:14:12,526
Even though they don't see each other, they still keep in contact.

190
00:14:12,526 --> 00:14:14,499
Is that okay?

191
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:19,702
Do you mean in films or something else?

192
00:14:19,702 --> 00:14:21,808
You know the answer.

193
00:14:23,185 --> 00:14:27,414
I don't think I can do it.

194
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,460
Huh?

195
00:14:31,681 --> 00:14:35,212
Because I'm not going anymore.

196
00:14:37,865 --> 00:14:39,559
Why?

197
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,003
You know the answer.

198
00:14:49,062 --> 00:14:53,608
Because... I love you.

199
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,520
[RIMtalay ReSoRt]

200
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,954
You said there'd be twin beds.

201
00:15:35,954 --> 00:15:37,668
Why is there a double bed instead?

202
00:15:37,668 --> 00:15:41,997
It's twins as in we both sleep on the same bed.

203
00:15:42,668 --> 00:15:46,268
No, go find another place to sleep. I want this bed to myself.

204
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,708
Why?

205
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,999
I want to sleep alone.

206
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,930
Here.

207
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:09,499
You're not eating?

208
00:16:23,179 --> 00:16:24,612
What are you doing?

209
00:16:24,612 --> 00:16:26,572
I'm feeding you snack.

210
00:16:26,572 --> 00:16:30,900
No, I don't want it. You can eat by yourself.

211
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:44,114
Wasn't that a bit cold?

212
00:16:44,735 --> 00:16:47,859
She was your longest relationship.

213
00:16:50,925 --> 00:16:56,139
No matter how long it is, a past relationship is always hard.

214
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,770
Fine, I'll take a shower.

215
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,808
Do whatever you want.

216
00:17:05,436 --> 00:17:09,525
Whatever I want? Can I sleep here with you all night long?

217
00:17:10,193 --> 00:17:11,806
Go be horny somewhere else.

218
00:17:11,806 --> 00:17:15,077
You climbed into bed to seduce me.

219
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:18,406
I'm not in bed to seduce you. I want to sleep. I'm so tired.

220
00:17:18,406 --> 00:17:21,442
Can you give me a minute to nap? Go somewhere else.

221
00:17:22,103 --> 00:17:24,040
Go!

222
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:28,129
Fine, I'm going.

223
00:17:30,441 --> 00:17:31,932
I'm really going.

224
00:17:31,932 --> 00:17:33,540
Okay.

225
00:17:38,794 --> 00:17:41,688
I'm really, really going.

226
00:17:41,688 --> 00:17:45,100
Just go. I'm taking a nap.

227
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,201
Third, are you okay?

228
00:18:22,593 --> 00:18:24,902
Let's go outside.

229
00:18:34,694 --> 00:18:36,719
Beautiful stars.

230
00:18:38,882 --> 00:18:40,378
Third.

231
00:18:42,077 --> 00:18:43,881
Well...

232
00:18:46,077 --> 00:18:49,642
I have a question I've been meaning to ask you.

233
00:18:49,642 --> 00:18:51,699
Can I ask you now?

234
00:18:52,557 --> 00:18:54,307
You can try.

235
00:18:56,228 --> 00:19:00,079
If I hadn't found that love-confession video,

236
00:19:00,734 --> 00:19:02,905
would you have told me that you liked me?

237
00:19:05,883 --> 00:19:10,619
No, I would've continued to keep it a secret.

238
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:18,519
What if afterward you found someone who is your type in every way?

239
00:19:19,073 --> 00:19:21,702
Would you be attracted to them instead?

240
00:19:23,879 --> 00:19:26,506
Think about it.

241
00:19:26,506 --> 00:19:29,805
I've met a lot of good people.

242
00:19:29,805 --> 00:19:34,917
But in the end, I'm stuck with a jackass like you.

243
00:19:36,178 --> 00:19:38,469
Thank you so much.

244
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:41,905
You're the first one who's been with me in every moment.

245
00:19:42,655 --> 00:19:46,034
We've had many firsts together.

246
00:19:46,931 --> 00:19:50,717
We had our first freshman orientation together.

247
00:19:50,717 --> 00:19:53,394
We made our first short film together.

248
00:19:53,394 --> 00:19:55,232
We watched the stars for the first time together.

249
00:19:55,232 --> 00:19:58,405
We took the train for the first time together.

250
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:01,620
For the next first,

251
00:20:03,757 --> 00:20:06,319
can I kiss you for the first time?

252
00:20:08,504 --> 00:20:09,958
We have kissed before.

253
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:14,608
No, I mean...

254
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:18,289
we kiss as a couple for the first time.

255
00:20:36,451 --> 00:20:38,380
I don't think we should.

256
00:20:40,433 --> 00:20:42,084
Why?

257
00:20:44,448 --> 00:20:46,680
I don't want to end up like Jam.

258
00:20:47,488 --> 00:20:49,976
One day if we were to break up...

259
00:20:50,907 --> 00:20:53,636
and I'm left with nothing,

260
00:20:53,636 --> 00:20:55,701
not even friendship.

261
00:21:09,615 --> 00:21:11,282
I'm leaving.

262
00:21:11,282 --> 00:21:13,311
Text me when you arrive.

263
00:21:15,037 --> 00:21:17,500
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

264
00:21:34,391 --> 00:21:36,897
That's enough. Let's start looking for locations.

265
00:21:36,897 --> 00:21:40,891
Two needs to return early to be with P'Un, his new boyfriend.

266
00:21:41,987 --> 00:21:46,062
From the bad boy gangstas, how did we end up here?

267
00:21:46,062 --> 00:21:47,840
Want to know if I'm still a gangsta?

268
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,963
- Let's have a go.
- Oh really?

269
00:21:50,778 --> 00:21:52,615
Where are you going? Wait up!

270
00:21:52,615 --> 00:21:54,423
Wait up!

271
00:21:57,931 --> 00:21:59,579
Wait up!

272
00:22:04,963 --> 00:22:06,622
- Is here okay?
- I think this is better.

273
00:22:06,622 --> 00:22:08,817
Come here, Third.

274
00:22:08,817 --> 00:22:11,220
The frame would be magnificent.

275
00:22:11,781 --> 00:22:13,757
- Is it good?
- Get closer.

276
00:22:13,757 --> 00:22:15,439
You come here. I'll take the photo.

277
00:22:15,439 --> 00:22:19,146
- A bit closer.
- Any closer than this, I'd be piggybacking him.

278
00:22:21,876 --> 00:22:23,605
Let's go over there.

279
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:27,041
Come.

280
00:22:59,793 --> 00:23:02,324
I don't want to end up like Jam.

281
00:23:02,324 --> 00:23:04,994
One day if we were to break up,

282
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:08,661
and I'm left with nothing,

283
00:23:08,661 --> 00:23:10,819
not even friendship.

284
00:23:25,171 --> 00:23:27,949
He's afraid if one day we break up, he'll lose a friend.

285
00:23:27,949 --> 00:23:30,717
I believe what he said is correct.

286
00:23:30,717 --> 00:23:35,665
You hurt him a lot even when you were not together.

287
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:38,831
I remember. There's Nong Kwang, Nong Namwan, and—

288
00:23:38,831 --> 00:23:40,400
Enough.

289
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:48,410
Even though I know I may lose him if we break up, that's the risk I need to take.

290
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:53,899
Now, I love him too much to be just friends.

291
00:24:04,522 --> 00:24:05,780
What is it?

292
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,960
The final obstacle you need to unlock.

293
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:20,008
"Things I hate about Khai."

294
00:24:20,649 --> 00:24:22,099
What is this?

295
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:27,932
Third listed 7 things he hated about you when he was trying to get over you.

296
00:24:27,932 --> 00:24:30,128
If you unlock each of them,

297
00:24:30,128 --> 00:24:34,159
Third may believe you are a new man.

298
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,220
He may go out with you.

299
00:24:38,404 --> 00:24:41,793
Two, why did you just tell me this now?

300
00:24:41,793 --> 00:24:45,039
You've known about it for a while, haven't you?

301
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,859
I didn't trust you at first.

302
00:24:47,859 --> 00:24:52,056
But now I do believe that you can do it.

303
00:24:53,297 --> 00:24:55,220
So hot-tempered.

304
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:00,101
Thanks.

305
00:25:02,424 --> 00:25:07,430
Khai, don't break my friend's heart.

306
00:25:14,664 --> 00:25:16,362
Things I hate about Khai.

307
00:25:16,362 --> 00:25:19,112
1. He drives too fast.

308
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:23,698
Khai, why are you going so slow?

309
00:25:23,698 --> 00:25:25,171
At what speed are you going?

310
00:25:25,171 --> 00:25:26,482
20.

311
00:25:26,482 --> 00:25:27,369
Huh?

312
00:25:27,369 --> 00:25:29,398
How can a big bike go at 20 km/h?

313
00:25:29,398 --> 00:25:30,750
You might as well just sell it.

314
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:33,562
If I'm late for class today, I'll slap your face hard.

315
00:25:33,562 --> 00:25:35,959
Have a little patience.

316
00:25:36,563 --> 00:25:39,097
If you're going to drive this slow, you'd be better off riding a bicycle.

317
00:25:39,097 --> 00:25:41,030
Be nice, asshole.

318
00:25:42,477 --> 00:25:44,550
You want to have a go?

319
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,651
Let's have a go.

320
00:25:45,651 --> 00:25:47,554
Come on.

321
00:25:51,202 --> 00:25:52,929
Are you okay?

322
00:25:52,929 --> 00:25:54,385
I'm fine.

323
00:25:54,385 --> 00:25:56,409
We just keep going. There's no point to rush.

324
00:25:56,409 --> 00:25:59,877
Let's be calm, and we'll get there.

325
00:26:01,797 --> 00:26:04,799
2. Khai gives up easily.

326
00:26:05,388 --> 00:26:07,907
The queue is long. Let's go somewhere else.

327
00:26:07,907 --> 00:26:09,251
That's fine, I can wait.

328
00:26:09,251 --> 00:26:10,925
But it's almost noon.

329
00:26:10,925 --> 00:26:12,925
You need to eat at noon on the dot.

330
00:26:12,925 --> 00:26:14,323
For you, I can wait.

331
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:15,556
I think we should go somewhere else.

332
00:26:15,556 --> 00:26:17,723
No, you wanted to eat at this restaurant.

333
00:26:17,723 --> 00:26:20,567
I can't wait this long. I'm finding something else to eat.

334
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:24,420
Why are you the one who gives up easily today?

335
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,003
3. Khai isn't smart.

336
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:32,919
Who knows how many times have the Oscars been held?

337
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:34,818
This is the 91st time.

338
00:26:34,818 --> 00:26:35,877
Correct.

339
00:26:35,877 --> 00:26:42,143
In what year did the first Oscars take place?

340
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:45,757
1929 at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel.

341
00:26:45,757 --> 00:26:48,276
The ticket price is around $5.

342
00:26:48,276 --> 00:26:52,200
No more than 250 people attended.

343
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,522
Professor, do you have any harder questions?

344
00:26:55,522 --> 00:26:59,909
I think this is too easy. It's not at the same level as a smart person like me.

345
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:04,870
Sure, in that case...

346
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:12,460
What genre is the movie that won Best Picture in 2012?

347
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,160
Shit.

348
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:17,697
Answer it, Mr. Smarty Pants.

349
00:27:19,002 --> 00:27:21,787
Correct! You were silent

350
00:27:21,787 --> 00:27:29,844
because you've figured out that the film that won Best Picture in 2012 is...

351
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:34,562
a silent movie called "The Artist."

352
00:27:35,177 --> 00:27:38,619
Give him a big hand, guys. What are you waiting for?

353
00:27:39,812 --> 00:27:42,220
Such a sophisticated way to answer.

354
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:46,717
Learn from this, everyone.

355
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,907
4. Khai is a player.

356
00:27:51,828 --> 00:27:54,701
Third, wait a minute.

357
00:27:57,904 --> 00:27:59,769
Milk.

358
00:27:59,769 --> 00:28:01,635
It's raining outside.

359
00:28:01,635 --> 00:28:03,865
Can I wait here until the rain stops?

360
00:28:03,865 --> 00:28:06,651
No, you can't. Please leave.

361
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:08,085
I have someone whom I really like.

362
00:28:08,085 --> 00:28:11,495
So what? We can just hold hands innocently.

363
00:28:11,495 --> 00:28:12,886
I'm not a player anymore.

364
00:28:12,886 --> 00:28:15,268
I don't want to hurt someone I love.

365
00:28:15,268 --> 00:28:17,320
There he is... the person I love.

366
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,254
P'Third!

367
00:28:20,254 --> 00:28:23,886
5. Whenever Khai breaks up with a girl, trouble finds Third.

368
00:28:23,886 --> 00:28:27,719
You pretend to be his friend, but you want him for yourself. You snake!

369
00:28:27,719 --> 00:28:31,562
No, Milk. Don't hurt him, hurt me instead.

370
00:28:31,562 --> 00:28:33,896
But I won't let that happen this time.

371
00:28:33,896 --> 00:28:35,097
Ouch!

372
00:28:35,097 --> 00:28:37,454
- Are you satisfied?
- No.

373
00:28:41,371 --> 00:28:43,905
- Aren't you hurt?
- Of course, but I'm okay.

374
00:28:43,905 --> 00:28:47,008
6. Khai never feels repentant.

375
00:28:47,008 --> 00:28:52,832
- Asshole!
- Khai has been calling to apologize to every woman he broke up with.

376
00:28:52,832 --> 00:28:54,400
He let them get back at him.

377
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,982
This is because he wants you to know that he is repentant.

378
00:28:57,982 --> 00:29:00,179
I didn't think there'd be this many.

379
00:29:22,931 --> 00:29:25,754
I believe you are truly repentant.

380
00:29:25,754 --> 00:29:31,819
I'm glad that you're trying to improve yourself according to the list I made.

381
00:29:32,858 --> 00:29:34,504
You know about that?

382
00:29:35,335 --> 00:29:37,719
Does this mean you have accepted me?

383
00:29:38,913 --> 00:29:44,904
No, I just want to tell you to please stop.

384
00:29:44,904 --> 00:29:50,201
Although you can fix other ones, you can't fix no. 7.

385
00:29:50,843 --> 00:29:52,509
Please give up.

386
00:29:53,868 --> 00:29:56,607
I don't want you to be disappointed.

387
00:30:07,294 --> 00:30:09,319
What is no. 7?

388
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:15,619
7. I never truly love anyone.

389
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:21,055
What is it that you want to talk to me about?

390
00:30:21,055 --> 00:30:23,822
Just go inside.

391
00:30:58,557 --> 00:31:00,379
You're right.

392
00:31:01,017 --> 00:31:03,948
I never truly loved anyone.

393
00:31:03,948 --> 00:31:07,759
Each person is just a means for me to not be lonely.

394
00:31:08,328 --> 00:31:14,168
Only with you, I feel that this is the love I've been searching for.

395
00:31:14,168 --> 00:31:19,105
The clouds, balloons, and light bulbs

396
00:31:19,105 --> 00:31:21,759
represent the number of days we've been friends.

397
00:31:23,274 --> 00:31:28,259
Today, can we start at one in a new relationship?

398
00:31:33,889 --> 00:31:35,960
Would you be my boyfriend, Third?

399
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:44,808
Thank you so much for this amazing setting.

400
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:53,426
But I'm just not sure if what you're doing is love.

401
00:31:55,234 --> 00:31:58,527
What is love to you?

402
00:31:59,864 --> 00:32:01,960
You have to answer that.

403
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:08,172
If you don't know what it is, how can you truly love someone?

404
00:32:33,716 --> 00:32:35,119
Where's Khai?

405
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:39,827
He texted me the other day, saying he needed to go away to handle some personal matters.

406
00:32:39,827 --> 00:32:45,717
Don't tell me he's gone off to see P'Ton by the sea again.

407
00:32:45,717 --> 00:32:47,448
I guess so.

408
00:32:55,689 --> 00:32:58,014
Looks like he will be gone for weeks.

409
00:32:58,014 --> 00:33:01,621
We'll use his room to hold a party with girls.

410
00:33:01,621 --> 00:33:03,440
Do you see that bottle of whiskey in the cabinet?

411
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,440
Khai used to tell me it belonged to his dad. No one is supposed to drink it.

412
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,911
But today, it belongs to us.

413
00:33:12,219 --> 00:33:14,407
- Bone.
- Did you just hear something?

414
00:33:14,407 --> 00:33:16,591
I heard it clearly.

415
00:33:16,591 --> 00:33:18,557
I'm going to count to 3, and then we turn to look at the same time.

416
00:33:18,557 --> 00:33:19,988
Okay.

417
00:33:19,988 --> 00:33:23,855
One, two, three.

418
00:33:33,358 --> 00:33:37,192
Khai, what the hell are you doing?

419
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:42,591
Third told me that I don't know what love is.

420
00:33:42,591 --> 00:33:45,907
So I've been watching as many romantic films as I can.

421
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:54,308
Don't tell me this is what you've been doing all week.

422
00:33:57,479 --> 00:34:00,579
Do you know now what love is?

423
00:34:19,622 --> 00:34:20,978
Do you know...

424
00:34:20,978 --> 00:34:25,505
Before, I never really believed love existed,

425
00:34:25,505 --> 00:34:30,086
only hatred and resentment were real until I met you.

426
00:34:30,086 --> 00:34:34,990
You made me realize that love is all around us everywhere,

427
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,600
especially where you are.

428
00:34:54,817 --> 00:34:57,740
That's our play called "Likebrary."

429
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:02,929
The show is not possible without all of you, our audience.

430
00:35:06,582 --> 00:35:11,978
Another integral part is the Comm Arts crew.

431
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,895
Let's start with the first one,

432
00:35:14,895 --> 00:35:17,679
the handsome director, yours truly.

433
00:35:20,417 --> 00:35:25,919
Next are the cast and directorial team.

434
00:35:28,421 --> 00:35:31,236
Where is Khai? It's almost our cue to go up.

435
00:35:31,236 --> 00:35:33,070
I don't know.

436
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,500
I don't know.

437
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,393
- Have you seen him?
- No.

438
00:35:37,898 --> 00:35:42,900
Next, please give a hand to the sound unit.

439
00:35:49,137 --> 00:35:53,482
Last but not least, the screenwriting team.

440
00:36:00,181 --> 00:36:02,079
Thanks.

441
00:36:27,122 --> 00:36:29,402
What are you doing, Khai?

442
00:36:34,051 --> 00:36:37,619
Third, I have something to tell you.

443
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,811
Hi.

444
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,625
Today is like any another ordinary day.

445
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:50,442
But I have something extraordinary to tell you.

446
00:36:52,396 --> 00:36:54,805
You are special.

447
00:36:57,538 --> 00:36:59,908
Not this kind of special.

448
00:37:06,231 --> 00:37:08,450
You are more than that.

449
00:37:11,264 --> 00:37:15,820
Today, I want to tell you about what's special to me.

450
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:23,337
I'm glad that I am your friend. I'm glad that I love you.

451
00:37:25,297 --> 00:37:28,679
I'm glad that I've done so many things with you.

452
00:37:31,591 --> 00:37:35,959
But what I'd like to do with you the most is...

453
00:37:40,987 --> 00:37:43,880
to grow old together with you

454
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,919
as a couple.

455
00:37:56,654 --> 00:37:58,122
Third,

456
00:37:59,554 --> 00:38:02,959
I watched as many romantic films as I could...

457
00:38:03,631 --> 00:38:06,886
to find out what love is.

458
00:38:06,886 --> 00:38:09,260
Instead of finding the answer,

459
00:38:09,938 --> 00:38:13,071
I found you in every one of them.

460
00:38:13,071 --> 00:38:16,386
Every scene when the lead characters express their love...

461
00:38:17,471 --> 00:38:22,320
is the same as what you've given me over the past three years that we've been friends.

462
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:28,583
Now I know love is not beautiful flowers,

463
00:38:28,583 --> 00:38:31,341
not luxurious locations,

464
00:38:31,341 --> 00:38:34,540
but the sincerity you've given me.

465
00:38:38,089 --> 00:38:41,108
If I am to confess my love to you,

466
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:49,422
there's no better way than the sincere way you did for me.

467
00:39:19,054 --> 00:39:25,659
If you still think what I've done here is not love,

468
00:39:26,787 --> 00:39:31,803
I really don't know what love is to you.

469
00:39:45,153 --> 00:39:48,180
I've engraved my name and yours in it.

470
00:39:49,217 --> 00:39:53,802
For me, you're not a movie,

471
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,756
you are real.

472
00:40:04,325 --> 00:40:06,139
Would you be my boyfriend?

473
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:15,460
Say yes! Say yes! Say yes!

474
00:40:49,793 --> 00:40:57,744
I used to think that if we were born alone, we should die alone.

475
00:40:57,744 --> 00:41:02,431
Because we can't choose, we have to learn to live alone.

476
00:41:02,431 --> 00:41:04,424
But now I know,

477
00:41:04,424 --> 00:41:10,059
while we are still alive, we can choose, we can choose whom to be with.

478
00:41:11,485 --> 00:41:14,565
This is the beginning of our film,

479
00:41:14,565 --> 00:41:19,959
the film that Khai and I create by ourselves.

480
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,840
Not just the two of us,

481
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,771
but our friends also make their own movies.

482
00:41:52,771 --> 00:41:59,277
The film by Two and P'Un, I'd like to categorize it as an aggressive romantic film.

483
00:41:59,277 --> 00:42:02,937
Come on, Two. Please help me out.

484
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:06,873
Find somebody else to be your photographer.

485
00:42:06,873 --> 00:42:10,108
No, it has to be you.

486
00:42:10,993 --> 00:42:12,577
Are you doing it or not?

487
00:42:12,577 --> 00:42:14,179
What if I'm not?

488
00:42:14,179 --> 00:42:18,143
You can't blackmail me with Lynn anymore.

489
00:42:18,143 --> 00:42:20,565
I'm not going to blackmail you with Lynn.

490
00:42:20,565 --> 00:42:22,766
I'm going to blackmail you with this.

491
00:42:22,766 --> 00:42:24,450
- What?
- If you're not doing it...

492
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:25,651
So?

493
00:42:25,651 --> 00:42:28,122
I'm going to kiss you.

494
00:42:28,122 --> 00:42:30,088
Please, Two.

495
00:42:30,088 --> 00:42:33,146
- Let me kiss you.
- No, P'Un. Don't!

496
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,340
Sorry!

497
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,182
Let me kiss you.

498
00:42:39,902 --> 00:42:41,530
You are strong.

499
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:48,020
Bone's film is a sad one without a happy ending.

500
00:42:48,596 --> 00:42:51,802
Let's call the bride and the groom on stage.

501
00:43:08,008 --> 00:43:10,079
I'd like to thank everyone for coming here today.

502
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:11,495
I'm very happy right now.

503
00:43:11,495 --> 00:43:14,734
Before we get to this point, both of us have been through a lot.

504
00:43:14,734 --> 00:43:18,006
I should thank my bride for standing here next to me.

505
00:43:18,006 --> 00:43:23,800
I have nothing much to say but give thanks to everyone for being here.

506
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:31,239
I'd also like to thank those who took part in making this event possible.

507
00:43:32,166 --> 00:43:33,705
Thank you.

508
00:43:35,205 --> 00:43:39,474
We have a beautiful presentation for you today.

509
00:43:39,474 --> 00:43:42,777
Let's watch it together.

510
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:27,128
Professor Paan in the VDO looks so good.

511
00:44:27,128 --> 00:44:30,697
If you hadn't really liked her, you wouldn't have done such a good editing job.

512
00:44:30,697 --> 00:44:32,297
Well...

513
00:44:45,837 --> 00:44:50,659
Luckily, his film has a sequel.

514
00:44:52,328 --> 00:44:53,573
Are you closing up?

515
00:44:53,573 --> 00:44:57,302
No, please have a seat.

516
00:45:03,593 --> 00:45:06,696
I want to apply for a movie rental membership.

517
00:45:07,582 --> 00:45:10,980
If you'd like to rent from our shop, there are two rules.

518
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:15,602
One is to give your own DVD as an entry fee. It can be any film.

519
00:45:15,602 --> 00:45:17,548
What about the other rule?

520
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:21,917
The second rule is that you must be single.

521
00:45:22,873 --> 00:45:25,297
Do you think you can comply with these?

522
00:45:29,245 --> 00:45:36,545
Looking back, our real-life films at this time seem to have a happy ending.

523
00:45:36,545 --> 00:45:40,870
But who knows what will happen 4 years later?

524
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:43,550
[4 years later...]

525
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:46,065
Khai, I think we should end this.

526
00:45:47,876 --> 00:45:49,908
Why, Third?

527
00:45:49,908 --> 00:45:53,259
No, I'm not ending it!

528
00:45:53,259 --> 00:45:56,611
There's no time. I think we should end it.

529
00:45:56,611 --> 00:46:00,577
But I'm trying here. Give me a bit more time.

530
00:46:00,577 --> 00:46:03,008
I don't have time for you anymore.

531
00:46:03,714 --> 00:46:06,417
The studio is about to close. What else do you need?

532
00:46:06,417 --> 00:46:08,834
The commercial is only one minute. You've been shooting all day.

533
00:46:08,834 --> 00:46:10,145
Let's end it now.

534
00:46:10,145 --> 00:46:12,054
Okay. You want to end it, huh?

535
00:46:12,054 --> 00:46:13,554
Yes.

536
00:46:16,622 --> 00:46:18,984
Guys, let's wrap up for today.

537
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:21,384
Thanks so much.

538
00:46:23,753 --> 00:46:27,299
I can end that, but not this.

539
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:34,410
[HOD Production]

540
00:46:35,581 --> 00:46:38,596
What's wrong with this signboard?

541
00:46:39,388 --> 00:46:45,275
I'm just wondering if I made the right call naming the company HOD Production.

542
00:46:45,275 --> 00:46:48,080
It reads like hod as in "shrinking."

543
00:46:48,768 --> 00:46:52,750
No, it reads like hod as in "gangster."

544
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:54,407
Shrinking.

545
00:46:54,407 --> 00:46:55,842
Don't get so caught up in it.

546
00:46:55,842 --> 00:46:57,437
Don't worry.

547
00:46:57,437 --> 00:47:01,982
Even if the sign shrinks, I won't.

548
00:47:01,982 --> 00:47:04,274
Big talk. We shall wait and see.

549
00:47:04,274 --> 00:47:06,902
- See what? Do you want to see it now?
- What are you doing?

550
00:47:06,902 --> 00:47:10,851
Just want to prove to you that my stuff doesn't shrink but it's all badass gangsta.

551
00:47:10,851 --> 00:47:12,866
- Keep it where it is.
- Come on.

552
00:47:18,257 --> 00:47:22,052
Sorry to interrupt. I can take a walk around the block with my girlfriend for an hour.

553
00:47:22,052 --> 00:47:23,548
No, you don't need to!

554
00:47:23,548 --> 00:47:25,495
No, don't do it for just one hour.

555
00:47:25,495 --> 00:47:28,597
Give us three hours. Take your time.

556
00:47:28,597 --> 00:47:31,828
Khai, Bone is here to edit some work. Let him stay.

557
00:47:31,828 --> 00:47:33,609
Fine.

558
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,110
[TWO22222]

559
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:42,236
Two is calling from over there.

560
00:47:42,236 --> 00:47:45,467
- Let's connect him to the projector.
- Let's go.

561
00:47:45,467 --> 00:47:47,711
I can't wait to find out if we won.

562
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:50,808
How's it going? Are they announcing it yet?

563
00:47:50,808 --> 00:47:52,821
No, but we're close.

564
00:47:52,821 --> 00:47:55,908
You guys ditched me, leaving me here all by myself.

565
00:47:55,908 --> 00:47:58,799
You're not there by yourself. P'Un is with you.

566
00:47:58,799 --> 00:48:01,539
Let me see.

567
00:48:01,539 --> 00:48:04,197
There he is.

568
00:48:06,359 --> 00:48:09,411
They're announcing the Commercial Film Award now.

569
00:48:12,877 --> 00:48:17,720
And the Best Commercial Film of the year is...

570
00:48:20,286 --> 00:48:22,338
"Theory of Love."

571
00:48:29,436 --> 00:48:31,445
Did we win?

572
00:48:33,542 --> 00:48:36,090
- Go up there.
- We won!

573
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:45,111
Wow, I'm so excited.

574
00:48:45,111 --> 00:48:47,083
Thank you, everybody.

575
00:48:47,083 --> 00:48:49,159
I'm from Thailand.

576
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,948
As you just won an international award,

577
00:48:56,948 --> 00:49:04,617
I'd like to ask what the inspiration was for you to come up with an ad about love that is so deep.

578
00:49:04,617 --> 00:49:08,666
In fact, it all began from our own story.

579
00:49:08,666 --> 00:49:10,777
Khai was in love.

580
00:49:10,777 --> 00:49:17,224
Looking at the content, you see that the character learns and grows little by little with time.

581
00:49:17,224 --> 00:49:19,493
It's like my view on love when I was young.

582
00:49:19,493 --> 00:49:22,468
I thought it was easy. It ends when you get the girl.

583
00:49:22,468 --> 00:49:24,114
That's the happy ending.

584
00:49:24,114 --> 00:49:31,538
As I got older, I've come to understand that keeping love alive is more important.

585
00:49:32,086 --> 00:49:36,999
I'm grateful for my loving relationship that has taught me this.

586
00:49:37,785 --> 00:49:42,877
Without that one person, this commercial wouldn't have been successful.

587
00:49:42,877 --> 00:49:46,509
Now I'm curious to see your inspiration, Khai.

588
00:49:47,168 --> 00:49:50,055
That person is not too far from here.

589
00:49:50,055 --> 00:49:52,579
They're my everything.

590
00:49:52,579 --> 00:49:56,949
They're my colleague, my advisor,

591
00:49:56,949 --> 00:49:58,857
my life partner.

592
00:49:58,857 --> 00:50:06,190
The fact that I founded the company with them has made me realize I've chosen the right one.

599
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:31,460
Our anniversary?

600
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:33,047
No.

601
00:50:33,047 --> 00:50:37,647
Is it the day we first kissed?

602
00:50:38,433 --> 00:50:40,139
No.

603
00:50:40,139 --> 00:50:43,934
The day we first moved here together?

604
00:50:43,934 --> 00:50:47,604
No, we just celebrated it not long ago.

605
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:55,240
Today is Third Day.

606
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:59,463
I used to look forward to this day

607
00:50:59,463 --> 00:51:02,776
because I'd get to shoot a movie review clip with you.

608
00:51:04,252 --> 00:51:05,708
Third,

609
00:51:06,582 --> 00:51:10,760
ever since we graduated, we haven't done any movie review.

610
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:16,817
Let's do it live tonight.

611
00:51:23,802 --> 00:51:28,225
Just setting up a camera brings all the memories back.

612
00:51:28,225 --> 00:51:32,839
From me asking him to sit in the background in the clip,

613
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:35,606
who would've thought that we would come this far,

614
00:51:35,606 --> 00:51:42,623
with him sitting beside me helping me review a film forever.

615
00:51:42,623 --> 00:51:50,074
And that's our review of "The Girl that Never Stops Laughing."

616
00:51:50,074 --> 00:51:54,042
It's a can't-miss film for all comedy fans out there.

617
00:51:54,042 --> 00:51:59,434
That's right. What movie you want us to review next or whatever you want us to do,

618
00:51:59,434 --> 00:52:01,967
leave us a comment.

619
00:52:01,967 --> 00:52:05,359
Let's check the comments and see what's out there.

620
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:12,244
Third, the girls want me to kiss you.

621
00:52:12,244 --> 00:52:14,708
Let's do it.

622
00:52:15,357 --> 00:52:16,903
No.

623
00:52:18,357 --> 00:52:21,525
And this is where we end our live show.

624
00:52:21,525 --> 00:52:24,368
See you next time. Goodbye.

625
00:52:24,368 --> 00:52:26,774
Bye. Say bye.

626
00:52:26,774 --> 00:52:28,431
Bye.

627
00:52:28,431 --> 00:52:29,622
Aren't we going to kiss?

628
00:52:29,622 --> 00:52:31,511
Turn off the camera first.

629
00:52:35,326 --> 00:52:39,086
Now that the camera is turned off, nobody can see us,

630
00:52:39,086 --> 00:52:40,956
can we kiss now?

631
00:52:40,956 --> 00:52:45,158
No, I want to take a shower. I feel sticky.

632
00:52:45,158 --> 00:52:51,420
No, I'm not letting you go anywhere until I kiss you.

633
00:53:24,011 --> 00:53:26,779
Why are we still getting comments?

634
00:53:26,779 --> 00:53:29,101
Don't tell me you didn't turn off the camera.

635
00:53:29,101 --> 00:53:30,359
Shit!

636
00:53:30,359 --> 00:53:34,719
I must have pushed the wrong button.

637
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:37,406
People just saw us kissing.

638
00:53:38,408 --> 00:53:41,819
You turn it off now. Push the button.

639
00:53:42,861 --> 00:53:44,935
I won't let you kiss me again.

640
00:53:44,935 --> 00:53:46,865
Do you think you can get away?

641
00:53:46,865 --> 00:53:49,497
No one can see us now.

642
00:53:49,497 --> 00:53:52,720
You can't get away from me. Come here, Third.

643
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,578
Come here.

644
00:53:54,578 --> 00:53:56,845
You won't get away.
