1
00:00:00,142 --> 00:00:01,833
I'd rather go back to the old way.

2
00:00:01,833 --> 00:00:03,480
Quick in, quick out.

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,107
No headache, unlike the nice ones.

4
00:00:06,107 --> 00:00:09,527
Can you please go somewhere else?

5
00:00:09,527 --> 00:00:11,604
I will move out of Khai's place.

6
00:00:11,604 --> 00:00:14,361
You can stay with me until you find a place.

7
00:00:14,361 --> 00:00:15,836
After today, I won't bring anyone home.

8
00:00:15,836 --> 00:00:17,312
I don't want what happened today to happen again.

9
00:00:17,312 --> 00:00:20,488
You need to interpret the meaning. Using movies to make a move.

10
00:00:20,488 --> 00:00:22,142
- So romantic.
- Really?

11
00:00:22,142 --> 00:00:25,227
With girls, I use my body. With you, I use my heart.

12
00:00:25,227 --> 00:00:26,680
You can't compare them.

13
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,301
Don't find a new place too quickly. Stay with me here for a while.

14
00:00:31,078 --> 00:00:32,407
So, what number did we get?

15
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:35,305
We got Booth No. 17 right in front of our building.

16
00:00:36,148 --> 00:00:38,279
What do the winners get in the Comm Arts Fair this year?

17
00:00:38,279 --> 00:00:40,063
The right to reserve the studio before anyone else.

18
00:00:40,063 --> 00:00:42,593
This year, I'll book the hell out of the studio.

19
00:00:42,593 --> 00:00:45,935
The seniors are really getting on my nerves with their attitude.

20
00:00:45,935 --> 00:00:47,556
I looked into it a bit.

21
00:00:47,556 --> 00:00:50,172
This year, the Faculty's "Princes" are selling stuff.

22
00:00:50,172 --> 00:00:51,991
Like beverages and meatballs, those sorts of things.

23
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:53,576
But the real contender is the booth right next to us.

24
00:00:53,576 --> 00:00:56,872
First-year girls' dunk tank led by Nong Pla,

25
00:00:56,872 --> 00:00:58,954
beautiful eyes and remarkable boobs.

26
00:00:58,954 --> 00:01:00,487
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

27
00:01:00,487 --> 00:01:03,232
I'll be at her booth all day then.

28
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:05,655
Go ahead.

29
00:01:05,655 --> 00:01:08,818
Oh, another worthy opponent... right across from us.

30
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:10,961
It's your beloved P'Un, Khai.

31
00:01:10,961 --> 00:01:14,184
I heard that he's gonna do a photo booth with his friends.

32
00:01:14,184 --> 00:01:18,759
I think girls will be all over his booth.

33
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:21,642
Shit, now we can't lose.

34
00:01:21,642 --> 00:01:24,103
What can we sell that's going to be brilliant?

35
00:01:31,101 --> 00:01:35,015
- How about the Gangsters' Film Review?
- What is it?

36
00:01:35,015 --> 00:01:38,095
If I told you, it'd be too long. Why don't I just show it to you?

37
00:01:38,095 --> 00:01:40,042
Come on, Khai. Let's do it.

38
00:01:41,457 --> 00:01:45,743
Hello. We're back once again at the Comm Arts Fair.

39
00:01:45,743 --> 00:01:48,904
Welcome to our Gangsters' booth.

40
00:01:48,904 --> 00:01:55,280
Let's meet our first unimportant guest, Khunphon.

41
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,350
Hello. Greetings.

42
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,603
Now let's hear the concept of our booth.

43
00:02:01,603 --> 00:02:08,367
We will review a film, gangsta style, without revealing the movie title.

44
00:02:08,367 --> 00:02:10,886
Khunphon will do the review.

45
00:02:10,886 --> 00:02:13,443
Anyone who guesses the title correctly will win a prize.

46
00:02:13,443 --> 00:02:16,385
Wrong answer means you get nothing.

47
00:02:16,385 --> 00:02:18,285
Let's start with the first one. Go.

48
00:02:18,285 --> 00:02:20,628
This film has recently been in the theater.

49
00:02:20,628 --> 00:02:23,217
It's a good...

50
00:02:23,217 --> 00:02:27,004
good-for-nothing kind of film. Those who have watched it consider it a waste of time.

51
00:02:27,004 --> 00:02:32,210
There's no conflict whatsoever... just an actor doing some jokes.

52
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,202
Don't even mention the climax because there's none.

53
00:02:34,202 --> 00:02:38,184
There's a twist but no logic to it.

54
00:02:38,184 --> 00:02:40,966
I can't wait to find out what movie this is.

55
00:02:40,966 --> 00:02:43,120
Khun Two, please give us the answer.

56
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,785
- Screw you.
- That's the wrong answer.

57
00:02:46,785 --> 00:02:50,699
That's not an answer. You are screwed. This is not a good idea.

58
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:52,922
- We need another idea.
- No good?

59
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:55,002
No good. Find a new idea.

60
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:02,916
I think we should just sell stuff like last year.

61
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,996
But that's not our signature. There's no story to it, you know?

62
00:03:05,996 --> 00:03:07,215
What shit story are you talking about?

63
00:03:07,215 --> 00:03:09,524
The focus is not on the stuff we sell, but on the looks of the seller.

64
00:03:09,524 --> 00:03:12,957
With me here, half of the girls will be at our booth.

65
00:03:12,957 --> 00:03:17,061
We can add some gimmicks to our products, like...

66
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:23,088
Eggs... Gangsta eggs, come and grab them.

67
00:03:23,088 --> 00:03:25,490
That's R-rated. The teachers won't let us do it.

68
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:26,785
What about bananas?

69
00:03:26,785 --> 00:03:30,001
Gangsta bananas, so ripe you can taste them.

70
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,870
That's no different, you perverts.

71
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,352
How about this? Sausages. Quite general.

72
00:03:36,352 --> 00:03:38,824
They come in 4 sizes: Small, short, long, jumbo.

73
00:03:38,824 --> 00:03:41,663
Whatever suits your appetite.

74
00:03:41,663 --> 00:03:43,767
This is a great idea. Let's sell sausages.

75
00:03:43,767 --> 00:03:46,112
I already have a plan on how we can sell them.

76
00:03:46,112 --> 00:03:48,801
Success guaranteed.

77
00:03:48,801 --> 00:03:52,510
Small. Short. Long. Jumbo.

78
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:29,180
[Theory of Love]

79
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:33,160
[Ep. 04: Crazy, Stupid, Love]

80
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,176
Welcome, everyone! Welcome!

81
00:05:35,176 --> 00:05:39,509
Our sausage booth, Gang-sa-ta, sells all kinds of sausages:

82
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:42,035
Small, short, jumbo, long.

83
00:05:42,035 --> 00:05:48,848
Our today's promotion is if you buy our sausages, you can do anything to us. Go ahead.

84
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:51,815
Go ahead.

85
00:05:51,815 --> 00:05:53,467
Take it easy, girls.

86
00:05:53,467 --> 00:05:56,259
Give me a light pinch on the cheek. That's right.

87
00:05:56,936 --> 00:05:58,839
Not choking!

88
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,632
She said, "Can you moan my name, please?"

89
00:06:06,687 --> 00:06:08,820
All done... my sausage.

90
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,830
Delicious!

91
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,339
Who wants my sausage?

92
00:06:16,055 --> 00:06:17,651
Here it is.

93
00:06:17,651 --> 00:06:20,357
My sausage. Who wants it?

94
00:06:21,401 --> 00:06:22,720
You.

95
00:06:23,499 --> 00:06:25,822
- Do you want me to feed you?
- Yes.

96
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,081
Take it easy.

97
00:06:28,923 --> 00:06:30,142
Want me to take a bite, too?

98
00:06:30,142 --> 00:06:32,253
It'd be like we indirectly kiss.

99
00:06:33,929 --> 00:06:34,995
One, please.

100
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:36,546
Sure thing.

101
00:06:36,546 --> 00:06:38,113
Can I ask you one thing?

102
00:06:38,113 --> 00:06:40,460
I bought your sausages for 300 baht.

103
00:06:41,021 --> 00:06:44,133
Of course... anything for a cute girl like you.

104
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:46,720
- Sing me a song.
- Sure.

105
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,940
♪ You're probably the only one who makes my heart stop ♪

106
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:53,960
♪ I'm lonely, and there's only one person who makes my heart... ♪

107
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:58,590
Seriously, can you be any flirtier than this?

108
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:03,515
You reminded me not to be flirty. But you're doing it ten times more.

109
00:07:05,762 --> 00:07:06,893
40 baht.

110
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:08,870
- How much?
- 40 baht, please.

111
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:12,608
I can't hear you very well. Can you say it to my ear, please?

112
00:07:12,608 --> 00:07:16,895
If you pretend not to hear again, I'll freaking eat it myself.

113
00:07:17,721 --> 00:07:19,567
Thank you.

114
00:07:23,938 --> 00:07:27,340
Although Khai's idea rakes in cash for our booth,

115
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:31,793
I can't deal with him being all flirty all day.

116
00:07:31,793 --> 00:07:35,531
Why do I have to have feelings for a douchebag like him?

117
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:43,783
Wait, excuse me.

118
00:07:43,783 --> 00:07:45,229
Are you guys leaving?

119
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:47,568
I haven't taken a photo with you yet.

120
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:51,022
No, we're having a bathroom break.

121
00:07:51,022 --> 00:07:54,333
How about this? While you wait for us,

122
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:58,642
spend some time at the photo booth over there.

123
00:07:58,642 --> 00:08:03,685
That booth seems a bit lonely.

124
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:07,950
- We'll be right back.
- Okay.

125
00:08:08,861 --> 00:08:10,918
Come on.

126
00:08:19,561 --> 00:08:23,692
We'd like to announce that our sausages have been sold out for today.

127
00:08:23,692 --> 00:08:27,273
Please come back to support our booth tomorrow.

128
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:31,015
With that, we're signing off. Goodbye!

129
00:08:33,338 --> 00:08:34,791
Let's pack up.

130
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:37,556
Guys, I did some checking.

131
00:08:37,556 --> 00:08:40,965
The poll right now suggests that we're no. 1.

132
00:08:40,965 --> 00:08:45,328
No. 1! Yay!

133
00:08:45,328 --> 00:08:49,809
But I feel bad for the dunk tank girls.

134
00:08:50,892 --> 00:08:53,458
Let me go and help them out.

135
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:56,785
That's none of your business. Help us pack up.

136
00:08:56,785 --> 00:08:58,397
I don't think we need to pack.

137
00:08:58,397 --> 00:09:02,498
Let's use this time to celebrate our no. 1 spot.

138
00:09:02,498 --> 00:09:08,044
We should ask the opposite booth that's so empty to take a photo of us to commemorate our victory.

139
00:09:08,044 --> 00:09:11,218
Because they look like they have nothing else to do.

140
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:14,128
That's enough. Don't be a child.

141
00:09:14,128 --> 00:09:15,612
Let's pack up and go home.

142
00:09:15,612 --> 00:09:17,281
I need to prepare stuff for tomorrow.

143
00:09:17,281 --> 00:09:19,000
Fine, let's go home.

144
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,280
But I didn't bring Chawee today.

145
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,624
Can I go with you?

146
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,690
Guys, are you really leaving?

147
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:31,878
You haven't visited my dunk tank booth.

148
00:09:31,878 --> 00:09:34,332
I'm just about to. Let's go.

149
00:09:34,332 --> 00:09:35,747
Hold on. Don't imagine things.

150
00:09:35,747 --> 00:09:42,162
- She asked me.
- She asked me.

151
00:09:42,162 --> 00:09:43,190
No point arguing.

152
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:46,050
- I'm not arguing.
- Let's ask her.

153
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:49,800
Bone already walked her back to her booth.

154
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,700
- Shit, Bone!
- Shit, Bone!

155
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:06,238
Third, you just passed your car.

156
00:10:07,457 --> 00:10:09,979
If you keep going, you'll reach Ayutthaya soon.

157
00:10:11,016 --> 00:10:13,298
I was just thinking about things.

158
00:10:13,956 --> 00:10:16,501
Why aren't you at the dunk tank booth?

159
00:10:16,501 --> 00:10:20,065
I was going to, but Two was being a sugar daddy.

160
00:10:20,065 --> 00:10:23,240
He paid 1,000 baht. That's why I'm here with you.

161
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,815
Open the car. Come on.

162
00:10:49,293 --> 00:10:51,109
Hey, man.

163
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:54,779
I'm so glad our booth was such a success today.

164
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,934
It's because I was the griller.

165
00:10:56,934 --> 00:10:58,992
Oh, yeah?

166
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,418
Fine, I give it to you.

167
00:11:02,734 --> 00:11:05,612
What's got into you? Why do you give in so easily?

168
00:11:05,612 --> 00:11:07,456
It's the joy of seeing P'Un's booth so empty.

169
00:11:07,456 --> 00:11:09,721
Recognizing your part in our success,

170
00:11:09,721 --> 00:11:13,028
I grant you one request.

171
00:11:13,028 --> 00:11:14,140
What did you say?

172
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:19,832
- I've done whatever the girls asked all day.
- I want to do one for you.

173
00:11:22,731 --> 00:11:24,744
Come on, before I change my mind.

174
00:11:24,744 --> 00:11:26,670
Fine...

175
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,412
I wonder...

176
00:11:28,412 --> 00:11:30,621
- Sing me a song.
- Huh?

177
00:11:30,621 --> 00:11:36,312
Why? You sang a lot of songs for the girls today. Would it kill you to sing just one for me?

178
00:11:36,312 --> 00:11:38,990
No, the vibe is not right.

179
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,136
Do it. You gave me your word.

180
00:11:41,136 --> 00:11:43,053
How about we listen to the radio?

181
00:11:43,053 --> 00:11:45,106
Fine, whatever.

182
00:11:48,904 --> 00:11:50,815
"Silly Fools." Do you know them?

183
00:11:50,815 --> 00:11:54,320
Of course. I was born in the same year as you.

184
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,927
I miss this song. Haven't heard it in a while.

185
00:11:56,927 --> 00:12:00,155
What are we waiting for? Sing it.

186
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,660
♪ Because no matter how high it is, you will reach it ♪

187
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,230
♪ There is no such thing as high ♪

188
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,080
♪ You can test it yourself, if you dare ♪

189
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:19,500
♪ However cold it is, I’ll push forward ♪

190
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:26,000
♪ If it’s fiercely hot, I’ll push through ♪

191
00:12:28,086 --> 00:12:33,998
My shirt is ruined. People wrote stuff all over it.

192
00:12:33,998 --> 00:12:36,908
Stop whining. I've got some on mine, too.

193
00:12:36,908 --> 00:12:38,930
Let me see.

194
00:12:39,496 --> 00:12:41,012
"I adore you, P'Third."

195
00:12:41,012 --> 00:12:42,583
"You're so cute."

196
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:45,592
"I have a crush on the griller." "Cute, cute, cute."

197
00:12:45,592 --> 00:12:50,679
Wow, there are a lot of "cutes" in there.

198
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:52,579
Because I am cute.

199
00:12:56,406 --> 00:12:59,904
You're right. You are cute.

200
00:13:01,226 --> 00:13:04,791
Don't sweet talk me like I'm the only one.

201
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:08,579
There are hundreds of cute people for you.

202
00:13:09,599 --> 00:13:13,805
No, only you are enough.

203
00:13:20,761 --> 00:13:22,278
What are you doing?

204
00:13:22,726 --> 00:13:24,778
Taking a shower.

205
00:13:24,778 --> 00:13:26,579
What's wrong with it?

206
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:34,179
Put this away.

207
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:27,070
[I like you]

208
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:44,830
[I like you]

209
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:52,720
Although Khai didn't sing me a song or be sweet like when he is hitting on a girl,

210
00:14:52,720 --> 00:15:00,212
just being near him like this is all I, a secret admirer, ever ask for.

211
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:12,003
If you're tired, go to sleep.

212
00:15:12,003 --> 00:15:16,038
You come to tend the shop after the fair. Such a hard worker.

213
00:15:16,038 --> 00:15:17,664
I love my work.

214
00:15:17,664 --> 00:15:20,778
I don't think you love your work.

215
00:15:20,778 --> 00:15:23,274
It's more like you're waiting for love here.

216
00:15:23,274 --> 00:15:25,278
Nonsense.

217
00:15:26,524 --> 00:15:29,443
It's 10:00 p.m. Please go home. I'll close it up.

218
00:15:29,443 --> 00:15:32,098
You'd better. I'm going.

219
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,512
- See you later.
- Goodnight.

220
00:15:50,692 --> 00:15:52,416
Are you closed?

221
00:15:53,095 --> 00:15:54,741
Paan.

222
00:15:54,741 --> 00:15:58,498
No, I'm just trying out the light and see if it's working.

223
00:15:59,168 --> 00:16:01,868
It's working fine.

224
00:16:01,868 --> 00:16:05,718
I've watched "My Best Friend's Wedding" that you gave.

225
00:16:05,718 --> 00:16:07,399
I liked it very much.

226
00:16:08,732 --> 00:16:13,878
Is there a hidden message in this movie?

227
00:16:15,496 --> 00:16:17,180
Message?

228
00:16:18,369 --> 00:16:20,178
What message?

229
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:26,913
A deep, indirect message for the audience. Something like that.

230
00:16:27,718 --> 00:16:29,114
I don't think so.

231
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:32,006
She loves her best friend.

232
00:16:32,006 --> 00:16:35,106
It's pretty direct. Nothing deep there.

233
00:16:36,977 --> 00:16:38,814
That's true.

234
00:16:39,484 --> 00:16:42,604
What do you want to watch today? Do you want a recommendation?

235
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:47,013
I want to see "Shape of Water." Do you have it?

236
00:16:47,013 --> 00:16:50,199
It's in the next room. Let me show you.

237
00:16:50,901 --> 00:16:52,301
Okay.

238
00:16:56,301 --> 00:16:59,908
Wow, you have a screening room here.

239
00:16:59,908 --> 00:17:04,305
Yes. I think a film is not created to be watched alone.

240
00:17:04,305 --> 00:17:07,994
When watched together, there's a kind of energy going around.

241
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:11,606
The emotions of the audience are linked up.

242
00:17:11,606 --> 00:17:16,762
Yes, it's more fun to watch as a group.

243
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,950
[MOVIE IN YARD: An open-air cinema at the 8th Nitade Fair, 20-21 June 2019] [Day 1: La Vita E Bella 7 PM, Hello Stranger 9 PM]
[Day 2: My Boyfriend 7 PM, Un Homme Et Une Femme 9 PM]

244
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:18,007
There's an outdoor movie screening during the Comm Arts Fair held by a university nearby.

245
00:18:18,007 --> 00:18:19,740
Do you want to go?

246
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:23,321
There's a great movie on the schedule.

247
00:18:23,321 --> 00:18:24,410
This one.

248
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:27,470
It's a French romance... very famous in the 60s.

249
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:31,659
It won many awards, including Cannes and Oscar.

250
00:18:31,659 --> 00:18:35,063
I've been wanting to see it, but it's not commonly available.

251
00:18:35,063 --> 00:18:38,920
I bet. I can't even pronounce the title.

252
00:18:42,532 --> 00:18:44,318
Do you want to see it together?

253
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,224
I mean seeing it as a group.

254
00:18:51,224 --> 00:18:56,933
Like you said, when watched as a group, the emotions are linked up.

255
00:18:56,933 --> 00:19:00,299
And you'll have someone to discuss it with.

256
00:19:01,899 --> 00:19:03,507
You're right.

257
00:19:04,317 --> 00:19:09,057
How about we meet at 9:00 p.m. tomorrow in front of the Comm Arts building?

258
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,580
Sure.

259
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:33,023
Please stop by at our sausage booth.

260
00:19:33,023 --> 00:19:34,818
Sausage, anyone?

261
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:40,083
Where did all the girls go? What's happening?

262
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,058
Look at P'Un's booth.

263
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,253
Next, please.

264
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:50,108
Guys.

265
00:19:51,883 --> 00:19:54,640
Fucking P'Un is taking photos by himself.

266
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,703
That's why all the girls are all over that booth.

267
00:20:03,608 --> 00:20:05,476
Just because he's taking photos by himself?

268
00:20:05,476 --> 00:20:10,966
Not just that. He sends the photos instantly via Line.

269
00:20:11,516 --> 00:20:14,379
- I'll send it to you.
- He's smart.

270
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,893
The girls cannot follow up with us.

271
00:20:16,893 --> 00:20:19,666
But they can with him.

272
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:23,652
No, I did some digging. He's not using his personal account.

273
00:20:23,652 --> 00:20:26,145
He created a new account just to lure these girls.

274
00:20:26,145 --> 00:20:29,612
What should we do? If this continues, we'll be in trouble.

275
00:20:30,302 --> 00:20:31,953
Don't worry.

276
00:20:31,953 --> 00:20:35,406
I'll teach him that he's messing with the wrong crowd.

277
00:20:44,181 --> 00:20:45,831
Where is he going?

278
00:20:45,831 --> 00:20:47,408
Who knows?

279
00:20:48,015 --> 00:20:50,350
Welcome to our booth.

280
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,988
We sell all kinds of sausages.

281
00:20:51,988 --> 00:20:54,453
A new promotion for today.

282
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:57,970
If you pay 200, you can cheek-kiss the person who feeds you for free.

283
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,960
Come on.

284
00:21:01,018 --> 00:21:03,923
Hey, do you really think this is going to work?

285
00:21:03,923 --> 00:21:07,007
What kind of girl would want to kiss us?

286
00:21:09,315 --> 00:21:10,827
Hello.

287
00:21:11,691 --> 00:21:13,527
Are you guys opened?

288
00:21:13,527 --> 00:21:16,225
I'd like to buy sausages for 2,000 baht, please.

289
00:21:17,285 --> 00:21:19,507
Wow, 2,000.

290
00:21:19,507 --> 00:21:21,839
- Not bad for a starter.
- Thank you.

291
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:23,498
10 times.

292
00:21:25,393 --> 00:21:28,006
Let's start with my friend.

293
00:21:28,006 --> 00:21:31,839
Bone, I'm going to get started on the sausages.

294
00:21:33,707 --> 00:21:36,316
He's our top-of-the-line product.

295
00:21:36,316 --> 00:21:37,488
Are you ready?

296
00:21:37,488 --> 00:21:38,880
Go.

297
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,891
- Start!
- One...

298
00:21:41,891 --> 00:21:43,609
Two...

299
00:21:43,609 --> 00:21:45,709
Three...

300
00:21:45,709 --> 00:21:47,805
Four...

301
00:21:47,805 --> 00:21:51,033
- Five...
- Let's move to another side.

302
00:21:51,033 --> 00:21:52,891
Six...

303
00:21:52,891 --> 00:21:54,490
Seven...

304
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,110
Come on!

305
00:21:56,986 --> 00:21:59,264
You are so cute. Can I take a photo with you?

306
00:21:59,264 --> 00:22:01,064
Sure thing.

307
00:22:02,858 --> 00:22:04,210
Hey, hey.

308
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:08,420
Hey. The sausages are burning. Hey! The sausages are burning.

309
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:11,018
Shit! I'm so sorry.

310
00:22:34,076 --> 00:22:35,879
Are you out of it?

311
00:22:37,413 --> 00:22:38,738
Here, have a bite.

312
00:22:38,738 --> 00:22:41,375
You haven't eaten anything all day.

313
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:43,305
Eat some so you'll have some energy.

314
00:22:44,631 --> 00:22:46,379
I'm not hungry.

315
00:22:46,379 --> 00:22:47,879
Hold on.

316
00:22:49,365 --> 00:22:52,398
Even though you're not hungry, you need to eat.

317
00:22:52,398 --> 00:22:56,707
The break is almost over. Let me feed you.

318
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:13,425
More.

319
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:15,670
That's enough.

320
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:18,952
Are you sure? Just a bite left. Eat it.

321
00:23:19,674 --> 00:23:22,179
That's fine. I'll eat it then.

322
00:23:23,579 --> 00:23:26,614
Why would you do that? I just had a bite.

323
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:30,108
That's fine. Your saliva doesn't repulse me.

What are you looking at me for? Give it to me.

According to the rule, you ate the sausage.

You'll have to give me a kiss on the cheek.

328
00:23:52,273 --> 00:23:53,668
What kind of sick game are you playing?

329
00:23:53,668 --> 00:23:56,681
I'm not playing. I'm a man of my word.

330
00:23:56,681 --> 00:23:59,408
A rule is a rule.

I just fed you. Come on.

Our break is over.

335

Let's go back to the sausages.

Bye. See you later.

The image files that you sent are invalid.

What? My files are invalid?

00:24:39,814 --> 00:24:42,098
Yes, I'll be waiting for the valid files.

Yes, Professor. I'll resend them as soon as I can.

Third, do you have a charger?

No.

I need to submit my work to the professor right now.

346

What do I do?

347
00:25:07,911 --> 00:25:09,890
There's one booth that has it.

348
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,490
Which one?

349
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:14,605

You already have a dark skin. Don't let your heart be dark, too.

I brought Nong Pla here earlier.

354
00:25:38,281 --> 00:25:40,854
So? I'm not letting you use it.

355
00:25:40,854 --> 00:25:42,720
Do you think I have to rely on you that much?

356
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,348
I can just go to the building. Someone will lend it to me.

357
00:25:45,348 --> 00:25:49,000
So, go. I'm not letting you use it.

You idiot. You're charging it at P'Un's booth.

That's right. I forgot.

I'll be back.

Guys, do you want to see the movie in the yard?

382
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:47,479
There's "My Girl" and a French film.

383
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:49,479
Un homme or something?

384
00:27:49,479 --> 00:27:51,333
Yeah.

385
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:55,647
- How did you know?
- There's a poster at my coffee shop.

386

You guys go ahead. I need to go to the coffee shop.

I need to go now. Need to feed the fish.

- I have to go, too.

- See you guys.
- Bye.

392

Why are you standing there? Don't you have a date to go to with some girl?

393
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,804
I don't have a date with a girl.

394
00:28:19,804 --> 00:28:21,623
But I have one with you.

395
00:28:21,623 --> 00:28:24,114
I'm seeing the movie in the yard with you.

396
00:28:30,492 --> 00:28:35,389
Is it just in my head or is he flirting with me hard?

397
00:28:35,389 --> 00:28:38,293
He may be doing it as a friend without any benefit.

398
00:28:38,293 --> 00:28:43,609
But for me, my heart is practically jumping out of my chest.

399

One, don't write down "My Girl" that we're about to watch.

Third, what did you write down?

00:30:08,859 --> 00:30:10,441
Why would I tell you?

415
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:14,979
I wrote down "One Day." You?

00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:18,916
Liar, you didn't write down that one.

Don't guess.

There are only two winners who wrote down the same film.

440
00:32:25,482 --> 00:32:28,912
The first one is...

441
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:33,692
Techaphon, third-year Comm Arts.

442
00:32:35,612 --> 00:32:38,094
Don't just sit here. Go up there.

443
00:32:50,921 --> 00:32:53,953
You must be wondering about the second winner.

444
00:32:53,953 --> 00:32:56,116
The winner is...

445
00:32:56,116 --> 00:33:00,110
Khunphon, also a third-year Comm Arts.

446
00:33:03,846 --> 00:33:08,773
The film that both wrote down was "Flipped."

447
00:33:08,773 --> 00:33:10,447
Let me ask them a question.

448
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:13,099
Why did you choose "Flipped"?

449
00:33:16,882 --> 00:33:22,951
I like how it tells the story of the relationship and emotions of the lead characters.

450
00:33:22,951 --> 00:33:26,300
First, they have different opinions.

451
00:33:26,975 --> 00:33:30,301
But they eventually are on the same page.

452
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:39,583
I like how the female lead has an unrequited love for the male.

453
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:43,860
But in the end he comes around and pursues her.

454
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,364
That's just your opinion.

455
00:33:45,364 --> 00:33:53,298
I think it may seem like any other romantic film, but it is special.

456
00:33:54,983 --> 00:33:56,621
That's right.

457
00:33:56,621 --> 00:33:59,446
Although there are gaps in this movie,

458
00:33:59,446 --> 00:34:04,807
but if you watch it with your heart, I still like it anyway.

459
00:34:07,255 --> 00:34:09,258
I like it, too.

00:35:41,158 --> 00:35:43,458
I mean "Flipped."

483
00:35:44,151 --> 00:35:46,607
You don't like that film.

484
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:51,359
You're right... I don't.

485
00:35:52,257 --> 00:35:55,059
But I know it's your favorite film.

486
00:35:55,889 --> 00:35:57,508
So?

487
00:35:58,664 --> 00:36:01,061
I wanted to match your answer.

488
00:36:02,568 --> 00:36:04,975
Over the course of the three-year friendship,

489
00:36:04,975 --> 00:36:09,666
Khai and I fight many times because we have different opinions.

490
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:13,334
This is the first time he deliberately sided with my idea.

491
00:36:13,334 --> 00:36:17,312
It's like he's saying he knows me so well.

492
00:36:17,312 --> 00:36:23,009
Is it possible that the story of me and him will turn out like "Flipped"?

493
00:36:23,009 --> 00:36:26,189
It starts out from two people having different opinions,

494
00:36:26,189 --> 00:36:31,819
but it ends with them being on the same page, especially in the matter of love.

495
00:36:31,819 --> 00:36:33,690
The next film is about to start.

496
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:36,907
For those who have the tickets, please go in.

497
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,898
Nong Gangsta, do you have tickets?

498
00:36:42,898 --> 00:36:44,895
I do. I'm just waiting for someone.

499
00:36:44,895 --> 00:36:46,765
Okay.

500
00:36:58,805 --> 00:37:02,418
Thank you very much.

501
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,298
Have a safe trip home.

502
00:37:06,298 --> 00:37:08,437
Thanks.

503
00:37:53,298 --> 00:37:55,526
This is not my laptop.

504
00:38:02,956 --> 00:38:06,705
Third, where does P'Un live?

505
00:38:12,186 --> 00:38:13,900
I'm sorry.

506
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,686
- See you later.
- Are you into Lynn?

507
00:38:18,384 --> 00:38:19,742
Did you look at my laptop?

508
00:38:19,742 --> 00:38:21,804
I needed to look to see whose it was.

509
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,284
You haven't answered me. Do you have feelings for Lynn?

510
00:38:28,284 --> 00:38:29,654
Don't just say crazy stuff.

511
00:38:29,654 --> 00:38:31,271
I just took photos of her for the class.

512
00:38:31,271 --> 00:38:32,910
I studied photography.

513
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:36,279
I can tell that you have feelings for Lynn.

514
00:38:36,909 --> 00:38:40,579
You do know that she has a boyfriend. Right?

515
00:38:41,483 --> 00:38:45,181
He is my best friend, Phon.

516
00:38:48,652 --> 00:38:50,104
Hey!

517
00:38:51,232 --> 00:38:54,018
I don't want to cross the line,

518
00:38:54,018 --> 00:38:56,104
but I think you should get over her.

519
00:38:56,852 --> 00:38:59,268
Why should I? I came first.

520
00:38:59,268 --> 00:39:01,358
I've had a crush on her since high school.

521
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:05,004
Have you ever told her that?

522
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:27,138
Third, help me with this.

523
00:39:27,138 --> 00:39:28,415
No.

524
00:39:28,415 --> 00:39:30,463
Why not?

525
00:39:30,463 --> 00:39:32,590
I'll smell really good afterward.

526
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:34,540
But I'm not going to smell you or anything.

527
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,729
Apply first and smell later.

528
00:39:36,729 --> 00:39:39,107
This is for the sake of your nose.

529
00:39:40,049 --> 00:39:42,628
No? That's fine.

530
00:39:42,628 --> 00:39:45,859
I'll do this for the sake of my nose. Turn your back to me.

531
00:39:46,962 --> 00:39:48,562
No?

532
00:39:55,531 --> 00:39:57,501
Turn around.

533
00:40:00,476 --> 00:40:04,218
Should we use the prizes that we received today?

534
00:40:04,218 --> 00:40:05,687
What's got into you?

535
00:40:05,687 --> 00:40:08,503
I'm in the mood to redeem the prizes.

536
00:40:12,432 --> 00:40:13,917
Is it a yes?

537
00:40:14,859 --> 00:40:16,370
Are you sure?

[ICON: Cineconic]

539
00:40:19,123 --> 00:40:23,306
Khai, you can't be late for a movie every time.

540
00:40:24,473 --> 00:40:26,325
Here I am.

541
00:40:26,325 --> 00:40:29,999
Here's cheese popcorn that you like.

542
00:40:31,926 --> 00:40:35,049
I'm sorry. The queue was long.

543
00:40:35,049 --> 00:40:36,392
Am I dreaming?

544
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:39,738
You're here on time, and you got me some popcorn.

545
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,808
Are you dreaming?

546
00:40:42,808 --> 00:40:46,217
- What are you doing?
- Checking if you're dreaming.

547
00:40:46,868 --> 00:40:48,124
Idiot.

548
00:40:48,124 --> 00:40:49,814
Did you get the tickets?

549
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:51,598
We don't need the tickets.

550
00:40:51,598 --> 00:40:53,689
Come on, I want to see the trailers.

551
00:40:53,689 --> 00:40:55,741
Come! Hurry!

552
00:41:04,693 --> 00:41:07,853
Khai, are you sure this is the right theater?

553
00:41:07,853 --> 00:41:12,539
Of course. This is the prize. A private theater just for us.

554
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:14,058
Come here.

555
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,619
This is weird.

556
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:25,511
There's nothing between us and the screen.

557
00:41:25,511 --> 00:41:29,619
I think this is great.

What are you doing?

00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,560
I'm cold.

560
00:41:50,193 --> 00:41:52,550
Actually, this is kinda nice.

561
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:55,475
Can I stay like this for the rest of the movie?

562
00:41:55,475 --> 00:41:57,690
Am I really dreaming?

563
00:41:57,690 --> 00:42:00,729
Shit, I don't want to ever wake up.

564
00:42:00,729 --> 00:42:03,198
I hope the movie doesn't end soon.

565
00:42:09,446 --> 00:42:11,016
The film was great.

566
00:42:11,016 --> 00:42:13,585
I really like a movie with an open ending.

Huh? Oh, yeah.

What's with you? Are you still trying to unravel the film?

571
00:42:24,029 --> 00:42:25,499
Me, too.

572
00:42:25,499 --> 00:42:28,001
There's no closure there.

573
00:42:28,001 --> 00:42:30,201
Yeah, that.

574

He's not showing anything.

645
00:47:57,363 --> 00:48:00,103
Maybe he's the kind that keeps his feelings inside.

646
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:03,933
I flirted, I asked him to kiss me on the cheek.

647
00:48:03,933 --> 00:48:05,997
I let him ride Chawee.

648
00:48:05,997 --> 00:48:09,120
I even sang him a song in the restaurant.

649
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,011
If it were somebody else, they'd be all undressed and ready to bang.

650
00:48:11,011 --> 00:48:13,519
- Oh, yeah?
- What do you think?

651
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:18,115
Fuck! Now, it's time to wake up from the dream.

652
00:48:25,262 --> 00:48:27,565
Can I stay like this for the rest of the movie?

653
00:48:27,565 --> 00:48:31,919
I flirted, I asked him to kiss me on the cheek.

654
00:48:31,919 --> 00:48:34,305
Our break is over.

655
00:48:34,305 --> 00:48:36,706
Let's go back to the sausages.

656
00:48:37,633 --> 00:48:39,591
I let him ride Chawee.

657
00:48:39,591 --> 00:48:43,359
I even sang him a song in the restaurant.

658
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:51,075
I forgot what an asshole he was during the three years that I've known him.

659
00:48:51,075 --> 00:48:54,782
He's spoiled. He gets what he wants.

660
00:48:54,782 --> 00:48:59,017
He doesn't care if others' feelings are hurt.

661
00:48:59,017 --> 00:49:03,559
This is Khai, the friend I having feelings for.

662
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:09,500
Now, I don't even want to be friends with him anymore.

663
00:49:24,678 --> 00:49:28,895
I feel like the four of us are not as close as we used to be.

664
00:49:28,895 --> 00:49:30,106
Do you have a hangover?

665
00:49:30,106 --> 00:49:31,467
I'm a heavyweight.

666
00:49:31,467 --> 00:49:33,033
I'm moving to Two's place.

667
00:49:33,033 --> 00:49:35,487
Third, what's wrong with you? Just tell me.

668
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:37,940
Did Khai and Bone join hands to dupe you?

669
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:39,763
I'd be pissed, too.

670
00:49:39,763 --> 00:49:41,196
I love you, Som.

671
00:49:41,196 --> 00:49:43,307
After he had you, he'd dump you in no time.

672
00:49:43,307 --> 00:49:45,007
Third, you asshole.

673
00:49:45,007 --> 00:49:46,526
- You're an asshole.
- You're fucking nosy.

674
00:49:46,526 --> 00:49:48,726
Fucking hell.

675
00:49:48,726 --> 00:49:50,390
Third.

676
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:56,159
Thanks for pointing out Khai's biggest flaw.

677
00:49:57,407 --> 00:50:00,087
Third...
