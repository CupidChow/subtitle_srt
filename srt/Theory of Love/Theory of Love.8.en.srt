Go back to Third.

Do what you want now.

3
00:00:02,837 --> 00:00:04,852
- So, what are you gonna do next?
- I'm going to chase after Third.

4
00:00:04,852 --> 00:00:08,167
I have this lovely friend right next to me, but how come I never noticed?

5
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:10,909
People who've come to audition are so nice.

6
00:00:10,909 --> 00:00:15,825
I want someone who does shitty things to hurt people without feeling any remorse.

7
00:00:15,825 --> 00:00:17,256
Who could it be?

8
00:00:17,256 --> 00:00:18,854
What grade did you get for acting?

9
00:00:18,854 --> 00:00:24,536
If you say 90% of guys are players, I might just be the other 10%.

10
00:00:24,536 --> 00:00:26,377
P'Shane, Khai went off script.

11
00:00:26,377 --> 00:00:30,625
He took it beyond the script. This is exactly the bad-guy male lead that I want.

12
00:00:31,411 --> 00:00:34,565
Acting isn't just something everyone can do.

13
00:00:34,565 --> 00:00:40,553
It takes concentration, interpretation, and imagination to communicate your point across.

14
00:00:40,553 --> 00:00:44,704
Today, I will give you the basics of those things.

15
00:00:44,704 --> 00:00:48,784
We'll start with imagination by doing something easy.

16
00:00:48,784 --> 00:00:52,062
You have a pen and paper in your hands.

17
00:00:52,062 --> 00:00:53,962
Let's start with the first activity.

18
00:00:53,962 --> 00:00:58,273
I want you to draw something according to what I say.

19
00:00:58,273 --> 00:01:00,170
For example, I say bear.

20
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,510
You don't need to draw a bear.

21
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,912
It can be a big person that you know.

22
00:01:07,912 --> 00:01:09,560
Got it?

23
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,350
All right, let's start.

24
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,789
The first word is...

25
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:15,513
"home."

26
00:01:23,555 --> 00:01:24,969
Time's up.

27
00:01:24,969 --> 00:01:27,473
Let me see, Khai. What did you draw?

28
00:01:27,473 --> 00:01:29,079
Here it is.

29
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:33,074
What is this?

30
00:01:33,074 --> 00:01:36,526
This is Chawee, my dear motorbike.

31
00:01:36,526 --> 00:01:38,449
Chawee. Is this really a bike?

32
00:01:38,449 --> 00:01:42,678
I thought it was a grasshopper.

33
00:01:45,287 --> 00:01:49,688
If she wasn't a girl, I'd come down hard on her.

34
00:01:49,688 --> 00:01:53,043
Why do I need to spend my time doing this?

35
00:01:53,043 --> 00:01:57,642
I got the role of the protagonist, thinking I'd get closer to Third.

36
00:01:58,761 --> 00:02:02,879
The second word is "star."

37
00:02:04,362 --> 00:02:06,258
Paramount Pictures.

38
00:02:06,258 --> 00:02:09,948
The third word is "soulmate."

39
00:02:12,813 --> 00:02:15,531
This is a mate of my soul.

40
00:02:15,531 --> 00:02:19,212
The last one is "clock."

41
00:02:35,394 --> 00:02:37,460
Time is up. Are you guys done?

42
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,248
All done?

43
00:02:39,248 --> 00:02:40,441
Good.

44
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:44,836
I need a bit more time. I'm almost done.

45
00:02:44,836 --> 00:02:50,225
Okay, let's start with the person who just finished, Khai.

46
00:02:51,917 --> 00:02:54,579
What is this?

47
00:02:55,568 --> 00:02:57,179
Third.

48
00:02:58,508 --> 00:03:01,545
Why is Third your clock?

49
00:03:02,407 --> 00:03:10,860
Third is my best friend in my past, present, and future.

50
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,834
Wow, you really love your best friend.

51
00:03:14,834 --> 00:03:18,506
If it were me, I'd use this as a pick-up line.

52
00:03:18,506 --> 00:03:20,517
Don't you think?

53
00:03:20,517 --> 00:03:25,159
Next, do you have anything to say about your friend?

54
00:03:26,356 --> 00:03:28,767
A teacher? Why?

55
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:40,756
Third! Third! Third!

56

00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:45,946
No, I have somewhere to be.

Why are you following me?

You're here to buy groceries to make dinner, so I want to help you.

How about this? This is good.

You let me shop by myself all the time.

Do you have so much free time?

71
00:06:10,054 --> 00:06:12,314
Why don't you use it to rehearse the script?

00:13:01,075 --> 00:13:03,839
As I am your senior...

166
00:13:05,191 --> 00:13:07,539
and you're Third's best friend,

167
00:13:10,054 --> 00:13:12,040
I'm asking you, Khai,

168
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:18,714
let Un try to win Third's heart.

169
00:13:28,038 --> 00:13:30,747
Cheers.

170
00:13:41,131 --> 00:13:42,979
Two, what are you looking for?

171
00:13:43,767 --> 00:13:45,545
Are you looking for Lynn?

172
00:13:45,545 --> 00:13:49,190
Jerk, I'm just looking to see if anyone else is coming.

173
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:53,966
Don't act innocent. Everybody knows you have a crush on Lynn.

174
00:13:57,851 --> 00:14:00,050
Shit, she's here.

175
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:04,775
Hey, Lynn! You're here. I missed you.

176
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:16,297
If you're going to look at her this hard, let me help you.

177
00:14:17,976 --> 00:14:20,768
- Lynn!
- Hey, Ko. Long time so nee.

178
00:14:20,768 --> 00:14:23,489
- How have you been?
- Fine.

179
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:26,736
There's space next to Two. Have a seat.

180
00:14:26,736 --> 00:14:28,754
- Okay, but aren't you sitting there?
- I'm going to the bathroom.

181
00:14:28,754 --> 00:14:31,481
- Okay.
- Hi, Toey.

182
00:14:33,757 --> 00:14:36,376
You look hot, girl.

183
00:14:38,797 --> 00:14:40,474
How have you been?

184

Somjade, you're an oppa now.

Hey, Two. How are you?

187
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:53,378
Hi, Lynn.

188
00:14:53,378 --> 00:14:55,820
You can say hi to me any time.

189
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,290
Do you want water?

190
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,297
Water is fine.

196
00:15:32,623 --> 00:15:35,034
Lynn, don't try to get out of this one.

197
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,200
You have a boyfriend, so drink up.

198
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,936
Come on, bottoms up.

199
00:15:44,305 --> 00:15:46,033
Come on.

200
00:15:46,033 --> 00:15:50,039
I... I just broke up with P'Phon.

201
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:52,725
Really?

202
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,625
Are you okay?

203
00:15:59,204 --> 00:16:01,225
Seriously, are you okay?

204
00:16:04,542 --> 00:16:06,288
You drink up.

205
00:16:18,321 --> 00:16:22,497
You can give me a lift to the main street.

206
00:16:22,497 --> 00:16:25,226
I will take a taxi to my condo.

207
00:16:25,226 --> 00:16:29,225
That's fine. Our condos are quite near anyway.

208
00:16:39,242 --> 00:16:41,079
Let's put on some music.

209
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:51,210
♫ The pain that I still feel, the pain that I still regret ♫

210
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:55,320
♫ It hurts that I still love you. There's still only you ♫

211
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,390
♫ I want to take care of you but I— ♫

212
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:05,550
♫ Tell your heart to just take a rest if you're tired
If he doesn't love you, that's enough ♫

213
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:08,550
♫ No need to expect him, no need to sit for him— ♫

216
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:28,295
Why is it that there's only sad music on the radio?

217
00:17:28,295 --> 00:17:30,799
That's okay. I can listen to it.

218

Lynn.

219
00:17:41,214 --> 00:17:43,180
Can I ask you...

220
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:47,050
what happened?

221
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:50,059
Did P'Phon go back to spending all his time with his friends?

222
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,160
He said...

223
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,680
he didn't love me anymore.

224
00:18:06,862 --> 00:18:09,428
He said he's tired of me...

225
00:18:11,074 --> 00:18:15,624
even though I'm the same person as the one he liked.

226
00:18:21,672 --> 00:18:24,001
Is it possible, Two,

227
00:18:24,998 --> 00:18:31,259
that something that he used to like so much can turn into something he's tired of?

228
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:37,919
How should I behave?

229
00:18:40,106 --> 00:18:42,629
I don't get it.

230
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,337

231
00:19:15,866 --> 00:19:18,885

Open the door for me.

Lynn! Lynn!

235
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:33,959
What are you doing here?

236
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,911
I went to the bar around here, so I stopped by to get my things.

237
00:19:37,911 --> 00:19:39,599
Open the door for me.

238
00:19:40,425 --> 00:19:41,865
It's late.

239
00:19:41,865 --> 00:19:44,795
I think you should come again tomorrow when you're sober.

240
00:19:44,795 --> 00:19:46,559
This is none of your business.

241
00:19:47,743 --> 00:19:49,948
Are you the person who took her photos?

242
00:19:49,948 --> 00:19:52,719
You had an eye on her since when she was with me.

243

What the hell are you talking about?

244
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,917
You just sneaked off to get some. Right?

245
00:20:01,622 --> 00:20:05,559
I shouldn't have felt guilty breaking up with you.

Apologize to her now.

251
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,615
You dumped her and then you treated her like shit?

252
00:20:24,615 --> 00:20:25,905
How can Lynn be tiring?

253
00:20:25,905 --> 00:20:27,182
You just dumped her for no reason.

254
00:20:27,182 --> 00:20:28,409
What did I tell you?

255
00:20:28,409 --> 00:20:30,360
That's enough!

256
00:20:40,011 --> 00:20:43,230
Don't scream. I'd fear it, too.

257
00:20:43,899 --> 00:20:47,159
See? All done, and it didn't hurt at all.

258
00:20:52,488 --> 00:20:57,179
Lynn, I'm sorry for causing this mess.

259
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:03,285
You don't need to apologize. You helped me. I should thank you.

260
00:21:03,285 --> 00:21:05,779
Really?

261
00:21:07,672 --> 00:21:11,303
Thanks, Two. If you weren't here, I'd be in so much trouble.

262
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,665
One more.

Yes.

267
00:21:33,774 --> 00:21:35,900
No wonder why he's hanging around Third all the time.

268
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,261
He's like "nong gangsta" this and "nong gangsta" that.

269
00:21:38,261 --> 00:21:40,662
All I want is to kick him in the nuts.

270
00:21:40,662 --> 00:21:44,439
How can you? That's P'Un, the Faculty's King.

271
00:21:44,439 --> 00:21:47,538
So what? I'm the all-around gangsta.

272
00:21:47,538 --> 00:21:50,326
- I can get any girl I want.
- What does he have that's better than me?

273
00:21:50,326 --> 00:21:51,950
Everything.

274
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:56,139
He's richer. He does his work better.

Yes. To work on the play.

When did I shoot this?

491
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:14,848
I need to take a shit. Watch my camera.

492
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,974
Nong gangsta, the love confession scene that you rewrote...

493
00:39:23,974 --> 00:39:27,639
It's awesome. Did you write it by yourself?

494
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:30,133
Yes, I was just winging it.

495
00:39:30,133 --> 00:39:32,189
I don't think so.

496
00:39:32,189 --> 00:39:35,711
I think you understand the feelings of someone with a secret crush.

497
00:39:35,711 --> 00:39:38,832
I've had my fair share of experience.

498
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:43,542
Did I break open an old wound?

499
00:39:43,542 --> 00:39:47,197
That's fine. It doesn't hurt anymore.

500
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:54,882
Hey, I've read somewhere that says

501
00:39:54,882 --> 00:40:00,253
in order to forget your old love, you need to find a person who loves you.

502
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:06,580
I think you will. I'm here for you.

503
00:40:09,757 --> 00:40:12,129
I don't want to be dumb anymore.

504
00:40:12,789 --> 00:40:18,028
The only way to forget about your old love is to find someone who loves you.

505
00:40:36,423 --> 00:40:39,476
Bone, have you seen Khai?

506
00:40:39,476 --> 00:40:41,065
No, what's the matter?

507
00:40:41,065 --> 00:40:43,808
He ditched the rehearsal. He didn't pick up the phone.

508
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:45,117
If you see him, let me know.

509
00:40:45,117 --> 00:40:46,717
Okay.

510
00:40:55,272 --> 00:40:58,759
Can you tell me now what happened?

511
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,605
I think I will quit the play.

512
00:41:11,605 --> 00:41:13,337
Why?

513
00:41:14,536 --> 00:41:19,803
I can't get over seeing Third and P'Un getting close.

514
00:41:19,803 --> 00:41:21,537
It freaking hurts.

515
00:41:25,808 --> 00:41:28,629
Do you want me to tell Third that you're quitting?

516
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:31,542
That's all right.

517
00:41:31,542 --> 00:41:35,029
I'll talk to him, but thanks.

518
00:42:29,474 --> 00:42:32,690
What? They kiss and it ends?

519
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:34,840
That's not a peak moment.

520
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:38,737
It's good that they kiss.What else would you expect them to do?

521
00:42:38,737 --> 00:42:41,335
They need to get laid.

522
00:42:42,066 --> 00:42:45,146
If you need to get laid, go back to your room.

523
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:49,927
If you wrote the script, what would be the ending?

524
00:42:51,241 --> 00:42:55,119
They kiss and look at each other's eyes.

525
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:58,166
So cliché.

526
00:42:58,166 --> 00:43:00,239
It's called a classic.

527
00:43:01,022 --> 00:43:05,128
When you kiss someone you love, don't you like it?

528
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:08,028
I don't know.

529
00:43:08,028 --> 00:43:12,829
Ask me again when I'm actually in love with someone.

530
00:43:15,122 --> 00:43:19,071
If I told you I want to find out what the answer is,

531
00:43:19,071 --> 00:43:21,226
would I be so bad?

532
00:43:26,072 --> 00:43:29,420
I know what I did to you was a colossal dick move.

533
00:43:30,284 --> 00:43:35,024
But I just want another chance to make it better.

534
00:43:35,024 --> 00:43:36,819
Is that possible?

535
00:43:53,284 --> 00:43:55,757
Third, listen to me.

536
00:43:55,757 --> 00:43:57,203
What do you take me for?

537
00:43:57,203 --> 00:43:58,188
Third.

538
00:43:58,188 --> 00:44:00,892
I'm not just someone whom you can do this to.

539
00:44:00,892 --> 00:44:01,987
Please listen to me.

540
00:44:01,987 --> 00:44:03,650
Shut up!

541
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:06,960
Get out and stop treating me like shit.

542
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,171
You're already disgusting to me.

543
00:44:09,171 --> 00:44:12,545
Get out. I don't want to see your face again.

544
00:44:12,545 --> 00:44:14,260
I told you to get out.

545
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:16,128
Get out!

546
00:44:16,128 --> 00:44:17,834
Get out! I don't want to see your face again.

547
00:44:17,834 --> 00:44:19,720
- Can you please listen?
- Get out!

548
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:22,294
- Third, what I just did...
- Get out!

549
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:25,139
Get out now!

550
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:09,270
Khai,

551
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:15,030
if one day I got lost, would you leave me?

552
00:45:15,586 --> 00:45:17,030
Never.

553
00:45:19,029 --> 00:45:23,682
If I was sad, would you console me?

554
00:45:24,448 --> 00:45:25,971
Any time.

555
00:45:26,869 --> 00:45:29,840
You've promised that you'd never leave me.

556
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,540
I'm true to my words.

557
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:39,026
Third!

558
00:46:01,604 --> 00:46:03,179
What's wrong?

559
00:46:07,294 --> 00:46:09,215
I thought I heard something.

560
00:46:09,215 --> 00:46:11,186
But it must have been nothing.

561
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:46,879
Will I not see that smile again?

562
00:46:53,146 --> 00:46:55,177
Am I dying?

563
00:46:56,362 --> 00:46:58,772
I deserve it, though.

564
00:46:58,772 --> 00:47:01,409
I've done Third wrong so many times.

565
00:47:01,409 --> 00:47:04,577
How could you throw her stuff away? Milk wants it back.

566
00:47:04,577 --> 00:47:07,139
You'd better find a way to get them back.

567
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:10,310
Are you sure everything is all there?

568
00:47:13,768 --> 00:47:15,643
Screw him! Is he my bitch?

569
00:47:15,643 --> 00:47:20,379
I can start speaking nicely to him when he's my bitch.

570
00:47:21,914 --> 00:47:24,320
I love you, Praew.

571
00:47:26,478 --> 00:47:28,317
I'm sorry, Third.

572
00:47:29,201 --> 00:47:34,922
I don't think I can keep the promise of not leaving you.

573
00:47:36,685 --> 00:47:40,739
Shit... I want to say I'm sorry to you,

574
00:47:41,498 --> 00:47:44,333
but I don't even get the chance.

575
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,960
I'm sorry for everything, Third.

576
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,040
Can you hear me, Third?

577
00:47:51,859 --> 00:47:55,339
Third, I'm sorry.

578
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:04,840
Last night, I...

579
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,801
Hold on.

580
00:48:05,801 --> 00:48:07,940
P'Un, where are you?

581
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:09,720
Are you into Paan?

582
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,295
Here it is.

583
00:48:11,295 --> 00:48:12,902
- What is it?
- Our wedding invitation.

584
00:48:12,902 --> 00:48:15,054
Wow, congratulations to you.

585
00:48:15,054 --> 00:48:16,931
The wound isn't getting any better.

586
00:48:16,931 --> 00:48:19,230
I think you need someone to help you out.

587
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:20,577
I'll help you get cleaned up.

588
00:48:20,577 --> 00:48:21,866
The person who Third likes.

589
00:48:21,866 --> 00:48:22,899
P'Un.

590
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:26,300
Everybody knows P'Un is pursuing Third.

591
00:48:27,057 --> 00:48:28,636
What the hell are you doing, Khai?

592
00:48:28,636 --> 00:48:30,919
I don't need you to stand up for me.
