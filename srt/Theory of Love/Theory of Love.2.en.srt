You're going out to see a film with Khai. Why are you dressed up like you're going to London?

What's up, Khai?

4
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,200
Okay... go with your family, then.

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,100
Hello.

6
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,720
- Nong Milk.
- What? Stop it.

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,230
Third, where are Milk's things that I left with you?

8
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,300
I threw them away.

9
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,430
How could you?

10
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,180
You'd better find a way to get them back.

11
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,650
Are you sure everything is all there?

12

Do you remember what I said?

16
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,750
If my life was a movie,

17
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:42,340
the story would end at the moment I decided to move on from Khai.

18
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,950
Please don't tell him.

19
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:53,850
You know that Khai has a rule not to date a friend.

20
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,650
Exactly, that's why I haven't told anyone.

21
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:01,860
Now that you know, you can't tell anyone either.

22
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,330

23
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,970
Not that long.

24
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,450
I asked you how long. Answer the damn question.

25

- 3 years.
- What?

26
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:14,230
3 years?

27
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,603
Since the moment I met him.

28
00:01:15,603 --> 00:01:19,853
Shit! And you've been keeping it a secret ever since.

29

00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,960
Of course, you are my friend.

37
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,220
Probably forever.

38

42
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,510
Don't you know how he is by now?

43
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,500
He breaks up with every single girl he's ever dated.

44
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,250

45
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,930
Khai has never really loved anyone,

46
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,283
but when he truly does,

47
00:02:28,283 --> 00:02:31,343
can that someone be you?

48
00:02:32,448 --> 00:02:36,471
- But...
- No but. Trust me.

49
00:02:36,471 --> 00:02:41,150
I will create opportunities for you to confess your love to him.

50
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,170
And then, here comes a twist.

51
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:48,020
With this support from my friend, what should I do?

52

Let's go to the editing room to see what else we should do.

57

I'm not worried about your part.

58
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,900
I do worry about the sound

59
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,438
because the person in charge of the boom mic cared more about hitting on a girl.

60
00:04:49,438 --> 00:04:51,358
That's true.

I told her those tickets are hard to get.

65

When I couldn't get them, she said I didn't love her.

88

It's not because he's directing.

00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,920
Very committed.

167
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,244
You don't know that.

168
00:12:27,244 --> 00:12:29,933
She may have bought it. This stuff is sold everywhere.

169
00:12:29,933 --> 00:12:32,033
You don't know that either.

170
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:36,420
Look! Look at this.

171
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,610
Every single one has got my name on it. She did it herself.

172
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,370
Awesome, Nong Maysa.

173
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,950
It's Fahsai.

174
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:45,430
Yeah, that's another girl.

175
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:50,180
Do you think I should ask her out for dinner as a thank you?

176
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,050
Up to you.

177
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,020
But you already have Nong Milk.

178
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,660
So? Milk's got nothing to do with this.

179
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,600
I'm only asking Fahsai out for dinner, I'm not dating her.

180
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,780
Set it up for me tonight.

181
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,900
I'm going to the toilet.

182
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:27,840
Does P'Khai like my gift, P'Third?

183
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,280
He likes it very much.

184
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,620
Fahsai, are you free tonight?

185
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,460
Khai wants to take you out for dinner to thank you.

186
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,870
Check, check.

187
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:52,730
Ambient sound of trees, scene 13, take 1. Record.

188
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:55,580
Khai, turn the mic this way.

189
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,980
What are you doing?

190
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,150
Helping Bone edit sound files.

191
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:07,200
I went with Khai to record different sounds, like footsteps and grass.

192
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,920
Yeah? How did it go?

193
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,540
Great. We got a lot of ambient sounds.

194
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:16,243
I didn't mean that. Did you tell Khai about your feelings?

195
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,101
No.

196
00:14:18,101 --> 00:14:19,170
What?

197
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:22,120
The atmosphere was just right. Why didn't you say it?

198
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,320
I couldn't do it.

199
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,270
What? Look at people around you.

200
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,790
They confess their love without the ambiance or anything.

201
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,600
This morning, a girl gave Khai a gift...

202
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,400
I know!

203
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:38,290
I gave the gift to him.

204
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,340
It's not that easy, Two.

205
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,940
If I were someone else, I may have said it a long time ago.

206
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,020
But I'm his friend.

207
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,450
What if it blew up in my face after I said it?

208
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,740
I don't want to lose a friend.

209
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,980
Keep on being just friends, then.

210
00:15:30,738 --> 00:15:34,370
Khai, I love you. Khai, I love you.

211
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:37,650
Khai, I love you. Khai, I love you.

212
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:44,080
♫ Just being able to take care of you
and worry about you when you're lonely ♫

213
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:50,980
♫ Just keep caring and being here. That's enough ♫

214
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:56,580
♫ I can only wish to be the main character ♫

215
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:02,180
♫ I am just a supporting role you can't see ♫

216
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:07,940
♫ I'm happy and not discouraged from being
given the role I was given ♫

217
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,870
♫ Even if you're not interested ♫

218
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:14,740
♫ Even though I'm not as good as anyone else ♫

219
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:19,190
♫ But I am satisfied ♫

220
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:23,360
♫ Just to be able to love you ♫

221
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,067
Third, what's the matter?

222
00:16:47,067 --> 00:16:48,687
Does something bother you?

223
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:52,210
No, I was just thinking about things.

224
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:55,500
Liar! I've known you for a long time.

225
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,630
When you're stressed out, you make this face.

226
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,300
Like this.

227
00:17:01,157 --> 00:17:05,710
Screw you. You look like a damn pug. My face doesn't wrinkle like that.

228
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,080
Fine, you don't look like this.

229
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,090
I just wanted to make you smile, to put you in a good mood.

230
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:15,300
I bet you use this trick with girls plenty of times.

231
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,000
Never.

232
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,200
You know I don't go around pleasing people.

233
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:25,390
I don't know what's up with you, but I know how to snap you out of it.

234
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,350
Let's catch a film tomorrow.

235
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,160
My treat.

236
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,820
[ICON SIAM]

237
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,170
Khai, where are you?

238
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:01,528
You said you'd hurry. They're about to screen the ads.

239
00:18:01,528 --> 00:18:03,958
I'm right behind you.

240
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,360
Sorry, traffic was horrible.

241
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,590
Hey, it's time to find a new excuse. You ride a motorbike.

242
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,310
Never mind, let's go. The movie is about to start.

243
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,560
Let's buy some popcorn first.

244
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,890
No way! The movie is about to start.

245
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:19,383
- It only takes a second.
- Come on!

246
00:18:24,027 --> 00:18:26,320
- What flavor do you want?
- Cheese.

247
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,980
Cheese?

248
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,530
No cheese, please.

249
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,180
I'll have sweet and salty.

250
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,930
Sweet in the bottom, salty on the top.

251
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,000
Yes.

252
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,430
Why did you ask me then?

253
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,570
No reason.

254
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,980
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

255
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,480
Want salty?

256
00:19:01,917 --> 00:19:07,090
Khai, this is not the time. The screen light is hurting my eyes.

257
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,840
Sorry.

258
00:20:19,837 --> 00:20:22,230
Is there anyone else out there like me?

259
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:27,838
When I cry watching a film in the theater, I don't want a person next to me to see it,

260
00:20:27,838 --> 00:20:31,968
especially when it's Khai. Not a chance.

261
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,320
Third, did you cry?

262
00:20:48,107 --> 00:20:50,440
How did you know? I saw you sleeping.

263
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,100
I faked it.

264
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,610
It's more exciting to see you trying to hide your tears than to watch the film.

265
00:20:55,610 --> 00:21:00,440
The film was boring. That's 80 minutes of my life wasted.

266
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,760
I don't think it was boring.

267
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,430
It played well with your emotions.

268
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:10,220
Yeah? The female lead was the most boring of all.

269
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,070
She wouldn't admit it.

270
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,980
If she likes him, just tell him. Why would she bury it so deep?

271
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,600
If she confesses, there's more chance for her love to be reciprocated.

272
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,760
But she may not want to lose him.

273
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,508
They are close friends.

274
00:21:25,508 --> 00:21:28,248
But you have to take a chance.

275
00:21:28,248 --> 00:21:31,108
It's better than doing nothing, don't you think?

276
00:21:32,947 --> 00:21:37,760
Often times after watching a movie, I would talk to Khai,

277
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,640
discussing what we liked or didn't like in the movie.

278
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,080
But this is the first time that he has talked to me in a serious manner,

279
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,960
like it is his own life.

280
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:53,950
Is this his way of indirectly telling me to confess my love to him?

281
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:08,150
Khai, I love you.

282
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:12,850
Why is it so hard?

283
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,050
Khai...

284
00:22:31,837 --> 00:22:36,980
Third, I have a favor to ask, and you can't say no.

285
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,370
What is it?

286
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:40,530
Watch a movie with me tonight.

287
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:43,310
Hold on, we just went to see a movie together today.

288
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,120
Aren't you bored?

289
00:22:45,757 --> 00:22:48,157
If it's with you, then I'm not.

290
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:10,740
Third, I broke up with Milk.

291
00:23:11,817 --> 00:23:14,130
The reason is stupid.

292
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,740
It took me a while to find the concert tickets.

293
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,940
In the meantime, she found herself a new guy.

294
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,740
Such an idiot.

295
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,490
So you're hurt.

296
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:29,040
Not exactly. I'm just tired of going from one girl to another.

297
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,050
I'm done with girls who don't really love me.

298
00:23:34,837 --> 00:23:38,287
Maybe I should look closer like Two said.

299
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:43,400
Okay, if you said all that,

300
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,350
if you're really looking for true love,

301
00:23:48,107 --> 00:23:52,140
I believe you, Khai. I'll tell you how I feel.

302
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,510
Did you tell him?

303
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:12,440
Of course... I didn't.

304
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,090
I wouldn't have come to you otherwise.

305
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:17,380
What the hell, man? What are you afraid of, Third?

306
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:20,200
I don't know how I go about it.

307
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,980
Do you get me? I can't just walk up to him and say, "Khai, I love you."

308
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,580
That's not right. It's weird.

309
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:30,508
What should I do?

310
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,100
What should you do?

311
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,500
I've got something.

312
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,450
If you're afraid that it'd be too blunt to just say it to him,

313
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:43,700
try something from a movie.

314
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,430
How?

315
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:48,040
Copy a scene from a romantic film.

316
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:52,550
You're a film major. Make use of what you know best.

317
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,580
I don't think that's going to work.

318
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:07,200
Third, how long are you gonna keep looking?

319
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,070
You came just when I was about to close the shop.

320
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,500
Just a minute.

321
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:18,650
What do you want with all these romantic films?

322
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,950
I will use them to confess...

323
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:26,040
For my class.

324
00:25:27,458 --> 00:25:28,850
What class?

325
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:32,670
Don't ask too many questions. It's for my screenwriting.

326
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,070
Ah.

327
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,070
Help me choose a movie with a good love-confession scene.

328
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:43,000
A film with a good love-confession scene?

329
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:49,980
What about this one, "Dear Dakanda"?

330
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,540
It's a classic.

331
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:59,720
Khunphon, I love you.

332
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:02,950
Why did you wait this long to tell me now?

333
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:05,400
I've made up with Milk.

334
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:23,860
No. Find me another one.

335
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,674
No?

336
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,600
Hey. How about this one? It's not too old. "One Day."

337
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,218
Khai,

338
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,474
have you heard the story about

339
00:26:45,474 --> 00:26:49,430
the people who climbed Mount Everest and how many of them fell and died?

340
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:56,629
Before this, I never understood why they would do such things.

341
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,700
Until I met you.

342
00:27:00,367 --> 00:27:04,934
It made me realize when you really love something,

343
00:27:05,767 --> 00:27:08,200
you don't need a reason.

344
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,869
Khai,

345
00:27:11,055 --> 00:27:13,650
you are my Mount Everest.

346
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:20,318
You said you didn't know how to hit on someone.

347
00:27:20,318 --> 00:27:22,260
That was smooth.

348
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,207
What's up, Milk?

349
00:27:28,207 --> 00:27:30,580
It's really you.

350
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:33,070
I was wrong. Please forgive me.

351
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,740
Please come back to me.

352
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,440
Sure.

353
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,870
You are my Mount Everest.

354
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:43,390
Not just that. You are the one with high heels.

355
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:46,058
How does that sound? It sounds big, right?

356
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,050
No.

357
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,926
No?

358
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,330
It's got to be this one. A legendary romantic comedy,

359
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:01,360
"10 Things I hate about you."

360
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,727
There's a love-confession scene that the world can't forget.

361
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:24,510
If you're willing to be troubled,

362
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:29,150
would you be my better half?

363
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:34,460
It's just a small favor I ask of you.

364
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:42,950
It's just a small favor I ask of you.

365
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:07,020
♪ Being all alone, what would I do if I got lost? ♪

366
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:11,350
♪ A dream is too big for a lone person to carry ♪

367
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:15,090
♪ What would I do if I got upset and wanted to vent? ♪

368
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:19,480
♪ Thinking about it, it's kind of a big deal ♪

369
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:24,410
♪ If it's not too much trouble,
would you be my love? ♪

370
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:28,400
♪ I've had a crush on you for so long ♪

371
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:33,210
♪ If you're willing to be troubled, would you be my better half? ♪

372
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:36,980
♪ It's just a small favor I ask of you ♪

373
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,190
That's awesome.

374
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:04,450
But what if I got caught by the guards?

375
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:10,180
Third, that face of yours means no, doesn't it?

376
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:17,260
- Is there anything else?
- I've got nothing else. This isn't good, that doesn't work.

377
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:24,780
I was going to recommend a classic scene from "Love Actually."

378
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:29,860
But judging from your reactions, you're going to say it's cliché.

379
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:39,430
Yeah, "Love Actually."

380
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,360
Oh, hey!

381
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,410
[Hi.]

382
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:00,995
Hi.

383
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:07,030
You're special.

384
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:14,190
Not this kind of special.

385
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:26,000
You're more special than that.

386
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:37,490
Today, I want to tell you about something so special to me.

387
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:42,850
I...

388
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:47,220
like...

389
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,610
you...

390
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,810
Now you know about my feelings. I...

391
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,050
Third.

392
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,700
This is awesome.

393
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:14,540
Did you just come up with a way for me to make up with Nong Milk?

394
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:19,750
Sorry, I'm not looking for a relationship right now.

395
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:24,250
But I thank you.

396
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:26,300
Love you, dude.

397
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,800
But I fucking hate you.

398
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:49,791
Are you hungry?

399
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:52,940
Here you go. Home-cooked by yours truly.

400
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:58,550
Thank you. Did you just call this "home-cooked"?

401
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:02,250
Whatever I cook is delicious. See?

402
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:12,690
How are you these days?

403
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,960
Is there someone in your life?

404
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,460
Here you go.

405
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,360
So?

406
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,710
What's got into you?

407
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:30,130
I've been focusing on telling you about my stuff.

408
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:32,250
I just want to get updates on your life as well.

409
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,212
So? Is there anyone?

410
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,160
Well?

411
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,170
No one.

412
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,670
I don't believe you. There's someone.

413
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:49,120
Tell me and I'll help you.

414
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,960
Is it this one?

415
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:54,850
Let me see. Let me see.

416
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:57,210
- It's nothing.
- Let me have a look.

417
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:59,330
- Give it back.
- Is it this one? Is this her IG?

418
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,220
- Give it back.
- Let me have a look.

419
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,821
- Is this her? Tell me.
- Give it back.

420
00:34:03,821 --> 00:34:06,660
- Third, she's quite pretty.
- Give it back.

421
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,650
Give it back.

422
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:10,750
Leave me alone!

423
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:15,050
I'm sorry.

424
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:18,160
Are you really mad?

425
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,120
I just want to know whom my best friend likes.

426
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,860
Are they treating you well?

427
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,160
That's fine.

428
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:33,640
You can tell me when you're ready.

429
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,850
I'm ready to be the first person who listens to you.

430
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:40,671
Before you listen,

431
00:34:40,671 --> 00:34:44,450
please stop being stupid and understand what I was trying to tell you earlier.

432
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:48,100
Is this the person who's ready to listen to me?

433
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:57,560
Shit! I knew that Khai was stupid, but didn't realize how much.

434
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,440
He's so stupid that it wears me out.

435
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,030
I think I'm done with this shit.

436
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:05,260
You can't give up now.

437
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:08,580
For someone as stupid as Khai,

438
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:12,780
you need to start with getting very close to him.

439
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:16,390
When you see an opportunity, you confess right away.

440
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:21,450
I've got a plan.

441
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:25,450
But it requires you to be shameless.

442
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:27,160
How?

443
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,750
[Espresso, Pour-over, Tea, Chocolate, Matcha, Brownie, Waffle]

444
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:34,920
You've run out of money to pay rent?

445
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:39,410
I'm sorry I didn't tell you guys.

446
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:42,750
But I have nowhere else to go.

447
00:35:51,757 --> 00:35:54,250
Oh my god, Third.

448
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:58,030
Don't cry. You're making me cry, too.

449
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,730
Calm down.

450
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:02,870
You can come and stay with me.

451
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:08,050
But no, my bathroom is not functioning right now.

452
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:09,920
My bedroom is small.

453
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,870
I'm afraid it won't be very convenient for you to sleep at my place.

454
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:21,460
I think you need to find a room that is large and spacious, with two bedrooms.

455
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:25,679
- You can stay with me, Third.
- Is that a good idea, Bone?

456
00:36:26,327 --> 00:36:29,350
Of course, it is. A friend in need is a friend indeed.

457
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:32,270
Pick up your things and come tonight. I'm about to close the shop now.

458
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:34,340
But...

459
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,890
What are you waiting for? Gather your things.

460
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:42,500
- I'm waiting for you to gather these.
- Oh, I forgot. Sorry.

461
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,700
Here's my apartment.

462
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,720
It's a bit messy.

463
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,300
Third, you can sleep on the bed. I'll take the floor.

464
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:19,630
Shit!

465
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:24,350
Sorry.

466
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:28,770
I don't normally have cockroaches here.

467
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:30,310
Sorry.

468
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:32,270
No need to say sorry.

469
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:36,040
It's your room. I'm the one who's giving you trouble.

470
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:40,789
Where can I put this luggage?

471
00:37:40,789 --> 00:37:44,700
Anywhere is fine. Put it on the bed.

472
00:37:46,059 --> 00:37:47,609
Hey.

473
00:37:48,437 --> 00:37:50,230
You can come to my place.

474
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:55,340
Bone's room is too small. Let's be considerate of him and his friends.

475
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,250
There are a lot of his friends here.

476
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,770
Where are Two and Bone?

477
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:06,580
They've just left.

478
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:09,680
I think they're meeting up with girls.

479
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:18,560
I lied. This is Two's plan to get me to have a moment alone with Khai.

480
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:23,400
It's strange. I sleep over here quite often.

481
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,030
But it's different this time.

482
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:32,540
This is the first time I'm here as his roommate.

483
00:38:34,357 --> 00:38:35,960
I'll just take this to your room.

484
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:39,160
No, no. I'll take care of it.

485
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,730
I'm going to go out and buy some shampoo.

486
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:45,950
No need. Use mine.

487
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:48,420
I'm out of soap and toothpaste, too.

488
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:52,150
Use mine. No need to buy them.

489
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:58,100
Since you're this kind, I'm just going to use your skincare and cologne as well.

490
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:02,790
Dude, if you're gonna use all of my stuff, give me your body in exchange.

491
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:07,300
Just the body? Don't you want my heart, too?

492
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,500
Third, don't say this to anyone else.

493
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,330
Why?

494
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,850
People will go crazy over you.

495
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:25,540
Everyone is crazy over me, except you.

496
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,340
You, idiot.

497
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:31,450
I'll take this over there. Your room is on this side.

498
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:34,360
I'll take this. Get some rest.

499
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,240
I'll come and help later.

500
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:04,410
I'm going to bed. Get home safe.

501
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:09,070
Oh no, you're staying here tonight.

502
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:11,330
Sweet dreams.

503
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:13,230
Sweet dreams.

504
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:18,750
Nobody was crying earlier. It was just a dream.

505
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,180
I don't know how this will end.

506
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:29,030
But I can feel that my life has reached a big turning point.

507
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,900
Is it closed?

508
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:42,390
I just want a cup of coffee.

509
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:46,380
No, we're open till late. Please come in.

510
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:52,747
What can I get for you?

511
00:41:52,747 --> 00:41:54,490
One iced espresso, please.

512
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:56,190
Coming right up.

513
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:07,730
An espresso this late means an all-nighter to study or to submit an assignment to the professor. Right?

514
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:12,850
Working on an assignment, but not to submit to a professor.

515
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:14,370
I've finished my studies.

516
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:18,410
Sorry, you look very young.

517
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:21,960
If you've just graduated, I think we're quite about same age.

518
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:34,250
Here you go, one iced espresso.

519
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,820
Thank you.

520
00:42:40,467 --> 00:42:42,850
Are those movies for rent?

521
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:44,100
Yes.

522
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,250
Can I have a look?

523
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:48,020
Please go ahead.

524
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:05,350
You've got a great selection of films.

525
00:43:06,157 --> 00:43:10,510
"Moonlight," "Shawshank Redemption,"

526
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:12,730
"36 by Nawapol,"

527
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:17,600
"To Kill a Mockingbird"? That's an old movie.

528
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:21,800
If you're keen to rent a movie, just bring one of yours in exchange.

529
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,150
It can be any film.

530
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:25,640
After that, you can rent any movie you want.

531
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,860
Too bad I didn't bring any DVD with me.

532
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:33,330
That's fine. You can rent one first, and bring your DVD later.

533
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:34,820
Can I?

534
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,350
What should I pick?

535
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:41,220
What genre do you like?

536
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,830
A romantic comedy is fine.

537
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:46,930
I don't want deep movies right now. Too tired to interpret the meaning of the film.

538
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:53,700
What about this one, "Notting Hill"?

539
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,650
A classic romantic comedy.

540
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:58,380
I like the scene when the two main characters meet in a book shop.

541
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:00,840
The male protagonist suggests a book to the female protagonist.

542
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:04,400
That's the beginning of their relationship.

543
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,210
I'm sorry for the spoiler.

544
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:14,373
That's fine. Everyone's seen '"Notting Hill."

545
00:44:14,373 --> 00:44:18,306
I'm renting it. I want to see the press conference scene again.

546
00:44:18,306 --> 00:44:20,216
So funny.

547
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:24,600
I'm going to go. How much?

548
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,350
80 baht.

549
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,670
Thanks for your recommendation.

550
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:37,890
Excuse me. We will issue a membership card for you.

551
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:41,670
Can I have your nickname, please?

552
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:42,880
Paan.

553
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,620
I'm Bone. Nice to meet you.

554
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:02,020
She likes you.

555
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,860
This is the assignment for today.

556
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:09,370
Welcome to our happy home.

557
00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:12,860
You two are becoming like a married couple.

558
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,270
I'm hungry.

559
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:17,350
You're back. Food will be ready in a few minutes.

560
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:22,830
I want to move out of Khai's apartment.

561
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:24,514
Why?

562
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,090
Third! Third!

563
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:30,290
Where are you?
