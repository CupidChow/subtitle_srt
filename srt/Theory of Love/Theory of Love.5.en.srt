But here and now, you can be Third who loves Khai.

492
00:42:46,347 --> 00:42:49,346
Hey, where is Third?

493
00:42:49,346 --> 00:42:52,628
Do you really have to ask? You know what you did.

494
00:42:56,119 --> 00:42:58,188
What do you want me to do?

495
00:43:02,331 --> 00:43:04,297
Third finished his part of the PowerPoint presentation.

496
00:43:04,297 --> 00:43:07,689
You add yours to his.

497
00:43:07,689 --> 00:43:09,149
This is the file.

498
00:43:09,149 --> 00:43:10,340
Hit "edit" here.

499
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:13,541
Yeah, yeah! I know how to do it.

500
00:43:13,541 --> 00:43:15,342
He's the man. Just let him do it.

501
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:17,068
Let's go.

502
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,820
[Chobjai Condo]

503
00:43:41,209 --> 00:43:42,669
Third.

504
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:45,169
I'm here to return the laptop.

505
00:43:54,812 --> 00:43:56,256
Thanks.

506
00:43:59,931 --> 00:44:02,058
Can I come in?

507
00:44:05,585 --> 00:44:06,985
Sure.

508
00:44:25,716 --> 00:44:28,132
That's not the only reason I'm here.

509
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:31,990
I also want to apologize to you for yesterday.

510
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:33,931
I didn't mean to say that shit to you.

511
00:44:37,346 --> 00:44:39,420
That's fine.

512
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:43,757
I'm sorry for making you mad yesterday.

513
00:44:49,467 --> 00:44:52,129
Can we go back to being friends like before?

514
00:45:00,495 --> 00:45:02,590
Of course.

515
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:05,454
It's not fun being mad at you.

516
00:45:07,173 --> 00:45:09,351
Same here.

517
00:45:10,568 --> 00:45:12,531
I feel good now.

518
00:45:12,531 --> 00:45:15,459
I'm going to go.

519
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:17,949
Thanks, dude.

520
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:24,230
See you later.

521
00:45:27,873 --> 00:45:31,168
Thanks for still seeing me as your friend.

522
00:45:31,168 --> 00:45:34,270
I will try to think of you as a friend, too.

523
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:42,160
You've taught here for almost a month. Have you started to get the hang of this place?

524
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,717
It's been good. The students here are awesome.

525
00:45:44,717 --> 00:45:48,056
They are very attentive to my editing class.

526
00:45:48,711 --> 00:45:51,958
I have Prof. Sujitra to thank.

527
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:55,991
If she hadn't taken a maternity leave, I wouldn't have had such a good experience.

528
00:45:55,991 --> 00:45:59,691
Any issues that you'd like to talk to me about?

529
00:46:01,165 --> 00:46:06,659
There's one about some students who haven't come to class.

530
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:11,708
For example, Mr. Boriphat.

531
00:46:11,708 --> 00:46:14,868
Since I started here, he hasn't been to any of my classes.

532
00:46:14,868 --> 00:46:17,040
Do you know him?

533
00:46:18,613 --> 00:46:20,662
I do.

534
00:46:21,597 --> 00:46:25,149
He goes by the name of Bone.

535
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:38,394
This is him, Professor. Here's Boriphat.

536
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,615
Why are you taking so long to set this up?

537
00:46:43,615 --> 00:46:44,910
You are an asshole.

538
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:46,030
I heard you were sick.

539
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:47,938
I got you porridge and some medicines.

540
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:49,845
I think you're out of it.

541
00:46:52,137 --> 00:46:54,211
This is Praew, my girlfriend.

542
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:55,709
Hello.

543
00:46:55,709 --> 00:46:57,731
- I have to go.
- Third!

544
00:46:57,731 --> 00:47:00,110
- Where is Third?
- I don't know.

545
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:02,714
Third has gone out of my life.
