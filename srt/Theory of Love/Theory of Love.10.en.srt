00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,630
How is this possible?

169
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,350
You said you were boiling with work piling up.

170
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:53,707
In fact, you came to eat boiling shabu with Khunphol.

171
00:14:53,707 --> 00:14:55,048
It's a coincidence.

172
00:14:55,048 --> 00:14:56,939
If you want to eat, come and have a seat.

173
00:14:56,939 --> 00:15:00,430
No, we don't want to accidentally sit at the same table.

174
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,410
Can we use the one right next to you?

175
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,970
It must be reserved for someone.

176
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,460
That someone is me.

177
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,591
Yes.

178
00:15:07,591 --> 00:15:09,791
How are you that quick?

179
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,840
Not so smooth.

180
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,160
I saw both of you when you were walking into the restaurant.

181
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:49,650
How hard is it to peel a shrimp?

182
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,220
The chopstick moment was great.

183
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:56,200
#ThirdNotAGoodLiar

184
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:07,107
Our cover has been blown. Should we just tell them we're a couple?

185
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,650
A couple, my ass.

186
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,730
Yes, I'm a loser.

187
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,620
I got soft and came with him.

188
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,900
If you want to yell at me, go ahead.

189
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:35,050
We're not here to yell at you. We're happy that you can accept him.

190
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:41,550
Not that. I just want to open myself up.

191
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:45,454
Now that you've opened up, what do you see?

192
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:55,029
I see a version of Khai I've always wanted to see.

193
00:16:55,872 --> 00:16:58,549
The one who is not a just a friend.

194
00:17:00,075 --> 00:17:03,049
The one who feels the same way I feel.

195
00:17:24,284 --> 00:17:30,253
But when he first gets with someone, he usually does this.

196
00:17:30,253 --> 00:17:32,449
This is nothing special.

197
00:17:33,158 --> 00:17:34,769
Wait, Third.

198
00:17:34,769 --> 00:17:38,049
When did you become so jaded about love?

199
00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:44,269
P'Shane told me to use my brain more than my heart with love.

200
00:17:45,089 --> 00:17:49,607
But Khai is using his heart with you entirely.

201
00:17:49,607 --> 00:17:52,529
If you want to find out the answer,

202
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:56,229
you need to use your heart to make a decision.

203
00:18:02,763 --> 00:18:04,955
What are you guys talking about?

204
00:18:05,603 --> 00:18:07,681
Don't shush me.

205
00:18:07,681 --> 00:18:10,200
You two pay up.

206
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,497
I paid for Third only.

207
00:18:12,497 --> 00:18:15,748
Nothing you say will change my mind.

208
00:18:15,748 --> 00:18:17,170
No!

209
00:18:23,155 --> 00:18:25,275
Why are you rearranging your condo?

210
00:18:25,275 --> 00:18:27,732
You often said my room was messy.

211
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:32,253
So, I am decluttering it so that you can come over and watch movies.

212
00:18:36,932 --> 00:18:38,974
It's good you're here.

213
00:18:38,974 --> 00:18:40,967
I've got a movie for you.

214
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,720
[Spirited Away]

215
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,300
"Spirited Away."

216
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,304
I borrowed this film from Bone a while ago.

217
00:18:49,304 --> 00:18:52,654
I liked it very much. So, I got it for you.

218
00:18:52,654 --> 00:18:55,050
You said you wanted to watch it.

219
00:18:55,859 --> 00:18:58,571
But you don't watch amination movies.

220
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:02,167
That was before. Now I do.

221
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:11,980
[Jeab (My Girlfriend)]

222
00:19:13,536 --> 00:19:15,658
You still kept that.

223
00:19:16,136 --> 00:19:18,489
Am I your Jeab?

224
00:19:24,139 --> 00:19:30,507
Of course, it brought me to you.

225
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:39,557
I wasn't sure at first if I was your Jeab.

226
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:46,830
But now I'm 100% sure that you're my Noi Naa.

227
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:02,669
What happened makes it hard for me to feel the same.

228
00:20:04,432 --> 00:20:06,589
Look into my eyes.

229
00:20:15,145 --> 00:20:17,169
Look into my eyes.

230
00:20:23,496 --> 00:20:27,729
Third, can you forget what happened?

231
00:20:27,729 --> 00:20:30,527
Let the past stay in the past,

232
00:20:30,527 --> 00:20:34,557
leaving you and me in the now and the future.

233
00:21:07,646 --> 00:21:08,973
I have to go home.

234
00:21:08,973 --> 00:21:14,309
Third, what about my answer?

235
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:21,053
You said if you finished rearranging your condo,

236
00:21:21,053 --> 00:21:23,199
you'd invite me here to watch a movie.

237
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:27,158
Let me know when you're done. We can watch this together.

238
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,293
Third!

239
00:21:30,293 --> 00:21:33,140
Third! Hold on!

240
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:48,665
"Begin Again."

241
00:21:48,665 --> 00:21:52,032
Third, you'll begin again with me. Right?

242
00:21:52,032 --> 00:21:55,680
Thanks! Woohoo!

243
00:22:00,012 --> 00:22:03,092
Let's begin again.

244
00:22:03,092 --> 00:22:06,210
Third, I will not let you go ever again.

245
00:22:19,804 --> 00:22:21,410
Please wait.

246
00:22:39,032 --> 00:22:41,493
I must have been heartbroken.

247
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:42,995
Heartbroken?

248
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:44,592
Who?

249
00:22:45,744 --> 00:22:47,989
That person just became unavailable.

250
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:04,802
In this scene, the boy and the girl are together.

251
00:23:04,802 --> 00:23:09,307
But for a reason they agree on earlier,

252
00:23:09,307 --> 00:23:13,649
they cannot tell other people they are a couple.

253
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:50,729
The way they express it becomes hard.

254
00:23:52,435 --> 00:23:55,329
They act like everything is normal...

255
00:23:57,515 --> 00:24:00,758
even though they're in love.

256
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:16,469
But they're sometimes playful when no one is looking.

257
00:24:31,776 --> 00:24:35,757
When they're alone, they are very sweet...

258
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,769
if no one sees them.

259
00:24:55,668 --> 00:25:01,449
So point out this feeling and express it as much as you can.

260
00:25:03,629 --> 00:25:06,810
[Hang in there.]

261
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:09,830
Without being too obvious.

262
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:19,652
How are these, Lynn? Beautiful?

263
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:23,857
This one is good.

264
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,050
Lynn.

265
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:47,748
Maybe it's just me, but I feel that lately

266
00:25:47,748 --> 00:25:50,950
my photos taken by you don't come out as good as they used to.

267
00:25:57,241 --> 00:26:01,370
Maybe it's me. I put on more weight.

268
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:03,567
Look at this plump face.

269
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:10,469
You need to find the angle that makes me look thinner.

270
00:26:16,697 --> 00:26:19,132
Be careful.

271
00:26:19,132 --> 00:26:21,944
I'll fine you if you break it.

272
00:26:23,034 --> 00:26:25,283
Is everything all right?

273
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:27,444
All good.

274
00:26:28,874 --> 00:26:32,916
Professor, thank you very much.

275
00:26:32,916 --> 00:26:36,490
Our seniors got the theater for a week.

276
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:39,134
We got it for months because of you.

277
00:26:39,134 --> 00:26:42,047
No problem. I get you.

278
00:26:42,047 --> 00:26:46,256
I used to organize a play like this one.

279
00:26:46,256 --> 00:26:51,047
Really? I thought you'd make films for competition.

280
00:26:51,047 --> 00:26:52,318
That, too.

281
00:26:52,318 --> 00:26:56,129
But I also like plays.

282
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:05,670
If the essence of filmmaking is storytelling, we just change the platform from film to stage.

283
00:27:09,215 --> 00:27:10,849
I agree.

284
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:16,446
Please excuse me. I'll go and supervise my staff.

285
00:27:16,446 --> 00:27:18,644
Okay. Good luck.

286
00:27:27,726 --> 00:27:30,304
I asked you to shoot behind the scene, not to take a nap.

287
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:33,490
What are you doing sleeping here?

288
00:27:35,224 --> 00:27:38,382
People are carrying stuff. Why don't you get some photos of that?

289
00:27:38,382 --> 00:27:40,035
I need them to promote the page.

290
00:27:40,035 --> 00:27:44,449
Yes, and take a lot of photos of you.

291
00:27:45,434 --> 00:27:47,169
What?

292
00:27:49,181 --> 00:27:50,861
Just one.

293
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,775
Quick.

294
00:28:00,009 --> 00:28:01,754
Let me see.

295
00:28:03,622 --> 00:28:05,646
Get to work.

296
00:28:05,646 --> 00:28:07,289
Do a good job.

297
00:28:43,161 --> 00:28:46,650
- Can I lend you a hand?
- I'm good. Thanks so much.

298
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,609
Are you shooting behind the scene?

299
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,600
Yes.

300
00:28:55,529 --> 00:28:57,474
I'm going to carry this over there.

301
00:28:57,474 --> 00:28:59,658
Who were you talking about the other day?

302
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:07,596
I happened to hear you and P'Shane talking about you being heartbroken

303
00:29:07,596 --> 00:29:10,707
because someone became unavailable.

304
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:12,789
Did you mean me?

305
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:18,389
Why do you want to know?

306
00:29:20,948 --> 00:29:22,929
Are you into me?

307
00:29:24,504 --> 00:29:26,629
You have Lynn.

308
00:29:27,272 --> 00:29:29,358
Why do you care?

309
00:29:33,431 --> 00:29:35,369
Since when?

310
00:29:38,336 --> 00:29:39,967
Tell me.

311
00:29:43,347 --> 00:29:45,852
Don't keep quiet. Tell me.

312
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:53,169
Since the freshmen welcoming ceremony.

313
00:29:55,378 --> 00:29:57,469
Snacks, guys.

314
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:06,061
I've got some snacks here.

315
00:30:06,061 --> 00:30:07,930
Smile.

316
00:30:15,221 --> 00:30:17,229
Beautiful, Third.

317
00:30:18,391 --> 00:30:20,809
Good shot.

318
00:30:20,809 --> 00:30:22,709
Have a look.

319
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,769
Good!

320
00:30:26,701 --> 00:30:29,627
This is not good.

321
00:30:57,872 --> 00:31:00,357
I like when you hold the camera.

322
00:31:28,392 --> 00:31:31,015
- I like when you...
- Enough.

323
00:31:31,015 --> 00:31:33,213
I don't want to hear it anymore.

324
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:43,405
The theater is closed.

325
00:31:46,062 --> 00:31:48,390
Un, want to get something to eat?

326
00:31:49,567 --> 00:31:51,841
You go ahead. I'll check the setting.

327
00:31:51,841 --> 00:31:53,646
Okay.

328
00:31:53,646 --> 00:31:55,655
Two, are you coming?

329
00:31:55,655 --> 00:31:57,053
No.

330
00:31:57,053 --> 00:31:58,890
See you.

331
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:16,890
Kay was falling sleep, and the professor gave her a nudge.

332
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:21,719
She thought it was me, so she said loudly, "Leave me the hell alone and let me sleep."

333
00:32:21,719 --> 00:32:26,152
Everyone was like, "What's up with her?"

334

Two.

336
00:32:37,752 --> 00:32:41,490
Sorry, Lynn. My mind wandered off.

337
00:32:42,887 --> 00:32:47,225
Are you all right? You seem upset.

338
00:32:47,225 --> 00:32:49,090
Nothing.

339

It's so dark.

341
00:33:15,289 --> 00:33:17,683
What about the people in the building?

342
00:33:17,683 --> 00:33:19,710
This is scary.

343
00:33:22,958 --> 00:33:27,243
Make sure the lights stay on during the shoot.

344
00:33:27,243 --> 00:33:29,055
Why?

345
00:33:29,055 --> 00:33:33,927
One time I was working with him in a studio.

346
00:33:33,927 --> 00:33:35,372
The lights went out.

347
00:33:35,372 --> 00:33:40,430
When they were back on, I saw him sitting there trembling for hours.

348
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:44,075
I asked him what's wrong, but he wouldn't tell me.

349
00:33:44,075 --> 00:33:48,587
I suspect that he's scared of the dark.

350
00:34:25,991 --> 00:34:28,475
Calm down. It's me.

351

It's me.

357
00:35:42,954 --> 00:35:45,450
About what happened in the theater...

358
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:52,669
Is this the reason you don't photograph me well anymore?

359
00:35:56,899 --> 00:35:58,858
I'm sorry.

360
00:36:15,994 --> 00:36:18,214
How's the presentation, Bone?

361
00:36:18,214 --> 00:36:19,929
I am working on it.

362
00:36:19,929 --> 00:36:25,261
I want the photos of me and my boyfriend when we were young inserted at the beginning.

363
00:36:25,261 --> 00:36:27,570
I'll have a messenger deliver the hard disk to you.

364

Please select some good photos. Thanks.

Can I park this, and you give me a lift to the Comm Arts building?
