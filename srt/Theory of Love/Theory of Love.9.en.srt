that my bad behavior...

21

would desensitize me.

And never put much effort into it.

I did that because I was worried about you.

I don't want Un to hurt you.

Today, I've brought you to a cake shop...

Hey, you. Hold on a sec.

171
00:16:52,628 --> 00:16:54,770
Let me powder your nose a bit.

172
00:17:08,432 --> 00:17:09,765
Okay, all done.

173
00:17:09,765 --> 00:17:13,322
Thanks to me, your face will stay beautiful and not oily.

174
00:17:13,322 --> 00:17:15,115
Thanks.

175
00:17:15,115 --> 00:17:18,591
Okay, the host looks beautiful.

Hello, welcome to Tasting with Lilynne.

178
00:17:26,434 --> 00:17:29,600
Today, I've brought you to a cake shop that offers a variety of cakes.

179
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,594
The owner claims that the cakes are freshly made every day.

180
00:17:31,594 --> 00:17:33,730
The atmosphere here is wonderfully relaxing.

181
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,884
About the taste, will I give my stamp of approval?

182
00:17:35,884 --> 00:17:38,456
Let's find out.

184

The intro is good.

185
00:17:41,597 --> 00:17:43,313
Let's insert the cakes.

186
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:45,106
Okay.

187
00:17:55,193 --> 00:17:56,548
Is this okay?

188
00:17:56,548 --> 00:17:58,706
More than okay.

189
00:17:58,706 --> 00:18:00,928
The shot is beautiful. Our group will get an A for sure.

190
00:18:00,928 --> 00:18:03,828
Lynn, please ask Two to help us out again in the next assignment.

191
00:18:13,986 --> 00:18:18,699
Lynn, you foxy girl.

192
00:18:20,053 --> 00:18:21,972
She forgot to turn off the mic.

193
00:18:21,972 --> 00:18:24,408
- What?
- The photographer outside.

194
00:18:24,408 --> 00:18:27,882
It hasn't been long since you became single, and now you've got a new guy.

195
00:18:27,882 --> 00:18:31,220
Two? He's my friend since high school.

196
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,680
Really?

197
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,486
But I think he's way better than your P'Phon.

198
00:18:36,486 --> 00:18:40,084
I agree. For a new guy, please find someone like him.

199
00:18:40,084 --> 00:18:44,240
Fun and good at what he does. Not just playing football with his friends.

200
00:18:51,743 --> 00:18:54,665
Two, thank you so much for your help today.

201
00:18:54,665 --> 00:18:56,664
Lynn, you can get a ride with Two. Right?

202
00:18:56,664 --> 00:18:57,742
See you tomorrow.

203

Bye. Get home safe.

204

Let's go home. My car is right there.

205
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:10,488
Wait a minute. We should grab something to eat first. My treat.

206
00:19:10,488 --> 00:19:12,988
I want to thank you for helping me out today.

207
00:19:17,828 --> 00:19:20,434
Sure, what do you want to eat?

208
00:19:20,434 --> 00:19:23,708
There's this place that I can take you. I guarantee it's the best.

209
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,402
Let's go.

210
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:36,759
Why did you stop?

211
00:19:45,503 --> 00:19:49,688
Are you thinking how an old place like this can be any good?

212
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,074
I used to think that way.

213
00:19:51,074 --> 00:19:53,854
But you need to try it first. I can assure you that you'll like it.

214
00:19:55,817 --> 00:19:59,245
Lynn, can we go some place else?

215
00:19:59,245 --> 00:20:00,619
Why?

216
00:20:00,619 --> 00:20:05,179
I don't like chicken, and I'm afraid that I'll get gout.

217
00:20:07,631 --> 00:20:09,309
Okay.

218
00:20:15,357 --> 00:20:17,805

Thank you.

220

Are my parents here?

221
00:20:35,654 --> 00:20:38,297
When did you become my parents?

222
00:20:38,297 --> 00:20:41,060
Have you ever been dumped by your parents?

223
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,697
They are busy, so they asked me to bring you home.

00:22:05,917 --> 00:22:08,004
Give it to me. I'll take out the food.

231
00:22:08,004 --> 00:22:10,817
You have only one good hand.

I forgot.

233
00:22:17,097 --> 00:22:21,202
You can eat snacks in the meantime. I know you have to eat at noon.

I think I can feed myself.

Okay. Take your medicines and get well soon.

On the day I'm trying to get over him, he treats me so well.

So well that I need to stop myself from getting carried away.

I've heard that when we taste something delicious, it makes us forget about the bad things in life.

Someone says a keyword about another person in this group.

443
00:39:06,614 --> 00:39:11,526
You need to guess who that person is.

444

For example, I say "the Faculty's King."

I'm saving your life! Why are you being suicidal?

The only way to forget about your old love...

00:42:39,614 --> 00:42:41,303
It's not that.

498
00:42:45,306 --> 00:42:47,306
Two.

499
00:42:47,306 --> 00:42:49,879
If there's something on your mind, you can tell me.

500
00:43:06,688 --> 00:43:08,088
Lynn.

501
00:43:11,318 --> 00:43:14,120
I've had a crush on you since high school.

502
00:43:16,924 --> 00:43:20,762
You don't have anyone in your life now.

503
00:43:25,062 --> 00:43:27,207
Would you like to go out with me?

504
00:43:41,423 --> 00:43:43,259
I'm sorry.

505
00:43:44,533 --> 00:43:46,299
Praew.

506
00:43:46,299 --> 00:43:48,359
Third.

507
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:50,420
It has been a while.

508
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:54,004
I'm going to go back to my friends.

509
00:43:54,004 --> 00:43:55,905
Wait, Third.

510
00:43:57,565 --> 00:44:02,860
I have something I've been wanting to tell you for a while.

511
00:44:05,782 --> 00:44:09,803
Khai and I...

512
00:44:23,586 --> 00:44:25,606
What's on your mind?

513
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,378
You can tell me anything.

514
00:44:28,378 --> 00:44:31,430
I'm a nosy person.

515
00:44:37,139 --> 00:44:39,258
Let's just say...

516
00:44:40,327 --> 00:44:46,599
if someone you love lies to you, will you forgive them?

517
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:53,319
If it's the first time, I can forgive them.

518
00:44:55,333 --> 00:44:57,814
What if they've done it repeatedly?

519
00:44:57,814 --> 00:44:59,859
Can you still forgive them?

520
00:45:00,597 --> 00:45:03,305
My immediate answer would be no.

521
00:45:05,465 --> 00:45:08,916
But if you think about it,

522
00:45:09,771 --> 00:45:11,959
looking at their intention,

523
00:45:12,754 --> 00:45:15,604
if they mean well, can you be mad at them?

524
00:45:21,339 --> 00:45:26,008
Since you're telling me this, who lied to you?

525
00:45:26,008 --> 00:45:27,772
Is it Un?

526
00:45:27,772 --> 00:45:29,907
No, it's...

527
00:45:31,638 --> 00:45:34,599
They are fighting! Let's go!

528
00:45:38,074 --> 00:45:40,458
You piece of shit!

529
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,702
What the hell are you doing, Khai?

530
00:45:44,702 --> 00:45:46,302
Why are you protecting him?

531
00:45:46,302 --> 00:45:48,220
Do you know what he did?

532
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:49,901
He was making out with some girl in the bathroom.

533
00:45:49,901 --> 00:45:51,062
So?

534
00:45:51,062 --> 00:45:52,144
You had to ask?

535
00:45:52,144 --> 00:45:54,854
He's hitting on someone else while chasing after you.

536
00:45:54,854 --> 00:45:56,306
Why are you so stupid?

537
00:45:56,306 --> 00:45:59,159
You are stupid. He's not chasing after me.

538
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:01,884
You are being fooled and yet you act like a big shot.

539
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:05,472
You're acting like a big shot. Why do you feel the need to defend me?

540
00:46:05,472 --> 00:46:06,952
I'm jealous, asshole.

541
00:46:06,952 --> 00:46:10,061
- Why would you be jealous?
- Because I love you.

542
00:46:26,865 --> 00:46:28,774
Can we start over?

543
00:46:28,774 --> 00:46:30,734
I don't want to hurt anymore.

544
00:46:30,734 --> 00:46:33,362
You don't watch animations.

545
00:46:33,362 --> 00:46:34,443
But I do now.

546
00:46:34,443 --> 00:46:36,543
You still keep this.

547
00:46:37,631 --> 00:46:39,438
My heart is broken.

548
00:46:39,438 --> 00:46:40,450
By whom?

549
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:41,779
Someone who just became unavailable.

550
00:46:41,779 --> 00:46:43,545
You have feelings for me, don't you?

551
00:46:43,545 --> 00:46:44,810
Thank you for giving me a lift.

552
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:46,225
What's your name?

553
00:46:46,225 --> 00:46:48,088
You're in a hurry. I don't want you to be late.

554
00:46:48,088 --> 00:46:50,892
- Khai, who were you talking to?
- No one.

555
00:46:50,892 --> 00:46:54,880
You're not feeling well. I'll cancel our orders and bring you home.
