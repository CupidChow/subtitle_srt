2
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:10,840
Coming out so early
after sleeping with Bai Qingqing?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,080
The Prettiest Girl in the Capital

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,240
didn't seem to satisfy you.

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:15,430
What did you come for?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,430
Wu,

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,400
don't get me wrong.

8
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,150
I just came to see

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,680
if you like cheating on girls.

10
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,110
Wu, let me explain.

11
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,790
I care about no one, but you.

12
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,950
I spent the night with Bai Qingqing

13
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,560
because I wanted to make you jealous.

14
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,520
You have so many concubines.

15
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,040
Do you even believe

16
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:30,910
what you're saying?

17
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,430
Let me explain.

18
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,630
Don't bother.

19
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,040
If you really cared about me,

20
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,880
you wouldn't have ignored my feelings.

21
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,750
Looks like you're only playing with me.

22
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:39,590
That's right.

23
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,750
Don't believe men.

24
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm giving you a special mission.

25
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,930
(Slap Emperor Jingxuan.)
Slap him.

26
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:45,950
(Get the new mission.)
I can slap him?

27
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,310
It depends on you.

28
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,680
It's a special reward for the womanizer.

29
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,240
Wu,

30
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,240
are you really angry?

31
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,590
If slapping me

32
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,630
can make you feel better,

33
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:54,750
slap me as many times as you want.

34
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,080
I'm not angry.

35
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,400
Do I look like I'm angry?

36
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,940
(Slap Emperor Jingxuan.
Mission completed.)

37

(Slap Emperor Jingxuan.)
Wu,

38
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,360
(Mission completed.)
you don't want to hurt me, right?

39
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,080
I just don't want to hurt my hand.

40
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:13,240
By the way,

41
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,790
who on earth is Ye Chang'an?

42
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,590
(Ye Chang'an...)

43
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,430
(Ye Chang'an,)

44

(you look so beautiful
in the white dress.)

45

(Your Highness,)

46
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,910
(do I not look beautiful
in other dresses?)

47
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,200
(My future wife looks beautiful
in anything.)

48
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,110
She's an old friend of mine.

49
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,840
She and Bai Qingqing look alike.

50
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,240
So,

51
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,240
you're missing her?

52
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:40,910
No.

53
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,200
I don't miss her.

54
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:43,360
That year,

55
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,310
she abandoned me

56
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,520
and went over to my enemy.

57
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,200
(What a surprise!)

58
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,080
(He was abandoned.)

59
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,240
One day, I'm leaving, too.

60
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,080
Your Majesty,

61
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,750
you'd better choose a girl

62
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,430
who can spend her life with you.

63
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,720
What are you talking about?

64
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,430
Are you going over to my enemy, too?

65
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,000
Is that what you think of me?

66
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:03,950
Forget it.

67
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,750
You can't understand, anyway.
