00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:12,800
Your Majesty,

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,190
I think we're lost.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:14,750
I'll go

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,520
and explore the way.

6
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:17,470
Go.

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:20,830
Wu,

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,270
I...

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,520
I don't think I have much time left.

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,270
Could you fulfill my last wish?

11
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:31,910
Be my empress.

12
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:35,190
No way.

13
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,190
Your Majesty...

14
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:39,190
Are you out of your mind?

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,600
Be his empress
and you'll complete the mission

16
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,720
and return to the modern world.

17
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,240
Why are you here?

18
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,720
Aren't you supposed to be in Dali State?

19
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,830
I always do what's good for me.

20
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,030
Besides,

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,110
you'll be the Empress soon.

22
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,110
I no longer want to be the Empress.

23
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,670
When I'm the Empress,

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,110
I have to leave this world

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,600
and I can never see His Majesty again.

26
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,240
Wu,

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,550
no matter whether you're the Empress,

28
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,390
I can't accompany you anymore.

29
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,550
Your Majesty,

30
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,190
now,

31
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,390
I want nothing, but to stay with you.

32
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,720
Even one more minute

33
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:17,960
would satisfy me.

34
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,110
This is such a great chance.

35
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,960
Are you just going to give it up?

36
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,000
Long before now,

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,000
I indeed wanted to be the Empress.

38
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,910
Carried away by desire,

39
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,030
I did a lot of silly things.

40
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,470
When I met you, Your Majesty,

41
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,320
I came to realize

42
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,960
that love was more
beautiful and valuable

43
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,830
than material.

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,030
Have you thought about me?

45
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,880
What do I do?

46
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,670
Your Majesty,

47
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,720
I'm sorry

48
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,160
that we haven't found the way out.

49
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,160
We're in the wilderness.

50
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,750
All around us,

51
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,520
no one dwells.

52
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,190

Wait.

58
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,750
I want to be the Empress.

59
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:11,880
Under the condition

60
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,720
that you take us back
to the Palace first.

61
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,270
Back to the Palace?

62
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,670
What if you break your promise?

63
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,520
Unless you take us back to the Palace,

64
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,910
I can't be the Empress

65
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,030
and you can't get promoted.

66
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,160
Fine, then.

67
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,470
I'll trust you for this once.
