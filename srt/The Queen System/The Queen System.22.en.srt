00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,110
Ye Chang'an,

3
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,600
you colluded with the Luo Army

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,600
so that His Majesty and I were

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,160
nearly killed by the bandits.

6
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:18,880
Now reveal yourself.

7
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,360
Mu Wu, you wicked girl.

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,470
Don't sling mud at me.

9
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,030
What is this?

10
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,080
It's the legendary cellphone.

11
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,080
It has the evidence of your crimes.

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,240
This is the photo
where you wore the Emperor's robe

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,270
and held the letter from the Luo State.

14
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,470
What else can you argue?

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,830
At this point,

16
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,390
I no longer need to pretend.

17
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,600
I am Ye Chang'an.

18
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,190
So, it is really you.

19
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,470
The Luo Army will capture
this city soon.

20
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,270
Good days are numbered!

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,390
Good news came from the battlefront

22
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,670
that General Rui, with his troops,
repulsed the Luo Army.

23
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:01,830
Looks like

24
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,030
your plan failed.

25
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,000
Ye Chang'an,

26
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,270
you had plots within plots.

27
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:09,800
Guards!

28
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,190
Take her away.

29
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:12,520
I

30
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,360
don't want to see her anymore.

31
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,160
You were shot

32
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,960
and I'm grateful to Mu Wu for that.

33
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,600
Without her,

34
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,030
I couldn't have lured you out.

35
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:22,830
I didn't do all this

36
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,630
for the Luo State,

37
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,830
but for you, Your Majesty!

38
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,880
Don't you remember
what you owed me in love?

39
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,630
I'll make you die of love, too.

40
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,270
Master,

41
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,630
time to make good on your promise.

42
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,830
Let Emperor Jingxuan
make you the Empress.

43
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,390
As long as His Majesty can be saved,

44
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:52,390
I'll do it.

45
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,670
Why are you finding an excuse again?

46
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,830
I would rather serve
the Third Princess of Dali State.

47
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,880
Anyway, she'll be the Empress soon.

48
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,000
Wait.

49
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,630
When I become the Empress,

50
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,470
I can get many points.

51
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,080
Can't I exchange them
for His Majesty's life?

52
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,080
You can.

53
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,390
But...

54
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,880
But what?

55
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,550
But if you use up your points,

56
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,270
you can't return to the modern world.

57
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,080
Your Majesty.

58
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:35,550
Your Majesty.
