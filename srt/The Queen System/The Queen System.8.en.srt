(Bai Qingqing...)

00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:06,680
(She lives in the side hall,)

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,080
(but His Majesty still slept with her.)

5
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:10,590
Your Grace?

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,720
To what do I owe the honor
of your visit?

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,520
Did Wu Mu offend you again?

8
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,400
Qingqing,

9
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,080
I came to visit you.

10
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,080
I hear

11
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,080
His Majesty finally slept with you.

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,240
I'm afraid

13
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,910
Mu Wu will be in the doghouse.

14
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,000
That's not true.

15
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,840
Your Grace,

16
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,840
don't trust rumors.

17
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,200
Now,

18
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,790
you find favor in His Majesty's eyes.

19
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,000
If you still live in the side hall,

20
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,430
it'll be unfair to you.

21
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,750
How about moving into my palace?

22
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,080
No, thank you, Your Grace.

23
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:44,790
I enjoy living here.

24
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,520
Qingqing,

25
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,910
when Mu Wu is in the doghouse,

26
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:49,750
she will be your burden.

27
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,950
His Majesty often visits me, anyway.

28
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,150
You'd better live with me.

29
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,040
Qingqing,

30
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,750
don't go with her.

31
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,790
Or you'll definitely be bullied.

32
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,240
This isn't up to you.

33
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,520
I take charge of the imperial harem.

34
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,910
When I give orders,

35
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,470
you take orders.

36
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,040
You're taking her away
in broad daylight.

37
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,950
If word gets out, I'll be laughed at.

38
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:15,400
Be patient.

39
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,880
Noble Consort Li

40
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,750
will waste her efforts
on a wild-goose chase.

41
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:19,840
Cutie,

42
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,040
what do you mean?

43
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,400
I know exactly what she's up to.

44
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,750
Wait and see how she will
make a fool of herself.

45
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,750
(His Majesty didn't sleep
with Bai Qingqing last night.)

46
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:34,150
Wu,

47
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,080
the Luo Army indeed retreated.

48
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,200
(If I hadn't made them temporarily
retreat with my points,)

49
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,560
(I could soon afford a cellphone.)

50
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,520
All you care about is the war.

51
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,270
What's wrong?

52
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,310
Does anything upset you?

53
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,750
Noble Consort Li

54
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,040
took Qingqing away.

55
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,720
I feel quite lonely in my palace.

56
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,750
She did?

57
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,310
Tomorrow,

58
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,680
I'll get Bai Qingqing back to you.
