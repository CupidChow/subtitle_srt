2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,000
Your Majesty.

3
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:13,910
Your Majesty, where are you?

4
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:28,550
Your Majesty!

5
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,800
Your Majesty, where are you?

6
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:37,960
Your Majesty!

7
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,230
(Why are you gone?)

8
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,400
(I saw you just now.)

9
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:21,310
(Your Majesty,)

10
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,870
(don't leave me alone.)

11
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,310
Your Majesty,

12
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,040
I've found you, at last.

13
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,000
Was that you?

14
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,590
I failed to catch up,
however hard I tried.

15
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,710
Silly girl,

16
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,760
don't call me Your Majesty.

17
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,400
We're in the modern world already.

18
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,840
I don't care.

19
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,200
Either in the ancient
or the modern world,

20
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,870
you're always my emperor.

21
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:07,950
All right.

22
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,040
What...

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,950
Whatever you say.

24
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,710
Your Majesty,

25
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,840
let's never be apart, okay?

26
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,190
We will never be apart.

27
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,080
Because...

28
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,430
You're my empress.
