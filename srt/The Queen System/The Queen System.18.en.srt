2
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,120
Cutie,

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:12,400
come out!

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,510
What are you yelling for?

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,310
Children usually
get their fathers in trouble.

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,400
But today,
my "father" got me in trouble.

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,510
Get me out immediately.

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,510
Dead rats are everywhere in the cell.

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:25,910
I'm so scared.

10
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,720
Your "father" got you in trouble.

11
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,270
And now you want to trouble me.

12
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:30,870
Why must I help you?

13
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:31,760
Do you have points?

14
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:32,800
What?

15
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,190
You want points at this moment?

16
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,870
I had hoped that you would
complete the mission early

17
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,360
so that I could report
on my mission, too.

18
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,080
But looks like

19
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,510
my promotion has to be delayed again.

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,190
You used me.

21
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,630
How could you do that?

22
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:47,120
The points are meant

23
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,270
for the empress candidates.

24
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,160
But look at you.

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,830
I totally give up on you.

26
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,480
Cutie, I never expected you

27
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,080
to be even more heartless
than Emperor Jingxuan.

28
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,190
Don't try to cozy up to me.

29
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,950
I never believe in human feelings.

30
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,270
By the way,

31
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,680
the other day, the Third Princess
of Dali State was poisoned.

32
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,870
I'm going to work for her.

33
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:11,360
See you.

34
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,040
Then don't come back again!

35
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,190
Cutie, come back.

36
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,720
I'll be the Empress, all right?

37
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,400
Still want to be the Empress?

38
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,680
Your Majesty, what are you doing here?

39
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:34,630
Never you mind.

40
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,910
I know you feel aggrieved.

41
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,480
It's just a band-aid solution

42
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,800
to put you in prison.

43
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:41,950
In prison,

44
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,360
you live a hard life.

45
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,080
But you're safe, after all.

46
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,760
I don't want Bai Qingqing to hurt you.

47
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,440
Then why did you accuse me
of being the wicked girl?

48
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,480
I trust you.

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,720
I'm here to release you.

50
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,480
Actually,

51
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,400
I wanted to tell you for so long.

52
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,230
I'm not Mu Wu

53
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,870
or the Prime Minister's daughter.

54
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,720
I'm not your new concubine, either.

55
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,760
I'm just your sweetheart
who only cares about you.

56
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,550
Silly girl,

57
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,000
I knew that already.

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,630
However,

59
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,310
you and I don't belong
in the same world.

60
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,080
I want you to return
to the modern world.

61
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,760
Are you expelling me?

62
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,550
If you stay close to me,
you'll only be in danger.

63
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:28,910
When the war is over,

64
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,000
I'll go find you.

65
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,550
It's dangerous for His Majesty
to stay with Bai Qingqing.

66
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,680
I must go to the northwest
to find out the truth

67
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,230
and get rid of Bai Qingqing.

(Forests in the northeast,
Palace of Tranquility)

69
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,550
Who are you?

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,040
What do you want, money or me?
