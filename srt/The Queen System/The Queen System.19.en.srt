00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:11,270
Your Majesty,

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,630
Consort Mu escaped from prison

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,830
and was kidnapped by some bandits.

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,390
How daring they are!

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,720
How dare they kidnap my girl?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,390
I...

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:19,830
I'll go save her.

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,470
The war against the Luo State
is ongoing.

10
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,240
If you leave without the right reason,

11
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,830
I'm afraid the court will be in chaos.

12
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,030
Your concern is misplaced, Qingqing.

13
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:29,110
Mu Wu

14
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,000
knows too many secrets
of the imperial harem.

15
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,750
I just don't want her
to be caught by the Luo Army.

16
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:34,750
How about this?

17
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,880
Shall I disguise you

18
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,470
so that you can leave stealthily?

19
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:43,800
You want me

20
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,110
to wear the eunuch's uniform?

21
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,080
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

22
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,550
No one else will know it.

23
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,270
This is ridiculous!

24
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:51,830
Then Your Majesty,

25
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,190
do you still want to save Mu Wu?

26
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:55,390
For Mu Wu...

27
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,160
For my state,

28
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,160
I...

29
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,190
I will do anything.

30
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:01,440
Then there you go.

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,750
When you see Mu Wu,

32
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,160
bring my regards to her.

33
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,440
After all, she and I used to be

34
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:09,910
good friends.

35
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,470

Wait.

40
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,160
Wine will bring more fun.

41
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:22,630
More fun

42
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,630
will make us more excited.

Come on.

44
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,390
Get us some wine.

45
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,000
You should drink, too.

46
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,390
Drink like real men.

47
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,240
To make us close,

48
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,470
drink as much

49
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,520
as you can.

50
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,190
All right.

51
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:41,750
Let's drink.

52
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,600
Sweety.

53
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,080
Sweety.

54
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,160
Sweety.

55
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,080
Get up.

56
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,080
Keep drinking.

57
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,630
Why did you stop?

58
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,800
Get me more wine.

59
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,800
I had planned to save her.

60
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,320
Why are they all drunk already?

61
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,360
There you are, Your Majesty.

62
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,440
I miss you so much.

63
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,360
I'm here to save you.

64
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,110
Don't touch me.

65
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,720
I'm going to find His Majesty.

66
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,440
Here I am.

67
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,360
No way.

68
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,550
I'm going to the northwest

69
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,800
to find out the truth for His Majesty

70
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,600
and get rid of Bai Qingqing.

71
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,670
Let's not stay here.

72
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:34,670
Leave with me.
