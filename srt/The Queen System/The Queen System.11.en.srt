Mu Wu,

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,270
let me in.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,830
I have something important
to discuss with you.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,160
No matter what it is,

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,590
say it right here.

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:18,950
Let me in

8
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,440
and I'll tell you about it.

9
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:28,800
Let's make a deal, first.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,680
We must sleep separately.

11
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,040
Otherwise, go sleep outside the door.

12
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:31,720
All right.

13
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:32,760
I agree.

14
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:43,080
What does this mean?

15
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:45,510
We agreed to sleep separately.

16
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,190
It's the border between us.

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,310
If you cross it, you'll be killed.

18
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,680
I'm the one who kills people.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,270
No one dares to kill me.

20
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:53,830
Besides,

21
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,190
if I cross the border when I'm asleep,

22
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,160
what will you do?

23
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,550
I'll call the police
and let them arrest you.

24
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:00,440
You'll be in prison

25
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,720
for at least three years.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,760
What police?

27
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:03,680
Who dares to arrest me?

28
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,760
Forget it.

29
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,830
Anyway, I will

30
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:08,680
resist as far as I can.

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,270
Fine, then.

32
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,120
You...

33
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,080
You call the shots.

34
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:18,830
Why do I have

35
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:19,870
so little space?

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,590
You're lucky enough to have some space.

37
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,590
Don't complain.

38
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,190
Wu,

39
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,120
you also care about me, right?

40
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,120
Otherwise, you wouldn't turn up
over and over again.

41
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,230
I don't care if you're playing
cat and mouse with me.

42
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,910
But like I said,

43
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:41,760
I will

44
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,310
never force you.
