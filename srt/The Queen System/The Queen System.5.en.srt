2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:08,430
Who's there?

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,270
Do you think you can hide here
and meddle along like this?

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:12,950
You watched costumed dramas.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,200
You know how the concubines
end up, don't you?

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,520
I don't think I can live
to the last episode.

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:19,560
By the way,

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,720
I died once, didn't I?

9
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,240
Let me die again, then.

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,000
Stop finding excuses.

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:26,910
I'm warning you.

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,680
If you die again,

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,080
we'll never return to the modern world.

14
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,270
Then could you

15
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:32,240
give me

16
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,000
some pure missions?

17
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,260
(Kiss Emperor Jingxuan.
Get the new mission.)

18
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,550
(Kiss Emperor Jingxuan.)
How about

19
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,820
(Get the new mission.)
kissing Emperor Jingxuan?

20
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,500
(Kiss Emperor Jingxuan.
Get the new mission.)

21
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,590
As the daughter of the Prime Minister,

22
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,000
why do you do the embroidery so poorly?

23
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:50,750
(So,)

24
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,400
(I'm the daughter
of the Prime Minister.)

25
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,950
(Daughter of the Prime Minister)
(I'm really from a great family.)

26
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:59,080
How careless you are!

27
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,200
Why do you still do the embroidery
when your wrist is wounded?

28
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,880
I don't have a choice.

29
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,590
I'm doing this for you.

30
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,270
Before I got married,

31
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,150
I was taken good care of

32
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,470
and I didn't do any housework.

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,840
If I weren't

34
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,750
Lady Wu,

35
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,590
I wouldn't do the embroidery.

36
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,360
Feeling aggrieved?

37
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,080
I don't think you're that kind of girl.

38
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,470
In the Palace, as far as I see,

39
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,200
no one but you

40
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,880
dares to be against Noble Consort Li.

41
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,720
You're the emperor,

42
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,400
but you're afraid of your noble consort.

43
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,910
Aren't you too weak...?

44
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,110
Your Majesty,

45
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,400
it's been cold lately.

46
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,680
Put more clothes on,

47
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,560
in case

48
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,590
you catch a cold.

49
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,000
I know.

50
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,470
See?

51
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,880
I came to your palace

52
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:51,950
to get warm.

53
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,430
But I'm still practicing embroidery.

54
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,840
(Is she playing hard to get?)

55
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,110
Come.

56
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,240
Come with me.

57
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,840
(I'll see)

58
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,720
(what other tricks you can play.)

59
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,040
I'm a principled girl.

60
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,520
Before we're in a relationship,

61
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,360
don't dream to sleep with me.

62
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,840
Don't you get funny with me!

63
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,040
No concubine dares
to talk to me like this.

64
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,520
Looks like you've never experienced
the cruelties of life.

65
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,630
Let me teach you
what a good husband should do.

66
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,910
Fine, fine.

67
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,000
I won't sleep with you today.

68
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,750
I will

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,630
just sleep here.

70
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,200
May I?

71
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,270
Womanizer, get off my bed!

72
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,360
Mu Wu,

73
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:41,680
what did you just call me?

74
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,360
♪I miss you a lot♪

75

80
