The Emperor's robe

00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,630
fits me very well, too.

00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,620
(Grand Taoist)

5
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:24,440
Your Grace,

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
what are you doing?

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,880
Why are you wearing the Emperor's robe?

8
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:29,270
Where's His Majesty?

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,190
I'm afraid

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,000
he's dying already.

11
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,830
His Majesty has been nice to you.

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,600
Why are you doing this?

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,390
This is the secret letter from the Luo
I received this morning.

14
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,080
(Secret letter)
The long-drawn-out war against the Luo

15
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,030
has exhausted both armies.

16
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,390
My plan worked.

17
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,030
After Emperor Jingxuan is dead,

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,080
I'll surrender to the Luo State

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,880
and let it annex your state.

20
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,600
Under such circumstances,

21
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,960
shall I negotiate with you,

22
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,670
Your Grace?

23
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,440
You changed your mind so quickly.

24
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:04,720
You're indeed a pillar of the state.

25
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,830
You flatter me, Your Grace.

26
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,320
Without help,

27
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,550
I don't think you can

28
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,720
persuade the ministers to surrender.

29
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,440
If you promise to maintain my post

30
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,190
when you replace His Majesty,

31
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:20,360
I'll fully cooperate with you.

32
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,080
I feel so bored
when I have no work to do.

33
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,910
I'd like to take a selfie.

34
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,190
Sorry, Your Majesty,

35
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,080
we're late.

36
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,110
Your Majesty, how were you wounded?

37
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,110
I'm all right.

38
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:36,960
Wu,

39
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,110
you're awake?

40
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:39,390
Don't worry, Your Grace.

41

(General Rui)
I've sent for the doctor.

42

Who on earth

43
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,830
are these bandits?

44
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,550
Your Majesty,

45
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,440
it's a scheme

46
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,240
of Bai Qingqing

47
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,720
and the Luo State.

48
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,550
Your Majesty,

49
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,000
please make me General of the Border

50
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,470
so that I can end the war early.

51

Noble Consort Li

52
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,160
made many mistakes before she died.

53

Wu,

54
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,240
what do you think?

55
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,600
Your Majesty,

56
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,750
what's gone is gone.

57
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,630
Our state is at a moment of crisis.

58
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,830
Don't bother about personal grudges.

59
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,830
We should protect our state first.

60
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,110
All right.

61
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,240
I get it.

62
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,670
General Rui,

63
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,470
even at the risk of my life,

64
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,190
I will struggle with you

65
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,960
to protect our people.

66
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

67
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,320
I returned

68
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,240
from the battlefront

69
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,910
because I was aware that the Luo Army
advanced and retreated.

70
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,270
Looks like

71
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,080
they're just stalling for time

72
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,160
so that they can catch you alive.
