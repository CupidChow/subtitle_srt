=The Queen System=
=Episode 14=

2
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:11,760
Cutie,

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,080
you're the System Controller.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,400
Tell me.

5
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,760
Is Emperor Jingxuan fatuous?

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,800
If he is,

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,080
I will not waste my feelings.

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,400
When you're asking this question,

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,830
it means you're already
in love with him.

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:25,910
But remember,

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,310
you should make him love you,

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,830
instead of loving him.

13
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,040
I would in no way love him.

14
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,040
He's a playboy.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,870
Good.

16
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,230
Don't forget.

17
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,270
You want to be the leading actress
in the modern world.

18
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,630
You mustn't love this fatuous emperor.

19
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,440
Who on earth is Ye Chang'an?

20
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,400
She's from the Luo State
in the northwest.

21
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:49,910
And she's very scheming.

22
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,160
She made the Luo Army
advance and retreat

23
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,800
just to pin down Emperor Jingxuan.

24
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:55,950
Then tell me

25
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:56,870
how we should

26
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,270
deal with Ye Chang'an.

27
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:00,550
I think of a woman.

28
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,590
She can help us.

29
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:03,680
It's quite cold

30
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,510
in the Cold Palace.

31
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,590
It's warm in your palace, though.

32
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,190
You know what Bai Qingqing is doing.

33
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,440
I get you out, on one condition.

34
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,510
Now, our state is in crisis.

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,360
Write a letter to your brother

36
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,480
and ask him to check out
why the Luo Army retreated.

37
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,160
Imprisoned in the Cold Palace,

38
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,510
who am I to bother about state affairs?

39
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,400
How can you say that?

40
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,680
In the face of the nation's troubles,

41
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,950
women like us have responsibility

42
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,360
for the fate of our state.

43
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,680
I'm imprisoned already.

44
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,720
Why must I care about His Majesty
who abandoned me?

45
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:44,680
He's so fatuous

46
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,480
that he's seduced by the wicked girl.

47
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,040
He just deserves it.

48
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,440
Even if you don't care about the state,

49
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,680
don't you want His Majesty

50
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,720
to leave Bai Qingqing?

51
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,910
A fatuous emperor like him

52
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,310
would rather believe that wicked girl

53
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,510
than my brother.

54
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,440
Think carefully about it.

55
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,720
What did you come for?

56
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,510
To ally with you, of course.

57
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,950
I'm already in the Cold Palace.

58
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,720
Why do you both want to ally with me?

59
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,870
Don't think I don't know

60
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,120
what you and Mu Wu did behind my back.

61
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,270
If you want your brother to live,

62
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,230
you'd better follow my orders.

63
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,510
