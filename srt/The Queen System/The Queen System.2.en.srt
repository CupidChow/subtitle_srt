2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:06,310
(Wu Mu, the new concubine,)
I used to work for an old man

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,030
(The Queen System, to be unlocked)
who handles accidental deaths of the crew.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,000
Now,

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,680
he's finally about to retire

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,030
and will pass his job to me.

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,470
But unfortunately,

8
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,190
I have to bring someone back to life
before I'm qualified for this job.

9
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,560
I want to find

10
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,600
a sincere girl

11
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,070
who has a bad fate

12
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,430
and give this chance to her.

13
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,680
Then, her wish can be fulfilled.

14
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,600
Now,

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,800
you're the new concubine, Mu Wu.

16
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,150
Obviously, Noble Consort Li
tried to kill you just now.

17
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,030
Your top priority is

18
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,520
to survive tonight.

19
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,800
If you die,

20
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,110
you can never return
to the modern world.

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,190
Why didn't you tell me about it earlier?

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,310
I kept insulting them

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,880
and offended everyone here.

24
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,680
How can I wind this matter up?

25
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:51,880
Oh, I got it.

26
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:52,920
Just now,

27
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,230
before I passed out,

28
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,680
Noble Consort Li brought me

29
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,150
a flagon of wine.

30
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,230
Can it be poisonous?

31
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,600
I didn't bring the wine.

32
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,880
Don't frame me.

33
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,350
Then why are you
wearing the wedding dress

34
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:06,520
in my resting palace

35
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,920
on my wedding night?

36
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,640
Your Majesty.

37
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,600
Your Majesty,

38
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,640
my brother is fighting the enemies
at the border.

39
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,800
He's protecting our state.

40
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,760
But here

41
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,800
in the Palace,

42
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,190
I'm framed by such a wicked girl.

43
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,110
Your Majesty,

44
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,760
please straighten me out.

45
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,720
Empresses in the Palace, huh?
[*A famous harem competing play.]

46
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,030
You're just threatening His Majesty

47
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,110
with your brother's military power.

48
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,960
I have seen it all before.

49
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,000
Such are just old tricks.

50
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,760
What are you talking about?

51
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,390
You claim

52
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,560
that the wine is poisonous.

53
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,230
I would like to know

54
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,110
why you weren't poisoned to death.

55
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,310
Because...

56
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,800
I'm just lucky enough.

57
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,150
(Noble Consort Li is still denying it.)

(I'll give her a lesson.)

59

Your Grace, would you like some?

60
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,390
Your Majesty, would you like some, too?

61
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,600
(Why is he really going to drink it?)

62

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,230

67
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:10,900
(Lady Wu Mu, The Queen System,
to be unlocked)

68
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,680
The poisonous wine burned my wrist.

69
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,030
I should have had him drink it and die.

70
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,980
(Lady Mu Wu)
I saved his life.

71
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,880
(Lady Mu Wu)
But he only made me Lady Mu.

72
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:19,800
By the way,

73
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,920
I'd like to talk about the script.

74
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,000
After acting as a walk-on
for so many years,

75
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm finally the leading actress.

76
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,030
I'm all ears.

77
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,880
Wu Mu, the role I'm playing,

78
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,880
must be the heroine.

79
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,030
(Intelligent)
She's intelligent

80
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,190
(Gorgeous)
and gorgeous.

81
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,680
Though she's a girl,

82
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,270
she cares about state affairs.

83
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,350
I even came up with a name
for the script.

84
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,470
(The Story of Mu Wu)
The Story of Mu Wu.

85
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,350
Come on.

86
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,720
You're quite imaginative.

87
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:43,800
Remember.

88
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,430
All you need to do is act as the empress

89
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,560
and fulfill your wish.

90
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,030
However,

91
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,150
you mustn't fall in love with him.

92
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,110
Otherwise,

93
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,680
our mission would fail.

94
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,070
Neither of us could leave this world.

95
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,190
Don't worry.

96
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,960
Let me show you how perfectly I act.
