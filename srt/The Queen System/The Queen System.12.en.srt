Wu,

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,830
shall I just make you the Empress?

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,950
Then no other woman
will dare to bully you.

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,400
What are you talking about?

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,680
People are watching.

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,230
You make me shy.

8
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:24,720
(What a silly man!)

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,950
(He's quite straightforward.)

10
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:27,950
It's a great chance.

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,630
Say yes.

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:33,720
Your Majesty,

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,720
I don't want to keep anything from you.

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:36,910
What are you going to do?

15
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,230
I no longer want to be the Empress!

16
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,760
Think carefully about it.

17
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,630
Once you fail the mission,

18
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:44,800
you'll never return to the modern world.

19
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,230
I don't care about the mission.

20
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:48,870
I don't want to return, anyway.

21
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,040
When His Majesty is here,

22
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,000
why shall I go somewhere else?

23
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:54,680
Who are you talking to?

24
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,830
You...

25
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,040
You've fallen in love with him.

26
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:01,760
Who?

27
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:02,550
Who's there?

28
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,950
Are you indeed the wicked girl?

29
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:06,830
Your Majesty,

30
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:08,950
I'm not the wicked girl.

31
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,360
I just don't belong in this world.

32
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:14,310
The man there...

33
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,160
You can't see him.

34
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,360
But he's been helping me quietly

35
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,870
to become the Empress

36
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,440
and complete the mission of the System.

37
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:23,040
Now,

38
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,040
I'm going to be the Empress.

39
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,830
But I don't want to leave.

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,680
Your Majesty,

41
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,760
do you believe this?

42
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,510
I believe you.

43
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,080
I always believe you.

44
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,190
Come on.

45
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,080
You know what?

46
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,760
This is my secret base.

47
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,830
I take no one here,

48
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,550
but the man I care about most.

49
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,190
If

50
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,440
I weren't the Emperor,

51
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,590
would you still care about me most?

52
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:08,480
Yes,

53
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,400
as long as you love me only.

54
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,360
Actually,

55
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,590
I want to take you back
to the modern world

56
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,800
and live a monogamous life

57
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,440
where you only love me

58
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,590
and I only love you.

59
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,400
We'll be everything for each other.

60
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:24,630
I

61
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,800
also want to go with you.

62
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,510
I'd like to see how vast the world is

63
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,800
where you used to live.

64
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:33,800
How about

65
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,400
abdicating the throne now?

66
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,480
You want me to abdicate the throne?
