2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,400
Greetings, Your Majesty.

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,350
(The Prime Minister)
Your Majesty, I wonder

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,800
(The Prime Minister)
why you summoned me.

5
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:18,000
Prime Minister,

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,400
this is the wicked top
found in your daughter's palace.

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,040
She isn't your real daughter, you know?

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,630
Your real daughter
was poisoned to death.

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,160
Mu Wu in the Palace

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,830
has been bewitched

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,120
and tries to collude with the Luo State!

12
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:33,000
My...

13
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,760
My daughter was poisoned to death?

14
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,160
It's...

15
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:35,590
It's...

16
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:36,550
It's impossible.

17
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:37,590
I don't think

18
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:38,590
a top

19
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,120
can prove anything.

20
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,310
Prime Minister,

21
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,550
leave us.

22
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,680
Wait, Your Majesty.

23
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,310
The Prime Minister seems
to be kept in the dark, too.

24
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:47,870
Why don't we

25
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,630
let him see Mu Wu personally

26
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,040
and ask her about the truth?

27
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,040
Fine, then.

28
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:02,190
Who are you?

29
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,190
I'm the Prime Minister.

30
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:06,950
Oh, Prime Minister.

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,870
To what do I owe the honor?

32
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,360
I'm your father!

33
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,160
As the daughter of the Prime Minister,

34
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,720
why do you do the embroidery so poorly?

35
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:14,910
Father,

36
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,270
what brings you here?

37
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,310
Do you know this little girl?

38
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,040
Bai Qingqing must be testing me.

39
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,160
Isn't she my younger sister?

40
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,950
(Wan'er)
Hello, sister.

41
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,720
You're so cute.

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,480
Sister, do you remember
this jade pendant?

43
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,270
I do, of course.

44
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,160
I gave it to you, didn't I?

45
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:38,910
Nice performance!

46
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,040
Father...

47
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,160
Father, what are you doing?

48
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,230
Don't call me Father!

49
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,590
Wan'er is the Minister's daughter.

50
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,360
When was she your younger sister?

51
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,800
What did you do to my daughter?

52
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,400
Prime Minister,

53
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,310
are you aware of it now?

54
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,550
Your daughter was killed by her.

55
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,550
Your Majesty,

56
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,870
if you still don't put
this wicked girl in prison,

57
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,120
I'm afraid all ministers

58
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,830
will object.

59
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,400
Put Mu Wu

60
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,000
in prison.
