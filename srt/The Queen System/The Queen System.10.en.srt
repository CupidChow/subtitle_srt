2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,800
I'm so happy.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,830
You're back, at last.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,040
Did Noble Consort Li bully you?

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:11,720
She didn't.

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,190
Luckily, His Majesty went there

7
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:14,870
and she allowed me to come back.

8
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,270
To celebrate our reunion,

9
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,720
would you like some crabs?

10
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,590
Thank you, Your Grace,

11
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,160
but I can't eat improperly now.

12
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,870
Because I'm pregnant.

13
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,160
Pregnant...

14
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,440
Pregnant...

15
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,950
You're pregnant?

16
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,120
Don't worry.

17
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,190
I'll take good care of you.

18
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,000
Your Majesty,

19
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,400
you must find out the murderer.

20
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,550
I was finally pregnant,
but I lost the baby.

21
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,040
Who could be so daring

22
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,440
as to hurt my baby?

23
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,190
Don't be angry, Your Majesty.

24
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,480
Qingqing,

25
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,400
I can find out the murderer, too.

26
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,480
Tell us.

27
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,760
Did you drink the soup Mu Wu brought you

28
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,000
and then have a miscarriage?

29
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:02,590
I'm not sure

30
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,800
who brought me the soup.

31
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,160
But it can't be Consort Mu.

32
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:08,760
In recent days,

33
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,590
Mu Wu has been taking care of you.

34
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,400
I guess

35
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,190
she's behind all this.

36
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:16,550
Don't presume too far!

37
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:18,590
Do you still not confess?

38
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,190
Do I have to torture you?

39
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:22,080
Li,

40
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,510
when will you stop lying?

41
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,160
Qingqing wasn't pregnant at all.

42
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,120
I want you

43
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:31,590
to put up a show

44
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,640
with me.

45
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:35,760
I had my men

46
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,590
spy on you a long time ago.

47
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:38,870
(So,)

48
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,040
(His Majesty didn't sleep
with Bai Qingqing.)

49
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,040
You think I'm not aware of what you did?

50
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,680
Your Majesty...

51
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,590
That's right.

52
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,680
You're such a stupid woman.

53
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,550
What makes you think
you can fight against us?

54
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,440
Your Majesty,

55
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,440
for the sake of my brother,

56
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,360
please spare me for this once.

57
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,590
Your Majesty,

58
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,680
how are you going to deal with her?

59
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:58,830
She will be taken

60
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,400
to the Cold Palace.
[*Where concubines are imprisoned.]

61
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,590
It's wise of you, Your Majesty.

62
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,310
If you still didn't punish her,

63
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,630
she wouldn't know who was really
in charge of the imperial harem.

64
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,680
Am I right, Your Majesty?

65
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,550
Yes.

66
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,630
You are

67
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,400
always right.
