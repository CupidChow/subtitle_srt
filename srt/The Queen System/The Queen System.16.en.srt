2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,160
You shouldn't have stolen my man.

3
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:14,190
Your Majesty,

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,120
look how unruly she is!

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,720
She doesn't respect you at all.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,120
Mu Wu,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,800
what's wrong with you?

8
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,040
Why did you slap her?

9
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,400
I didn't mean to slap her.

10
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,360
My hand hurts, too.

11
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:26,910
What?

12
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:28,190
You feel sorry for her?

13
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,910
Anyway, you shouldn't have slapped her.

14
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,230
Without her,

15
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,000
the Luo Army wouldn't have retreated.

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,760
Whatever.

17
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,400
I knew you no longer cared about me.

18
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,080
Noble Consort Li used to bully me.

19
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,000
Now, Bai Qingqing is bullying me.

20
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,680
You only care about your state, right?

21
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:45,870
Forget it.

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,480
I will

23
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,120
no longer be in your way.

24
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,160
Mu Wu.

25
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:51,270
Your Majesty,

26
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,400
look at her.

27
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,230
Why can you say
she didn't murder Noble Consort Li?

28
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,480
She must be possessed
by something dirty.

29
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:57,830
She's so malicious.

30
00:00:58,510 --> 00:00:59,760
If you don't kill her today,

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,360
she'll kill me tomorrow.

32
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:03,510
Kill me

33
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:04,230
as you wish.

34
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,830
Anyway, no one in this world loves me.

35
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:08,830
Mu Wu,

36
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,270
apologize to Qingqing.

37
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:12,480
Then,

38
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:13,510
I won't punish you.

39
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,310
Why must I apologize to her?

40
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:16,680
Don't think I don't know

41
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,760
that you're just spoiling her

42
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:19,800
for the war thing.

43
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:21,950
Anyway,

44
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,760
all you want is

45
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:24,760
to retain your throne.

46
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,830
Why do you always
find fault with my throne?

47
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,590
Do you hate me

48
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,400
because I don't make you the Empress?

49
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,800
Yes, that's right.

50
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:32,760
(She really hates me.)

51
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,190
I'm asking you for the last time.

52
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,590
Which do you pick,

53
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,950
the throne or me?

54
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:38,950
Ridiculous!

55
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,310
Go back to your palace right now.

56
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,760
Without my permission,

57
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,190
you mustn't leave there.

58
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,480
Stop following me.

59
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,590
This is all your fault.

60
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,950
Now, I'm grounded.

61
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,510
It's no big deal.

62
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,230
Anyway,

63
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:56,870
you slapped her

64
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,910
and completed the mission.

65
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,870
You've got the points.

66
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,080
Don't you

67
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,310
want to blow them?

68
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,910
No.

69
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,190
I'm not in the mood.

70
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,590
Looks like

71
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,400
I have to grow old alone

72
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,360
(Grow old alone.)
in Palace of Tranquility!

73
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,590
(Grow old alone.)
Stop being so depressed.

74
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,120
I've got new pajamas.

75
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,080
Would you like to have a look?

76
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,910
All modern people dress like this.

77
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,460
