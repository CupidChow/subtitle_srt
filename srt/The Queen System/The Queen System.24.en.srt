Wu,

3
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,600
I didn't have time
to tell you something.

4
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,070
Your Majesty.

5
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,640
I've been keeping it to myself.

6
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,480
Actually,

7
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,190
at first sight,

8
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,710
I fell in love with you.

9
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:42,320
Your Majesty,

10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,430
long time no see.

11
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,670
You have pined away.

12
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,000
I don't want you to be so sad.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,880
I've been missing you all the time.

14
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:58,790
Is that you, Wu?

15
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:00,790
Wu.

16
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,200
Are you back?

17
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:04,840
Your Majesty,

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,470
I'm here.

19
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,670
Are you back, Wu?

20
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,710
I miss you so much.

21
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,950
Your Majesty,

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,590
I believe one day,

23
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,680
we will meet again.

24
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,950
I want to meet
Emperor Jingxuan literally.

25
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,430
Let me see him

26
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,710
and I'll pay anything for that.

27
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,230
Didn't you dream
to be a leading actress,

28
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:36,640
become a superstar

29
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,120
and reach your peak?

30
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:39,680
Don't you want it anymore?

31
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,680
Nothing can be as important
as Emperor Jingxuan.

32
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,350
I'm willing to give up anything for him.

33
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:53,680
You can return.

34
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,280
But I have to make it clear first.

35
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,150
People like us

36
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,840
believe in karma.

37
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,350
I can only offer limited help.

38
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,200
Whether you two
can meet and recognize each other

39
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,870
depends on your fate.

40
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:09,760
Your Majesty.

41
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,480
Your Majesty, where are you?

42
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,230
Your Majesty.
