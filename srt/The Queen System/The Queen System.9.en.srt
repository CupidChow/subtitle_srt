Emperor Jingxuan hasn't been here
for days.

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:07,590
Why aren't you worried at all?

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,000
What must I be worried about?

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,520
I've got enough dresses, anyway.

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,000
Don't you want to be the Empress?

7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,720
If you don't,

8
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,040
I have to be trapped here forever.

9
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:17,630
It's none of my business.

Fine.

can I bite him?

Wu, what are you murmuring?

Nothing.

About me?

39
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,950
I'm thinking

40
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,080
about how to bite you.

41
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:09,520
You're a young lady.

42
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,910
Why do you want to bite people?

43

Oh, no.

I don't mean that.

What do you mean, then?

46

Do you...?

47
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,040
Do you want so much to bite me?

48
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,790
Like I said,

49
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,360

Your Majesty,

55
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,200
my brother wrote a letter to me,

56
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,630
mentioning a magic

57
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,470
of the Luo State in the northwest.

58
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,360
With the magic,

59
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,040
someone's body can be possessed
by a soul from very far away.

60
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,240
There's no such thing as magic.

61
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,080
I didn't believe it at first.

62
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,750
But rumors

63
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,750
spread throughout the Palace

64
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,270
that

65
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,880
the wicked girl

66
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,240
lives right in Palace of Tranquility.

67
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,110
Your Majesty,

68
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,720
do you remember that Consort Mu

69
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,950
often talks to the air?

70
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,400
Consort Mu is in no way the wicked girl.

you're offending me already.

74

I'm caring so much

75
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,150
just about our state, Your Majesty.

The war against the Luo State is
soon to break out.
