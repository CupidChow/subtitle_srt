2
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:21,720
Who killed her?

3
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,120
How daring!

4
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:24,720
Don't be angry, Your Majesty.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,950
I don't know what happened.

6
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,680
I came to chat with Noble Consort Li.

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,590
But as I arrived,

8
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,120
she was already poisoned.

9
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,310
So,

10
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:40,510
she died of poisoning?

11
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:41,550
Right.

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,830
She was still holding a cake.

13
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,870
I'm afraid...

14
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,360
Was the food container here
when you arrived?

15
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:50,910
Yes.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The food container looks quite familiar.

17
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,270
It belongs to Mu Wu, I assume.

18
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,760
That's impossible.

19
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,360
Mu Wu wouldn't do such a thing.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,720
Eunuch Li,

21
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,000
recently,

22
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,360
who has visited the Cold Palace?

23
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:06,870
Your Majesty,

24
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,160
as far as I know,

25
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,310
Consort Mu came once.

26
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,230
But I didn't see

27
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,910
if she brought any cakes.

28
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,510
What did I say?

29
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,400
Without sufficient evidence,

30
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,360
we mustn't convict anyone.

31
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,360
So, Your Majesty,

32
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,510
I would do such a thing?

33
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,440
Like I said,

34
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,310
without sufficient evidence,

35
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,510
we mustn't convict anyone!

36
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:28,720
Murder is a serious crime.

37
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,000
I'll have it carefully investigated.

38
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,400
You make sense, Your Majesty.

39
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,680
In the imperial harem,

40
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,270
there are always tricks and traps.

41
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,120
Please investigate the case,
Your Majesty.

42
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,510
(What an annoying eunuch!)

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,550
(He's quite loquacious.)

44
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,870
(I'll cut his tongue one day.)

45
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,270
Will His Majesty

46
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,120
believe that I'm innocent?

47
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:51,870
Master,

48
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,590
don't worry yourself silly.

49
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,310
In my opinion,

50
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,630
you still stand a chance
to be the Empress.

51
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:58,910
Forget it.

52
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,550
How about giving me a new mission

53
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,120
so that I can get more points

54
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,360
and deal with Bai Qingqing?

55
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,400
Then in the next mission,

56
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,480
you can have some fun.

57
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,040
Go slap Bai Qingqing.

58
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,820
(Slap Bai Qingqing.)

59
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,000
(Get the new mission.)
I don't dare to.

60
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,400
Didn't you say
she was possessed by Ye Chang'an

61
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,720
and she was very scheming?

62
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,190
Are you

63
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,800
also bewitched by her?

64
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,830
What are you thinking about?

65
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,190
I'm your exclusive helper.

66
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,080
Don't worry.

67
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,230
I'll keep you safe.

68
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,620
(Slap Bai Qingqing. Mission completed.)

69
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,510
(Slap Bai Qingqing. Mission completed.)
You shouldn't have stolen my man.
