1
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:19,719
It was such a beautiful place.

2
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:21,888
And in that place

3
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:23,923
was David, Julian, Thomas,

4
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,394
from our church garden.

5
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:25,585
Reverend Mother,

6
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:28,555
do you think that was heaven?

7
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,005
Am I still dreaming?

8
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:56,916
Yes, I'm still dreaming.

9
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:03,983
What happened?

10
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:07,754
When did I get back to the dorm?

11
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:15,195
I think nothing happened. I think...

12
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,533
But why are my clothes so dirty?

13
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,468
Did I take a tumble somewhere?

14
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,444
I did! I must have fallen.

15
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:42,522
Oh! My lips are all split too.

16
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,625
How did this happen?

17
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:52,232
I hit it!

18
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:54,701
But against what?

19
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:14,921
Was it here?

20
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:17,890
There?

21
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:20,126
Or there?

22
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,329
I can't remember!

23
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,702
I can't remember at all...

24
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:46,119
This isn't real.

25
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:51,224
It's all a dream.
I have to go back to sleep.

26
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:54,560
When I wake up, I'll be back
in my room at the convent.

27
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,030
I'm going to pray as soon as I wake up.

28
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,602
I think I can hear
the church bells already.

29
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:08,341
It's going to be all better now,
it's going to be fine.

30
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,310
Really?

31
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:11,411
Yes, of course.

32
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:12,679
Even your lips?

33
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,113
Lips...

34
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,855
It's... lips.

35
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,560
How is it all fine
if you remember the lips?

36
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,165
You've got one thick skin.

37
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:33,766
Then...

38
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:37,103
those lips were the lips?

39
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,708
I don't know. I do not recall.

40
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,577
What? Look at this liar.

41
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:46,612
You said you remembered.

42
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,514
You do, don't you? Don't you?

43
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,350
Let go, please!

44
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,485
Do you know where your lips
even crashed into?

45
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:55,655
If you pull something
like last night again, I'll kill you.

46
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,757
Getting drunk even though you can't drink,

47
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,726
then doing something stupid
you won't be able to handle

48
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:02,595
and doing things to the one person
you shouldn't! Don't do that again!

49
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:05,098
You're worthless than this orange peel!

50
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:06,466
I'm sorry.

51
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,168
If you know you're sorry,
then go apologize.

52
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,205
-What?
-You said you were sorry,

53
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:14,006
then go apologize to him!

54
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:17,543
Then it wasn't yours?

55
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,746
If it were mine, you wouldn't be here.

56
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,581
I would have thrown you off the roof!

57
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:23,149
Go apologize! Now!

58
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,557
He even feels funny.

59
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,160
What kind of a dude has such smooth skin?

60
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:36,129
Gross.

61
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:40,900
If it wasn't him...

62
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:43,736
then who was it?

63
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:05,958
Come have a seat.

64
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,930
You'll feel better with a cup of hot tea.

65
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:24,177
Last night,

66
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:26,345
it was pretty crazy.

67
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:29,582
-I--
-You were something else.

68
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:40,460
It was you.

69
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:43,796
I'm sorry.

70
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,999
I just went up to the roof
for some fresh air.

71
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,869
My head felt better but,

72
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:51,904
-but--
-But

73
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,173
you landed not in the best place,

74
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:55,575
I would say.

75
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:58,678
But to me, it's nothing

76
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:01,047
more than fainting
after hitting the bare floor.

77
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,116
-"The bare floor"?
-I mean,

78
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:07,220
I'm not saying that's exactly what it is.

79
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,055
What I mean is...

80
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,826
just think of getting hit
by a stone fallen from the sky.

81
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,361
Just think of it as bad luck.

82
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:16,896
I am so sorry!

83
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:19,665
Is that right?

84
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:21,934
Hey!

85
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:25,638
I told you to go apologize
and you're sitting here, sipping tea?

86
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,508
I am apologizing.

87
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,676
Not to Shin-woo!

88
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,947
It wasn't him?

89
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,183
It was Tae-gyung.

90
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,751
In your words,

91
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:42,321
the one who fainted after getting hit
by a stone called Ko Mi-nam

92
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,056
was Hwang Tae-gyung.

93
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,492
Fainted?

94
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,042
Tae-gyung!

95
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:04,911
Hey! Oh, no!

96
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,854
Tae-gyung's a severe neat freak.

97
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:17,723
And for that to happen to him,

98
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:19,392
I'm not surprised he fainted.

99
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,496
It's like pig poop falling
into a spring of crystal clear water!

100
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,832
Pig poop?

101
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,035
A tsunami of pig poop.

102
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:32,204
If you want to apologize,
try Tae-gyung's room.

103
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:34,974
Although, I don't know
if he will accept it.

104
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:50,756
Someone uploaded a video
of the club party last night.

105
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,660
BUFFERING

106
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,470
What is this?

107
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,113
What's going on?

108
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,248
Did Tae-gyung and the new member get hurt?

109
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:18,784
Jesus! Did they fight or something?

110
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,426
Stuff like this happened
right after the new recruit...

111
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:31,097
That Ko Mi-nam or whatever
must be a troublemaker.

112
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:33,099
Damn it!

113
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,568
He better not ruin their reputation!

114
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,288
I can't believe it,

115
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,057
but that actually happened.

116
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:03,129
I can't think straight in this state.

117
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,164
I have to clean myself.

118
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,604
Excuse me.

119
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:15,174
How dare you enter?

120
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:16,642
Get out!

121
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,513
I...

122
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:23,983
have come to ask forgiveness
for last night's events.

123
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,354
I cannot keep a level head right now.

124
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,557
I can't talk to you now, go away.

125
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:33,392
I have to clean myself.

126
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:36,729
It smells terrible.

127
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,434
Then, are you forgiving me for now?

128
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:48,040
Are you forgiving me?

129
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:50,609
Forgive?

130
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:52,311
Why should I?

131
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:57,283
Because maybe you are a good person?

132
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:08,561
I've always disliked people
that I disliked from the beginning.

133
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,731
Because those people
always did things I disliked.

134
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:16,001
I hated you from the start, and you did
the worst possible thing to me.

135
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:20,072
You'll only continue to do so,
and I'll continue to hate you.

136
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,274
You want me to forgive you?

137
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:24,610
It's not going to happen. Ever.

138
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,712
So get the hell out of my room!

139
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,284
You disgusting, foul puker.

140
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:49,101
You should have waited until I washed up
and become levelheaded again.

141
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,586
The smell is so disgusting.

142
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,065
That hurts.

143
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,012
Excuse me.

144
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:36,282
Can I leave this here, at least?

145
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,956
This is a scented candle
and herb tea that I made

146
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:45,591
from where I used to live.

147
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,562
The scent's supposed to help you
feel better.

148
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:52,298
I hope it's able to help you
lift your mood.

149
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:55,534
You said something smells foul, right?

150
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:58,037
This candle purifies air too!

151
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,338
Are you still there?

152
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:01,607
I'm leaving!

153
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,414
Oh, that's hot!

154
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:19,525
What do I do?

155
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,272
No, paper! Don't go near the candle!

156
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:34,406
It's dangerous!

157
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,210
Have to turn off the fan.

158
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:01,734
The fire, put out the fire!

159
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:42,574
I need water to put out the fire.

160
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,887
Oh, I think it's working!

161
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,203
I feel much better.

162
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:13,539
I should head out.

163
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:19,111
Oh, man.

164
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:52,644
Did you just...

165
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,514
spit in my room?

166
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:57,950
No, I...

167
00:16:58,417 --> 00:16:59,251
So I...

168
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,687
was trying to put out the fire.

169
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:03,856
It's dangerous.

170
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:29,248
Stand up.

171
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,053
What did you do in my room?

172
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:37,189
I just...

173
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:39,958
wanted to ask for forgiveness.

174
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,126
And this is how

175
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,128
you ask for forgiveness?

176
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:45,097
I'm sorry!

177
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,968
Let me forgive you in your way, then!

178
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,778
Hey! Are you okay? Hey!

179
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,381
-Hey! Hey!
-Oh, my--

180
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,950
Stop!

181
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,789
What did you do to him?

182
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:12,291
It wasn't me!

183
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:14,993
Hey.

184
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:16,695
Hey!

185
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:18,864
-Oh.
-Oh, no!

186
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:26,772
AMBULANCE

187
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,342
Be careful, please.

188
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:34,947
Careful.

189
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:44,323
Are you all right? Can you hear me?

190
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:48,560
What happened?

191
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,429
How did you end up fighting him?

192
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,334
He just beat you up?

193
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,937
I'm all right, sir.

194
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,710
God will punish him, mark my words.

195
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:09,381
Excuse me.

196
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:12,618
No, stay down.
We're almost at the hospital.

197
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,257
Hospital?

198
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,160
Yes, hospital!

199
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,529
You have to get examined!

200
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,565
We have to see where you're hurt
in detail just in case

201
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,434
something happens later on and all that!

202
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,036
Just in case.

203
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:33,372
But...

204
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:39,144
They're going to find out
that I'm a woman.

205
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:48,187
Excuse me! Can you stop the car, please?

206
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,401
I think it's fine now,
the bleeding's stopped too.

207
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:04,269
It's not that swollen either.

208
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,372
Hold this against your head.

209
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:09,408
Eat it when it melts.

210
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,210
Thank you.

211
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:15,914
Hwang Tae-gyung, that jerk.

212
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:19,184
I told Mr. An you went to the hospital
for examinations.

213
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:22,688
I made sure to stress it's an emergency.
That should have scared him.

214
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,924
I bet he's feeling really bad now.

215
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,761
Tae-gyung really didn't hit me, though.

216
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:32,364
You said you weren't officially a nun yet,

217
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:35,234
so there's no need to be all religious
and forgive him of his sins.

218
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:40,806
You have a terrifying lack of faith
in others' words, Mr. Ma.

219
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:43,942
What do you know?
The sole reason for that is calling.

220
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:47,312
What, Hwang Tae-gyung?

221
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:52,985
Mi-nam's in the ER
getting treated right now.

222
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:53,885
Put him on the phone.

223
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:57,289
Why? What for? What?
Going to apologize or some--

224
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:58,290
Put. Him. On the phone.

225
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:00,225
Fine.

226
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,427
He wants to talk to you.

227
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,173
Are you still at the hospital?

228
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:17,342
Yes.

229
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,414
You're not done?

230
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:25,050
Yes.

231
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:26,418
What are you doing?

232
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,989
Holding some ice to it.

233
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:32,357
Yes?

234
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:36,061
Are you worried? Is that why you called?

235
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,665
Worried?

236
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:42,200
If you are, I'm all right.

237
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,772
I'm not.

238
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:48,707
I'm only calling to drag you

239
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:51,109
back to Mr. An and make sure
he knows I didn't hit you.

240
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:54,813
That's fine too. I'll be sure to explain.

241
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:57,082
Where is he? Why can't I see him?

242
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,085
No phones allowed
in the emergency room, sir.

243
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:02,054
Oh. I'm sorry.

244
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:04,356
Wait a second.

245
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,893
If you're also at the ER,
how are you using your phone?

246
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:09,828
Excuse me?

247
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:12,497
Are you even at the ER right now?

248
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:15,767
I...

249
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:17,736
I'm...

250
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:18,870
You.

251
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:20,372
Where are you right now?

252
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,242
Eggs! Get your eggs here!

253
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:26,044
Fresh, large eggs!

254
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:27,112
-Eggs--
-You!

255
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,181
3,000 won for one carton!

256
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,718
Get your eggs! Get your eggs here!

257
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,588
Hey, can we get some eggs here, Nurse?

258
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:41,259
Get your eggs! Get your eggs here!

259
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:43,795
What do we do?

260
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,264
Just say we missed each other.

261
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:47,833
It will be fine.

262
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,474
A lie?

263
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:04,416
Just tell Mr. An that

264
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:07,119
Hwang Tae-gyung isn't at fault.
That should do it.

265
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,888
That's what he wanted anyway, right?

266
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:12,758
I'll be sure to explain everything.

267
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:14,459
Mr. Ko Mi-nam?

268
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,631
Mr. Ko Mi-nam, right?

269
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:20,532
Who are you?

270
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,603
I'm reporter Kim Yeong-ho from Nara Daily.

271
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:27,572
I see. We're not available
for interviews at the moment.

272
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:29,241
-We have somewhere to get to, so--
-I just

273
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:31,910
wanted to ask if you saw the video online?

274
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:34,746
-We didn't. Sorry, we have to go.
-It's nothing, really.

275
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:38,583
It seemed like Mi-nam here and Tae-gyung

276
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:40,185
weren't getting along well.

277
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,220
Did something happen?

278
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,158
You're hurt!

279
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:48,193
He's not.

280
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:51,696
Did someone hit you?

281
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:54,099
No. No way!

282
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,903
Wait, did Hwang Tae-gyung...

283
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:02,307
No! That never happened.

284
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:05,911
I can assure you,
Tae-gyung did not hit me!

285
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:09,281
I see.

286
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:13,485
I'll make sure to write
that that's what you said.

287
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,493
A.N.JELL HIT BY RUMORS OF CONFLICT
AND NOW, VIOLENCE?

288
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:28,099
What? Tae-gyung hit Ko Mi-nam?

289
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,737
"Ko Mi-nam's injury was significant,

290
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,841
but he adamantly denied being

291
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:37,108
hit by Hwang Tae-gyung."

292
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:41,580
Doesn't this

293
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:46,351
look like Ko Mi-nam trying
to get attention by using Tae-gyung?

294
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:50,355
Ko Mi-nam.

295
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:52,457
You're out.

296
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,264
No new members! Go away, Ko Mi-nam!
No more Ko Mi-nam!

297
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:02,667
No to Ko Mi-nam! Go away,
Ko Mi-nam! No more Ko Mi-nam!

298
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:06,104
No to Ko Mi-nam! Go away,
Ko Mi-nam! No more Ko Mi-nam!

299
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:09,641
No to Ko Mi-nam! Go away,
Ko Mi-nam! No more Ko Mi-nam!

300
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:13,144
No to Ko Mi-nam! Go away,
Ko Mi-nam! No more Ko Mi-nam!

301
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:16,648
No to Ko Mi-nam! Go away,
Ko Mi-nam! No more Ko Mi-nam!

302
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:27,125
The current top ten
most-searched keywords.

303
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:29,160
First place, "Ko Mi-nam." Second,

304
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:31,897
"Hwang Tae-gyung Ko Mi-nam assault."
Third place,

305
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:33,632
"Kick out Ko Mi-nam." Fourth place,

306
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,067
"You Are Beautiful." You Are Beautiful?

307
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:38,336
You Are Beautiful?

308
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,605
You Are Beautiful? What's this?

309
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:42,374
Fifth place, "Ko Mi-nam injury."

310
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:47,145
They're raving about you!

311
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:53,351
I think I need to go
and explain myself to them.

312
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:55,086
No.

313
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,422
Do you know what will happen if you do?

314
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:58,890
Want to see?

315
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:02,394
No to Ko Mi-nam! Go away,
Ko Mi-nam! No more Ko Mi-nam!

316
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:05,230
Hey, look, it's Ko Mi-nam!

317
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:07,365
-Go!
-Go!

318
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:10,769
-Crush him!
-Let me at him!

319
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:12,737
-Get him!
-Oh, my goodness!

320
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,240
-Stop it!
-Break it up!

321
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:16,508
-Get him!
-Crush him!

322
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,518
You see that?

323
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:30,956
I wonder what "You Are Beautiful" is.

324
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:37,596
Get him, Jolie!

325
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:44,469
Oh, my goodness!

326
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:47,806
Stop it, please!

327
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,412
Jolie, stop!

328
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:04,222
Hey, pig poop tsunami.

329
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:05,991
Wasn't it enough tackling Tae-gyung?

330
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:08,259
You just had to torpedo his room too?

331
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,301
I'll be sure to clean his room.

332
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:18,370
I'll pay you back in kind.

333
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:21,039
Angelina Jolie!

334
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,307
Get him!

335
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:24,442
That's right! Lick him to death!

336
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:25,577
Here too!

337
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,446
Yes, there too! Yes, lick him! Yes!

338
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:29,414
Yes, good!

339
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:31,082
Here too!

340
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:33,485
Good job!
Hey, where do you think you're going?

341
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:34,819
Hey, come here!

342
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,656
Don't do this! Let go of me!

343
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:43,662
He...

344
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:45,664
He's a weird one.

345
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,266
There's no need
to get all mad over a joke.

346
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:51,936
What, am I a molester or something?
Why scream like that?

347
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,307
He's the pervert that jumped Tae-gyung!

348
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,343
What a freaking weirdo.

349
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:07,786
I'm sorry!

350
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:09,054
Are you okay?

351
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:10,121
Pardon?

352
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:18,430
If you keep reacting like that,
everyone's going notice.

353
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:20,265
Excuse me?

354
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:21,866
See? You're doing it again.

355
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:24,536
What I'm trying to say is,

356
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:28,039
your anxiety and fear is very obvious.

357
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:30,442
It's small wonder why people believe

358
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:31,910
that Tae-gyung hit you.

359
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:35,046
Oh, that's what you meant.

360
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:41,753
That scared me for a second.

361
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,668
I better get this cleaned up
before he gets back.

362
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,309
"Heavenly Homecoming to Moon?"

363
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:09,714
"Mo Hwa-ran's Time Flying Backwards"?

364
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:12,283
What are all these?

365
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,654
"Mo Hwa-ran."

366
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:19,524
These are all Mo Hwa-ran's.

367
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:22,727
He must be a big fan of hers.

368
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:24,929
What?

369
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,664
MO HWA-RAN, THE FIRST ALBUM

370
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:33,171
This child.

371
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:34,906
Is this Tae-gyung?

372
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:38,009
What are you doing?

373
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:44,282
Are you snooping around again?

374
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,184
I wasn't. I didn't see anything.

375
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:53,391
Tae-gyung, hold on.

376
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:54,592
What's wrong?

377
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:55,593
The doctor said--

378
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,895
-Tae-gyung!
-Yes?

379
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,329
Tae-gyung?

380
00:29:58,696 --> 00:29:59,564
What's going on?

381
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:02,233
Throw him out of the dorm.

382
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:04,803
Do you want to add fuel to the fire?

383
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:06,704
Then I'll leave.

384
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:08,940
Why do you have to leave?

385
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:11,376
Tae-gyung, don't do this.

386
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,112
-Hey. Tae-gyung.
-Tae-gyung!

387
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:16,981
They started off on the wrong foot.

388
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:20,185
I think it would be good to give them
some time before it's too late.

389
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:33,331
The kids and their emotions...

390
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:37,769
Tae-gyung. Excuse me.

391
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:39,003
Excuse me.

392
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:40,839
Tae-gyung!

393
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,347
I knew it.

394
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:51,749
I told you
you'll only do things I dislike.

395
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,786
Just try to end it here for today.
If you cross the line,

396
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:56,321
I might really hit you.

397
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:25,884
Stay strong, Sister.

398
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:29,187
It's getting harder to stay here everyday.

399
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:31,756
It's only been a day,

400
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,892
but it feels like
it's been a year already.

401
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:36,494
I'm so drained and exhausted.

402
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:40,665
What do you mean?
We got through one day safe and sound.

403
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,201
They say you're halfway done
just by starting, so we're halfway there.

404
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:47,171
But he left the house because of me.

405
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:54,312
I really did everything
that he didn't like.

406
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:59,784
Sister, I actually want
to compliment you on that.

407
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:00,785
Look,

408
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:03,621
if you become close,
you'll get comfortable.

409
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:06,824
And if you get comfortable,
they might find out a lot of things.

410
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,660
But if he hates you like he does now,

411
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:11,930
then they won't come near you at all.

412
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:15,133
Then you'll be safe.
So you're doing great.

413
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:18,002
Do you truly believe I can do this?

414
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:20,705
Of course! For Mi-nam,

415
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:22,941
I know you can do it.

416
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:25,043
Oh, also,

417
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,879
it's unfortunate that the rumor's
about your conflict,

418
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:29,614
but you're trending.

419
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:32,684
Ko Mi-nam's become
nationally famous in one go!

420
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:38,189
So I've become a nationally famous liar.

421
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:49,400
But you have a greater chance
of finding your mom.

422
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:51,002
Cheer up, Sister.

423
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:52,470
If I become famous,

424
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:55,540
will our mom recognize us?

425
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,142
-So handsome.
-He really is!

426
00:32:58,209 --> 00:32:59,877
-Isn't he?
-He's gorgeous!

427
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:02,413
I practically raised him as a baby,

428
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,116
I fed him, I basically raised him, I did!

429
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:06,784
-No way.
-You don't believe me?

430
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:10,388
I'm telling you the truth,
why don't you believe me?

431
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,958
Mi-nam here is my nephew.

432
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:16,361
-Really?
-Of course!

433
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:17,528
Look.

434
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:20,565
He looks just like his father.

435
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,367
He's a chip off the old block.

436
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:25,269
He looks exactly like him.

437
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:28,373
But you abandoned the twins
at the orphanage.

438
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:29,574
Who abandoned them? Who?

439
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:34,512
Due to unfortunate circumstances,
I had to entrust them there for a bit.

440
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:37,749
I couldn't bring them back since
my circumstances weren't getting better.

441
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:42,820
But things are looking up now,

442
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:45,023
so I should go find them.

443
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:48,593
Like they'll welcome the aunt
that threw them away.

444
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,761
You're not even their mom.

445
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:52,930
You listen to me, all right?

446
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,733
What's better, a mom you don't even know

447
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:57,635
or an aunt like myself,

448
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:00,271
who's at least raised you for a while?
The aunt, clearly!

449
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,906
You had them for a few months!

450
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,741
So?

451
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:06,277
I'm better than their mom,
who threw them out

452
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:09,313
the moment she had them.
Right? Don't you think so?

453
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:22,026
Ma'am.

454
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:25,129
I came quietly, so make sure
the reporters don't swarm.

455
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:26,130
Yes, ma'am.

456
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,934
I'm at the Nyx.

457
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:33,204
I got it, Mr. An.
I won't turn my phone off.

458
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:01,432
It's been a while.

459
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:07,538
I heard about you while I was abroad.

460
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:11,542
Seems like you really
did get quite famous.

461
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:13,778
I haven't heard about you even in Korea.

462
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:15,813
Seems like you

463
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:18,382
have been quite forgotten, ma'am.

464
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:22,587
"Ma'am"?

465
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:25,490
You used to call me "Mother"

466
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,092
when you were younger.

467
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:31,028
I didn't know better then.

468
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:34,098
I thought moms were the ones
who gave birth to the kid.

469
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:38,870
Tae-gyung.

470
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:42,773
Don't act like you know me.

471
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:47,378
When I was young, you were too famous
and I had to pretend I didn't know you.

472
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,780
But now, I'm rather known.

473
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:52,216
So don't complicate things for me, ma'am.

474
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:09,167
Today sucks ass.

475
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:19,410
The Asian Music Festival set
for two weeks from now

476
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:22,313
will be Ko Mi-nam's official debut stage.

477
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:28,186
Didn't you say his official debut
will be during the sixth album showcase?

478
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:29,520
Mi-nam's not ready yet.

479
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:32,190
I haven't finalized the style
and the concept yet either.

480
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:34,125
-Right.
-No.

481
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:39,964
We're going to stomp out the seeds
of the conflict rumors with this.

482
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:42,466
And I've already seen Mi-nam's skills.

483
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:46,671
Start with their press photos immediately.

484
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:49,273
Yes, that's the spirit.

485
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:50,641
Freaking...

486
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:55,880
Yes, the jacket and profile pictures.

487
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:58,683
Yes, we'll be there in an hour
and a half if there's no traffic.

488
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,785
Yes. Thank you. See you soon.

489
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:03,087
Wait, what pictures?

490
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:04,855
And stage preparation?

491
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,757
I thought I just had to stay for a month

492
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:08,693
until Mi-nam can come back to take over!

493
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,128
The plan's changed a bit.

494
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,999
I can't do it. I can't.

495
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:18,803
You idiot. You should have known
this wouldn't work!

496
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:21,138
She says she can't do it.

497
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:24,775
What are you doing to do, huh?
She can't do it!

498
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:26,978
Is this a joke? Huh?

499
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,913
What?

500
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:30,615
-I'm going to--
-Wait.

501
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:32,917
Stop. Please, stop!

502
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:34,619
Stop?

503
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:39,924
Then, shall we?

504
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:43,928
Let's go, then.

505
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:48,299
I'm really sorry about this.

506
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:50,534
Let's go.

507
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:01,545
That's what it was?

508
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:04,915
What are you up to, Shin-woo?

509
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,118
Nothing.

510
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:08,619
I just saw something interesting.

511
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:10,588
What is it?

512
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:12,189
What?

513
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:14,358
Try to look for it yourself.

514
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:17,728
You might be too dense
to figure it out though.

515
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:22,133
Wait, what is it? Shin-woo!

516
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:24,602
What is it? Tell me!

517
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:26,971
Tell me, Shin-woo, please?
I'm going to die of curiosity.

518
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:28,973
Please, Shin-woo!

519
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,275
Please, Shin-woo, tell me!

520
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:33,244
Wait a second.

521
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:35,513
Oh! Ko Mi-nam!

522
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:39,417
He's such a weirdo.

523
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:41,852
Why?

524
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:44,121
He cried after Tae-gyung left yesterday.

525
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:45,956
He cried?

526
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:49,126
Yes. He was sniffling
as he went up the stairs.

527
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,228
What does he think he is, a girl?

528
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:56,233
He's strange.

529
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:59,437
For a guy, he's too thin and skinny.

530
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:01,539
Too squishy.

531
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:03,374
Too soft.

532
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:05,209
It feels weird.

533
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:09,914
You seem to like him.

534
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:12,616
You took care of him that night too.

535
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:16,120
That I did.

536
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,327
Take Tae-gyung to the car.
Make sure no one sees you.

537
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:24,762
Okay, I will.

538
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:26,163
Tae-gyung, you all right?

539
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,465
Let's go!

540
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:30,634
He's completely out of it.

541
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,970
Hey. Ko Mi-nam!

542
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:17,648
Who are you?

543
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:29,427
You're all right living with

544
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,828
such a girly dude?

545
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,063
It'll be amusing to watch
for the time being.

546
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:34,832
What?

547
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:36,333
What did you say?

548
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:38,702
I said, let's watch something.

549
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:40,037
Silly.

550
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:41,205
What?

551
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,478
Nice!

552
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:51,015
Good!

553
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:53,083
Nice!

554
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:55,319
Nice!

555
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:04,295
Your expressions are fresh,
but you're too surprised.

556
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:05,830
Do you have anything else?

557
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:11,035
Idiot.

558
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:31,749
No new members! Go away, Ko Mi-nam!
No more Ko Mi-nam!

559
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:35,185
No new members! Go away, Ko Mi-nam!
No more Ko Mi-nam!

560
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:37,121
No new members! Go away, Ko Mi-nam!

561
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:38,956
-No more Ko Mi-nam!
-It's Ko Mi-nam!

562
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:42,660
NO NEW MEMBERS

563
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:45,162
-Go away!
-Ko Mi-nam!

564
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,698
-No more Ko Mi-nam!
-No more Ko Mi-nam!

565
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:50,067
-Go away Ko Mi-nam!
-Go away Ko Mi-nam!

566
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:52,303
-Go away Ko Mi-nam!
-Leave the team!

567
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:54,538
-Go away Ko Mi-nam!
-Leave the team!

568
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:56,607
-Go away Ko Mi-nam!
-Leave the team!

569
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:58,776
-Go away Ko Mi-nam!
-Leave the team!

570
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:00,878
-Go away Ko Mi-nam!
-Leave the team!

571
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:45,122
We don't want Ko Mi-nam!
Kick Ko Mi-nam out!

572
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:47,925
We don't want Ko Mi-nam!
Kick Ko Mi-nam out!

573
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:50,661
We don't want Ko Mi-nam!
Kick Ko Mi-nam out!

574
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:53,397
We don't want Ko Mi-nam!
Kick Ko Mi-nam out!

575
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,066
Mr. Kim.

576
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:59,470
I'm telling you, the conflict rumors
about A.N.JELL are not true.

577
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:01,905
A rumor, that's exactly what it is.
A malicious rumor.

578
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,140
Yes.

579
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:07,211
We'll show you on the stage, you'll see.

580
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:10,714
Are you free for dinner tonight?

581
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:12,383
A.N.JELL FANS AGAINST NEW MEMBER!

582
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:38,642
INCOMING CALL
MR. AN

583
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:43,380
MR. AN

584
00:44:57,327 --> 00:45:00,464
You're so down, must be exhausting
being hated by a million antis.

585
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:02,733
I'm all right.

586
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:05,969
Yes, you're right.

587
00:45:07,571 --> 00:45:10,808
I've never had so many people
hate me before.

588
00:45:11,008 --> 00:45:12,443
It's a bit difficult to handle.

589
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,311
At least you're not running away.

590
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:16,447
If I run away like this,

591
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:18,449
I'll be a sinner for life.

592
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,723
I may be lying to the others for now,

593
00:45:26,256 --> 00:45:29,560
but when my brother comes back,
everything will be set right.

594
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,228
Then,

595
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:34,098
I'll be able to ask for forgiveness
for my sins.

596
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:38,869
I'm committing a sin,
so I must endure the hardships.

597
00:45:40,604 --> 00:45:41,438
Okay.

598
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:43,741
I hear you about the endurance thing,

599
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:48,779
but there's no need to stuff
so much in there.

600
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,714
Excuse me?

601
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:58,355
I did what you told me to do,
I put them in here.

602
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:02,459
Yes, but you only need two.

603
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:06,997
Yes.

604
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:09,133
I saw all the articles about Ko Mi-nam.

605
00:46:09,733 --> 00:46:11,769
So what? What do you want from me?

606
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:15,172
We're pre-recording the video
for the Asian Music Festival soon.

607
00:46:15,906 --> 00:46:17,341
But if you're not going to be in it...

608
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,077
Are you trying to fuel the rumors?

609
00:46:24,848 --> 00:46:26,884
Fine. I'll think about it.

610
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:29,219
"Think about it"?

611
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:32,923
The cue sheet's already out.

612
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:34,792
Read over it.

613
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:38,195
I emailed it to you. Check it out.

614
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:40,330
I will.

615
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:46,203
Open the mail in front of me
and read it. Right now.

616
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:57,881
One, two, three, four.

617
00:46:57,948 --> 00:46:59,917
One, two, three, four.

618
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,085
One, two, three, four.

619
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:04,755
One, two, three, four. One!

620
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:10,594
That all-nighter's paid off.

621
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:12,563
Barely.

622
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:13,730
Good job.

623
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,566
Did I do well?

624
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:21,605
Nicely done.

625
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:24,174
-Good job.
-You did well.

626
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:25,275
That wasn't bad.

627
00:47:27,744 --> 00:47:28,679
Don't be stingy.

628
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:30,113
-Fine.
-You did great.

629
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,682
Wait, this is a half of...

630
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:38,689
You catch on quick.

631
00:47:41,091 --> 00:47:42,025
Are you reading it?

632
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:43,293
Yes, I am.

633
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:48,332
Sung-chang. Are you dating
Kim Hui-jin, the actress?

634
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:51,401
Wait,

635
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:52,703
what?

636
00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:57,741
She wants you to pick up the watch
you left behind last night.

637
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:02,980
Oh, I think I forwarded you
the wrong email.

638
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,448
Don't read it! All right?

639
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:08,685
Don't read it.
I'll send the cue sheet right now.

640
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,487
Don't ever turn this off.

641
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:40,484
What is that?

642
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:46,290
Oh, the stylist.

643
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:49,960
Wait, isn't that Ko Mi-nam?

644
00:48:51,995 --> 00:48:53,597
This room's completely empty.

645
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:56,767
Will it be really okay, here?

646
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:57,868
It's urgent!

647
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:00,304
But, ma'am, here is a bit--

648
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:02,539
You. I told you to skip
the formalities with me.

649
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,775
Yes.

650
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:09,413
What are they doing?

651
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,982
It's urgent, take them off.

652
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:13,617
Wait, but here's too--

653
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:15,519
Hey. I told you, no one's here.

654
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:16,486
Don't worry.

655
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:26,263
Stay still!

656
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:30,000
Could they see us from outside?
Turn off the lights.

657
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:35,372
What the heck?

658
00:49:36,206 --> 00:49:37,140
What are they doing?

659
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:40,444
What is going on?

660
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:42,079
Quickly!

661
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:44,514
Hold on, it's not... I can't.

662
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:45,415
Come on!

663
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:46,850
What in the world?

664
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:48,485
What...

665
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:49,820
Oh, I got it!

666
00:49:52,055 --> 00:49:53,657
There's really only one left.

667
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:54,658
I told you!

668
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:57,527
You dropped this one!
I picked this one up.

669
00:49:58,295 --> 00:50:01,498
I told you to wrap them up securely,
so they wouldn't fall out!

670
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:03,033
What if someone else saw it?

671
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:12,209
It's fine now, I put them in securely.

672
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:14,678
I should make sure they don't fall out

673
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:16,346
by sewing them up in your pants.

674
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:18,048
Let's see here.

675
00:50:20,617 --> 00:50:21,785
That's holding up well, at least.

676
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:25,122
I tied it extra tight,
so it won't get loose.

677
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:28,692
It's not like you had big ones
to begin with,

678
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,293
but now you really look flat.

679
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:33,130
You're still a woman.

680
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:48,678
A woman?

681
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:57,421
Thanks to you, no one will figure out
that I'm a woman.

682
00:50:58,622 --> 00:50:59,456
Let's go.

683
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:00,424
VIDEO CLIP HAS BEEN SAVED

684
00:51:20,343 --> 00:51:22,312
Mr. An? I'm on my way.

685
00:51:22,979 --> 00:51:24,147
They're all in the practice room?

686
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:28,518
I'll be there soon.
I must confirm something. It's important.

687
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:43,100
Tae-gyung! You're here!

688
00:51:45,368 --> 00:51:46,236
You're here.

689
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:53,510
Tae-gyung.

690
00:52:06,022 --> 00:52:07,324
It's been a while.

691
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:10,360
It's nice to see you.

692
00:52:29,613 --> 00:52:30,447
Ko Mi-nam.

693
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:32,282
You...

694
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,454
Oh, Tae-gyung, you're here!

695
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:39,990
You just got here and you're already
taking care of Mi-nam?

696
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:43,960
See? Do you see that? They're so close!

697
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:47,364
They're such good buddies!
All those conflict rumors, rubbish!

698
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:48,798
-What is going on?
-What did I tell you?

699
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:51,801
You look so great together!

700
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:53,703
The two of you, please.

701
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:56,406
The best friends that you are, and pose!

702
00:52:57,941 --> 00:52:58,775
Wait a second.

703
00:53:00,076 --> 00:53:02,879
A.N.JELL, if you can all please
get together!

704
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:04,848
Go on. Let's go.

705
00:53:04,915 --> 00:53:06,783
On the count of three! Two, three!

706
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:10,453
I have to take care of something now!

707
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,656
Can't it wait? The reporter's still here.

708
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:14,624
We have to send Ko Mi-nam out of the team!

709
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:15,859
Tae-gyung.

710
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:18,495
You don't know anything about Mi-nam.
Mi-nam is--

711
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:19,563
Hwang Tae-gyung.

712
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:20,830
Mr. An!

713
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:24,301
Yes, I'll be right there!

714
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:30,006
I called him here on purpose,
to put those rumors to rest.

715
00:53:30,073 --> 00:53:32,309
Stay relaxed, for today. Okay?
Take it easy!

716
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:35,278
Mr. An!

717
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:37,480
Mr. Kim, I reserved
a great place for dinner.

718
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:38,715
Shall we?

719
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:41,284
Let's go.

720
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:55,031
For a second, I thought Hwang Tae-gyung
was about to hit you.

721
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:57,033
I was like, do I stop him or what?

722
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,802
But he came and just hugged you.

723
00:53:59,703 --> 00:54:02,973
It seems like the kid
had a change of heart, huh?

724
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:05,342
Yes.

725
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:07,611
His eyes were more menacing.

726
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:10,113
More menacing?

727
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,949
I think that's just his character,

728
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:16,386
to maintain a strong glare.
His concept, you know.

729
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:18,655
Anyone can do it. Want to see?

730
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:21,157
You do this, and this and voilà.

731
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:24,294
"How much? How much do you need?"

732
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,064
It was a bit different from that.

733
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,703
Anyhow, you did well today.

734
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:36,006
You should go wash up.

735
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:40,010
They're all using the showers
in the practice room.

736
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:41,811
The showers upstairs are all empty,

737
00:54:42,078 --> 00:54:44,648
I checked them in advance.
So you should use them.

738
00:54:44,914 --> 00:54:45,749
Go ahead.

739
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:48,351
There's no water coming out of the shower.

740
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:49,986
Really?

741
00:54:51,154 --> 00:54:52,889
Do you think the upstairs one's
broken too?

742
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:54,357
-Let's go.
-Let's go check.

743
00:54:57,761 --> 00:55:00,630
I just thought about this.
Ko Mi-nam isn't showering today either.

744
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,832
I think Tae-gyung was right.

745
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:05,235
He must be freaking disgusting. Right?

746
00:55:06,169 --> 00:55:07,070
I'm so hot!

747
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:09,873
Now that I think about it,

748
00:55:10,707 --> 00:55:12,976
where did she wash up until now?

749
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,622
PLEASE CONSERVE WATER

750
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:39,903
Yeong-suk, you know I'm busy
what with being A.N.JELL's manager.

751
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:43,540
You're here?

752
00:55:44,307 --> 00:55:46,242
Wait, you can't...

753
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:48,712
You can't come in here! Yeong-suk!

754
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:50,814
Hello? Yeong-suk!

755
00:56:03,993 --> 00:56:05,095
Let's go, let's go!

756
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:06,996
I'm so sweaty.

757
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:08,431
I'm so freaking tired.

758
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:10,467
-I call first dibs!
-Get off.

759
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:12,369
I feel so hot.

760
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:13,536
I'm so hot.

761
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:17,040
Is the water working?

762
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:18,375
Today is the hottest.

763
00:56:18,441 --> 00:56:20,243
The water's working, let's go!

764
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:25,815
Let's go, let's go!

765
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:28,184
Wait, can you...

766
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:36,292
-It's so hot.
-Today's the hottest by far.

767
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:38,128
-What the heck?
-Hey.

768
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:48,271
What do I do?

769
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:53,910
Hey.

770
00:56:54,444 --> 00:56:55,612
You already took a shower?

771
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:58,481
You're quick.

772
00:56:59,182 --> 00:57:00,550
Yes.

773
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:02,752
Aren't you leaving?

774
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:05,088
I will.

775
00:57:10,994 --> 00:57:12,762
Yes, I need to leave. Now.

776
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,939
I can't pass through that, I can't!

777
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:24,174
What do I do?

778
00:57:24,908 --> 00:57:27,644
Reverend Mother, what should I do?

779
00:57:30,313 --> 00:57:32,482
Gemma!

780
00:57:34,417 --> 00:57:36,286
Gemma!

781
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,399
Reverend Mother.

782
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,768
Gemma.

783
00:57:52,569 --> 00:57:54,204
Do not be afraid.

784
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:57,774
I'm very embarrassed.

785
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:01,978
You do remember the infant angels

786
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:04,347
drawn on the church walls,
don't you, Gemma?

787
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:06,282
Yes, I do.

788
00:58:06,749 --> 00:58:07,884
Gemma.

789
00:58:08,952 --> 00:58:11,654
Were you embarrassed of looking at them

790
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:14,557
because they were naked?

791
00:58:15,859 --> 00:58:16,793
No.

792
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:20,797
Think of them as infant angels,
in the bodies

793
00:58:20,964 --> 00:58:22,999
that God has given them.

794
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:25,535
Infant angels?

795
00:59:01,237 --> 00:59:02,138
All right.

796
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,308
Shall we head out now?

797
00:59:17,987 --> 00:59:18,888
Ko Mi-nam.

798
00:59:24,427 --> 00:59:25,795
I guess you do wash up.

799
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:41,644
It's crowded in here, so if you're done,
you can go outside.

800
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:48,618
I can't wash up if you're in here.

801
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:52,989
Yes. Yes. I'll leave.

802
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,942
Thank goodness. I wasn't caught.

803
01:00:20,516 --> 01:00:21,451
You were.

804
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:23,186
Excuse me?

805
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:32,996
You got caught red-handed by me.

806
01:00:40,169 --> 01:00:41,804
Reverend Mother, what do I do?

807
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:45,541
I don't think I got out safely.

808
01:00:54,617 --> 01:00:56,719
