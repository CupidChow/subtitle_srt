1
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:08,368
Ko Mi-nam.

2
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,403
You're a funny one.

3
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,682
Reverend Mother,

4
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:27,620
the star in my heart exploded
into a thousand million fragments.

5
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:30,123
What do I do now?

6
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:47,207
I lost it for a second
because I was so angry.

7
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:51,010
I'm usually not like this at all.

8
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:52,512
Why did I do that?

9
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:55,882
Oh! Is it Ko Mi-nam?

10
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:36,756
It feels like fireworks
are going off in my chest.

11
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:39,259
I feel dizzy...

12
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:52,605
Shin-woo?

13
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:55,408
Why's he calling me?

14
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,412
Oh, right. I promised to meet up with him.

15
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,785
-Mi-nam, where are you?
-Me?

16
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:07,820
I'm...

17
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:10,223
Where am I again?

18
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,858
Is something wrong? Are you all right?

19
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:13,860
I...

20
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,129
There are fireworks...

21
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,632
Okay, Mi-nam, focus.
Tell me where you are right now.

22
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:20,600
I'll go to you.

23
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,249
I should rest

24
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,151
until the fireworks die down.

25
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:45,658
Why did he do that?

26
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,731
Tae-gyung, why did you do that?

27
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:54,968
What do you think?

28
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:57,604
Why do you think I did that, Ko Mi-nam?

29
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:07,413
Was he angry?

30
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,583
He didn't do that the other times
he was angry.

31
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,655
Then why did you do that this time?

32
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:21,894
What do you think?

33
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:26,199
Why do you think I did it, Ko Mi-nam?

34
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,042
He's not like that.

35
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,981
So why did you do that, seriously...

36
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,793
What do you think?

37
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:57,163
Why do you think
I did that to you, Ko Mi-nam?

38
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,206
The fireworks won't stop.

39
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:09,075
What do I do?

40
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,751
How do I send Ko Mi-nam
back to where she's from?

41
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,021
Should I tell Hwang Tae-gyung
all about the convent thing?

42
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:26,259
No, I have to be careful
and play my cards right this time.

43
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:37,337
Everything would be fine
if he just liked me...

44
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,440
but I bet he's still mad at me.

45
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:51,317
He won't even acknowledge me?

46
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:52,485
Hey, Hwang Tae-gyung!

47
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,125
Are you still mad at me?

48
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,128
I have nothing to be mad about

49
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,230
I know you'll keep being you,
so I have nothing to say.

50
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:05,598
I have a lot on my mind right now

51
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:07,767
So just go.

52
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:09,569
Hey.

53
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,138
You're not even going to get mad at me?

54
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,441
Am I nothing to you?

55
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,878
How can a woman like me be nothing?

56
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,947
I'm pretty, I'm super popular.

57
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:25,551
We were named
The Best Matched Couple in Korea.

58
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:28,955
How could you not like me?

59
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,059
Yes,

60
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,462
it is true that you're pretty and popular.

61
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:39,232
But this relationship is a fake and a lie.

62
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:40,500
Don't get confused.

63
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,936
Then what will you do if Ko Mi-nam
gets confused and says she likes you?

64
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:52,812
She won't get confused by me.

65
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:56,783
She's dead set,
even throwing away her pride like a fool.

66
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,333
What is she dead set on?

67
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:22,008
Enough about her. Go.

68
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:23,709
Then...

69
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,345
don't you get confused
by Ko Mi-nam either.

70
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:34,720
Ko Mi-nam is a guy!

71
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:37,857
Don't confuse her as a woman.

72
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:40,626
I...

73
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:44,964
I'm not one to get confused.

74
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,300
Ko Mi-nam is not a woman.

75
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:51,037
Then when you...

76
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:55,441
bought her a hairpin and clothes
and took care of her,

77
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,944
was that all insignificant?
All meaningless?

78
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,182
Yes. It all meant nothing.

79
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,951
I just did those things. It's nothing!

80
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,928
That's what you think! Do you really think
she feels the same way?

81
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:36,749
She...

82
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:39,452
She was indifferent.

83
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:40,686
Yes?

84
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,289
Still. Don't be nice to her.

85
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,425
I'll decide
whether I'll be nice to her or not!

86
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,427
Mind your own business and leave!

87
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:51,931
Why are you getting mad at me?

88
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:56,302
He got mad at me.

89
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:59,105
That's better than indifference,
I suppose.

90
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,175
You heard that, didn't you, Ko Mi-nam?

91
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,444
You're nothing to him.

92
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,116
She was calm. Indifferent.

93
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:13,853
How could she be so unaffected?

94
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:17,657
Whatever. It didn't affect me either.

95
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,892
If you get pissed, you lose.

96
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,302
It meant nothing to him.

97
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,437
I'm nothing to him.

98
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:34,907
Yet I still wanted to ask him
why he did all that. I'm so stupid.

99
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:37,476
Reverend Mother.

100
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,713
I'm so upset and embarrassed
and humiliated.

101
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,009
She said she was here. But where is she?

102
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,885
Mi-nam, please, pick up the phone.

103
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,059
Is she sick again? Did something happen?

104
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:09,869
Is that you, Mi-nam?

105
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,441
I was so worried about you.

106
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:16,876
What are you doing in the dark?

107
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,478
Don't turn on the lights!

108
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:24,550
What's wrong with you?

109
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,620
Don't turn on the lights. Please.

110
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,590
I just want to stay in the dark.

111
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:37,496
I'm so embarrassed about my heart
and feelings...

112
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,534
I just want to hide them away
in the darkness.

113
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,745
How long were you planning
to stay and cry like this?

114
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,150
After you finished crying,

115
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,119
did you even think of coming to me?

116
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:03,989
Shin-woo...

117
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,127
No. You had completely forgotten about me.

118
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:12,631
And yet...

119
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,234
I waited for you.

120
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:17,203
I ended up running back to you.

121
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,772
I feel like a fool for getting my hopes up
and worrying for you!

122
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,817
I'm so sorry for breaking
my promise to you.

123
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:35,187
I was too selfish
and only thought of myself.

124
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:39,325
I'm so tired of putting you first
and being thoughtful.

125
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:44,563
See for yourself,
see how I feel in the light!

126
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:07,753
Mi-nam. You...

127
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,421
I'm sorry.

128
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,693
I'm sorry.

129
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,229
I'm so sorry...

130
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:20,065
I'm sorry.

131
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:26,739
Don't cry.

132
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:29,241
It's all right.

133
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:33,112
Sorry I got mad at you.

134
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,550
Why did I do that?

135
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:14,420
I was very angry, that's why.

136
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,325
Why was I angry?

137
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:23,529
Because Ko Mi-nam was being an idiot
and said she'll go to Shin-woo.

138
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:28,901
Why did I stop her?

139
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:31,670
Because I didn't want her to get hurt.

140
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:35,040
Why don't I want that?

141
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:38,811
What is Ko Mi-nam to me?

142
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,956
This is complicated. And confusing.

143
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,094
I need to see Ko Mi-nam under bright light
and think about this again.

144
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:00,432
Today,

145
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,803
I rented a restaurant
just to confess to her, you know.

146
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,173
I shelled out a small fortune.

147
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:10,976
But it's all gone to waste now.

148
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:13,979
I'm sorry.

149
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:17,816
I had planned a really cheesy event too.

150
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:21,186
I was going to give her flowers
and a present...

151
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:24,757
and serenade her.

152
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:30,095
But it's all ruined now because of me.

153
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,499
Yes. It's all your fault.

154
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:41,106
I'm just kidding. It's not your fault.

155
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,043
I guess she's not ready yet.

156
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:47,646
I'll just be a fool

157
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,515
for a little longer, I guess.

158
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,651
Even if it's much later,

159
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:56,455
if she receives the flowers and present
and hears your song,

160
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:00,559
she'll know your feelings for her.

161
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:02,861
You think so?

162
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,199
The flowers and present are a no-go,

163
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:09,969
but I guess I can still sing.

164
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:17,643
You're going to sing it now?

165
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:24,550
Sure, for practice.

166
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,618
You hear it first.

167
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,888
Yes. I'll listen to it carefully.

168
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:31,357
Oh. You know what,

169
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:33,225
I should change the title.

170
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,662
What should I change it to?

171
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,233
"A Song For A Fool." That sounds good.

172
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,343
Because I'm a fool

173
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:55,147
I guess it's all right if I get hurt

174
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,984
They tease me, saying it's a foolish love

175
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:03,389
But I'm just a fool, just a fool

176
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:07,426
I treated her well because I wanted to

177
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:11,597
That was enough to make me happy

178
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:15,734
Just one smile from her

179
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:19,471
Is all I need to be happy

180
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:23,609
Until the person she loves
appears in front of her

181
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:28,013
I'll just stay here, by her side

182
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,551
I'm happy that I can give
everything to my love

183
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:36,121
I don't expect anything back

184
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:40,292
I'll always be there,
close enough for her to reach

185
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:44,663
I'll always be there,
close enough to answer to her call

186
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:49,234
I'll always be there, now and forever

187
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:53,439
Because I love her

188
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:57,643
Because I'm a fool

189
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:14,993
That was a beautiful song.

190
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:18,330
Don't you think it's too stupid?

191
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:23,102
You're not ashamed or embarrassed
of how you feel.

192
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:24,770
You aren't apologetic for it.

193
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,306
All you're doing is loving her,
with all your heart.

194
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,909
He may be a fool,
but he's an awesome fool.

195
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,016
Do you think someone who is nothing

196
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:41,053
can become that awesome?

197
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,191
It's possible that the other person
may not know anything.

198
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,127
But no one is nothing.

199
00:18:58,537 --> 00:18:59,371
Yes.

200
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:01,807
Crying because you're nothing

201
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,476
is more foolish than a fool.

202
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:22,327
Buy me something to eat
in return for the song. I'm hungry.

203
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,169
Let's go somewhere as expensive
as the restaurant.

204
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,404
I don't have that much money.

205
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:36,508
I'll loan you some money, then.
Pay me back with lots of interest.

206
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:56,995
What do you want to eat, Shin-woo?

207
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:11,276
In bright light, it's even more confusing.

208
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:13,745
What is she to me, exactly?

209
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:19,818
Yes, Mr. An.

210
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,926
You even sent along a flower basket
for the song request

211
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:29,761
and you succeeded in persuading him!

212
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:32,631
He's one heck of a stubborn kid,
how did you get through him?

213
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,801
He must have liked the song.

214
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:38,036
How was it?

215
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:42,641
The lyric begging for the person
to please come back was impactful.

216
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:47,579
That lyric is why this song
is so important to me.

217
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,450
You did resolve
the copyright issue, right?

218
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:53,218
Yes.

219
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:57,422
I take it that you met up
with the composer and hit it off again.

220
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:00,392
Hey.

221
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,961
The composer, Mr. Ko Jae-hyeon,
passed away a long time ago.

222
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:04,062
You didn't know?

223
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:05,697
What?

224
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:14,506
Were you any successful
in finding his children?

225
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:19,544
Yes. I think I can find one of the twins.

226
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,914
They must be so big now.

227
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,485
Were you close with Mr. Ko?

228
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:29,621
I mean, if you know his children,
I assume you were...

229
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,693
I don't know if they would remember me,
I saw them when they were quite young.

230
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:38,063
They sang really well. They were adorable.

231
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:44,303
I still remember them fighting over
the cookies I made for them.

232
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:01,253
Oh, excuse me.

233
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,062
I didn't know he died.

234
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:14,499
If he wasn't, I would be by his side now,

235
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,070
not trying to make a memory with his song.

236
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,741
That man is just the same as you.

237
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,547
The woman who abandoned
her kid for "love,"

238
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:33,852
and the man who made a love song
for the two. You're both the same.

239
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:36,121
I'm sure you suited each other.

240
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:39,758
The kids' mother...

241
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,095
died as soon as she gave birth.

242
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:48,100
So you made desserts and laid them
at their feet, to be their mother?

243
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,034
Yes, I did.

244
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,803
I loved him so much,

245
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:54,306
I was willing to be their mother.

246
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:57,676
Be their what?

247
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:01,713
If he didn't pass away so early,

248
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,683
they would have been your siblings.

249
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:10,021
I can't believe you actually
thought of being a mother to someone.

250
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,924
What a terrifying love.

251
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:14,793
It is.

252
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:17,896
My love is terrifyingly great.

253
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:22,200
Then go find them and play mother.

254
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:25,871
The song will be my congratulatory gift.

255
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:40,412
By the way, when you tell me
I'm really cool,

256
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:42,414
why don't you do this?

257
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:43,482
Right.

258
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:45,383
You're really cool!

259
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,922
If she would come now and distract me
with all her clumsiness,

260
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,858
she would be quite useful.

261
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,452
Today is the most precious day,

262
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,854
for you were born.

263
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:26,892
Thank you for being born.

264
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,384
I'm glad to hear
that my fingers were useful!

265
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:56,021
If I had known, I should have
just glued all ten of them together!

266
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,505
His car's here,
so I assume he's also home.

267
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,379
I hope he's all right.

268
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:25,450
Maybe something happened
with his mother again.

269
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:45,604
He's still not asleep.

270
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,540
Did something really happen?

271
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,001
Well, I guess...

272
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:18,536
she wasn't that unaffected.

273
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:37,255
He looks so down,
I can't cause him more trouble.

274
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:53,738
No, I should tell him that I'm all right

275
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:55,774
so he wouldn't waste his time
worrying about me.

276
00:27:58,810 --> 00:27:59,711
Tae-gyung.

277
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:03,081
I'm really all right.

278
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:10,388
Did I make a typo?

279
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:15,760
Tae-gyung. That was pretty good.

280
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:17,896
Oh, no!

281
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:19,464
Not "pretty good"!

282
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:21,666
If he sees this
he'll misunderstand for sure!

283
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:23,501
That's not what I meant to send!

284
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:25,637
What do I do?

285
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,212
What do I do?

286
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:35,980
Right.

287
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,383
The music's so loud, it probably
drowned out the notification.

288
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:41,386
Yes, if he saw it
he would have come after me already.

289
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,822
I have to erase it before he sees it!

290
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:52,731
Tae-gyung?

291
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:56,134
Is he in the bathroom?

292
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,338
I have to find his phone quick!
Where is it?

293
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:31,402
I have to erase it! Quickly!

294
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:34,472
Password? What the heck is this?

295
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,407
What do I do? What could his password be?

296
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,509
What is it?

297
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,321
Four, eight, two, zero.

298
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:53,258
Four, eight, two, zero.

299
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:55,326
It worked!

300
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:09,741
"Tae-gyung.

301
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:12,377
That was pretty good"?

302
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:15,013
It was a typo! A typo!

303
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,283
I meant to write "all right"!
"I'm really all right"!

304
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,252
I really didn't mean to write
"That was pretty good"!

305
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:24,656
You never fail to meet my expectations.

306
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:27,258
Pig Rabbit.

307
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:29,594
"That was pretty good"?

308
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,600
I'm sorry.

309
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,607
Ko Mi-nam.

310
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:48,313
Phone.

311
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:56,921
Are you really all right?

312
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,427
Yes. I'm really all right.

313
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:05,930
Fine.

314
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:09,234
Then I'll delete "That was pretty good."

315
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,040
From today on, this incident

316
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:17,709
has been all deleted.

317
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,046
Yes. Please, delete it all.

318
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,951
DELETE THIS MESSAGE? YES

319
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:35,193
Ko Mi-nam.

320
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,965
You're going to bruise something fierce.

321
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:54,245
You know we have a photoshoot tomorrow.

322
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:56,381
Be sure to apply it amply,
so the bruise doesn't last.

323
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:58,683
Thank you.

324
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:06,991
Make sure it doesn't get in your eyes.

325
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:12,130
Ouch, it hurts!

326
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:14,332
Don't rub them!

327
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,100
It stings, it hurts!

328
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:18,970
Don't touch! It will make more go in.
Stay still!

329
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:21,506
It stings, it hurts! It hurts so much!

330
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:24,809
Water. Rinse with running water.

331
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:30,548
It stings so much, it hurts.

332
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:31,549
Stay still.

333
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:33,818
Put out your face.

334
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:37,755
Stay still! I told you not to touch it!

335
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:39,524
That's cold!

336
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:46,831
Is it better now?

337
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:52,070
It still prickles
and it's hard to open my eyes.

338
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:56,441
Just don't open them
and go straight to bed.

339
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:59,644
Yes, I will. Thank you.

340
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,546
Good night.

341
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:08,186
Be careful!

342
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,421
I'm sorry.

343
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:16,361
Ko Mi-nam. Let's go.

344
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:28,773
Stairs.

345
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:50,628
Tae-gyung.

346
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:55,566
Are you mad at me?

347
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:02,407
You can't even see,
how do you know if I'm mad or not?

348
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:08,546
Because I'm a nuisance
that keeps making you angry.

349
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:17,989
At first, yes.

350
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:19,924
That's what you were to me.

351
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:28,366
But now, you're...

352
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:36,307
Whatever I am to you, I'm fine with it.

353
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:41,212
Anyhow, I was smiling just now.

354
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,081
I'm not mad at you.

355
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:45,650
That's good to hear.

356
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:04,135
Nice, get a little closer!
Act like you're close! Great!

357
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,237
A little more. Jump! Higher!

358
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:55,953
Mi-nam's premiere didn't go
as planned and wasn't successful.

359
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,788
So this photoshoot
really has to garner attention.

360
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:00,324
Thank you so much for agreeing
to be a part of it, He-i.

361
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:01,926
Of course.

362
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,661
Anything for Tae-gyung.

363
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:06,931
Where are these kids, anyway?

364
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,336
Ko Mi-nam.

365
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:16,073
I want to shoot with you.
Don't we have any shoots together?

366
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:17,608
I'm sure there will be later.

367
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:22,013
I'm a bit sleepy.

368
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:27,118
Why are they all clustered over there
when beautiful He-i is right here?

369
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,186
Even Tae-gyung's with them.

370
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:31,489
The photoshoot concept is a woman
surrounded by men, after all.

371
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:37,094
And you're that woman!
Surrounded by A.N.JELL,

372
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:38,329
doesn't it feel pretty good?

373
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:46,103
I'm sure if you're that woman,
you'll feel great.

374
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:50,208
I'll buy you really good food.

375
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:53,411
Hey, Tae-gyung! Come over here!

376
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,247
It suddenly got really cold.

377
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:01,485
I'm the one dressed like a princess
but she's the one being treated like it.

378
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:11,128
Whatever.

379
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:14,865
As long as Tae-gyung
isn't next to her, it's fine.

380
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:20,571
And besides, she'll be heading back
to the convent after all this ends anyway.

381
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,612
The convent that Mi-nyeo was at
is nearby, it's that way.

382
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,715
So,

383
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:34,452
is Mi-nam going back
to the convent for sure?

384
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:38,155
I mean, she might work
at the orphanage there

385
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:40,925
or try to go to Rome again.

386
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:45,796
She won't be able to confess
to Shin-woo before she leaves?

387
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:49,834
They all know she's a girl,

388
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,969
can't she say something before she goes?

389
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:54,772
I doubt she'll be able to.

390
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,443
All right, over here!

391
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:25,670
Honey...

392
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,479
Shin-woo. Jermy.
Aren't you going to help me?

393
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:39,917
Get over here. Now.

394
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:52,563
Let's go!

395
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:57,134
If you don't, I'll kill you.

396
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,938
Here. You hold it.

397
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:06,577
You, help lift my train.

398
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,384
Thanks for lending me a hand, everyone.

399
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,157
Hold the parasol properly.

400
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:22,426
-Carry it properly.
-Yes.

401
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:30,201
Are you envious?

402
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:31,869
No, I'm fine.

403
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:35,272
He-i's so lucky.

404
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:38,809
She's pretty, popular, sweet, and nice.

405
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:41,912
And on top of that,
her boyfriend's Tae-gyung

406
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,881
and her friends are Shin-woo and Jermy.

407
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:48,419
When I see her, I know she's at least
saved a country in her past life.

408
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:52,156
But you,

409
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:54,492
you're a girl but have to pretend
you're a guy.

410
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:59,130
I'm sure you'll be pretty too,
if you dress up.

411
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:05,469
Like this,

412
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,605
I feel just like Marie Antoinette.

413
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:11,776
Extragavant, flamboyant, beautiful.
It's totally you, Fake Fairy.

414
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:14,879
But do you know what her end was?

415
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:16,580
What?

416
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:19,683
Beheaded.

417
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,218
You're so uneducated.

418
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:22,653
Hwang Tae-gyung.

419
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:26,290
You know I spout whatever comes to mind
when I get angry, right?

420
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:27,825
Tae-gyung.

421
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:29,827
Don't make He-i mad.

422
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:31,896
You should be more careful, Tae-gyung.

423
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:36,367
Fine. Who cares if you're uneducated?

424
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:38,269
As long as you're talented at lying.

425
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:42,139
Who cares if you don't know who she is?
You're the Princess of Faking and Lying.

426
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:45,810
Oh, that was a compliment.

427
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,479
You don't deny
that you're a faker and a liar, after all.

428
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:49,980
That's admirable!

429
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,083
It's time for the guys!

430
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,285
Come on, let's go!

431
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,021
-Let's go.
-Come on, move along!

432
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:06,230
You're so pretty today.

433
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:09,400
Shin-woo must think so too, I bet.

434
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:12,636
Mi-nam must be so jealous of you,

435
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:15,105
she'll want to look pretty to him too.

436
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,844
Mi-nam wants to look pretty to Shin-woo?

437
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:20,744
Yes.

438
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:22,713
Mi-nam likes Shin-woo.

439
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:25,683
Shin-woo? Kang Shin-woo?

440
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:30,654
Oh, Tae-gyung didn't tell you?

441
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,357
Pretend you don't know, okay?

442
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:34,592
I have to go!

443
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:38,796
Hwang Tae-gyung.

444
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:42,900
You think Ko Mi-nam likes Kang Shin-woo?

445
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:47,571
You say I'm uneducated
but you're just dumb.

446
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:51,041
Right.

447
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:54,645
I should set Ko Mi-nam up
with Kang Shin-woo.

448
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:57,948
Hold on! I have something to tell you.

449
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:04,088
Now. We're opening up
the photoshoot like you requested,

450
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:05,923
so I look forward to great articles
about Mi-nam.

451
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,992
Is Shin-woo's girlfriend here as well?

452
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:11,362
No. Nothing about Shin-woo. Ko Mi-nam!

453
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:13,764
He's handsome,
please focus on Mi-nam instead.

454
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:16,267
Are Tae-gyung and He-i getting along well?

455
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:18,869
No Tae-gyung either.

456
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:21,839
Ko Mi-nam, he's got real potential.
Jackpot!

457
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,975
Please tell us more
about Shin-woo's girlfriend.

458
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,810
-Just one thing!
-Mr. An!

459
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:28,379
Mr. An, just one word!

460
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:31,815
-No it's all about Mi-nam today.
-Everyone's chasing after idle gossip.

461
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:35,519
But I have smelled something bigger.

462
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:38,355
A.N.JELL

463
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,591
is hiding a huge secret.

464
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:42,826
And at the center of it

465
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:46,130
is the Mysterious, Secret Woman.

466
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:50,167
She's near them, I'm certain of it.

467
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:55,005
I should take a closer look
at all the women.

468
00:42:57,708 --> 00:42:58,909
Nice, amazing! Yes!

469
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:00,311
Great poses, yes. Great!

470
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:03,714
All right. Another, on three!

471
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:06,150
Very good, yes!

472
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:09,853
As another woman,
I feel so bad for Mi-nam.

473
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,590
I'm sure she'll want to be pretty
in front of the man she loves.

474
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:15,326
You're too nice. You're nice to a fault.

475
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:19,396
Can you help Mi-nam out?

476
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,632
I'll lend you all my clothes and makeup.

477
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:25,035
Let her be a beautiful woman
in front of Shin-woo, just once.

478
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:27,438
Even if she can't confess,

479
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:30,574
maybe I should help her to look pretty.

480
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,014
This is going to be great!

481
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,885
Yes, great! Nice!

482
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:45,322
Whoa! It's raining!

483
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:46,223
Oh no!

484
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:48,659
What do we do now?

485
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:53,530
What do we do?

486
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:56,400
How about a short break,
until the rain lets up?

487
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,035
Let's take a break!

488
00:43:58,102 --> 00:43:59,903
Pack it up and bring it in!

489
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:14,952
-Hello? Weather Service?
-It's pouring like mad.

490
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:16,553
We have to resume shooting soon.

491
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,589
The rain's always the problem. The rain.

492
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:20,424
Where's Mi-nam?

493
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:22,860
She got wet so, Miss Wang took her.

494
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:42,179
This is taking longer than usual.

495
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:46,016
Makeup for photoshoots usually is heavier.

496
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:47,851
Keep your eyes closed.

497
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:51,789
You look great.

498
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,491
Should I put some mascara on too?

499
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:57,461
We have to do that too?

500
00:44:57,961 --> 00:44:59,530
Photoshoot, remember?
It's different makeup.

501
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:00,831
Look at the end of your nose.

502
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:03,100
You have to put some on.

503
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:05,969
Oh my goodness.

504
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:08,505
Oh, your eyes look even bigger!

505
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:11,709
Putting makeup on you
is really fun, I love it.

506
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:31,862
All done!

507
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:35,899
Take a look, Mi-nam.

508
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:40,838
But Miss Wang,

509
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:42,639
this is a girl!

510
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:45,042
It's fine for now.

511
00:45:45,776 --> 00:45:48,912
I wanted to make you pretty,
at least just once.

512
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,615
I can't. I can't do this.

513
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:55,185
It's pouring, no one's around here.

514
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:57,554
You won't get caught.

515
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:06,463
Mi-nam, try these on.

516
00:46:10,033 --> 00:46:11,435
It's just until the rain lets up.

517
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:13,837
You can be a pretty woman

518
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:17,341
until the rain ends.

519
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:21,945
Then you can go back to being a man.

520
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:29,953
This is pretty...

521
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:34,191
I have never worn clothes
like this before.

522
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:01,752
Look at you, Mi-nam! You're gorgeous.

523
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:11,395
Look over here, Mi-nam.

524
00:47:16,533 --> 00:47:18,335
Here. You can't stay like this for long,

525
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:20,971
so take this as a reminder.

526
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:25,142
Thank you so much...

527
00:47:25,642 --> 00:47:27,010
Stay here.

528
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:28,545
I'll go keep watch outside.

529
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,260
Is this really me?

530
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:19,863
Even Tae-gyung
won't recognize me like this.

531
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:25,869
I would be so embarrassed if he saw me
like this and recognized me!

532
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:30,207
Is that you, Miss Wang?

533
00:48:39,016 --> 00:48:40,017
Shin-woo...

534
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,788
Oh. Miss Wang told me to come...

535
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:48,892
I'm sorry. I just tried it on with her.

536
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:51,795
I'll change right now.

537
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,196
No.

538
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:00,637
I think she called me
to take a look at you.

539
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,841
If no one saw this,
it would have been a pity.

540
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:08,178
Mi-nam.

541
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:10,614
You're really pretty.

542
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:18,355
You're beautiful.

543
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:50,220
It's like we're filming a romantic movie,
strolling in the rain, just the two of us.

544
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:54,391
Yes, I feel like I'm shooting a movie too.

545
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:56,360
The Terrifying Fake, Lying Princess.

546
00:49:58,061 --> 00:50:01,164
Hey! I'm getting wet
because you're walking too fast!

547
00:50:02,232 --> 00:50:04,601
And when it's raining, you're supposed
to tilt it towards the girl.

548
00:50:05,302 --> 00:50:06,970
But I'm getting wet now!

549
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,741
If you don't want to get wet,
let's go to that greenhouse.

550
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:13,243
I want to take a look inside.
I think it will be fun.

551
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:24,187
I should get changed
before the rain stops.

552
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:28,492
It's still pouring.
Stay like this, just for a bit longer.

553
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:33,130
I'm just embarrassed,
I've never worn clothes like this before.

554
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:36,133
I feel like a totally different person.

555
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:39,736
Yes. You're straight out of a fairy tale.

556
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,173
You turn into a woman when it's raining

557
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:46,143
and turn back into a guy
when the rain ends.

558
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:48,845
There's a fairy tale like that...

559
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:51,481
The Frog Prince?

560
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:54,918
A frog by day, a prince by night.

561
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:57,254
But you're a princess.

562
00:50:58,555 --> 00:50:59,523
Like The Swan Princess.

563
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:03,794
A swan by day, a princess by night.

564
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:07,564
I'm no princess.

565
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:11,968
If you do that,

566
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,704
you'll mess up your hair.

567
00:51:18,308 --> 00:51:19,309
What are you doing?

568
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:24,648
Ko Mi-nam, why are you wearing my clothes?

569
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,318
Hwang Tae-gyung, take a look at this.

570
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:39,229
Tae-gyung.

571
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:41,865
Ko Mi-nam.

572
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,333
Mi-nam, you look great in my clothes.

573
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:46,036
And you two look great together too.

574
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:50,207
Did you grow closer
after you revealed that you were a girl?

575
00:51:54,177 --> 00:51:56,580
You're really doing your best
to look pretty for Shin-woo.

576
00:51:57,247 --> 00:51:58,081
And you really do!

577
00:51:58,582 --> 00:51:59,449
Doesn't she look great?

578
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:03,220
No. It's ridiculous.

579
00:52:07,724 --> 00:52:08,658
Take me with you!

580
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:21,938
I did something...

581
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:24,407
that doesn't suit me.

582
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:28,945
This is all so ridiculous.

583
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:37,521
I told myself to think
that it's nothing special.

584
00:52:40,257 --> 00:52:42,025
I told myself everything was
and will be all right.

585
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,264
But I guess I'm even more foolish
than most fools.

586
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:53,336
I'm sorry, Shin-woo.
You can go ahead without me.

587
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:02,379
Don't cry.

588
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:06,883
Don't cry anymore...

589
00:53:08,718 --> 00:53:09,719
for or because of Tae-gyung.

590
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:20,597
Shin-woo.

591
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:23,433
You have been crying...

592
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:26,203
because of Tae-gyung.

593
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:29,372
I caught you.

594
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:33,143
You...

595
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:35,545
like Tae-gyung.

596
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:37,814
Don't you?

597
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:54,564
Hey!

598
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:55,966
Hwang Tae-gyung!

599
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:00,237
Why did you run off like that?

600
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,305
Get out of my sight.

601
00:54:03,006 --> 00:54:03,840
Hey...

602
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:09,646
Why's he so angry?

603
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:14,251
I thought he might laugh at Ko Mi-nam
if he saw her like that.

604
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:16,686
So why is he furious?

605
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,392
I didn't want to butt in...

606
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:25,462
and make this harder for you.

607
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:28,865
But...

608
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:31,968
I can't bear to watch you

609
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:34,871
cry anymore.

610
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:41,344
I thought I was hiding it well.

611
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:43,847
I thought I was holding it in well...

612
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:48,518
But you figured it out.

613
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:52,422
Yes, I did.

614
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:54,758
Because I have been...

615
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,094
watching you this whole time.

616
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:01,731
So you saw everything...

617
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:04,734
even my heart.

618
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:09,339
Tae-gyung can't see it clearly yet.

619
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:14,110
Do you want to show him?

620
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:18,915
No.

621
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:23,653
I don't want to upset him
over this absurd thing.

622
00:55:29,726 --> 00:55:31,027
Don't worry about me.

623
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:34,497
I'll take care of it where no one can see.

624
00:55:36,633 --> 00:55:37,600
I'll go change...

625
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:44,074
and come back as a man.

626
00:56:15,271 --> 00:56:16,940
I know they came this way.

627
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:33,223
Shin-woo?

628
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:36,826
Why's he just out in the rain?

629
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:40,463
Did something happen over there?

630
00:56:49,305 --> 00:56:50,740
This was so stupid.

631
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:56,746
Yes. You are stupid.

632
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:11,094
You shouldn't have come here
in the first place.

633
00:57:13,163 --> 00:57:15,832
You should have just stayed at the convent
and become a nun, Sister.

634
00:57:20,136 --> 00:57:21,905
Do you even want to go back

635
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,574
to the convent after you finish
living as Ko Mi-nam?

636
00:57:26,342 --> 00:57:28,077
In my humble opinion,

637
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:29,846
you shouldn't give up on your dream.

638
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:32,949
Why don't you go to Rome
to become a nun, like you wanted?

639
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:35,585
Just go do it again. It's not hard.

640
00:57:38,354 --> 00:57:39,255
Miss Yoo He-i.

641
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:42,725
I may have given up that path,

642
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:46,229
but it's not a path
you can talk about lightly.

643
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,398
Wow. Look at you, you're so cool.

644
00:57:49,532 --> 00:57:51,668
So go back to that oh-so-awesome path!

645
00:57:51,734 --> 00:57:52,702
Miss He-i!

646
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:59,042
And stay away from Hwang Tae-gyung!

647
00:58:01,211 --> 00:58:04,681
You want him to look at you?
While you're by his side.

648
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:06,816
You get your hopes up
when he's kind to you

649
00:58:06,883 --> 00:58:09,285
and you want him,
even though you pretend you don't, right?

650
00:58:11,955 --> 00:58:13,256
Do you want Hwang Tae-gyung

651
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:16,426
to find out your pitiful heart? Do you?

652
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:22,632
No, I do not.

653
00:58:24,601 --> 00:58:25,602
And I will not.

654
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:28,671
Miss Yoo He-i?

655
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:34,911
Who's that lady with you?

656
00:58:35,945 --> 00:58:37,914
Shin-woo was just here, wasn't he?

657
00:58:39,315 --> 00:58:41,084
If you get caught, we're all done for.
Run.

658
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:42,151
Who could that be?

659
00:58:43,152 --> 00:58:44,821
Who are you?

660
00:58:45,722 --> 00:58:47,724
-Are you all right?
-Get out of the way!

661
00:58:47,957 --> 00:58:49,492
-Miss!
-You're hurt!

662
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,427
Miss!

663
00:58:51,494 --> 00:58:52,629
-Let go!
-Stop moving!

664
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:00,470
I can't get caught.
I have to get far away!

665
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:07,310
Tae-gyung. Are you okay?

666
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:09,512
You don't look well.

667
00:59:09,812 --> 00:59:12,282
I'm not sick. I'm angry.

668
00:59:12,348 --> 00:59:14,484
No, you look really sick.

669
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:16,553
Your face is pale.

670
00:59:18,154 --> 00:59:20,490
Like you got seriously hurt somewhere.

671
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:21,724
I didn't get hurt.

672
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:25,128
I'm not sick. I'm just shocked.

673
00:59:26,262 --> 00:59:27,163
I thought you were angry.

674
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:29,065
I'm angry because I was shocked.

675
00:59:29,132 --> 00:59:30,500
Did you see something you didn't like?

676
00:59:34,437 --> 00:59:36,773
You saw something you didn't like,
which shocked you

677
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:38,942
and made you angry, so now you're sick.

678
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:40,243
Got it.

679
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:41,711
That's one complicated way to get sick.

680
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:43,146
You scared me.

681
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:47,617
Let's see here...

682
00:59:49,118 --> 00:59:49,953
Fine.

683
00:59:50,653 --> 00:59:52,255
I want to deny it but it's true.

684
00:59:53,623 --> 00:59:55,325
I was shocked when I saw her like that.

685
00:59:55,892 --> 00:59:58,161
I got angry because someone else
was next to her.

686
00:59:59,062 --> 00:59:59,996
And because of that,

687
01:00:00,863 --> 01:00:01,798
I'm sick.

688
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:04,968
And because I'm sick, I have lost.

689
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:09,405
Let's see here. I need to select
the photos to provide for the articles.

690
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:10,607
Which ones should I choose?

691
01:00:12,308 --> 01:00:16,512
Pictures that have Mi-nam as the center...

692
01:00:19,415 --> 01:00:20,550
She's still doing this?

693
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:22,385
Is this actually effective?

694
01:00:24,687 --> 01:00:25,788
What the heck are you doing?

695
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:27,624
What?

696
01:00:28,725 --> 01:00:29,559
That.

697
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:32,028
Ko Mi-nam does that every single day.
What the heck is that?

698
01:00:32,729 --> 01:00:34,831
Oh. You saw?

699
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:38,101
It's an acupuncture point, you see.

700
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:39,602
I taught her.

701
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:44,507
So when your heart explodes in front
of the person you like and you can't

702
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:46,843
control it, you press it.
I taught her to do it.

703
01:00:47,777 --> 01:00:48,611
What?

704
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:50,146
Just look at her.

705
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:52,582
She actually believed me
and is still doing it.

706
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:55,551
I guess Shin-woo was in front of her.

707
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:01,824
That's what this meant?

708
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:18,307
She's looking at me.

709
01:01:24,647 --> 01:01:26,983
See! How much did you berate her

710
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:29,986
that she would make a pig nose at you?

711
01:01:30,953 --> 01:01:32,488
Be nicer to Mi-nam, yes?

712
01:01:32,955 --> 01:01:37,026
Don't you know how much she adores
her hairpin because you bought it for her?

713
01:01:38,728 --> 01:01:41,064
-What?
-And you, you're well-off,

714
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:43,633
you couldn't even get her
a decent hairpin?

715
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,936
That cheap thing, it was in pieces.
In pieces, already!

716
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,414
This is Ko Mi-nam's bag, right?

717
01:01:58,848 --> 01:01:59,682
Yes.

718
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:23,239
You really went to look for this?

719
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:35,651
Gemma.

720
01:02:36,686 --> 01:02:38,521
It must be quite a struggle for you.

721
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:42,759
That person...

722
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:46,195
He's like a bright star.

723
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:50,600
And by his light,

724
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:53,369
I brighten up

725
01:02:54,504 --> 01:02:55,805
or I become dark.

726
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,010
When it brightens, my hopes soar.

727
01:03:02,912 --> 01:03:04,347
When it darkens, I'm crestfallen.

728
01:03:06,716 --> 01:03:08,251
I hate myself for being like this.

729
01:03:08,918 --> 01:03:10,219
I'm so ashamed.

730
01:03:14,857 --> 01:03:15,691
I am...

731
01:03:17,493 --> 01:03:19,896
so proud of you, Gemma,

732
01:03:21,531 --> 01:03:24,400
for discovering such a love.
You are so beautiful with it.

733
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:41,384
It's hot!

734
01:03:42,852 --> 01:03:43,686
No offense...

735
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:47,824
but who are you exactly

736
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:50,760
to look for the twins, Miss Mo?

737
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:56,132
I have a big debt that I owe to them.

738
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:00,136
You know,

739
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:02,471
I saw you last time.

740
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:04,273
I saw everything.

741
01:04:05,274 --> 01:04:06,642
Like your surgery scar on your stomach.

742
01:04:08,644 --> 01:04:09,612
You gave birth, didn't you?

743
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:16,319
What was your relationship
with my brother?

744
01:04:17,987 --> 01:04:20,590
By any chance, are you the real mother

745
01:04:21,624 --> 01:04:23,326
of the twins?

746
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:31,500
It's just that,
when you were super popular,

747
01:04:31,801 --> 01:04:34,604
you went on a break for years.
You gave birth then, right?

748
01:04:36,138 --> 01:04:37,206
I did take a long break, yes.

749
01:04:39,141 --> 01:04:41,944
Is that why you're looking everywhere
for the twins?

750
01:04:42,778 --> 01:04:45,014
Because you're their mother?

751
01:04:45,615 --> 01:04:46,449
I...

752
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,254
I did not give birth to them.

753
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:55,491
What?

754
01:04:56,025 --> 01:04:57,126
Then what kind

755
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:01,030
of debt do you have that makes you
so desperate to find those kids?

756
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:02,732
It's because of me...

757
01:05:05,501 --> 01:05:06,936
that they no longer have their mother.

758
01:05:09,772 --> 01:05:10,706
Their mom...

759
01:05:13,976 --> 01:05:15,177
She died because of me.

760
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:17,914
Oh, my goodness...

761
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:36,265
I can't stop crying.

762
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,968
I can't see the stars through my tears.

763
01:05:43,072 --> 01:05:44,573
If I can't see them like this,

764
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:47,376
I wouldn't hope...

765
01:05:48,978 --> 01:05:50,346
or be disappointed.

766
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:55,284
I wish I wasn't able to see them.

767
01:06:16,272 --> 01:06:17,139
Tae-gyung.

768
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:19,475
Ko Mi-nam.

769
01:06:20,443 --> 01:06:21,911
I can see you clearly right now.

770
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:25,448
You can't see anything over here
because it's so bright, right?

771
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:28,784
You.

772
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:31,854
Were you crying like that every time
I couldn't see you?

773
01:06:35,958 --> 01:06:38,928
I'm not going to cry anymore.
Just pretend you didn't see me.

774
01:06:40,296 --> 01:06:42,331
How can I when I can see you so clearly?

775
01:06:45,234 --> 01:06:46,068
Ko Mi-nam.

776
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:48,804
You were looking at me like that
this whole time, right?

777
01:06:49,772 --> 01:06:51,507
I didn't know because I couldn't see you.

778
01:06:53,943 --> 01:06:55,544
Then keep on pretending that you can't.

779
01:06:56,278 --> 01:06:57,580
I'm not going to look at you anymore.

780
01:06:59,148 --> 01:07:00,049
No, you can't!

781
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:06,722
You can't stop now. You're not allowed to.

782
01:07:07,156 --> 01:07:08,224
Keep looking at me!

783
01:07:09,658 --> 01:07:10,693
As you have always done.

784
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:13,863
Just look at me, and only me,
like you always have!

785
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:17,233
Tae-gyung.

786
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:23,406
Ko Mi-nam.

787
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:25,875
From now on, you have my permission

788
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:28,444
to love me.

789
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:44,060
