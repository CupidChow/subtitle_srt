1
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:18,218
If I go up now, it's all done for.
I must endure.

2
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:23,556
Ko Mi-nam.

3
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:25,625
Do you want to die?

4
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,972
Yes, I found it!

5
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:40,106
You found it?

6
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,242
You brat, you scared me to death!

7
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:44,611
-Sorry.
-So...

8
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:46,179
-I'm really sorry.
-Damn you!

9
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:47,981
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

10
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:49,115
Thank you, sir.

11
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:51,551
Tae-gyung, we're leaving!

12
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:52,952
-Let's go!
-I'm coming.

13
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:56,523
Thank god we found it!

14
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:57,824
I'm so relieved, seriously.

15
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:00,794
Thank you so much, sir.

16
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:39,933
Ko Mi-nam.

17
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:42,402
Ko Mi-nam!

18
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:53,746
Ko Mi-nam!

19
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:56,349
Ko Mi-nam!

20
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,556
Ko Mi-nam...

21
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:28,281
I made it!

22
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:31,684
I made it.

23
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:42,195
Thank goodness.

24
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:46,199
Who was that, anyway?

25
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:56,576
Wait a second.

26
00:02:58,211 --> 00:02:59,279
Tae-gyung?

27
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:10,924
Tae-gyung!

28
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,093
Tae-gyung! Are you all right?

29
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,828
Tae-gyung! Can you hear me?

30
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:16,896
-Tae-gyung!
-Oh no.

31
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:17,931
Oh no!

32
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:19,032
Tae-gyung!

33
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,033
Tae-gyung!

34
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,703
Tae-gyung, it's me, Ko Mi-nam!

35
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,643
Ko Mi-nam.

36
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:47,827
Tae-gyung.

37
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,933
Tae-gyung.

38
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,867
AMBULANCE

39
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,002
Tae-gyung!

40
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,370
-Tae-gyung!
-Tae-gyung!

41
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:58,705
Tae-gyung!

42
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,708
Tae-gyung!

43
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:04,611
Thank you, Ko Mi-nam!
You're beautiful, Ko Mi-nam!

44
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:07,547
Thank you, Ko Mi-nam!
You're beautiful, Ko Mi-nam!

45
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,882
Thank you, Ko Mi-nam!
You're beautiful, Ko Mi-nam!

46
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,218
-Ko Mi-nam saved Tae-gyung's life.
-Thank you, Ko Mi-nam!

47
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:16,289
Which basically means,
he has saved A.N.JELLs as well.

48
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:18,992
The savior of the million-member
fan club A.N.JELLs, Ko Mi-nam

49
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,527
is hereby officially accepted
as a member of A.N.JELL!

50
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,163
Thank you, Ko Mi-nam!
You're beautiful, Ko Mi-nam!

51
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,899
Thank you, Ko Mi-nam!
You're beautiful, Ko Mi-nam!

52
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:29,369
What? "Thank you, Ko Mi-nam"?

53
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,705
I am not thankful, Mr. An.
I am not thankful at all.

54
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,941
Well, I'm thankful.

55
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:37,010
All of Mi-nam's anti-fans are gone,
just like that.

56
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:40,780
And besides, aren't you thankful
that Mi-nam saved you?

57
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,249
He didn't save me.

58
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,719
How about staying a bit longer?

59
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,488
I told you, I'm fine.

60
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,257
I mean, it's not necessarily for you.

61
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:54,627
Mi-nam's getting a lot
of positive feedback for saving you.

62
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:58,398
So if you stay in the hospital
a while longer, his image will improve.

63
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:00,900
Why should I? How does that benefit me?

64
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,335
I'm going to leave. Right now.

65
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:05,038
Hey.

66
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,707
You can't leave now.
There's a filming crew here.

67
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,743
You called a filming crew? Why?

68
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,813
Are you going to make me do an
interview thanking Ko Mi-nam or something?

69
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,848
Touchy.

70
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:19,852
They're not here for you.
Yoo He-i is here for a donation show.

71
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:21,421
Yoo He-i?

72
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,023
Yes, the actress, you know her!

73
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,726
Yoo He-i, the Korea's Fairy,
beloved by all!

74
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,942
Nice. Excuse me.

75
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,419
-She's here.
-She's so pretty.

76
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:54,587
Can we take pictures too?

77
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,390
You have to beat the illness, you have to.

78
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:00,326
Her dream

79
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:03,429
was to become a celebrity
like you, Ms. He-i.

80
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,701
Don't give up, ma'am.

81
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:11,304
You will be able to...

82
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:14,374
make that dream come true. I believe.

83
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:27,754
She cries so beautifully
every time I see her.

84
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,626
Every photo is like a photo shoot.

85
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,738
She's so sweet for a top celebrity.

86
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:51,544
Do you think we can get her to clean
the toilet and help them bathe?

87
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,913
I think she would do it,
she's too nice to say no.

88
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,014
You think so?

89
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:00,586
You're

90
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,156
so thin and frail...

91
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,532
I'm sorry.

92
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:14,801
I don't know what's gotten into me.

93
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:23,276
Hold on.

94
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:26,179
Go and have some time to yourself.
We'll take a break.

95
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:32,285
Oh, wait.

96
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,291
"The Tears of Korea's Fairy."

97
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,359
The article titles just flow out.

98
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:45,331
Our fairy's so sweet,
her heart's so gentle.

99
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,989
"The Tears of Korea's Fairy"?

100
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,437
I cried long enough for them
to have something to work with.

101
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:26,405
I'm done.

102
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,608
Tell them that I can't continue
because I'm overwhelmed.

103
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:31,577
Why do you make me do ridiculous things?

104
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:36,515
Hand me some tissues.

105
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:39,185
By the way, that kid I was with,

106
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,721
she's not contagious or anything, right?

107
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,390
It's been dangerous lately

108
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:47,493
but I can't wear a mask or use
hand sanitizer because of my image.

109
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:50,329
Do they think Korea's Fairy
doesn't ever get sick?

110
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:53,699
I said, hand me some tissues.

111
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,035
What the hell!

112
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,607
What the hell are you?

113
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:07,713
Sorry, wrong van. It looks exactly
the same as mine. My mistake.

114
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:13,486
Wait. Aren't you Hwang Tae-gyung?

115
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,456
It is you! I'm such a huge fan
of your team.

116
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,661
You do know me, right?

117
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:23,663
I do.

118
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,967
"Korea's Fairy"? As if.

119
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,702
Some fairy you are.

120
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,306
You can't even keep up an act
long enough to be convincing.

121
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,944
So you heard everything.
No need for me to act then.

122
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:44,717
You're right.

123
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:47,286
I'm no fairy.

124
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:49,956
But you're no angel either.

125
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,159
Pro to pro, let's let
certain stuff slide, okay?

126
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,262
Hey. Hold up.

127
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,364
What?

128
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,633
You want more of me?

129
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,935
Oh, I get it.

130
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,038
I'm not actually your fan,
that was a common courtesy.

131
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,041
Why? Are you my fan?

132
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:12,078
Fake Fairy.

133
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,113
Pick up your trash.

134
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,314
What?

135
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:18,684
Take the dirty tissue
with your facial oil all over it with you.

136
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,127
"Fake Fairy"?

137
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:29,395
How dare he!

138
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:31,797
Hey. Don't shut the door.

139
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:36,168
Your perfume is giving me a headache.

140
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,404
Leave the door open, so it can clear out.

141
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,084
He's such a rude jerk!

142
00:10:58,357 --> 00:10:59,992
And where the heck is my van?

143
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,662
Miss Yoo He-i!

144
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:05,264
Here you are.
The crew has been looking for you!

145
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,366
I couldn't even run away
because of his dumb van!

146
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,470
Yes, I'm coming!

147
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,406
What were you doing here?

148
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,175
The crew's waiting for me, you said?
I'll head right over.

149
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:19,945
Would you be okay with an additional
interview after the shoot's over?

150
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:21,347
-Sure.
-Great!

151
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,728
Wait, that car.

152
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:37,463
A.N.JELL?

153
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:40,566
But Yoo He-i just came
from that direction.

154
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:43,369
Is there something here?

155
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:49,775
There's something about you.

156
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:51,777
Tell the truth!

157
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,245
What are you talking about?

158
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:56,649
What were you doing
with Tae-gyung at the pool?

159
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:00,052
What's going on with you two?

160
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:02,855
I...

161
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:05,458
Tae-gyung and I...

162
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:09,528
If you don't fess up,

163
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:11,197
I'll shoot.

164
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:14,300
Don't shoot!

165
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:18,003
Where do you think you're going?
Come here!

166
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:19,171
Hey!

167
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:20,673
You little... Come here!

168
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:26,078
Tell me now!

169
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,013
Stop it, please!

170
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:29,782
Then fess up!

171
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,652
You can't run from me!

172
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:39,391
Please stop!

173
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,078
Ko Mi-nam, what exactly are you?

174
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:01,580
What is your true identity?
Tell me this instant!

175
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:07,253
Ko Mi-nam. Get inside.

176
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,122
Shin-woo! Thanks so much.

177
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:12,858
Where do you think you're going?

178
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:19,698
Did you just spray me?

179
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:23,702
You just sprayed me all over to save him?

180
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:25,838
Mi-nam asked you to stop,
so stop bothering him.

181
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,707
He's going to debut soon,
he can't catch a cold.

182
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,876
You should go dry yourself too.

183
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,215
Shin-woo, how could you?

184
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,185
Jolie.

185
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,021
You know what?

186
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:46,025
My heart hurts so much,
like I've been shot.

187
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:47,927
Jolie.

188
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:00,673
Thanks, Shin-woo.

189
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,475
You've been drenched two days in a row.

190
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,277
But in all seriousness,

191
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,479
what happened yesterday?

192
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:11,851
Did something happen
between the two of you?

193
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,525
How did Tae-gyung even fall into the pool?

194
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,795
Why were you there in the first place?

195
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:28,367
It was my mistake.

196
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:31,203
Tae-gyung!

197
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:36,041
I tripped and fell into the pool
and he help me.

198
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,012
Tae-gyung! Are you all right?

199
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,750
Why? Is there a problem?

200
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,721
No.

201
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:51,323
Thank goodness you two were together then.

202
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:09,141
Hwang Tae-gyung, making a mistake?

203
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,077
This is weirder.

204
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:22,621
What the heck is this?

205
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:25,591
Tae-gyung.

206
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:27,226
Did you see it?

207
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:28,661
You put this here?

208
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:31,397
Yes. Have some when you get hungry.

209
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:33,065
What is it?

210
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,736
That's porridge and that's tea.

211
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,439
What's what?

212
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:45,177
Can I enter for a bit and explain?

213
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:59,525
I heard you didn't eat well
at the hospital,

214
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:01,994
so I prepared some nutritional porridge.

215
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:05,664
So you're carrying fire in one hand
and water in the other?

216
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,137
What is this?

217
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,007
Oh, it's shrimp porridge.

218
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,377
Do you not like shrimp?

219
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,217
I'm allergic to shellfish.
If I eat this, I'll die.

220
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:26,285
Really?

221
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,888
I really didn't know.

222
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:32,958
How could you die eating this?

223
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:36,095
You. Take all of this and get out!

224
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:42,401
I really didn't know
you had such allergies.

225
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:44,903
Right.

226
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,839
You probably did not know.

227
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:49,041
That's why you're dangerous, Ko Mi-nam.

228
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:51,977
I just wanted to be

229
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:54,880
a worthy, useful person to you.
That's why I made it.

230
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,750
If you want to be such a person,

231
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,385
focus on prepping for our performance.

232
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,520
You.

233
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:04,089
If you mess that up, I swear to god,

234
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,357
I will kill you.

235
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:08,527
Yes, sir!

236
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,630
I will do my utmost.

237
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,822
-Shall we begin?
-Let's go.

238
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:46,231
It could not be love

239
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:50,235
There was no way it was love

240
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:54,339
I fooled myself again and again

241
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,741
But my heart

242
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,644
Hold on. Ko Mi-nam.

243
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:00,446
Stay on beat!

244
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:08,454
Chin up!

245
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:14,226
Again.

246
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:47,686
Hello!

247
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:49,955
Oh, my.

248
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:58,530
Mr. Ma!

249
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:00,032
How have you been?

250
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,768
You just got back from vacation?

251
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:07,873
It was a pretty long break,

252
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,209
but we're back now, for you and Mi-nam!

253
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,379
Mi-nam!

254
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,082
Can I...

255
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:18,784
Can I come back now?

256
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:26,291
I know you tried to abandon me
and run away.

257
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,661
I also wanted to drop everything and run,

258
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:31,697
but I can't. Not anymore.

259
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,736
We have to find the person
who brought this picture to me.

260
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:41,440
I really need both of your help.

261
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:48,914
I will find this person. I will.

262
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:54,786
Eat up, you bitch.

263
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:56,989
This is all good for you, you know.

264
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:58,290
Dang it.

265
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,930
I should have beaten
that horrible woman to a pulp

266
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,331
for running off with my money!

267
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,369
For the love of... Where are you
going to get the settlement money?

268
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,237
You should have hit her more carefully!

269
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:13,272
Bitch!

270
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:16,375
Like I was supposed to know
she spent ten million won on her nose?

271
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:17,476
-Goodness.
-Damn...

272
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:19,811
What are we going to do?

273
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:25,217
Remember?

274
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:27,686
I have him.

275
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,290
I have my nephew,
I have nothing to be afraid of.

276
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:34,459
Work hard, play hard, eat well!

277
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:36,995
Take some time off and treat yourselves
to good things, yes?

278
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,931
One of the stylists

279
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:41,500
-took the skirt...
-Oh. It's Yoo He-i!

280
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:47,572
KOREA'S FAIRY HOLDS THE GIRL'S HAND TIGHT,
UNABLE TO LET GO

281
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:48,774
Whatever.

282
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:49,975
Fake Fairy.

283
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:51,977
She tries hard, I'll give her that.

284
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:55,314
She's so pretty.

285
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:57,249
She's totally my type.

286
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,851
I love women like this.

287
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:04,856
Shin-woo! You like women
like this too, right?

288
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,659
Tae-gyung, you do too, don't you?

289
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:09,428
I think you said that before.

290
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,264
I never did. They aren't my type.

291
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:13,832
Why not?

292
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:15,934
She's so pretty!

293
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:17,502
Right, Shin-woo?

294
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,805
I don't know. Is she pretty?

295
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:23,442
What? Are both of you blind?

296
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:25,911
Yoo He-i is so pretty!

297
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:29,047
If she's not pretty,
then who is your type?

298
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:30,849
Ko Mi-nam.

299
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:36,655
That's gross. You're annoying me.
Wipe your face.

300
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,659
I'm sorry!

301
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:42,661
You still have some left.

302
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:44,196
I do?

303
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:48,066
Ko Mi-nam, how dare you!

304
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:58,977
Ko Mi-nam.

305
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:01,313
What about you?

306
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:03,081
What?

307
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:04,349
You're a man.

308
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:07,719
What do you think of women like Yoo He-i?

309
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,524
Yoo He-i?

310
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:14,359
Who's that?

311
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,262
Are you kidding me?
You don't know who Yoo He-i is?

312
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:20,532
Yoo He-i? Of course he knows.

313
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,268
He just doesn't like Yoo He-i,

314
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:25,103
he likes all the girls. All the girls.

315
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,938
Who is Yoo He-i, exactly?

316
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:34,179
Let's memorize the idols,
memorize the idols.

317
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,414
Girls' Generation, nine people!

318
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,616
-Let's memorize the idols.
-2NE1, four people!

319
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:38,583
Hold on!

320
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:40,852
The names of all 13 members
of Super Junior are?

321
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:43,188
Leeteuk, Heechul, Han Geng, Yesung,
Kangin, Shindong,

322
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,290
Sungmin, Eunhyuk, Donghae,
Siwon, Ryeowook, Kibum, Kyuhyun!

323
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:46,458
-Kyuhyun, okay!
-Okay!

324
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:48,260
Let's memorize the idols, Wonder Girls!

325
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:50,095
-Five people!
-Let's memorize the idols.

326
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:51,096
Firetruck!

327
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:55,600
What? Jung Won-kwan, Lee Sang-won,
Kim Tae-hyung, Do Gun-woo...

328
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,969
-Don't listen to him. Block your ears.
-You don't know?

329
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:10,449
Let's memorize the idols,
memorize the idols.

330
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:12,517
Girls' Generation. Nine people!

331
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:15,854
Let's memorize the idols,
memorize the idols.

332
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:17,422
Man.

333
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:20,792
I have to practice and memorize
all the names too.

334
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,527
This isn't easy.

335
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:28,500
And no matter how many times I come
in the men's room, I can't get used to it.

336
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:32,204
I should leave before someone catches me.

337
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,239
-Man.
-I need to piss so bad!

338
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,079
Coming through!

339
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,915
This kid's avoiding us again.

340
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:47,118
It's not like you're going to pee
sitting down.

341
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:49,855
Hey! Why do you keep
running away when you see us?

342
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:52,357
I'm sorry, I'm a bit...

343
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:00,465
It's so obvious
you're doing it on purpose.

344
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:03,101
Just because you got to debut
as A.N.JELL in one shot,

345
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:05,003
you don't think we trainees
aren't worth your time?

346
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:08,173
You're seriously pissing me off.

347
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,307
That's not it!

348
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:11,610
I just...

349
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,381
Yes, take your dump.

350
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,083
You're not worth our time either.

351
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:28,994
Everyone really hates me.

352
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,131
I just run away because I'm afraid
you'll find out I'm a girl.

353
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:36,101
I'm sorry.

354
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,446
"I'm afraid you'll find out I'm a girl"?

355
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:52,951
You... Are you a girl?

356
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,855
Let's see if it's true.

357
00:25:58,823 --> 00:25:59,824
You can't!

358
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,193
-Ko Mi-nam's a girl!
-It's a girl!

359
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,461
Ko Mi-nam's a girl!

360
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:06,031
-Ko Mi-nam's a girl!
-You're a girl?

361
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:07,232
-I'm sorry!
-Hey!

362
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:08,867
-She's a girl!
-He's a girl!

363
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:19,077
-Get her!
-Run after her!

364
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:20,845
Ko Mi-nam is...

365
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:21,980
Ko Mi-nam's a girl?

366
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:23,348
He's a girl?

367
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:24,683
Ko Mi-nam's a girl!

368
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:29,287
Stop right there!

369
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,558
You little!

370
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:40,432
-Stop!
-Get over here!

371
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:42,400
I got caught!

372
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,102
What do I do now?

373
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:45,637
Reverend Mother!

374
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:46,738
Gemma!

375
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:48,907
Gemma!

376
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:02,087
Reverend Mother.

377
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,222
Are you here for me?

378
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:08,793
Gemma. You ran very fast, very hard.
Are you out of breath?

379
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:10,595
No.

380
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:12,764
Where you just got hit, does it hurt?

381
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,834
No!

382
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,768
Gemma.

383
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,870
Doesn't something feel strange?

384
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,140
You're not out of breath. You're not hurt.

385
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,110
Where do you think this is?

386
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:27,012
This is...

387
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:39,391
Is this a dream?

388
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:42,560
You are correct, Gemma.

389
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:45,697
You are in a dream.

390
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:48,299
Now.

391
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:51,002
Shall we wake up now?

392
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:54,139
One.

393
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:57,876
Two.

394
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:00,645
Three.

395
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:21,066
It really was a dream.

396
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:23,301
I was so scared.

397
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,013
KO MI-NAM IS AN ANGEL

398
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,451
KO MI-NAM

399
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:46,925
Tae-gyung!

400
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:48,693
TAE-GYUNG

401
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:54,833
Hey.

402
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:57,469
Mi-nam.

403
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,604
Can you sign this for me, please?

404
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:02,640
What? You want my autograph?

405
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,309
Yes.

406
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:07,011
Didn't you not like me?

407
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:25,663
KO MI-NAM

408
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,535
-I was here first!
-Thank you!

409
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:32,370
Tae-gyung, could you sign this please?

410
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:45,450
That's so cool.

411
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:46,551
Mine's so...

412
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:55,660
Why do I have to choose your autograph?

413
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:59,964
Because yours looked so awesome,
so I wanted to ask you.

414
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:02,133
I tried my best to come up with some.

415
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:05,670
Would you choose one out of these?

416
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,974
KO MI-NAM

417
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,354
They're all bad.

418
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:25,790
Even an autograph needs its own flare.

419
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:29,294
Since you're inarticulate and dull,
naturally your autograph reflects it.

420
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:33,198
Then can you make me
a sophisticated autograph,

421
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:35,800
since you're the most sophisticated one?

422
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:38,403
Why should I?

423
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:42,507
You told me to do my best,
to give it my all.

424
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:45,510
So I thought that accounts
to my autograph as well.

425
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:49,380
I'm sorry for making things
difficult for you.

426
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:53,518
I'll try my best.

427
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,496
Like you can imitate it if I make you one.

428
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:09,601
Ko Mi-nam.

429
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:13,605
Her name's simple enough,
making one would be easy.

430
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:25,984
Ko Mi-nam.

431
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:31,756
Ko Mi-nam.

432
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:39,097
What are you doing?

433
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:42,267
It's nothing.

434
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,836
You're writing Ko Mi-nam
with a passion on that

435
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:46,070
and "it's nothing"?

436
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:48,506
Well...

437
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,676
I was making my autograph.

438
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,514
Your autograph?

439
00:31:57,081 --> 00:32:00,885
Yes. I thought I should have one,
so I'm trying my best

440
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,086
but it's not going so well.

441
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:05,990
I see what you mean. These aren't great.

442
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:10,228
That's what Tae-gyung said too.

443
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:14,599
You showed Tae-gyung first?

444
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:16,701
Yes.

445
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:20,004
If you want opinions on things like that,
come to me first from now on.

446
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:21,572
What?

447
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,974
We're special.

448
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:29,414
We're close, remember?

449
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:34,752
Yes, we are!

450
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:57,742
Well, this is decent enough.

451
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:00,311
The strokes are fine
and it's well-balanced.

452
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:04,582
No.

453
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,318
It's too complicated for Ko Mi-nam.

454
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:09,821
It would be too hard for her to copy.

455
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,856
She can't write English.

456
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:35,179
What do you think?
It's easy to write, right?

457
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:37,048
Yes, it is.

458
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:39,017
And it's cool-looking too.

459
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:42,253
Ko Mi-nam.

460
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:43,921
Damn...

461
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,057
It's such an overwhelmingly cool name.

462
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:48,259
Who named you?

463
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:52,397
My mom.

464
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,332
That's what my late father
had said, I was told.

465
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:56,968
I heard from Mr. An

466
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:58,903
that your parents have passed away.

467
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:01,973
Oh, but my mother's alive.

468
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:03,541
What?

469
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:06,377
Well, she might be.

470
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:11,315
I'm sure there was a reason why
my mom had to leave me when I was born.

471
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:14,852
But my name's so overwhelmingly unique,

472
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,554
I'm sure she remembers me.

473
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:21,125
When I become famous, I know
she'll recognize me and come to see me.

474
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,363
That's what I'm waiting for.

475
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:32,236
So, that's what it was.

476
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:36,140
-Pardon?
-That's why

477
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:40,711
we need to make an autograph
that highlights that name.

478
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:43,648
Thank you.

479
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:23,421
Ko Mi-nam.

480
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,623
This should be good enough.

481
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:42,273
Her room is so dirty,
this might get lost in the mess.

482
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:20,278
KO MI-NAM

483
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:23,381
KO MI-NAM

484
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:29,220
This is why I get involved,
she's so unrefined.

485
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:45,703
Ko Mi-nam?

486
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,638
Where were you? What were you doing?

487
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,042
I was practicing my autograph.

488
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,378
Speaking of, check your room. I--

489
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:55,479
I made one!

490
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:57,815
What?

491
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:00,651
An autograph. Shin-woo made one for me.

492
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:04,522
Shin-woo.

493
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:07,692
Did he now?

494
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:12,129
Do you want to see? It's super cool!

495
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:15,633
Forget it! I have no interest
in something like your autograph.

496
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:18,236
Of course.

497
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,537
I'm sorry.

498
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:24,208
Ko Mi-nam, you're as light

499
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:27,144
and disloyal as that piece of paper.

500
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:28,412
Excuse me?

501
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:29,947
Forget it. Get out of my way.

502
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,389
What does this paper
have to do with being disloyal?

503
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:41,259
Did I do something wrong again?

504
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,435
I should have never helped that disloyal,
frivolous Ko Mi-nam.

505
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:56,407
The autograph I made...

506
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:01,078
Ko Mi-nam's so dense,
she might not even find it.

507
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:05,316
Even if she did, she'll think
that it was one of hers.

508
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,020
No, it's too outstanding for her
to mistake it as such.

509
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:10,388
She'll definitely notice.

510
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:22,099
Tae-gyung! Why did you make me
an autograph without asking me?

511
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,735
I like the one Shin-woo made for me more.

512
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:32,510
I have to get that back.

513
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:05,076
I left it there without saying anything.

514
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,045
So it would be perfectly fine for me
to take it back without a word.

515
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:24,195
Is this the one she made with Shin-woo?

516
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:34,939
It's not that good.

517
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:46,117
Damn...

518
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:09,707
Ko Mi-nam.

519
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:13,411
You lost a fine piece
due to your shallow attitude.

520
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:28,826
I can't see anything.

521
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:31,328
What just happened?

522
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:48,746
Stay calm, Tae-gyung.

523
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:57,154
Is this Ko Mi-nam's head?

524
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,924
Ko Mi-nam?

525
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:01,892
I have nyctalopia.

526
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:04,094
I can't see anything if there's no light!

527
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:06,330
Ko Mi-nam, wake up! Ko Mi-nam.

528
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:09,967
Ko Mi-nam! Wake up!

529
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:14,238
Such a useless noggin.

530
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:24,682
I have to gain my bearings.

531
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:27,351
If I can turn 120 degrees,

532
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:28,786
I have hope.

533
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:30,454
Turn 120 degrees.

534
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,122
Turn 120 degrees.

535
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,233
Just 120 degrees.

536
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,747
Ko Mi-nam is dangerous, I knew that.

537
00:41:57,781 --> 00:41:59,283
So why did I go
and do something like this?

538
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,289
My goodness gracious.

539
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,024
Who takes five million won

540
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,260
for settlement money? Who does that?

541
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:11,028
You should have just paid time for it!

542
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:13,264
Was there really a need
to get a private loan?

543
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:15,266
Hey. That meager five million,

544
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:17,801
my nephew can pay it all back in a jiffy!

545
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:21,572
Don't you know what a famous singer he is?

546
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:23,641
You haven't even met him.

547
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,310
I left him the picture, I told you!

548
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:28,579
I'm sure he's waiting for me right now.

549
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:31,815
My little brother will be so happy

550
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:35,319
in heaven when he hears
that Mi-nam became a singer.

551
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:40,791
I can't remember much,

552
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:43,294
but this is Father.

553
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:46,497
I wonder what he was like.

554
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,240
He was a genius composer!

555
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:59,009
Who had no hit songs.

556
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:00,778
"No hit songs"?

557
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:02,947
How dare you!

558
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,182
You know Mo Hwa-ran right? Mo Hwa-ran.

559
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:09,019
My brother made her songs too.
You don't even know.

560
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:10,020
Want to hear it?

561
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:14,224
Just this one thing

562
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:16,660
In the next life

563
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:18,862
If you ever return

564
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:22,433
to this place

565
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:26,570
Take myself, take my heart

566
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:30,574
with you when you're born again

567
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:34,878
So you may know

568
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:38,782
my broken heart,

569
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:42,319
so you can feel

570
00:43:42,686 --> 00:43:46,023
how broken I am

571
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:01,839
Your voice is always
so beautiful, Ms. Hwa-ran.

572
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,841
Thank you.

573
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:05,843
This song you just sang,

574
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:10,381
it's the one you always refer to
as the song you love the most, right?

575
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:11,982
Yes.

576
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:14,218
it's by composer Ko Jae-hyeon.

577
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:15,619
It's called "Passionate Sorrow."

578
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:19,590
It wasn't a huge hit, I do admit,

579
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:22,726
but it's the song I cherish the most.

580
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:27,931
Is there a special reason behind it?

581
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:31,268
A heartbreaking story, perhaps?

582
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:33,270
Well...

583
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:36,106
let's just say

584
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:41,011
it holds memories of a time
when I was most purely loved.

585
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:54,925
And with which man would that be?

586
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,502
All right, today's the Asian Festival.

587
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:07,204
Rehearsal starts at two o'clock.

588
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:11,709
Our waiting room's the VIP dressing room
in Studio B so we'll be unpacking there.

589
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:24,855
Oh, Ms. Yoo He-i.

590
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,162
You're the host
for today's festival, right?

591
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,566
Please introduce us well.

592
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,434
And, well,

593
00:45:37,835 --> 00:45:40,037
I'm actually a big fan.

594
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:44,441
I'll be looking forward
to your special stage today.

595
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:47,144
I'm a big fan of A.N.JELL as well.

596
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:48,812
-Jermy, right?
-Yes!

597
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:51,048
Kang Shin-woo, right?

598
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:54,485
And that must be the new member,
Ko Mi-nam!

599
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,291
And he's...

600
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:07,097
Sorry, I seem to be drawing a blank.

601
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:10,901
You don't know Tae-gyung?

602
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:12,970
He's our leader.

603
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:14,838
Sorry,

604
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:18,075
I blanked for a second.

605
00:46:18,842 --> 00:46:20,611
I'll see you on stage!

606
00:46:25,649 --> 00:46:26,617
Hwang Tae-gyung.

607
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:28,652
I bet you're pissed now.

608
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:32,089
What the heck.

609
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:33,490
Fake Fairy.

610
00:46:34,024 --> 00:46:36,093
What an immature, childish move.

611
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:44,268
Hello?

612
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:46,436
The security office?

613
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:51,375
Sir, we're a bit busy right now,
can you call...

614
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:55,746
A lady's looking for Ko Mi-nam?

615
00:46:56,446 --> 00:46:57,581
I have to go. Now!

616
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:00,784
But you have to go on stage!
Let's think about this.

617
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:02,619
What do I do?

618
00:47:03,787 --> 00:47:05,856
I'll go see her first and make sure
she doesn't go anywhere.

619
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:09,426
You just focus on the performance at hand.
You can't botch this up!

620
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,763
Okay. Please call me
as soon as you meet her!

621
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:16,066
Yes, I'll call you immediately.
Head over to the waiting room!

622
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:18,969
Studio B, go on!

623
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:47,531
This is the Studio D.

624
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:49,333
Where is everyone?

625
00:47:58,508 --> 00:47:59,877
A.N.JELL WAITING ROOM

626
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:02,079
Quickly, we don't have much time!

627
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:03,347
-We're on next, right?
-Yes!

628
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:04,581
Okay, got it, thank you!

629
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:07,050
Hey, Jermy! Are you sleeping?

630
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:08,919
No.

631
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,255
All right then. Be careful!

632
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,590
Hey, that's sponsored! Treat it carefully.

633
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:17,160
Oh, hello. How are you?

634
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,228
We're doing fine.

635
00:48:20,197 --> 00:48:21,398
Tae-gyung, you look fantastic.

636
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:41,051
Excuse me, is this--

637
00:48:41,118 --> 00:48:42,586
Bring that bag over to me.

638
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:44,688
Pardon?

639
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:47,090
The bag. There.

640
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:49,927
Oh, yes.

641
00:48:57,067 --> 00:48:58,835
Those lights are so strong,
my head's aching.

642
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:00,704
Press here.

643
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:02,839
Oh. Yes.

644
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:17,154
Harder.

645
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:19,623
Yes.

646
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:21,291
But...

647
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:23,927
But I am a bit busy right now...

648
00:49:25,195 --> 00:49:26,363
I brought your coffee, ma'am.

649
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:28,932
Who are you?

650
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:31,635
Pardon?

651
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:36,573
Who are you?

652
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:43,547
Contour here to make him look slimmer!

653
00:49:43,613 --> 00:49:45,048
-Yes, ma'am.
-Hey.

654
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:47,084
Let's check over the products.

655
00:49:50,854 --> 00:49:52,522
Have you seen Ko Mi-nam?

656
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:53,991
I haven't seen him anywhere.

657
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:55,125
I don't know.

658
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:56,560
Maybe he's in the bathroom?

659
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:58,095
Go find him. Go on.

660
00:49:58,161 --> 00:49:59,029
Okay.

661
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:06,536
Don't worry. I'll take good care of him.

662
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:08,105
Why are you telling me that?

663
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:10,674
It doesn't concern me.

664
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:18,448
This little... Getting all loose already?

665
00:50:22,052 --> 00:50:25,722
Yes, I'm in A.N.JELL with Tae-gyung.

666
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:28,091
He's a really great person.

667
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:30,193
Is that right?

668
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:33,063
Guess he treats
other people well, at least.

669
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:47,010
Oh, Tae-gyung's a fan of yours, Ms. Mo.

670
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:50,614
Tae-gyung

671
00:50:51,782 --> 00:50:52,649
is my fan?

672
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:58,422
I found a ton of your old movies
and albums in his room.

673
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:01,725
He must be a fan,
since you're quite famous.

674
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:04,628
Did he say that?

675
00:51:08,331 --> 00:51:09,199
Then...

676
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:11,968
would you like an autograph?

677
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:14,171
Pardon?

678
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,340
I'll sign something for you,

679
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:19,976
want to take it to him?

680
00:51:21,478 --> 00:51:25,048
An autograph is a way of expressing
one's heart and love for another.

681
00:51:25,315 --> 00:51:26,950
I'm sure he'll love it.

682
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,755
You're too sweet.

683
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:35,492
Your name was Ko Mi-nam, you said?

684
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:36,993
Yes!

685
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:38,862
Ko Mi-nam.

686
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:40,697
Ko Mi-nam.

687
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:44,868
I didn't think I would meet another one...

688
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:47,838
A.N.JELL, standby for rehearsal!

689
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:49,306
What the...

690
00:51:49,372 --> 00:51:51,508
-Mr. An! You're here!
-Yes, hi.

691
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:56,313
Where did Hoon-i and Mi-nam run off to?

692
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:03,186
Where is Studio B anyway?

693
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:12,229
Call him right now!

694
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:14,498
This is Mi-nam's phone.

695
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:15,966
Dang it.

696
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:17,634
Oh, there he comes.

697
00:52:21,905 --> 00:52:24,941
I'm sorry, I got a bit lost. I'm sorry.

698
00:52:25,008 --> 00:52:26,510
Get ready.

699
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:30,514
Has Mr. Ma called?

700
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:32,182
No. Let's hurry up and get this done.

701
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:33,717
Quickly!

702
00:52:52,736 --> 00:52:53,603
Okay.

703
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:56,540
Wrap it up and head over,
I have to check on the other boys.

704
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,275
Bring him over quick!

705
00:53:09,052 --> 00:53:10,320
Why isn't he calling?

706
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:12,622
Ko Mi-nam!

707
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:15,892
What are you waiting for?

708
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:19,996
Sorry.

709
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:22,199
Rehearsals are starting soon,

710
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:23,700
you should turn it off.

711
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:28,104
Do I have to?
I'm waiting for an important call.

712
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:30,473
You're waiting for a call?

713
00:53:31,942 --> 00:53:35,212
I... I think it might be something
about my mom.

714
00:53:35,812 --> 00:53:37,581
Really? Are you sure?

715
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:40,083
I'm not sure yet, I'm waiting.

716
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:42,953
But I have got a good feeling about it.

717
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:45,722
I hope your feeling proves correct.

718
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,993
Shin-woo, Mi-nam.
Rehearsals are starting. Come on!

719
00:53:51,194 --> 00:53:52,028
Let's go.

720
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:00,937
I'm telling you,

721
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:05,675
I'm going to tell Mi-nam directly.
Face-to-face.

722
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,779
Mi-nam wants to see me too.

723
00:54:10,146 --> 00:54:11,548
No, he doesn't.

724
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:14,017
He wishes to see his mom. His mom!

725
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:17,287
Just tell me about his mom, please.

726
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:21,591
Well, I...

727
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:27,364
You did great! The show's starting in ten,
get something to wipe their sweat off.

728
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:42,879
The show will begin soon, so don't go
anywhere and stay here, please.

729
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:52,722
Ko Mi-nam. Give me your phone.

730
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:55,358
What are you doing?

731
00:54:56,493 --> 00:54:58,795
You were distracted because of it
the whole time during rehearsal!

732
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:02,032
This is your debut stage.

733
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:04,000
Pull yourself together and

734
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,603
get your head out of the clouds!
Do you want to get kicked out?

735
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:09,639
Tae-gyung.

736
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:12,976
I think I'll be able to leave soon.

737
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:14,878
What?

738
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:17,547
I found the person
who came to see me last time.

739
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:19,349
I'll be able to find my mom soon.

740
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,019
I see. That's good news.

741
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,722
So you'll leave as promised?

742
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:29,526
Yes, I won't be getting in your way
or causing trouble for you any longer.

743
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:32,195
This is all thanks to you, Tae-gyung.

744
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:35,432
Thank you for taking care of me
this whole time.

745
00:55:37,934 --> 00:55:39,269
I'm even more thankful that

746
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:40,904
you'll be out of my hair soon.

747
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:43,606
So please give me my phone back.

748
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,475
She'll call me soon.

749
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:47,777
Not until our performance is over.

750
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:51,648
Be patient and fulfill your responsibility
for this stage perfectly.

751
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:53,650
That was your promise.

752
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:57,020
You're right. I'll do my best.

753
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,290
Then please take good care of it
until we're done.

754
00:56:13,436 --> 00:56:16,606
So once they call, Ko Mi-nam will scram?

755
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:22,078
What a grateful phone.

756
00:56:28,184 --> 00:56:32,689
Now, the first stage since A.N.JELL
was reborn as a four-member team!

757
00:56:38,995 --> 00:56:42,832
It could not be love

758
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:46,870
There was no way it was love

759
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:50,707
I fooled myself again and again

760
00:56:50,774 --> 00:56:54,677
But my heart keeps calling out for you

761
00:56:55,345 --> 00:56:59,315
I tried running away

762
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:03,353
I tried pushing you away

763
00:57:03,553 --> 00:57:05,955
But the more I do

764
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:10,860
You fill up my heart

765
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:15,064
I think that's how much I love you

766
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:19,102
I think how's much I'm longing for you

767
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:23,273
No matter how much it aches

768
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:27,243
My heart can't seem to leave you

769
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:31,214
I guess love can't be changed

770
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:35,351
My heart will never change

771
00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:39,556
My heart's always belonged to you

772
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:43,593
And now, I can tell you everything

773
00:57:43,927 --> 00:57:47,797
I love you

774
00:58:00,443 --> 00:58:02,612
Sometimes love,

775
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:04,948
Or at times our tears

776
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:08,318
May cause us pain and suffering

777
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:10,553
-But I still love you
-But I still love you

778
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:12,655
-I love you
-I love you

779
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:17,660
All I need by my side is you

780
00:58:34,611 --> 00:58:38,448
I think I still love you

781
00:58:38,648 --> 00:58:42,552
I think I'm still waiting for you

782
00:58:42,919 --> 00:58:46,523
You may be able to fool your head

783
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:50,593
But your heart cannot be fooled

784
00:58:50,793 --> 00:58:54,631
I guess love can't be changed

785
00:58:54,898 --> 00:58:58,835
My heart will never change

786
00:58:59,102 --> 00:59:02,872
My heart's always belonged to you

787
00:59:02,972 --> 00:59:06,976
And now, I can tell you everything

788
00:59:07,243 --> 00:59:11,414
I love you

789
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:16,986
That was amazing!

790
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,956
That was absolutely wonderful!

791
00:59:20,023 --> 00:59:22,258
That's how do you it. Perfect!

792
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:23,226
Fantastic!

793
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:27,430
Just keep this up for the sixth album.

794
00:59:27,797 --> 00:59:28,898
Thank you!

795
00:59:29,098 --> 00:59:32,035
By the way, have you seen Tae-gyung?

796
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:55,625
Where's the information
to send Ko Mi-nam away?

797
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:03,166
Where did Tae-gyung go?
We have to take pictures for the sponsor.

798
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:04,934
Let's start with you two, then. Here.

799
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:05,835
No, I'm sweaty.

800
01:00:05,902 --> 01:00:08,304
Jermy, it's for the sponsors.

801
01:00:08,404 --> 01:00:09,973
But I'm sweaty!

802
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:12,675
Jermy! Can I borrow your phone?

803
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:14,043
What?

804
01:00:14,143 --> 01:00:16,479
I have to talk to Mr. Ma. It's urgent.

805
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:17,747
Can I borrow it?

806
01:00:20,149 --> 01:00:21,250
Seriously.

807
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:23,119
Make it quick.

808
01:00:25,421 --> 01:00:26,689
I'm serious. Make it quick.

809
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:33,296
Man.

810
01:00:43,406 --> 01:00:45,775
Mr. Ma! What happened?

811
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,683
I sent you a text just now,
did you not see it?

812
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:54,884
YOU HAVE A NEW MESSAGE

813
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:56,653
I DON'T THINK WE CAN FIND YOUR MOTHER.
I'M SORRY.

814
01:01:14,404 --> 01:01:15,338
I see.

815
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:17,807
So if we can't find her,

816
01:01:18,574 --> 01:01:21,110
does that mean we still don't know
where she is right now?

817
01:01:21,577 --> 01:01:23,046
I... I think she most likely...

818
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:27,250
She passed away.

819
01:01:55,978 --> 01:01:57,280
Hey, are you done?

820
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:00,950
Ko Mi-nam.

821
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:06,122
Hey.

822
01:02:06,589 --> 01:02:07,790
What, what's wrong?

823
01:02:12,628 --> 01:02:13,730
Hey.

824
01:02:14,163 --> 01:02:15,932
Are, are you hurt? Are you sick?

825
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,402
Hey. Oh, no.

826
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:20,603
Hey!

827
01:02:20,937 --> 01:02:22,071
Are you okay?

828
01:02:23,506 --> 01:02:26,242
Just hold on, okay?
I'll bring someone, anyone.

829
01:02:26,609 --> 01:02:28,177
Stay here, okay? Stay here!

830
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:05,248
Ko Mi-nam.

831
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:13,356
They can't find her.

832
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:16,692
She's not in this world anymore.

833
01:03:19,028 --> 01:03:19,962
My mom's...

834
01:03:21,664 --> 01:03:23,132
She's gone. I can't meet her.

835
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:36,445
Mom...

836
01:03:38,381 --> 01:03:42,251
Shin-woo, there's something wrong
with Ko Mi-nam. He's crying his eyes out!

837
01:03:44,453 --> 01:03:46,322
That way. Wait up!

838
01:05:01,364 --> 01:05:02,431
What...

839
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:26,822
