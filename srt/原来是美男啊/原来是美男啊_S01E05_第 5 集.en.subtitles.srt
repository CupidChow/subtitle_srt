1
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,454
Shin-woo, what's wrong with Ko Mi-nam?

2
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:23,857
Does Tae-gyung know what's wrong with him?

3
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:25,925
It seems like it.

4
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,695
Tae-gyung might also know everything.

5
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:30,697
What?

6
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,736
Just leave them be.

7
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:01,661
Stop crying.

8
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:03,496
People are going to find out.

9
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:06,199
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,368
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:15,875
Mi-nam.

12
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,614
What's wrong?

13
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:23,016
Are you okay?

14
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,052
What's wrong? Tae-gyung, what happened?

15
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:27,287
What's...

16
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:29,856
going on with Mi-nam?

17
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:33,393
I think his stage anxiety
just caught up with him.

18
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,463
Ko Mi-nam. Stop crying.

19
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:47,740
What are you all doing here?
You guys were great!

20
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:49,275
You were fantastic!

21
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:52,879
What's going on? Are you all right?

22
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,815
Mi-nam was just a bit overwhelmed
by everything.

23
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:59,452
Tae-gyung was comforting him.

24
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:04,624
Well, look at you!
Even your teamwork is fantastic!

25
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:06,926
Can you re-do his makeup?

26
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,431
Oh, my goodness. Your face is a mess.

27
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,100
The festival's not even over,

28
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:16,769
but the reporters
are dying to speak with you!

29
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:17,704
Get him ready.

30
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:18,972
Let's go.

31
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:41,728
I heard about your mom from Hoon-i.

32
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:46,933
I should stop crying and making a mess.

33
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:49,068
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:52,639
Are you sure you can do it?

35
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:56,276
I can.

36
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,244
You can't.

37
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,787
What are you going to do
with those swollen eyes, cry again?

38
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:09,489
How will you explain them?

39
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:12,091
Will you say that I'm bullying you again?

40
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:15,929
I can do it. I'll do my best.

41
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:18,531
Take her with you.

42
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:22,869
I'm sure she's dying to hear
the news in person.

43
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,438
There's no way she'll be up
for any interviews.

44
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:28,708
Just go.

45
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:36,616
Tae-gyung.

46
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:38,818
Thank you.

47
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,591
What about Mr. An?

48
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:46,659
I'll handle it.

49
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,695
What about the reporters?

50
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,465
We need to disguise her
if we want to sneak out.

51
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:54,968
Oh, wait!

52
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,304
I just have to take off
her Ko Mi-nam disguise!

53
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:00,506
I've got a great idea. Let's go.

54
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:14,387
DRESSING ROOM, YOO HE-I

55
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,360
Yoo He-i's stylist is a friend of mine.
We'll borrow something and return it.

56
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,266
This one...

57
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:28,301
and this one.

58
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,104
Oh, Gucci? This looks good.

59
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:36,843
You were great today, He-i.

60
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,011
-Thank you!
-Great job.

61
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:45,985
Let's go and stake out
by Yoo He-i's dressing room

62
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:48,554
so I don't miss her!

63
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,794
Hwang Tae-gyung?

64
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:02,568
Hwang Tae-gyung is outside
Yoo He-i's dressing room?

65
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:09,042
I knew it. I knew something was up.

66
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:11,611
I knew her and A.N.JELL had something!

67
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:21,821
Hurry up, the show's over.
You'll be stuck when the crowd spills out.

68
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,091
We're done.

69
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:45,945
Be sure you don't get caught.

70
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,369
She really is a girl.

71
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,472
It feels so strange to see her like that.

72
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,240
Hwang Tae-gyung?

73
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:21,247
Isn't this Yoo He-i's dressing room?
What are you doing here?

74
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:26,586
Is He-i already back in her room?

75
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,158
Oh, wait!

76
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,560
-What's going on?
-Reporter.

77
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,629
-If he sees your face, we're done for!
-Tae-gyung!

78
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,030
Hold on! Stop!

79
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:40,566
Tae-gyung! He-i!

80
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:44,971
Damn it.

81
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:52,812
Run out that way.

82
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:54,013
Keep your head down.

83
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,815
If you don't make eye contact,
no one will know.

84
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:57,517
Go, quickly!

85
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:58,718
Thank you!

86
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,721
Tae-gyung!

87
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:03,456
Damn it.

88
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:05,658
Tae-gyung!

89
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,360
Hwang Tae-gyung!

90
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:30,016
-Ms. Wang.
-Trust me. Let's go.

91
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,727
You danced so enthusiastically today.

92
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,762
Oh, thanks.

93
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,630
You were so enthusiastic,

94
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,866
you didn't realize
you were standing in my way.

95
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:50,203
Sorry for blocking the camera.
I won't do it again.

96
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,509
You wore some high heels today.

97
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:59,178
Your legs must've looked the longest!

98
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,447
Sorry. Should I break the heels off?

99
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:04,217
Oh, no. No need to on my account.

100
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:06,953
But if you want to...

101
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,656
What a scary little thing.

102
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,225
Bitch.

103
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:14,827
Tae-gyung!

104
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,730
You have to be kidding me.

105
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:19,499
Tae-gyung!

106
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,101
Hwang Tae-gyung!

107
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,871
Stop going up.

108
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:25,872
Tae-gyung!

109
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:31,344
Hwang Tae-gyung?

110
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,180
Why are you here right now?

111
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,587
I knew it. I knew it was the two of you.

112
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:43,756
What is this?

113
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,159
This might be for the best.

114
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,462
Fake Fairy. You take care of it.

115
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:50,963
Take care of what?

116
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:52,899
Just do what you do normally.

117
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:54,267
Bye.

118
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,602
Wait! Tae-gyung!

119
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,040
He-i, what's going on between you two?

120
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:02,708
What do you mean?

121
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:04,710
I just want to know

122
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:08,114
why the two of you ran away
when you saw me?

123
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:11,083
I did? When?

124
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:13,719
I saw everything.

125
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,855
I followed you all the way here.

126
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,757
What are you talking about?

127
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,064
-Where's Tae-gyung?
-Where are they?

128
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,099
-What's taking them so long?
-Seriously.

129
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,268
They will be here shortly, yes.

130
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,406
Thank you.

131
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:35,841
Where's Mi-nam?

132
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:37,743
-He left.
-What?

133
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,746
So, do what you're best at
and cover for him, please.

134
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:42,148
What?

135
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:43,916
Direct all questions towards me.

136
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:45,952
I'll answer all of them sincerely.

137
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:53,659
Something terrible has happened.

138
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,562
You see, an emergency came up with Mi-nam.

139
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:57,463
I'm so sorry.

140
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,799
I sincerely apologize.

141
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:11,043
So...

142
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,180
he's been searching for his mom,
but she passed away?

143
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,683
That's why he was crying.

144
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,052
Then did both of you know

145
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:22,722
that he didn't have parents?

146
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,324
Is that why you were so good to him?

147
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:30,396
I had no idea.

148
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,300
I was such a fool for misunderstanding.

149
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,671
This stupid rotten orange of a brain!

150
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:44,710
I feel bad for Ko Mi-nam.

151
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:53,586
Mi-nam.

152
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:56,355
I searched everywhere for you two,

153
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:58,424
my only flesh and blood!

154
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:02,428
There isn't a place in Korea
that I didn't go to!

155
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,564
Before your dad died,

156
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:08,434
he entrusted you
and your twin sister to me

157
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:10,169
and told me

158
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:13,539
that your mom was no longer in this world.

159
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,845
Is there no way of finding out
who she was?

160
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:25,217
I heard that she was a singer,

161
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,386
but I've never seen her in person.

162
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,954
And besides,

163
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,390
if she's already gone,

164
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,359
there's no way to find her.

165
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:37,730
Meeting you today
is the happiest moment of my life.

166
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,800
My goodness.

167
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,135
Mi-nam.

168
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:51,844
Well...

169
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:53,779
Sister...

170
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,117
Don't be so discouraged.
At least you found your aunt.

171
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:00,820
Right.

172
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,456
It's all thanks to you, Mr. Ma.

173
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:04,857
Thank you.

174
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,625
I didn't do anything.

175
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:07,927
This all happened

176
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:11,764
because you played
Mi-nam's role perfectly.

177
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:18,070
And your debut stage today was so great.
You did amazingly well.

178
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:19,972
We just have to keep this--

179
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:20,873
It's time...

180
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:22,742
for us to stop.

181
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:25,945
I promised Tae-gyung I would.

182
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:30,416
You promised him?

183
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:32,318
Did you now?

184
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:45,765
And now, it's time for Ko Mi-nam's

185
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:49,368
first successful performance
congratulatory party!

186
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:51,270
A congratulatory party?

187
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:55,207
So many people have come
to congratulate Ko Mi-nam.

188
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,342
Firstly,

189
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,778
the nation's beloved singer, Kim Gun-mo!

190
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:03,682
Oh, his schedule's so busy,
he had to leave early.

191
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:04,917
And the second guest

192
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:08,053
is comedian Jung Sung-ho.

193
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:10,222
"Mi-nam.

194
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:13,359
It was so fun today.

195
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:15,361
Right, Mi-nam?"

196
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:17,596
Yes, thank you so much!

197
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:20,065
And lastly, Noh Hong-chul is here!

198
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:24,336
"Shin-woo.

199
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:27,506
Let's go! Let's do this!"

200
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:31,043
Jermy, thank you!

201
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:33,145
We were all waiting for you.

202
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:34,346
Come on, have a seat.

203
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:37,950
You haven't eaten anything
until now, right?

204
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:39,985
Have a seat.

205
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:43,055
Thanks, Shin-woo.

206
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,537
Tae-gyung didn't help with anything,

207
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:00,506
but he also didn't stop us from doing it.

208
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,142
Tae-gyung.

209
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:04,810
Thank you.

210
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,247
We waited forever
in this cold weather for you.

211
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,719
But we couldn't let you be alone
after all that happened today.

212
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:15,187
Yeah, we're a team.

213
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:16,789
It's only right we stick together.

214
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,926
Thank you for thinking of me

215
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:25,564
even though I was a mess.
I gave you nothing but trouble.

216
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:27,266
I'm sorry.

217
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,070
Ko Mi-nam.

218
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:35,074
You were pretty useful today.

219
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,144
You did great on stage today.

220
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,082
Thank you!

221
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:49,722
Did you watch Barefoot Ki-bong?

222
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,423
You all saw it right?

223
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,060
There's a scene where Ki-bong
is eating with his mom.

224
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:56,862
I'll show you what he does,
and you copy me, okay?

225
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:01,233
"Put a piece on here! And another!"

226
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:03,602
Why aren't you laughing?

227
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:05,137
I can't believe this!

228
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:08,540
Everyone dies of laughter
when I do this on variety shows!

229
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:09,441
Stop it.

230
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:11,210
We've seen it so many times,
it's lame now.

231
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,078
"It's lame"?

232
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,514
Wow, how could you say that to me?

233
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,317
During those wretched,
struggling times as a rookie group,

234
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:21,754
I went on every variety show I could
and did all these impressions

235
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,088
to raise the profile for our band!

236
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,090
I basically spoon-fed you!

237
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:27,426
You should be forever grateful
to these impressions

238
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:28,761
that have served us so well, but no!

239
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:31,130
You're throwing them out like trash!

240
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:32,631
I don't know

241
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:35,701
whether your impressions
played such a huge role in our success.

242
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:39,071
Wow, I can't believe what I'm hearing.

243
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:43,275
Who was the one who had to cover for you
for all those variety shows

244
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:44,910
because you whined and refused to?

245
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:46,512
Don't be like that.

246
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:48,914
Tae-gyung tried at first, at least.

247
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:54,954
Wait, then you also went on TV

248
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:56,922
and did what Jermy just did?

249
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,825
Ko Mi-nam. Are you curious?

250
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:03,963
It was so long ago.
There isn't any record of it left.

251
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:05,197
No.

252
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:09,168
I've kept the footage to cheer me up
when I feel down.

253
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:10,869
Ko Mi-nam! Let's go.

254
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:12,871
Come on!

255
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:17,943
Why is he bluffing?

256
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,179
There's no way any of it still exists.

257
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:21,747
He's not bluffing.

258
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,582
I've watched it a few times too.

259
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:30,389
Hold on, let me find it.

260
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,924
Where did I put it?

261
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:36,061
Oh, shoot.

262
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:42,401
Here we go.

263
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,205
Jermy, don't turn it on!
I'll kill you if you do!

264
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:47,206
Come on, sit.

265
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:53,145
The new rising star of the music industry!

266
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,548
I give you the rookie group, A.N.JELL!

267
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,484
ROOKIE GROUP A.N.JELL

268
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:03,956
Your team name isn't Angel but A.N.JELL.
What does it mean?

269
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,595
Arch...

270
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,664
it's short for Archangel.

271
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,136
Yes, it's Archangel.

272
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:19,972
Damn it.

273
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:22,107
He'd better not show that to her.

274
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,677
This was our very first
variety show appearance

275
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:26,912
right after we debuted.

276
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:31,083
The Three Grating Brothers
are quite popular

277
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,351
-these days.
-Turn that off now!

278
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:33,719
They have prepared...

279
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:34,753
Wait. Hold on.

280
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,756
Let's forward to the most important part.
Here we go!

281
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,262
Hand me the radish!

282
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:47,166
Oh, such determination!

283
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:58,010
That may have been
the most serious rendition of that skit.

284
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:15,828
-Get over here.
-I personally think Tae-gyung

285
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:17,663
-was the best at it.
-Get over here!

286
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:19,031
The absolute best!

287
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:21,700
I'm going to kill you!

288
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,269
That's the legendary moment
of our doomed Variety Genius,

289
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:25,237
Hwang Tae-gyung.

290
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:29,274
You're truly amazing, Tae-gyung!

291
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,244
Turn it off right now!

292
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,486
What? Tae-gyung and Yoo He-i?

293
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:45,190
I'm telling you,
they haven't even had a meal together.

294
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:47,359
Come on.

295
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,596
Yoo He-i said that too,
but you don't have to lie to me.

296
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:55,200
That's the first thing everyone says
in response to relationship scandals.

297
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:56,668
My goodness.

298
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:59,538
Where are you even getting this from?

299
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,406
I've seen some things

300
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:04,810
at the hospital
where Hwang Tae-gyung was at last time!

301
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:08,080
The parking lot.

302
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:17,723
I'm sorry I couldn't come see you
when you're so ill.

303
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,025
I only got to come by for a shoot.

304
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,427
It's not your fault.
We are famous stars after all.

305
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,663
Honey!

306
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:25,597
He-i.

307
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:28,200
What?

308
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,139
They met in the hospital parking lot.

309
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,108
That's for certain.

310
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,876
Come on.

311
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:42,014
Those two don't even know
each other's phone numbers.

312
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:46,752
Well, they did act like
they didn't know each other in public.

313
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:49,488
But today,

314
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:52,524
I caught them red-handed.

315
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:00,566
Oh, Yoo...

316
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,703
How long do we have to run away like this?

317
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,139
It's not your fault.
We are famous stars after all.

318
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,407
He-i!

319
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,343
What? Come on, Mr. Kim.

320
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,512
You've read too many romance comics!

321
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,814
I have proof!

322
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:17,549
This is ridiculous.

323
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,051
You have proof? Sure.

324
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:20,786
I can't wait.

325
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,988
Here. Take a look.

326
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:24,923
Sure.

327
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,031
Come on.

328
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:36,468
This looks nothing
like Tae-gyung and Yoo He-i.

329
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:41,173
I mean, I have no immediate plans
to write an article.

330
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,041
But...

331
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,677
I will prove that those two

332
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,179
are dating.

333
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,414
Just watch.

334
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:04,630
Ko Mi-nam.

335
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:06,531
Is it that funny?

336
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,636
You were crying earlier,
and now you're laughing.

337
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:13,205
You keep making things difficult for me.

338
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,141
I'm sorry.

339
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:20,979
Anyway, disrespectful laughter
is better than clingy tears.

340
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,483
You were so funny though.

341
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,251
You were the coolest out of the three!

342
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:27,753
You were number one!

343
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:30,789
"Were"?

344
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:32,524
What about now?

345
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,962
You're still cool, Tae-gyung!

346
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:40,165
But not coolest or number one.

347
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,136
Forget it.

348
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:45,804
I don't care about what you like or not.

349
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:49,174
All that aside,

350
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:53,779
I'll remember you as the number one
best person for taking care of me.

351
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,116
I'm so happy I get to leave
with such good memories.

352
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:00,085
Leave?

353
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,623
I couldn't find my mom,
but I'll keep my promise.

354
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,260
I'll make sure I won't cause
any trouble for you before I leave.

355
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:15,400
I'm going to go help Shin-woo clean up.

356
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:24,976
She practically begged me
to stay for her mom,

357
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,946
but she won't do the same for her brother?

358
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:31,783
I thought twins would be more loyal.

359
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:42,294
Are you feeling better?

360
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:45,931
It was a rough day,

361
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,533
but this really helped and comforted me.

362
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:52,137
I can comfort you even more.

363
00:22:57,342 --> 00:23:00,912
But that is if you would give me your hand
and honestly ask for help.

364
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:04,416
"Honestly"?

365
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,985
Give me your hand.

366
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:09,721
Pardon?

367
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:11,990
I said give me your hand.

368
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:29,341
Take these over there.

369
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:32,978
Okay, I will.

370
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:44,222
I'm right here.

371
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,892
Who are you offering your hand to?

372
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:56,501
Oh, I'll take them.

373
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:57,969
It's all right.

374
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,271
Just give them to me.

375
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,240
It seems like I misunderstood you

376
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:05,143
and disliked you for dumb reasons.

377
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:07,412
At least let me help with this.

378
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:09,648
What misunderstandings?

379
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,685
Well, I...

380
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,221
I thought

381
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,491
you were being a fox
and trying to seduce them

382
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:21,393
by getting close to them.

383
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,429
Being a fox and trying to seduce?

384
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,498
Who exactly are you talking about?

385
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,734
Well, I...

386
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:32,704
Yeah! Jolie!

387
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:35,440
My friend, Jolie! Jolie, who loves me!

388
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:37,576
Jolie is closest to me,

389
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:41,246
but you kept befriending her
and being all close to her.

390
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,848
It annoyed me.

391
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:46,084
Oh, is that so?

392
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,487
Well, you don't have to worry now.

393
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,822
I will no longer

394
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,591
do that again.

395
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:54,559
Okay then.

396
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,763
I won't do anything mean to you again too.

397
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:00,999
I'm taking these.

398
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:04,569
Don't think of it as being mean.

399
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:08,940
I've always liked you
and your exciting, vibrant energy.

400
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,481
Oh, no!

401
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,218
Are you all right?

402
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,094
You almost fell!

403
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:31,763
I'm fine.

404
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:35,634
Give them to me. I'll carry these down.

405
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:43,141
That was close.

406
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:45,210
I almost fell for it.

407
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,086
This new style looks great on you.

408
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,789
It reminds me of your rookie days.

409
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:02,561
Why did you decide to change it
all of a sudden?

410
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:04,663
Just because.

411
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:07,265
I'm apparently not the coolest.

412
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,068
Hold on, I have to go talk to the person
who would do your makeup.

413
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:45,437
It's Fake Fairy.

414
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:05,991
Hwang Tae-gyung.

415
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:10,495
What are you doing?

416
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:16,434
Saving this poor thing.

417
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:21,539
You were watching me sleep, weren't you?

418
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:25,343
Like there's anything worth seeing.

419
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:27,879
Why don't you look in the mirror?

420
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:38,690
Oh, that's right.

421
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:41,860
What did you tell the reporter last time?

422
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:43,828
Why, what did he say?

423
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:45,764
He asked me if we were dating.

424
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:47,966
Are we dating?

425
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:49,601
What? Of course not!

426
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:51,836
Okay then.

427
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:55,106
Don't act all chill about it.

428
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:57,809
Who was the girl then?

429
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:02,347
The one who ran with you
wearing clothes similar to mine.

430
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,784
There are pictures, you know.

431
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:08,586
Pictures?

432
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:12,057
I saved it because it was so ridiculous.

433
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:17,095
She dressed like me,
so I can see why he mistook her for me.

434
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,666
-Let me see.
-Hey! What are you doing?

435
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,537
You really can't tell who it is.

436
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:28,006
Hwang Tae-gyung! Give it back!

437
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:29,874
They can't write anything with this.

438
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:32,444
Still, you better explain.

439
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,079
It's annoying that
he's confusing me for her.

440
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:36,748
What's there to be confused about?

441
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:41,152
Her height is totally different,

442
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:44,255
and her body is different too.

443
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:47,058
She looks nothing like you.

444
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:50,128
Don't worry about it, Korea's Fairy.

445
00:28:57,602 --> 00:28:58,803
I hope your hair turns out pretty.

446
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:07,245
Did he just delete the photo? Hey!

447
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:08,480
Tae-gyung!

448
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:11,683
Why was he with Yoo He-i?

449
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:24,095
Hwang Tae-gyung.

450
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:26,464
Is he really seeing someone?

451
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,334
Who could it be?

452
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,202
ORIGINAL PYTHON PUMPS

453
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,738
We're going nuts in the studio right now.

454
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,778
They're so pretty.

455
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:41,746
Ko Mi-nam.

456
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:43,414
You like this too?

457
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:47,418
No, I just thought the heels
were really pretty.

458
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:49,754
Her heels, not her legs?

459
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:55,927
Don't guys usually look at the girl's legs
rather than the shoes?

460
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,797
-Right?
-Yeah.

461
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:00,131
He freaking loves legs.

462
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:01,432
I...

463
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,768
-It's true.
-You're so strange.

464
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:09,107
Are the heels that pretty?

465
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:13,611
No, it's just I've never worn
heels like that before.

466
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,055
Because I'm a man!

467
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:27,125
I've never worn them before,
so it's pretty in a cool, novel way.

468
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,695
The model's legs are quite beautiful.

469
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:33,097
Heels...

470
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:47,579
Well?

471
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:50,148
Yeah, the concept for the sixth album
is very good.

472
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:53,852
Be sure to keep it a secret
and that it doesn't leak.

473
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:54,752
Okay.

474
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:57,355
Oh, Tae-gyung.

475
00:30:57,755 --> 00:30:59,757
There's something you need to keep secret.

476
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,462
You don't have to act
in front of me, dummy.

477
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:06,798
You're dating Yoo He-i, right?

478
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,334
-What?
-Yoo He-i?

479
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:13,004
You were with her at the salon too.

480
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:16,040
You're dating her?

481
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:17,609
I'm not.

482
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:19,344
Come on, man. You know my...

483
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:24,282
Right. Keep it down-low.

484
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,051
-I'll be going now.
-Sure.

485
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:30,321
Wait, Tae-gyung.
We have a lunch appointment.

486
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:32,357
Me?

487
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:36,127
A senior artist in the music industry
specifically asked for you.

488
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:37,729
She wants you to remake her song.

489
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:39,764
Who is it?

490
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:42,467
You'll see when you get there. Let's go.

491
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:12,664
Which one should I get?

492
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:19,003
Come in.

493
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:24,943
It's Ms. Mo Hwa-ran.
I'm sure you know her well.

494
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:27,211
This is Hwang Tae-gyung, ma'am.

495
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:30,648
I also know him well, of course.

496
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:50,001
I had a huge, sudden craving
for this restaurant's food.

497
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:52,637
Thanks for coming with me.

498
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:56,040
Glad to be of help
even if it's you buying me food.

499
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:57,742
Let's dig in.

500
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:00,478
And while you're at it,

501
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:02,380
can you come with me after this?

502
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:04,282
Where are we going?

503
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:05,316
An amusement park.

504
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:07,852
I'm obsessed with Viking rides,

505
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,988
but I haven't rode one since we debuted.

506
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:11,990
I've never rode one at all.

507
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:14,359
That's fine. We can go today.

508
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:16,995
I prepared our disguises too.

509
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:27,038
What do you think?

510
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:35,413
What about me?

511
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,583
I'm sure no one will recognize us
if we walk around like this.

512
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:44,789
You can put it back in here.

513
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,329
Is that a disguise too?

514
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:54,866
No. It's a present.

515
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:56,501
Pardon?

516
00:33:57,402 --> 00:33:59,337
I'm going to meet this girl today,

517
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:02,040
and there was something I hid from her.

518
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:03,641
I'll apologize to her with that.

519
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:06,711
Hopefully, I'll receive
her forgiveness and her heart.

520
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:10,681
If someone as cool as you
gives her a present,

521
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:12,250
I'm sure she will love it.

522
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:21,492
I'm ready to go back on stage again.

523
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:23,828
Granted,

524
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:27,131
I could end up doing
a couple of dinner shows a year.

525
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:28,566
But I want more than that.

526
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:31,569
I want to come back just like old times.

527
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:36,140
The industry's not as it used to be.
It's getting rough.

528
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:39,410
That's why I'm asking you

529
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:43,848
and this young artist here.

530
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:49,353
We'll release an album
and perform together.

531
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:58,362
We should start by doing a remake
of your song first.

532
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,897
Tae-gyung will do a fantastic job.

533
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:01,899
He must be talented.

534
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:03,701
Of course!

535
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,471
He's the son of Hwang Kyung-se,
the world-renowned conductor.

536
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:10,708
Is that right?

537
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:13,845
Like genius father,

538
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:15,980
like genius son?

539
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,683
I'm not sure about the genius,

540
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:20,751
but I take only after my father.

541
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:22,820
Only your father?

542
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:29,227
Those who think they're geniuses
don't get along with me well.

543
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,529
They're too sensitive and fastidious.

544
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,598
It never ended well.

545
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:36,601
Even if they are sensitive or fastidious,

546
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:39,170
if the other party
isn't temperamental or unpredictable,

547
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:41,072
it ends pretty well.

548
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,109
Why don't you dig in?

549
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:47,512
The food is truly delicious. It's so good!

550
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:51,549
I specially ordered the best
this place offers.

551
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:53,451
Thank you.

552
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:09,367
What's wrong?

553
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:11,569
Shrimp.

554
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:12,470
What?

555
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:17,508
Oh, it is shrimp.

556
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:18,576
What's wrong?

557
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,279
Oh, he's allergic to shrimp.

558
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:22,747
Are you okay?

559
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:34,358
He's allergic to shrimp?

560
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:13,931
It's just because you begged me,
so make sure no one sees it, okay?

561
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:21,305
I ordered this specially for you
since we haven't seen each other.

562
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:22,573
Why aren't you eating?

563
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:25,476
It's shrimp.

564
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:27,712
Yes, it's shrimp.

565
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:30,848
Are you a picky eater?

566
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:39,290
Your father must've raised you
to be like the fastidious man he is.

567
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:43,261
Can't you even pretend to eat it?

568
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:27,471
What are you doing?

569
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:38,115
Don't make things more difficult for me.
Go to the bathroom.

570
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:06,110
Isn't it funny?

571
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:09,513
That really happened? That's so funny!

572
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:12,049
Oh no!

573
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:14,518
I'm sorry, I'll go clean it.

574
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:48,152
Tae-gyung?

575
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:54,892
Tae-gyung?

576
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,261
Are you unwell?

577
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:12,276
Tae-gyung!

578
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:15,746
Are you all right?

579
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:17,982
Tae-gyung!

580
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:20,651
Tae-gyung!

581
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:00,858
Hello?

582
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:02,827
Mi-nam, where are you?

583
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:14,972
Shin-woo, I'm really sorry.

584
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:17,341
Tae-gyung's really sick,

585
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:19,510
so I think I have to go
take care of him today.

586
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:25,883
Tae-gyung?

587
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:29,420
I see.

588
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:31,689
Okay.

589
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:33,724
Bye.

590
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:42,700
Are you all right?

591
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:44,935
I'm fine.

592
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:46,670
I just couldn't breathe for a little bit.

593
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,573
Did you have shrimp by any chance?

594
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:55,045
Even you remember it.

595
00:41:57,715 --> 00:41:59,283
How come she can't?

596
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:33,384
I guess I can't give this to her today.

597
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:47,698
Go back and bring me my phone.

598
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:49,366
Sure.

599
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:53,604
Which way do I go?

600
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:56,941
You don't know? You came with me.

601
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,343
I just followed you.

602
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:02,212
My goodness.

603
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:05,282
Where the heck are we?

604
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:09,620
We didn't walk long.

605
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:11,989
I'm sure it will appear
one way or another.

606
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:13,824
Then go.

607
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:15,192
I can go,

608
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:17,628
but I can't guarantee I'll make it back.

609
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:20,531
I can't risk getting lost
in front of these many people.

610
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:22,900
You came here just fine.

611
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:26,971
Right.

612
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:38,449
Shin-woo prepared these
so we could go to the amusement park.

613
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:41,518
Shin-woo asked you to go
to the amusement park?

614
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:44,121
I wonder why he asked you.

615
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:48,459
Why? Is it not fun if you go with me?

616
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:50,194
We're super close, you know!

617
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:54,031
Usually, a guy goes to an amusement park
with his girlfriend.

618
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:57,167
Oh, I think he does have a girlfriend.

619
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:00,270
He said he was going to see her today.

620
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:04,174
Then he was just killing time with you.

621
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:06,577
Why am I not surprised?

622
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:18,889
We've been walking for a while,
but it's nowhere to be seen.

623
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:21,725
They probably left
with all of our stuff by now.

624
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:25,362
At this point, it would be faster
to head over to the agency.

625
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:27,631
I know the way there well.

626
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:29,266
Let's go.

627
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,013
Wait.

628
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:46,450
We passed by this ice cream shop earlier.

629
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:48,218
Stupid.

630
00:44:48,752 --> 00:44:50,954
There's a ton of this ice cream chain
in this neighborhood.

631
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:51,955
This is a different one!

632
00:45:05,169 --> 00:45:07,604
Tae-gyung! It's the same store again!

633
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:09,673
I said there's a ton of these!

634
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,323
Tae-gyung, I'm telling you,
this is the same store!

635
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:27,958
I observed it closely last time.

636
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:29,526
It's the same employee!

637
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,197
What the heck? I'm sure it's this way.

638
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:39,236
I got a little confused
since I'm always in the car.

639
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:41,839
So, stop whining and be quiet!

640
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,510
Tae-gyung, let's just catch a cab.

641
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:49,680
I'll run up when we get to the agency
and get the money for the cab fare.

642
00:45:51,381 --> 00:45:54,017
Have you no pride? We can't get a cab now.

643
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,755
Then, should I ask for some directions?

644
00:45:57,821 --> 00:45:58,655
No!

645
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:00,224
I'm going to find the way.

646
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:03,327
Someone once told me this.

647
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:06,497
"If you look with an earnest,
desperate heart, you can find it."

648
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,468
So, just trust and follow me.

649
00:46:47,704 --> 00:46:49,239
-Hello!
-Hey!

650
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,109
That's A.N.JELL's stylist.

651
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:54,912
A.N.JELL?

652
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,947
I heard it's getting impossible
to get them as sponsors.

653
00:46:57,014 --> 00:46:58,081
Yeah, it's been rough.

654
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,550
Do they have something here today?

655
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:01,485
Not that I know of.

656
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,121
Besides, that's a female costume.

657
00:47:04,688 --> 00:47:05,689
Wait a second.

658
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:09,293
That looks similar to what I wore
during the Asian Music Festival.

659
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:11,361
Call me when you need help.

660
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:12,262
Okay.

661
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:18,836
Sorry, the side got ripped a little bit
but it's as good as new.

662
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:20,804
Yoo He-i's so picky about stuff like this!

663
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:23,674
How did you even end up ripping it?
I'm so dead.

664
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,776
We were running a bit.

665
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:28,912
Anyway, you saved my life with this.
Thank you.

666
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:29,947
Whatever.

667
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:32,382
Oh, I heard you went on a blind date!

668
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:36,787
That stylist must know the woman
who wore that and ran.

669
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:38,922
Give me a minute.

670
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:42,292
Excuse me.

671
00:47:43,827 --> 00:47:45,028
Oh, Ms. He-i!

672
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:47,531
Hello.

673
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,266
We met each other at the salon, right?

674
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,969
Oh, yes.

675
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:57,741
I heard Tae-gyung and that person
escaped successfully.

676
00:47:58,675 --> 00:47:59,509
Excuse me?

677
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:01,311
How did you...

678
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,548
I heard it from Tae-gyung.

679
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:07,117
Tae-gyung told you that?

680
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:10,087
Are you two really dating?

681
00:48:13,156 --> 00:48:14,324
In these moments,

682
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:16,293
I think the right answer is no.

683
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:19,129
If he even told you about Mi-nam,

684
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:20,931
you really must be dating!

685
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:22,966
Yes, we are.

686
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:24,468
That person,

687
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:27,905
Tae-gyung made me swear
to secrecy about them.

688
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:29,373
As he should have!

689
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:31,642
If people find out Mi-nam's a girl,

690
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:33,310
it will be hell for all of us.

691
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:38,582
Of course.

692
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:42,152
If people find out Mi-nam's a girl,

693
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:43,620
it will be a disaster.

694
00:48:55,732 --> 00:48:57,034
We're finally here.

695
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,503
See? What did I say?

696
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:01,605
I said I could find it.

697
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:12,149
I told you to trust me.

698
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:35,405
Now, let's get in the van and go home.

699
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:41,945
Why is my heart beating so fast?

700
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:44,948
Is it because I walked for too long?

701
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:03,033
Why do you keep sneaking looks at me?

702
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:06,103
No, I just...

703
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:10,507
Your new hairstyle is really cool!

704
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:16,413
It's the hairstyle that I said
was really cool.

705
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:20,017
I didn't change it because of you.

706
00:50:21,284 --> 00:50:22,786
It's for the new album.

707
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:25,222
I see.

708
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:28,658
By the way,

709
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:30,594
when you tell me I'm really cool,

710
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:32,829
why don't you do this?

711
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:34,031
Right.

712
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:35,899
You're really cool!

713
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:38,502
Forget it. You don't mean it.

714
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:41,304
I do!

715
00:50:42,005 --> 00:50:43,807
Your heart wasn't in it at all.

716
00:50:44,307 --> 00:50:45,575
It was from the bottom of my heart!

717
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:47,577
And yet you only tell me now?

718
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:49,279
I just...

719
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:51,214
You're super awesome, Tae-gyung.

720
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:54,551
Jolie!

721
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:55,819
What a good girl.

722
00:50:56,153 --> 00:50:56,987
Jermy.

723
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,689
What?

724
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:01,525
Is Shin-woo not back yet?

725
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:03,860
He's here. He's on the roof.

726
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:05,228
I see.

727
00:51:05,762 --> 00:51:06,930
-Jolie.
-Hey.

728
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,333
Oh, that's right.

729
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:12,769
I won't get close to Jolie.

730
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:15,405
Yes. Don't get close.

731
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:17,074
Go. That way.

732
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:24,648
Jolie.

733
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:26,850
Jolie.

734
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:28,085
After that day,

735
00:51:28,552 --> 00:51:31,188
I can't keep Ko Mi-nam out of my mind.

736
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:38,695
I've always liked you.

737
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,602
I just got it out of my head,
and now it's back!

738
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:47,104
Dang it.

739
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:50,740
Jolie.

740
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:52,576
What should I do?

741
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:55,412
I think about Ko Mi-nam all day.

742
00:51:57,414 --> 00:51:58,381
What's wrong with me?

743
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:13,930
Shin-woo, didn't you say
you were meeting someone today?

744
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:15,565
Yeah.

745
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,300
But she bailed on me.

746
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:20,237
Oh, I see.

747
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:23,840
Then should we go
to the amusement park now?

748
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:27,244
I'm sure we'll have fun since we're close!

749
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:30,780
I'm exhausted right now.

750
00:52:32,015 --> 00:52:33,083
Maybe later.

751
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:43,560
Later? But it's going to be night soon.

752
00:53:10,887 --> 00:53:12,055
You've packed well.

753
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:13,890
Yes.

754
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:17,661
I will get out of your hair
for real this time.

755
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:19,529
So you say.

756
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:23,066
But I wonder how long
this resolve will last.

757
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:27,137
Mi-nam! Your aunt's here!

758
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:29,639
Aunt?

759
00:53:30,473 --> 00:53:32,475
Mi-nam!

760
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:35,111
Mi-nam, you should've told me!

761
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:36,513
It will be fine.

762
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:37,981
Everything will be fine, Mi-nam!

763
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,249
-Aunt!
-Mi-nam!

764
00:53:39,482 --> 00:53:41,985
Yes, yes, it will be!

765
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:44,020
Oh, by the way, who are you?

766
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:48,758
The reason I called you here is...

767
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:50,727
Hwang Tae-gyung.

768
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:52,729
A man

769
00:53:53,463 --> 00:53:54,864
never, ever

770
00:53:55,498 --> 00:53:56,700
lets his knee touch the ground!

771
00:53:57,601 --> 00:53:58,435
But...

772
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,071
I am kneeling before you right now.

773
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:07,444
Tae-gyung. My aunt knows nothing!

774
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:08,912
So, leaving now...

775
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:10,747
is a bit difficult.

776
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:12,983
Please.

777
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:17,821
I will no longer listen to your excuses.

778
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:20,457
How strange.

779
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:22,292
I'm not even angry anymore.

780
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,028
Just do what you want.

781
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:28,665
Tae-gyung.

782
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:33,603
That's good enough.

783
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:37,274
Be strong.

784
00:54:37,707 --> 00:54:39,676
Remember your aunt!

785
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:42,178
She doesn't know anything.
It's up to us to take care of her.

786
00:54:44,347 --> 00:54:47,150
You're all okay with Mi-nam's aunt
staying here for a while, right?

787
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:50,487
Well, my mom stayed here

788
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:52,389
when she was visiting from England.

789
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:54,924
I guess there's no problem.

790
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:58,194
What a beautiful family-centered mind.

791
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:05,001
You're such a kind man, Mr. An.

792
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:08,405
Yes.

793
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:10,573
I think you can stay at Mi-nam's room.

794
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:11,841
Oh, wait.

795
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:15,178
He may be your nephew, but still a guy.
It would be uncomfortable.

796
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:16,146
Well...

797
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:20,550
Oh, then you should use Mi-nam's room,
and you can room with someone else.

798
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:22,218
Who wants to share rooms with Mi-nam?

799
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:23,520
-Pardon?
-What?

800
00:55:24,387 --> 00:55:26,523
What? There are no other rooms.

801
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:29,292
Jermy, you're the youngest,
so you share rooms with him.

802
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:35,031
Me? Share my room with Ko Mi-nam?

803
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:44,441
No, I don't have the confidence
to stay in one room with Ko Mi-nam.

804
00:55:46,209 --> 00:55:47,043
Then Shin-woo?

805
00:55:49,979 --> 00:55:51,715
I'm sure there's someone
more comfortable than me.

806
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,051
Tae-gyung?

807
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:55,952
No. I refuse.

808
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:58,488
You're all dudes!

809
00:55:58,555 --> 00:56:01,257
What's wrong with sharing a room
for a few days?

810
00:56:02,058 --> 00:56:03,993
Mi-nam, you decide.
Who will you room with?

811
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,540
I'll kill you.

812
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:26,883
If I have to share a room with someone...

813
00:56:41,097 --> 00:56:42,031
Are you pointing at me?

814
00:56:46,336 --> 00:56:48,571
There we go. Okay.

815
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:50,240
Tae-gyung's room is the biggest anyway.

816
00:56:50,306 --> 00:56:51,574
Bunk with him. Okay.

817
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,277
No. I absolutely refuse.

818
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:56,846
Ko Mi-nam, look at me.
You don't like it either, right?

819
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:01,985
But considering the circumstances,
you're by far the most comfortable.

820
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:06,623
Well, I'm not. It's uncomfortable.

821
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,459
Forget it, dummies!

822
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:12,262
Mi-nam, go pack. Let's go to my house.

823
00:57:12,695 --> 00:57:15,398
Your aunt can use the side room,
and you can share with me.

824
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:16,599
Excuse me?

825
00:57:16,666 --> 00:57:17,534
I don't think...

826
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:20,804
I live alone, so I'm bored too!

827
00:57:21,037 --> 00:57:23,473
We'll exercise together, go to the sauna,
scrub each other's backs!

828
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,876
We'll have a fun time like family!

829
00:57:28,044 --> 00:57:28,878
Tae-gyung!

830
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:32,415
Tae-gyung!

831
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:44,994
Ko Mi-nam.

832
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:48,198
Just come to...

833
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:52,235
Come to my room.

834
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:55,638
Don't lie.

835
00:57:55,705 --> 00:57:57,507
You look like you're chewing
on crap right now.

836
00:58:01,277 --> 00:58:02,445
I'll have a fun time with him.

837
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,681
We'll exercise together,

838
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:06,816
go to the sauna,

839
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:08,485
and scrub each other's backs.

840
00:58:09,419 --> 00:58:10,386
Sounds like fun.

841
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:18,161
What a great guy

842
00:58:19,796 --> 00:58:21,898
Hwang Tae-gyung
sure seems to have changed a lot.

843
00:58:22,265 --> 00:58:25,201
He was hell bent on kicking us out before,
but not so much now.

844
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:27,737
Tae-gyung's a good person.

845
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:30,907
Nonetheless,

846
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:33,176
you have to keep this on you.

847
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:35,945
What's this?

848
00:58:36,379 --> 00:58:38,248
Be careful when you press this.

849
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:41,985
So, this...

850
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:44,254
I'm sure it will never happen,
but if Hwang Tae-gyung...

851
00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:49,659
You know, if he, by any chance...

852
00:58:50,293 --> 00:58:51,828
So, let's put it this way.

853
00:58:51,895 --> 00:58:54,497
If his eyes change from this to this,

854
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,068
then press this like there's no tomorrow!

855
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:02,238
Okay? You got that?

856
00:59:11,247 --> 00:59:13,850
I latched onto my nephew.

857
00:59:14,918 --> 00:59:17,053
It was easier than I thought.

858
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:20,857
The Yellow Pants Ko Mi-ja isn't dead yet!

859
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:24,394
I'll send the interest right over.
Just hold on!

860
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:26,496
This little...

861
00:59:29,332 --> 00:59:32,902
When can I even talk to Mi-nam
about the money?

862
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,671
I'm going to go crazy.

863
00:59:36,105 --> 00:59:37,473
Oh, my goodness.

864
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:38,374
Oh dear...

865
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:40,743
Mi-nam.

866
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:42,412
You can use this room.

867
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:43,813
Oh, okay!

868
00:59:44,614 --> 00:59:47,050
It's too early now, right?

869
00:59:47,116 --> 00:59:47,951
All right.

870
00:59:48,518 --> 00:59:49,385
Go on.

871
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:52,722
Oh, my goodness. Is this my room?

872
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,308
Are you permanently moving
into my room or what?

873
01:00:13,509 --> 01:00:15,578
If my aunt sees my things,

874
01:00:15,812 --> 01:00:17,447
she might suspect something.

875
01:00:18,314 --> 01:00:20,516
And I was packing anyway, so...

876
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:23,753
It wasn't a complete waste then.

877
01:00:24,821 --> 01:00:26,556
You promised to be out of my hair,

878
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:28,791
but you're just latching on at this point.

879
01:00:32,762 --> 01:00:33,696
It's so heavy.

880
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:37,900
No way.

881
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:39,836
You're not asking me

882
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:41,971
to help you move, right?

883
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:46,442
I can't trouble you like that!

884
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:50,780
You're such a nuisance.

885
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:55,284
It's only right you regard me as such.

886
01:00:57,053 --> 01:00:58,921
That's one thick skin you've grown.

887
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:13,369
You've got such a great personality.

888
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:15,571
On camera, off camera, you're the same.

889
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:18,441
You and I get along so well!

890
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:20,410
We should hang out more!

891
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:22,278
And...

892
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:25,314
if you know any secrets about Tae-gyung,

893
01:01:25,615 --> 01:01:27,216
please let me know.

894
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:29,919
Of course. You have my name card, right?

895
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:58,514
I'll sleep quietly and not disturb you.

896
01:02:00,616 --> 01:02:02,018
Just having you in the picture

897
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,187
makes my room look shabby.

898
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:06,723
I'm sorry.

899
01:02:11,761 --> 01:02:12,628
Ko Mi-nam.

900
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:16,399
Do you think

901
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:18,534
I'll let you sleep there?

902
01:02:21,003 --> 01:02:22,038
I'm all right.

903
01:02:22,105 --> 01:02:24,540
I wouldn't dare sleep on your bed.

904
01:02:25,374 --> 01:02:27,043
I can just sleep on the floor.

905
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:30,346
Who said anything about my bed?

906
01:02:31,848 --> 01:02:33,216
Go sleep over there.

907
01:02:37,286 --> 01:02:38,421
Oh, okay.

908
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:01,844
She's still a girl
when it comes down to it.

909
01:03:02,411 --> 01:03:04,680
How could she think
she could sleep next to a guy's bed?

910
01:03:08,684 --> 01:03:10,353
A wounded pride means nothing but defeat.

911
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:16,759
I'll turn off the lights now, Tae-gyung.

912
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:18,628
No, don't.

913
01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:20,630
I can't sleep with the lights off.

914
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:24,300
I can't sleep with the lights on.

915
01:03:27,236 --> 01:03:28,171
I'll sleep.

916
01:03:56,933 --> 01:03:58,835
I really can't sleep with the lights on.

917
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,846
Since he's deep asleep,
there's no harm in turning it off, right?

918
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:33,469
He looks so different when he's asleep.

919
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:38,608
Oh, it's because his eyes are relaxed.
He looks so nice.

920
01:04:46,782 --> 01:04:50,286
He'll be furious if he finds out
I have something like this.

921
01:04:52,355 --> 01:04:53,322
I'm sorry.

922
01:04:59,428 --> 01:05:02,798
I saw a lot of new sides
of Tae-gyung today.

923
01:05:19,348 --> 01:05:21,484
It's acting up again.

924
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:24,387
My heart's beating so fast,

925
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:26,756
and it feels like electric shocks
are running through my body.

926
01:05:27,456 --> 01:05:30,393
Reverend Mother, what's wrong with me?

927
01:05:59,355 --> 01:06:01,357
