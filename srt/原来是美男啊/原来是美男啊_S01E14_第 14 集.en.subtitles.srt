1
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:19,052
Tae-gyung!

2
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:24,758
Ko Mi-nam.

3
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:27,394
I'm here because there's something
I must tell you.

4
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:30,897
I'm only going to say it once,
so listen carefully.

5
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:37,137
Ko Mi-nam.

6
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,440
I...

7
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:48,848
-Oh, my gosh!
-Oh, my gosh!

8
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,521
Tae-gyung!

9
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,931
Tae-gyung!

10
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:08,768
I'll say goodbye, like you came
to see me off and head to the terminal.

11
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:17,243
Hear me out before you go.

12
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:22,916
I like you.

13
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:29,923
Bye, Ko Mi-nam.

14
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:36,863
Go, quick.

15
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,101
Then

16
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,770
I'll be off now, Tae-gyung.

17
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,658
What did I just hear?

18
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:10,330
Wait, it was Ko Mi-nam?

19
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:21,374
Darn it. Come on!

20
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:47,834
Did I hear it correctly?

21
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:50,803
He said it really quietly,

22
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:52,906
so maybe I heard it wrong.

23
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:57,710
I wish the world would grow quiet
for a minute, so I can hear

24
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,147
the softly-spoken words
that my heart remembers.

25
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:11,991
I like you.

26
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:58,304
She must have heard it clearly then.

27
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,776
I can't say it again, just so you know.
It's too embarrassing.

28
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,472
I knew she wouldn't come.

29
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,843
But I did get to tell her
that my feelings for her have begun.

30
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:40,013
That's enough for me.

31
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,728
HWANG TAE-GYUNG SEEING KO MI-NAM OFF!

32
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:56,996
What the heck is this?

33
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:00,566
HWANG TAE-GYUNG SEEING KO MI-NAM OFF!

34
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,869
I SAW KO MI-NAM AND TOOK A PICTURE

35
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:04,971
TAE-GYUNG IS COOL
EVEN WHEN HE SIGNS AN AUTOGRAPH

36
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:15,281
ADDRESS BOOK

37
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,550
Don't make me laugh, Hwang Tae-gyung.

38
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:19,719
What are you doing?

39
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,265
-Na-young.
-Oh, hi, hi!

40
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,767
Oh, I meant to ask.
Is your radio show live today?

41
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:38,171
Yes. You guys should come on
as guests sometime.

42
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:39,639
When our sixth album comes out.

43
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,010
Should I just go on today?

44
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,179
-Today?
-Your show airs in Busan too, right?

45
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,113
Of course.

46
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,549
Then I want to do a surprise show.

47
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,384
-Today?
-Yes.

48
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:52,852
That sounds like a great idea!

49
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:30,823
Should I say that I did hear it

50
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,625
and I give him permission to like me too?

51
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:35,595
Give me permission?

52
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,196
Forget it, Ko Mi-nam.

53
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,464
Just say no!

54
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:39,699
No.

55
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,267
I can't be all arrogant like him.

56
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,437
Then should I say I didn't hear it clearly

57
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,606
and ask him to say it again?

58
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:49,575
You didn't hear it?

59
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,511
Then just pretend I didn't say it at all.

60
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:52,512
I take it back!

61
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,747
No. I can't have him take it back.

62
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:58,584
I'll just cherish the words
with a grateful heart.

63
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:03,055
My heart might just burst if I hear him

64
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,324
say the word "like" again anyway.

65
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,561
I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat.

66
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:10,963
Ko Mi-nam.

67
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:12,398
Do you like pasta?

68
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,369
Do you like pasta or not?

69
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,444
Ko Mi-nam. How about BBQ on charcoal?

70
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,611
Do you like it?

71
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:27,447
What about naengmyeon?

72
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:28,781
Do you like it?

73
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:32,452
What about sushi?

74
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:33,920
Do you like it?

75
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,091
I like sushi.

76
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,227
Give me an answer.

77
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:42,829
How about you?

78
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:52,538
I like it very much.

79
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,743
All right, then. Sushi it is.

80
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:10,156
When I thought he was a boy,

81
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,492
he was a spitting image of Jae-hyeon.

82
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,096
But now that I know she's a girl...

83
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,732
she looks exactly like her mom.

84
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,038
Fine. Have a good trip, then.

85
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:29,342
Eat all the eel you want
until your stomach explodes.

86
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:35,748
Seeing my son

87
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,185
and that woman's daughter like that...

88
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:43,256
really irritates me.

89
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:02,408
Since you might pass away
after eating shrimp,

90
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:03,509
I'll eat them all.

91
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,045
Oh, isn't this crab meat?

92
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,347
I'll have this as well.

93
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,586
Thank you so much for being
so thoughtful in preventing my death.

94
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:16,556
Give me two of yours.

95
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:21,294
But I have one of each...

96
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,997
The tuna and eel look particularly good.

97
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,900
The tuna and the eel?

98
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,136
You can have them.

99
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,240
I'm going to lose at least ten points
at this rate.

100
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,776
Do I have to be this desperate
to maintain my points?

101
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,145
Oh, by the way.

102
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:42,315
The picture taken of us at the airport,
will it be okay?

103
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:44,250
It doesn't matter.

104
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,352
Hwang Tae-gyung was seeing Ko Mi-nam off.

105
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,522
Our fans don't care
if we're together like that.

106
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,425
I can see all the stories rolling in.

107
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:55,194
Stories?

108
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,863
The fans write a lot of stories
with us as the main characters.

109
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,800
And a good chunk of them
are love stories without any girls.

110
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,735
Those are called fan fiction.

111
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,538
-Fan fiction?
-Yes.

112
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,908
Most of them are a love triangle
between me, Shin-woo, and Jermy.

113
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:11,310
A love triangle?

114
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,460
Shin-woo?

115
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:34,967
Jermy.

116
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:38,704
You don't see anyone else but Shin-woo.

117
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:55,187
You're here...

118
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,156
inside my heart.

119
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:08,100
You two!

120
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:10,536
I'll get my revenge.

121
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,179
"I'll get my revenge!"

122
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:22,081
Wow.

123
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:23,716
Shin-woo finally

124
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,919
found out about me and Tae-gyung.

125
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,922
This story is getting a lot
more interesting than I imagined.

126
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,660
-It's almost time, right?
-Yes.

127
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,764
-Jermy!
-Yes!

128
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:39,999
We're about to go live.

129
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,636
I'll start off by telling the listeners
that you'll be singing at the end.

130
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,806
Okay. Tell them to look forward to

131
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,307
Jermy's cutest ever ending song!

132
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:49,975
Okay, I will.

133
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:05,524
I hope Ko Mi-nam smiles like you
after she hears my song.

134
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,108
Why is Tae-gyung at the airport?

135
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:27,446
Why is he with Ko Mi-nam?

136
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:41,627
What are you doing?
Why were you at the airport?

137
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:45,765
Hey. Why are you butting in?

138
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:48,868
Wait. Do you...

139
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:53,139
Mr. Ma, look carefully.

140
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,414
See that?

141
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,617
I'm going to be very busy from now on.

142
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:06,519
You two take care of the rest.

143
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:17,163
Wait. So this...

144
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:19,431
This was for Tae-gyung?

145
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:26,138
Wait! Does Tae-gyung know what this means?

146
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,547
Where do you think you're going?

147
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,650
I have something I must ask Tae-gyung.

148
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,451
Before I see him in person and confirm it,

149
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:40,853
I can't do anything else.

150
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,023
Make it quick and come back.

151
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:45,825
She already introduced you
in her opening bit,

152
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,427
so if you miss it, it's going to be
a broadcasting accident. Okay?

153
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,237
Wait, so you like Tae-gyung?

154
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:00,806
Then I've been...

155
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:03,008
I've been off the mark this whole time?

156
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,579
-Wow.
-He knew about the pig nose all along...

157
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:12,785
Be careful.

158
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,223
I just don't get it.

159
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,524
Why?

160
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,595
Why? There were three to choose from

161
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:25,598
and you just had to like the rude,
arrogant Hwang Tae-gyung? Why?

162
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,534
I don't know when it started, but...

163
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:32,104
I felt electric shocks whenever I saw him.

164
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:38,911
Oh, Jermy?

165
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:41,647
Hey. What are you doing here?

166
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:43,549
Shouldn't you be at the radio show?

167
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:48,821
Ko Mi-nam.

168
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:50,656
Do you like Tae-gyung?

169
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:53,659
You found out too?

170
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,560
Do you?

171
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,328
Someone might hear you!

172
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,379
Jermy! Where are you going?

173
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,048
-Hey!
-Jermy!

174
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:24,890
He didn't come here!

175
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:28,327
There's only an hour left.
Find him, quick! Quick!

176
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,830
The message board is filled with people
all excited to hear Jermy sing.

177
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:33,966
If he bails, we're all going
to be in big trouble.

178
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,100
Yes, I understand.

179
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,536
Find him now, quickly!

180
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:43,676
We should head over to the dorm first.

181
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:50,015
The bus!

182
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:52,051
He might be on his treasure bus.

183
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:53,719
A bus?

184
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,260
I can't remember if the bus stop
was this one or that one.

185
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:09,501
Oh, that's the one!

186
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,615
I should get off on the next stop
and wait on the other side.

187
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:41,033
Excuse me, sir! Can you stop the bus?

188
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,422
Jermy!

189
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,991
Jermy!

190
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,626
Jermy!

191
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,528
Jermy!

192
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:11,663
Excuse me!

193
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:13,999
Please stop the bus!

194
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:16,535
Jermy!

195
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,076
This is my bus.

196
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,244
Get off.

197
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:02,014
Jermy...

198
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,550
It was fine when you said you were a guy.

199
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,887
It was fine for me when you said
you were a girl.

200
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:15,194
But if you say you like Tae-gyung...

201
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:19,865
How am I supposed to be okay with that?

202
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:22,801
Why?

203
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,337
Why isn't it me?

204
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,075
I only told you about my treasure bus.

205
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,046
I only let you hold Jolie's leash.

206
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,685
I was planning to sing a song,
just for you.

207
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:43,689
So why...

208
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:47,659
Why didn't you like me instead?

209
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:29,468
Yes.

210
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:32,771
It's almost time, isn't it?

211
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,075
I'll just sing it here,

212
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,045
over the phone, if that's okay.

213
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:43,916
HE CAN SING OVER THE PHONE!

214
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:45,317
Okay.

215
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:51,323
Now, it's finally time
to meet A.N.JELL's Jermy!

216
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:53,025
Jermy?

217
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,595
Hello, this is Jermy!

218
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,965
Yes, the college entrance exams
are over now

219
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:03,869
so to cheer up the students
who had spent the year studying hard,

220
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:07,573
I brought a fun, upbeat song as a present!

221
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:08,740
Thank you.

222
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:15,080
I think the students who are listening
right now will definitely be cheered up!

223
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:17,316
Thank goodness, that was close.

224
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:23,121
Now then, shall we hear what
you've been waiting for? Jermy's song!

225
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:28,360
He chose a song that suits him well,
a fun and upbeat song.

226
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,128
The title's really great too.

227
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:31,697
"The Best Words."

228
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:34,633
The best words to me...

229
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:39,504
I have been cherishing them
because they were so precious to me.

230
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,610
But I guess if you hold them
to your chest too long...

231
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,647
they become words that

232
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,616
you can never say.

233
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:57,689
But I hope they aren't words
you don't want to hear,

234
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,159
or useless, or words that make you sad.

235
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,830
No, of course not!

236
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,199
I'm sure they'll be amazing
and just great.

237
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,268
"The Best Words," by Jermy.

238
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:15,307
I love you, these three words

239
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:19,177
Are the best words

240
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:24,383
When our family wakes up in the morning

241
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,754
We say it to each other

242
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:33,191
I love you, these three words

243
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:37,296
Are the best words

244
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:42,601
The words that Jermy

245
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:46,405
Wants to say to that person

246
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:51,209
He loves the words so much
He's excited all day

247
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:55,280
He loves the words so much,
Even he feels super excited all day

248
00:21:55,347 --> 00:22:00,485
He loves the words so much

249
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:04,056
His heart beats all day long

250
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:08,593
I love you, these three words

251
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:12,431
Are the best words

252
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:18,036
I really like these three words

253
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:21,373
I really, really do

254
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:27,612
I love, I love you

255
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,195
They...

256
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:45,731
really are the best words.

257
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:51,770
But you can't accept them.

258
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:54,773
Right, Ko Mi-nam?

259
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:00,312
I'm sorry, Jermy.

260
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:04,149
Right now,

261
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:07,352
I can't tell you I'm fine.

262
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,425
But once the bus goes around
full circle...

263
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,029
I'll be okay then.

264
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,284
We're here.

265
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:47,893
Once we get off this bus,

266
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,762
I'm going to be the fun,
outgoing Jermy again.

267
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:54,266
Forget everything I said in here.

268
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:57,436
If you don't,

269
00:23:58,537 --> 00:23:59,671
I can't ever go back.

270
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,340
You got that, Ko Mi-nam?

271
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:12,717
Ko Mi-nam! Come on, get off the bus!

272
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:15,520
If you don't get off now,
you have to go around for another hour!

273
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:24,696
Ko Mi-nam! Want to get some ice cream?

274
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:27,165
Sounds great, Jermy.

275
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:29,000
It will be my treat.

276
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:31,303
Let's go!

277
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:36,942
Yes. I do remember Ko Jae-hyeon.

278
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:41,179
Ko Jae-hyeon was Mo Hwa-ran's lover.

279
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:44,516
They were pretty well-known
in the industry.

280
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:48,720
What kind of a person was he?
Ko Jae-hyeon.

281
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:52,357
He was quiet and a good person.

282
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:56,828
A bit too plain for someone as stuck-up
as Mo Hwa-ran to fall in love with.

283
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:01,466
They ended things after Mo Hwa-ran
started dating another guy.

284
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:06,104
I heard that Mr. Ko also had children,
do you know anything about them?

285
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:11,276
I don't know whether he had kids,
but he was seeing someone else.

286
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:15,013
It was around the time
he was making my song.

287
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,483
She was also preparing
to debut as a singer.

288
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,785
They were quite the pair of lovebirds.

289
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:24,356
But if he made "What Do I Do?"

290
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,925
for Mo Hwa-ran,

291
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:31,062
he must have dumped her
and gotten back together with Mo Hwa-ran.

292
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,232
Mo Hwa-ran was being clingy, that's why.

293
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:39,404
She really got around, I hear.

294
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:44,576
I also wanted to have something
with her once.

295
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:49,548
I'm sorry, but I have to get going.

296
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:51,516
Thank you for your time.

297
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,486
Sure, Tae-gyung. See you next time.

298
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:06,197
That amazing love you keep praising

299
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,467
is nothing but salacious gossip
on other people's lips.

300
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:13,872
Why did you want to see me again?

301
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:18,109
I got something for you,

302
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:21,980
and I wanted to see
whether you would like it or not.

303
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,249
Go on. Open it.

304
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:36,394
These are for women.

305
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:39,564
Yes, they're women's clothing.

306
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:43,802
I wasn't wrong in choosing them, right?

307
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,440
-I--
-Don't worry.

308
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:52,510
I'm sure there's a reason why
you're pretending to be your brother.

309
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,213
I don't want to make things
difficult for you by prying.

310
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:59,951
You're Jae-hyeon's child.

311
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:04,589
My brother will be back soon.

312
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:06,157
I'm sorry,

313
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:08,627
but please turn a blind eye until then.

314
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:11,329
Mr. An didn't seem to have a clue.

315
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:14,599
Do your team members know?

316
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:18,370
It's not on them. It's not their fault.

317
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,639
I started all of this.

318
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,645
So they do know.

319
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,249
But they still covered for you

320
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,152
and remained close with you?

321
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:38,990
You are doing a very dangerous thing.

322
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:46,564
It's difficult to explain,

323
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:51,403
but Tae-gyung and I are personally
very special to each other.

324
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:56,608
Be careful that nothing troublesome
happens to him because of you.

325
00:27:57,976 --> 00:27:59,210
Whatever that may happen,

326
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:03,114
I will make sure that no harm
goes Tae-gyung's way.

327
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:05,950
I cannot allow myself

328
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,919
to let him get hurt.

329
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:11,289
You really care for him, don't you?

330
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:14,993
It would have been better for him

331
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:18,563
to not get involved with you.

332
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:29,974
She really is his mother,
the way she worried for him.

333
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:34,679
I can't even say
that I know their relationship.

334
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:37,115
I'm kind of stuck in the middle, it seems.

335
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:42,353
TAE-GYUNG! HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

336
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,923
YOU'RE MISS MO'S FAN, RIGHT?
THIS IS MY BIRTHDAY PRESENT FOR YOU!

337
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:50,462
I almost gave him this as a birthday gift,
thinking that he was a fan of hers.

338
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:55,533
But I couldn't say anything then.
He looked so sad.

339
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:01,439
Now, I don't feel so good about this.
It feels like I'm lying to him.

340
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:32,170
"WHAT DO I DO"

341
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,042
Oh, goodness. It's already this late?

342
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:44,382
And she hasn't even called once?

343
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:49,420
I mean, I did tell her not to bother me.

344
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:51,689
So I guess she waited all day long.

345
00:29:58,429 --> 00:29:59,364
Hello?

346
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,567
Hey. Are you sleeping?

347
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:05,804
I had a full day today,

348
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:07,705
so I was really tired...

349
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,443
Forget it. Just go back to sleep,
you sleepyhead Pig Rabbit!

350
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,581
How can she just fall asleep like that?

351
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,751
She should have been celebrating
like it was a national holiday!

352
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:20,852
But what? "I'm tired"?

353
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:26,491
I guess she's just going to sleep...

354
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:44,242
Tae-gyung. I might fall asleep
if we watch a movie right now.

355
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,246
Who said I called you
to watch a movie together?

356
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:52,483
I called you because I needed someone
to guide me in the dark theater.

357
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:56,221
I don't need you, Ko Mi-nam.
I need your eyes.

358
00:30:57,222 --> 00:31:00,325
If you're that sleepy,
leave your eyes with me and go.

359
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:05,563
Wait, I'll guide you.

360
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:10,702
Ko Mi-nam's eyes?

361
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:12,670
Time to guide me.

362
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,212
Follow after me carefully.

363
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:30,989
What are you doing?

364
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,056
I'm sorry!

365
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:41,599
Sit here.

366
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,109
This is way too close to the screen.

367
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,544
Let's go further back, Ko Mi-nam's eyes.

368
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:03,454
Here?

369
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:07,125
This is too far in the back.
Let's go that way.

370
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:10,061
Tae-gyung.

371
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:12,163
Did your eyes adjust?

372
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,936
Ko Mi-nam's eyes? Eyes can't speak.

373
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:19,370
Don't blink back at me.

374
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:16,728
I slept for a full two hours.

375
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:17,862
I feel so refreshed now.

376
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:20,031
Was the movie fun?

377
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:23,601
Well, it wasn't bad.

378
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,905
I can see the sky pretty clearly from here

379
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:29,640
but I can't see any stars.

380
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,077
But the night view is amazing.

381
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:37,382
You may not know,
since you've never seen stars before,

382
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:38,950
but it's different from the night view!

383
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:41,252
Ko Mi-nam's eyes.

384
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:44,322
Don't act like you're all that
because you can see stuff.

385
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:49,160
Sorry for showing off to someone
who can't see a thing.

386
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:56,167
Here. I'll show you stars
that you can see too.

387
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:05,443
Look, a star.

388
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:09,347
There's a star on my shirt too!

389
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:14,352
Another star!

390
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:18,723
I already found you three stars!

391
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:23,261
Thank you so much.
I'm so happy I'm seeing stars.

392
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:29,167
Now that I think about it,
even when it's not nighttime

393
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:30,968
there are so many stars around us.

394
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:36,974
When I'm done being Ko Mi-nam
and am far away,

395
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:40,845
I'll think of you as I find these stars.

396
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:43,714
Far away?

397
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:48,252
When my brother comes back
and we all return to our rightful place,

398
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:52,123
I should be far away from you all.

399
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,294
Do your best to find those stars.

400
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:58,329
I'll go to check every time

401
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:00,965
to see how many you've found.

402
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:04,168
I'll look forward to seeing lots of stars.

403
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:24,722
But the star that I love the most,
the coolest one of them all,

404
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:26,924
I can't take with me.

405
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:28,993
I'll miss it a lot.

406
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:35,066
Ko Mi-nam.

407
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:38,870
Want to see stars right this second?

408
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:52,450
One hit of this,

409
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,285
you'll see at least five stars.

410
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,753
Go on, take a hit.

411
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:59,290
Are you really going to hit me?

412
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:17,942
Don't make your pig nose this time.

413
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:51,542
A NEW START, CONFLICTS, AND EVEN
RUMORS OF VIOLENCE AMONG A.N.JELL?

414
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:04,255
I can't stand by and let them be.

415
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:07,258
I have to tell him

416
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,395
that she's the daughter
of the man I loved.

417
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:19,337
Which one would be best for Tae-gyung?

418
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:22,073
Go on, choose the best one.

419
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:23,841
This one!

420
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,878
This one is so pretty.

421
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:32,116
We got to see Tae-gyung at the airport,

422
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,219
hear Jermy's song on the radio,

423
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,355
and I got allowance from my mom.

424
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:40,324
Yesterday was one heck of a great day.

425
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:44,028
But when Jermy was singing,
he was like, fighting back tears.

426
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,229
Was it just me? Did you feel it?

427
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:49,467
What if Jermy also has a girl he likes?

428
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,402
Don't say things like that.

429
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:54,972
Tae-gyung.

430
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:57,174
Shin-woo.

431
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:59,176
And now Jermy?

432
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,512
No way! We can't have that happen.

433
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:05,816
Who do you think
is Shin-woo's girlfriend, anyway?

434
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:07,985
Do you think she's just like us?

435
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:12,256
Is she prettier than me?

436
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:15,059
We're all done, Jolie.

437
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,628
It's just like you said, Jermy.
When Jolie shakes her body,

438
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:19,230
it feels like it's raining.

439
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,298
I told you.

440
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:22,967
Good thing I told you
to wear a raincoat, right?

441
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:25,503
I'll go bring Jolie's brush.

442
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:29,073
Jolie, we're done! Come here.

443
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:39,650
It didn't rain in Busan.

444
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:41,519
Did it rain in Seoul?

445
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:45,990
I was helping Jermy

446
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,559
-bathe Jolie.
-Jolie, don't you feel good?

447
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,028
It seems like you're almost done.

448
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:53,864
Why don't you come help me now?

449
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:01,939
Mi-nam.

450
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,477
You won't even help me now,

451
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:08,446
now that you've rejected me?

452
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:12,817
You feel bad, right?

453
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:16,020
Then don't refuse and come help me.

454
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:36,340
What do I need to help you with?

455
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:40,144
First, take a look at this.

456
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:51,188
My mother gave it to me. It's for you.

457
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,892
I couldn't explain everything,

458
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:56,494
so I just brought it with me.

459
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,897
She said it was the one thing
she wanted to give

460
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:01,932
to my girlfriend.

461
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:06,303
I just hoped that you would at least
take a look at my mom's heart.

462
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,340
I won't ask you to receive it.

463
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:17,047
I'm sorry to your mother as well...

464
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:21,585
You're putting a lot of pressure on me
from the get-go.

465
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:22,820
But from now on,

466
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:26,624
I'm going to be better to you,
to the point of overwhelming you.

467
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:32,229
I treated you like a little brother,
taking care of you in the background.

468
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:37,101
But now, I'll be a man who cares for you
so blatantly you will notice.

469
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:42,373
Oh, your eyes changed.
You look more on edge now.

470
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:44,775
That's a positive change.

471
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:50,181
We were too comfortable, as brothers.

472
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,216
That's why we couldn't get anywhere.

473
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:56,987
Ko Mi-nam.
Keep watching me with those eyes.

474
00:40:57,321 --> 00:41:00,458
See how well I take care of you.
See how far I'll go in my stupidity.

475
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:02,026
Watch me carefully.

476
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:05,529
Shin-woo.

477
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:08,599
Don't do stupid things because of me.

478
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,868
What? You're worrying for me now?

479
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:15,506
That's it, a glance or two towards me.
That's a good starting point.

480
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,612
I can't look at you, Shin-woo.

481
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:37,294
I had stayed a step back to comfort you.

482
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:43,100
But now, I'm going to take a step forward
and comfort myself.

483
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:50,674
Ko Mi-nam! Now, for Mi-nam's
single album to be successful,

484
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:52,042
it's one step after another!

485
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:57,047
The date for the showcase is set.

486
00:41:57,214 --> 00:41:59,083
Let's go! Jackpot!

487
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:00,317
-Jackpot!
-Jackpot!

488
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:03,020
-Jackpot!
-Jackpot!

489
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:06,857
All right.

490
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:09,693
Everybody, eyes on me.

491
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:14,899
The day for the real Mi-nam's return
has been set.

492
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:21,238
Mi-nam will be back the day
before the showcase.

493
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,509
I thought this day would never come.

494
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:30,915
What's the real Ko Mi-nam like?

495
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:32,016
The real Mi-nam?

496
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:36,086
Well, they look exactly the same.

497
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:37,955
But they are quite different.

498
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:43,360
He's got Tae-gyung's charisma,
Shin-woo's soft tender side,

499
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:44,995
and Jermy's outgoing, bright personality.

500
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:46,830
He has it all.

501
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:49,099
Oh, man.

502
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:54,071
You better be on your toes
when he gets back.

503
00:42:57,441 --> 00:43:00,044
Oh, man. I can't believe it. Mi-nam...

504
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:03,814
is finally coming back!

505
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:36,380
It may be hard and lonely,
but that's just all practice

506
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:40,751
I won't fall

507
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:43,687
I have no problems at all

508
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,859
The video has finished recording.

509
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,695
Wow! 100 out of 100 points!

510
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:54,932
Yes! 100 points!

511
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:57,434
Ma Hoon-i got 100 points!

512
00:43:57,601 --> 00:43:59,370
Yes, check this out.

513
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:03,941
The celebratory song for me, Ma Hoon-i,
for coming this far!

514
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:05,209
Did you upload it on the blog?

515
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:06,243
It's been uploaded.

516
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,479
It's all finished now.

517
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:11,915
-Mi-nam will be back from the States!
-Yes!

518
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,551
The Mi-nam here will get together
with Tae-gyung!

519
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:17,021
-Yes!
-Everybody go!

520
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:20,090
What?

521
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:21,659
With Tae-gyung?

522
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:23,794
What's that about?

523
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:33,203
What do you mean?

524
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:35,272
Hoon-i told me too.

525
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:38,308
That you and Tae-gyung are fake

526
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:40,511
and the real couple is Tae-gyung
and Ko Mi-nam.

527
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:43,714
What's real?

528
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:45,516
It's not, right?

529
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:47,785
I can't believe it either.

530
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:50,821
How could Tae-gyung like Mi-nam
when he has you?

531
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,790
-How is that possible?
-He-i.

532
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:55,693
How can Ko Mi-nam be his real girlfriend?

533
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:58,729
How could someone like Ko Mi-nam beat me?

534
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:04,268
How is it not me? Why is it Ko Mi-nam?

535
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:09,006
I hate Ko Mi-nam so much.

536
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,508
She's sucks so much!

537
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:15,879
I want to be a guy too!

538
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,615
I want to chop my hair off
and be a guy too!

539
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:20,517
Calm down.

540
00:45:33,964 --> 00:45:35,232
These are the stars you found today?

541
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:39,336
Yes. That's the star I found
while getting something to drink.

542
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,805
And that one was on Mr. An's jacket.

543
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:45,876
And that star was on the tomato
Mr. Ma was eating!

544
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:49,079
Just three today?

545
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:52,015
You're not looking
that thoroughly, are you?

546
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:57,521
Well, my favorite star is always
shining next to me right now.

547
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:04,661
I mean, it shines. All the time. Everyday.

548
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:08,565
Oh, the one you kept bragging about?
The coolest one?

549
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:09,933
Where is it?

550
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:12,469
You can't see stars anyway.

551
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:14,104
You don't have to know.

552
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,674
You bragged about it so much

553
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:20,577
that I bought
a high performance telescope.

554
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:23,280
I could see everything with that.

555
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:26,150
You really bought one?

556
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:30,087
Yes. Let's see that star you keep
bragging about

557
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:31,822
tonight. I'll let you see it with me.

558
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:33,857
Ko Mi-nam.

559
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,660
Tonight's a fan meeting with a star!

560
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:41,031
Yes! Then I'll see you later.

561
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:49,673
What if we can't see a thing
because of the weather?

562
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:54,311
Whatever. I don't need any other stars.

563
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:56,346
I'm the best star there is anyway.

564
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:59,082
There's no way Ko Mi-nam can't see me.

565
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:09,927
She can have this as a substitute.

566
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:20,304
I can't tell him that he's the star.
That's a secret.

567
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:22,906
How do I tell him?

568
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:26,276
-Ko Mi-nam!
-Yes?

569
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:28,545
I'm on my way to meet your producer,
want to come with me?

570
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,214
We have to discuss your showcase too.

571
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:31,682
Sure.

572
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:36,653
Hey.

573
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:39,556
Oh, it's "What Do I Do?"

574
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:42,025
Tae-gyung's done?

575
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:44,394
Yes. I have sent a CD to Miss Mo as well.

576
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:47,931
Nice. Then we just have to set
a recording schedule with her.

577
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,672
So this is the remake Tae-gyung made

578
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,441
of my dad's song.

579
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:11,521
I should tell him everything,
including my dad, tonight.

580
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:16,994
It's a star.

581
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:24,101
You know the original composer
of this song, Ko Jae-hyeon?

582
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:27,437
Apparently he and Mo Hwa-ran
had something going on.

583
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,074
I kind of caught that too.

584
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:32,876
Were they lovers?

585
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:35,279
Apparently, everyone who knew
about it knew about it.

586
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:36,847
They were on fire for each other.

587
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:43,120
Oh, that must be why Hwa-ran
was so adamant for this song's remake.

588
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,757
Tae-gyung really didn't want to do it
but Hwa-ran bothered him so much

589
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:48,425
that he ended up doing it.

590
00:48:52,529 --> 00:48:54,197
Are you okay?

591
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:55,866
It's all shattered.

592
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:56,867
Are you hurt?

593
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:02,272
What?

594
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:07,978
How, how did you find out?

595
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:10,647
Did Mo Hwa-ran tell you?

596
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:13,684
Then...

597
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:16,553
it is true?

598
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:19,089
I...

599
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:20,691
Mi-nam.

600
00:49:21,258 --> 00:49:23,460
The reason why I didn't tell you...

601
00:49:25,495 --> 00:49:28,865
was because I was afraid
you might be upset.

602
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:33,103
I thought you would be really upset
when you found out

603
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:36,506
your dad abandoned your mom

604
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:38,742
for Mo Hwa-ran.

605
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:40,677
That's why I didn't tell you.

606
00:49:41,678 --> 00:49:42,512
What?

607
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:48,986
Just, you've been looking for your mom
all this time,

608
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,155
but if you found out that
she was abandoned

609
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:56,960
and died alone, giving birth to you two,

610
00:49:57,961 --> 00:50:01,832
I was afraid you'll grow to hate
even your own dad.

611
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,102
So I couldn't tell you.

612
00:50:07,904 --> 00:50:08,805
My mom...

613
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:11,808
was abandoned...

614
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:15,112
and died alone?

615
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:18,815
Did he not know that?

616
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:22,185
Mi-nam?

617
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,488
Are you okay?

618
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,859
She said they were just friends.

619
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:31,561
She said they weren't anything else.

620
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:34,998
I'm going to go ask her again.

621
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:38,168
What? Mi-nam!

622
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:40,470
Wait, did he just find out from me?

623
00:50:40,604 --> 00:50:42,773
Oh, no, Mi-nam! Mi-nam!

624
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,119
This isn't for you.

625
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:15,439
Are the stars out or not?

626
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:18,175
I can only know when Ko Mi-nam gets here.

627
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:20,677
Come home quickly, Ko Mi-nam.

628
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:43,767
He demands to see you now.
Will you be all right?

629
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:50,974
I'll see him.

630
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:53,944
Tell him to wait for a minute.

631
00:52:12,395 --> 00:52:13,697
I should call Tae-gyung here...

632
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:17,334
and tell both of them everything.

633
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:31,882
Ko Mi-nam.

634
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:34,050
You won't pick up your phone?
Where are you anyway?

635
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:37,621
Did something happen?

636
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:46,363
Yes.

637
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:47,597
I'm about to...

638
00:52:49,266 --> 00:52:50,934
meet with his child.

639
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:52,636
You should come too.

640
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:55,205
I'm not interested.

641
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:58,375
I don't care if you play mother
to them or not.

642
00:52:58,975 --> 00:53:00,043
Don't drag me into this.

643
00:53:00,977 --> 00:53:01,811
Goodbye.

644
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:03,747
You know them too.

645
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,685
You know them too.

646
00:53:10,453 --> 00:53:13,323
I just want to show you
before you really get dragged in.

647
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:17,527
Who is it, then?

648
00:53:19,162 --> 00:53:20,830
A girl named Ko Mi-nyeo.

649
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:25,669
Come see for yourself.

650
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:16,319
No way.

651
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:17,687
It can't be her.

652
00:54:30,233 --> 00:54:33,403
It's him. It's really him.
He's really Ko Mi-nam's father?

653
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:43,713
TO TAE-GYUNG, MO HWA-RAN

654
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:45,515
What is this?

655
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:50,287
Tae-gyung! Happy birthday!

656
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:53,423
You're Miss Mo's fan, right?
This is my birthday present for you!

657
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:06,870
You told me...

658
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:10,240
you were just friends with my father.

659
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:12,976
That's the truth, right?

660
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:17,314
Tell me that it is.

661
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:22,719
That's the note I wanted to move on from,
but it seems like

662
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,155
you already know the truth.

663
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:29,559
Please.

664
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:32,829
Tell me that it's a lie.

665
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,568
We weren't just friends.

666
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:42,739
We loved and held each other deeply.
I won't be able to...

667
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:45,108
forget it my whole life.

668
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:06,363
So you two loved each other so much

669
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:09,499
that my dad abandoned my mom,

670
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:12,435
and you abandoned...

671
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,674
Tae-gyung?

672
00:56:20,577 --> 00:56:21,411
You.

673
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:25,148
You knew Tae-gyung was my son?

674
00:56:27,283 --> 00:56:29,853
I know that you abandoned and hurt

675
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:34,657
the one person you should have
cherished the most in this world.

676
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:38,595
So for you to say that was love...

677
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:42,065
I can't believe it. I can't buy it.

678
00:56:45,468 --> 00:56:46,836
That's not love.

679
00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:55,645
You sound exactly like your mother.

680
00:56:57,514 --> 00:56:58,782
She ignored me.

681
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:02,318
She didn't believe that your father
would come back to me.

682
00:57:08,525 --> 00:57:09,793
She probably couldn't believe you...

683
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:14,297
because you abandon
and treat people recklessly.

684
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:18,935
And I can't believe you either.

685
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:21,971
My father...

686
00:57:23,907 --> 00:57:25,875
would have never loved such a person.

687
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:35,485
Even when there's proof right here?

688
00:57:40,857 --> 00:57:42,225
This song Tae-gyung made for me

689
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:46,362
was by your father,
begging me to come back to him.

690
00:57:47,764 --> 00:57:50,266
Your father made it and I sang it.

691
00:57:51,734 --> 00:57:53,369
That's why your mom left.
She acknowledged us.

692
00:57:56,172 --> 00:57:57,373
You're lying, aren't you?

693
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:00,176
You're lying.

694
00:58:00,243 --> 00:58:01,411
Everyone acknowledges it!

695
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:06,216
Why?

696
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:08,852
Why do you want to insist
that it's not true?

697
00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:13,723
Even my own son, Tae-gyung,

698
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:16,726
acknowledged it even
if he didn't understand it.

699
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:19,662
That's why he made me this song.

700
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,535
Remember when I said I met you
when you were young?

701
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:29,339
If your father didn't die
at such a young age,

702
00:58:30,306 --> 00:58:31,908
I could have been your mom.

703
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:34,444
And Tae-gyung knows it too.

704
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,551
I wanted to provide for you
financially as well.

705
00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:45,054
Didn't your aunt tell you?

706
00:58:46,723 --> 00:58:47,824
Financially provide for me?

707
00:58:48,157 --> 00:58:49,826
Tae-gyung knows
that I will be good to you,

708
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:51,628
that I'll dote on you.

709
00:58:53,296 --> 00:58:54,864
I told him everything.

710
00:58:55,965 --> 00:59:01,871
But you haven't told Tae-gyung that
you're Jae-hyeon's child yet, have you?

711
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:07,343
Did you tell him that you know
that he's my son?

712
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:16,386
If you haven't said either of those things
you surely haven't told him

713
00:59:16,653 --> 00:59:18,121
that I know that you're a girl.

714
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:21,558
It's not because I wanted to fool him.

715
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:26,229
Try telling him that.

716
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:28,798
See if he believes you.

717
00:59:58,127 --> 00:59:59,095
This girl...

718
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,532
is the daughter of the man your mom loved.

719
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:14,110
She didn't mean to fool you, she said.

720
01:00:31,694 --> 01:00:32,528
You.

721
01:00:33,763 --> 01:00:36,466
Did you want to deny it that badly
because of my son?

722
01:00:40,603 --> 01:00:42,438
Do you acknowledge me now?

723
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:45,742
Take a leaf out of your mom's book.

724
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:47,910
Acknowledge my love,

725
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:49,812
and give up.

726
01:01:05,194 --> 01:01:07,397
Kang Shin-woo's girlfriend

727
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:09,899
is Ko Mi-nam's twin sister.

728
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:15,171
Ko Mi-nam.

729
01:01:16,406 --> 01:01:18,274
There's something off with Ko Mi-nam.

730
01:01:19,876 --> 01:01:22,812
Every time you put Ko Mi-nam
in the equation, it doesn't work.

731
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:28,985
Ko Mi-nam disappeared on this day
without doing an interview.

732
01:01:30,086 --> 01:01:32,622
Also on this day,
Ko Mi-nam did not show up

733
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:36,059
at the premiere.

734
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:41,798
And on this day too.
Ko Mi-nam was nowhere until the end.

735
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:46,536
Wherever Ko Mi-nyeo appears,

736
01:01:46,836 --> 01:01:48,171
Ko Mi-nam is nowhere to be found.

737
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:50,540
They're twins.

738
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:53,676
Identical twins.

739
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:56,746
Twins!

740
01:02:02,518 --> 01:02:03,986
Twins!

741
01:02:09,525 --> 01:02:11,861
I don't want to get involved
with any A.N.JELL issues anymore.

742
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:15,364
Ask them about anything involving them.

743
01:02:15,631 --> 01:02:17,667
If you tell me honestly,

744
01:02:19,602 --> 01:02:21,304
I can make sure you're not involved.

745
01:02:23,172 --> 01:02:24,006
Tell you what?

746
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:26,843
Ko Mi-nam and Ko Mi-nyeo.

747
01:02:27,944 --> 01:02:29,078
They're one person, aren't they?

748
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,081
Is it a man? Or a woman?

749
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:38,921
Shin-woo.

750
01:02:39,889 --> 01:02:43,459
Mr. Kim just called saying
he's pushing your article back a bit.

751
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:45,261
Why?

752
01:02:45,628 --> 01:02:48,331
Wasn't he rushing to release it
as an exclusive?

753
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:55,505
He wants to release it after he interviews
Mi-nam and his sister together.

754
01:02:56,572 --> 01:02:57,774
He's a bit...

755
01:02:59,008 --> 01:03:00,543
Can you set up a place and time?

756
01:03:04,213 --> 01:03:05,047
Sure.

757
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,155
The person you are trying to reach--

758
01:03:12,588 --> 01:03:13,422
She's not picking up.

759
01:03:14,323 --> 01:03:15,925
We need to get a plan together...

760
01:03:24,433 --> 01:03:25,268
Tae-gyung!

761
01:03:32,074 --> 01:03:34,443
Please. Please, hear me out.

762
01:03:36,746 --> 01:03:37,713
No. Let me ask you.

763
01:03:39,415 --> 01:03:41,184
How long have you known about my mother?

764
01:03:45,788 --> 01:03:47,857
On your birthday.

765
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:51,994
Since then?

766
01:03:54,697 --> 01:03:58,501
That's why every time I was losing
my mind over things with my mother,

767
01:03:58,868 --> 01:04:00,903
you interrupted me with perfect timing.
It makes sense now.

768
01:04:03,773 --> 01:04:06,275
When did you find out that the song
I was working on was your father's?

769
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:11,514
A few days ago.

770
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:14,016
Was that when you began
to meet up with my mother?

771
01:04:16,786 --> 01:04:17,687
Yes.

772
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:24,760
My mother told me
that she loved your father so much

773
01:04:26,429 --> 01:04:28,731
she was willing to abandon me
and become your mom.

774
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:30,666
Did you hear that too?

775
01:04:32,635 --> 01:04:34,303
I heard it today. I--

776
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:36,806
She even baked cookies for you
when you were young.

777
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:37,974
Do you remember that?

778
01:04:43,846 --> 01:04:45,648
I hope you two have fun getting along.

779
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:47,583
But don't drag me into it.

780
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:52,822
Please hear me out!

781
01:04:58,227 --> 01:04:59,428
Stay out of my sight.

782
01:05:00,663 --> 01:05:01,731
I don't want to see you.

783
01:06:32,088 --> 01:06:34,090
