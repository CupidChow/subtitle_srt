1
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:23,857
I don't want to see it,

2
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:25,725
I should turn around,

3
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:27,961
but I feel frozen in place.

4
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:29,596
What do I do?

5
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:35,735
Shin-woo.

6
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,448
Let's go.

7
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:01,194
Hwang Tae-gyung you despicable crook!

8
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:04,831
How could you be sipping water
in this situation?

9
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:09,269
Hey!

10
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:15,909
You jerk! You bastard! You crazy psycho...

11
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:20,046
You were the one who suggested
to pretend we were a thing.

12
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:22,749
I merely accepted the offer.

13
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:24,284
Pretend we're a thing?

14
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:25,685
Yes.

15
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:28,488
Like what we did just now.

16
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:45,538
Let go. Let go of me or else!

17
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:47,841
There are cameras everywhere.

18
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:50,410
Stop flailing, the kiss
is going to look messy.

19
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:53,480
Aren't the nosebleed pictures
humiliating enough?

20
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:56,182
You think this will keep me quiet?

21
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,019
I'm just taking you up on your suggestion
on figuring this situation out.

22
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:01,654
Like this, for example.

23
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,860
Don't worry. It'll never be real.

24
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,300
"It'll never be real"?

25
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:20,373
What? Did you want it to be real?

26
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:26,713
What? Me?

27
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,581
Don't make me laugh!
Hwang Tae-gyung, you...

28
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,318
Airhead!

29
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,656
That's the scariest insult
my elementary school fans tell me.

30
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,826
You really are scary, Fake Fairy.

31
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,398
Let me make it scarier then.

32
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,867
You may have started this,

33
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,737
but I'll be the one ending it
by dumping your ass.

34
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,742
So you can't end this until I say so.

35
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,278
Scary.

36
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:02,048
And don't you dare let anyone
find out we're faking this.

37
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:07,086
If you do, I'm going to reveal everything
about Ko Mi-nam to salvage my pride.

38
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:10,657
You better pretend well
so people would buy it.

39
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,459
Pretending is your forte.

40
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,562
Hope to learn lots from you.

41
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,532
First, take me home.

42
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:26,472
On a hectic day like this, you need
to make sure your lover gets home.

43
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,741
Pretend you're a gentleman.

44
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:30,877
On an exhausting day like this,

45
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,079
you should tell your lover
to go home immediately and rest.

46
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:35,515
Pretend you're a caring lover.

47
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:42,589
Hey! Hwang Tae-gyung!
Where are you going! Hey!

48
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:54,167
Hwang Tae-gyung.

49
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:56,302
You airhead...

50
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,308
I wasn't suggesting this act
the first time.

51
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,178
I actually meant it...

52
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:20,159
Drink this.

53
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,299
Water is not going to help.

54
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,369
You're that shocked by Tae-gyung?

55
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,138
I...

56
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:34,474
I...

57
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:37,543
Of course, you'd be. I am too.

58
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:42,215
I bet all of Tae-gyung's fans in Korea
are bawling their eyes out right now.

59
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:44,517
Look over there.

60
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:48,421
MY ONE AND ONLY TAE-GYUNG

61
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,056
A KILLER SMILE, HWANG TAE-GYUNG

62
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:58,164
They must be very sad too.

63
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,870
The fans really liked and admired
Tae-gyung. Of course, they'd be sad.

64
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:07,407
Fans?

65
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,575
Yeah, fans.

66
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,011
Tae-gyung is a star,

67
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:16,316
beloved and admired by millions.

68
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,285
So liking Tae-gyung

69
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:20,987
is not a bad thing,

70
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:22,922
nor is it special.

71
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:26,693
I suppose so.

72
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,395
If you're just one of many,

73
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,364
it's nothing special.

74
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,200
Exactly. It's nothing big or special.

75
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,503
If you're sad right now
because of Tae-gyung,

76
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:41,474
it's because you're one
of many Tae-gyung fans.

77
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:47,647
A fan...

78
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:54,053
Guys, don't cry.

79
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,889
We're true fans,

80
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:59,792
we support and congratulate him
on everything, even when he finds love.

81
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,829
Congratulations!

82
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,797
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

83
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:08,134
-Congratulations! Congrats!
-Congratulations! Congrats!

84
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,103
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

85
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:14,374
I should congratulate him too!

86
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:16,676
Like them!

87
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:18,911
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

88
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:22,281
-Congratulations! Congrats!
-Congratulations! Congrats!

89
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:25,585
-Congratulations! Congrats!
-Congratulations! Congrats!

90
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,088
Tae-gyung! Congrats on your
new relationship!

91
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,726
We prepared this for you. Congratulations!

92
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:38,498
-Congratulations! Congrats!
-Congratulations! Congrats!

93
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,533
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

94
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,268
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

95
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,236
Con...

96
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:56,149
Your leader seems to be quite shy
actually. He must be embarrassed.

97
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:58,351
Why is he glaring like that?
He secretly loves it.

98
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:03,122
He must feel a bit bad
for keeping it a secret, even from us.

99
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,859
Anyway, a party without

100
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:09,195
the main guest is a bit flat, isn't it?

101
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:11,364
Oh, goodness.

102
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,899
Flat? No, no, silly whelk.

103
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,667
I know I prepared all the food

104
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:18,271
but we'll just make it my welcoming party!

105
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:21,207
I made a lot so don't be shy and dig in!

106
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:22,975
Ko Mi-nam.

107
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:25,745
How could you be there
and congratulate me?

108
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:27,613
I can't believe this.

109
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,649
Do you even know why I'm in this mess?

110
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:32,552
Of course, you don't.

111
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:34,854
If you did, you wouldn't be sitting there.

112
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,396
Here, Mi-nam!

113
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,933
Have another, my dear Mi-nam.

114
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,401
Here you go.

115
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,603
My goodness.

116
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,605
The Ko men are known

117
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:55,041
for holding their liquor!

118
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,643
How is your tolerance so low?

119
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,846
Aunt Mi-ja.

120
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:01,747
I'm feeling a bit tipsy.

121
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,286
Ko Mi-nam, scoot over. I'll take it!

122
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,356
Move over.
Don't give it to Ko Mi-nam, I'll take it.

123
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:11,858
I love alcohol!

124
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,628
Yeah? Okay, then, whelk! Here you go!

125
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:18,064
Bottoms up!

126
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:19,465
Bottoms up!

127
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:20,566
Yoo He-i

128
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:24,303
played with Mi-nam.

129
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,408
She sought him out on purpose

130
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:33,813
and said she was a fan and took pictures
with him, linking her arm with his.

131
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:36,282
But in hindsight, I realized

132
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:39,418
it was all a cover for that jerk,

133
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,587
Hwang Tae-gyung.

134
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:44,390
Wait, you mean

135
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:48,427
Yoo He-i used my Mi-nam?

136
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:52,265
That's exactly it. Mi-nam and I
are both disappointed, to say the least.

137
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:53,799
My goodness gracious.

138
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,836
Seriously, some women can downright
bewitch and blind you.

139
00:08:58,804 --> 00:08:59,805
Ko Mi-nam!

140
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,841
Is that why he looked so down?
Because of Yoo He-i?

141
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:07,647
Ko Mi-nam?

142
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,652
Did you, by any chance, like...

143
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:14,587
-Pardon?
-Isn't that why you're...

144
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,289
disappointed? Because you liked...

145
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,427
I'm just a fan. Nothing special.

146
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,362
Liking someone is not a crime.

147
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,264
Here!

148
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:31,504
That's written by my favorite writer.

149
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:36,375
In it, it says "those who do not love
will be found guilty."

150
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:38,311
So what I'm trying to say is

151
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:41,847
those who are in love, with whomever
it may be, are not guilty.

152
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,016
Really?

153
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,485
It's not a crime? It's okay?

154
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:49,255
Yeah. What's wrong with liking someone?

155
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:54,193
Thank you for saying that, Jermy.

156
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,303
Ko Mi-nam.

157
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:07,440
I guess you really did like Yoo He-i.

158
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:14,013
And I...

159
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:16,682
You...

160
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,298
What is this?

161
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:33,766
It's over?

162
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,769
Then where's Ko Mi-nam?

163
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:49,415
Not here either.

164
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,297
Look who it is. If it isn't Ko Mi-nam.

165
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:45,037
What are you doing down there?

166
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,041
I'm looking for answers. Quietly.

167
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:50,710
What?

168
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:54,046
Am I guilty?

169
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,881
Or not guilty?

170
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,551
Ko Mi-nam.

171
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,553
You got into trouble again, didn't you?

172
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:01,487
Yes.

173
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:05,291
I think so. I got into some huge trouble.

174
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,728
That's why you were hiding here
and couldn't come back to my room

175
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:10,963
because you were afraid
of getting yelled at?

176
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:19,972
You better come crawling out
before you do what you do best

177
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:22,341
and ask for forgiveness.

178
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,746
No! I don't want to! I can't!

179
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,216
How big a trouble did you get into?

180
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:32,051
Get out here now!

181
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:34,854
I can't!

182
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,623
You! Get out here or else!

183
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,991
Let go of me!

184
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,031
Are you really not coming out?

185
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:57,743
I can't go out! I won't go out!

186
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:02,314
Ko Mi-nam.

187
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,851
Should you be getting drunk
and throwing a violent tantrum right now?

188
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,086
Did you even listen

189
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:10,055
to the song you're supposed to sing?

190
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:14,727
I'm sure it's good, you made it after all.

191
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,496
Tae-gyung!

192
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,499
I'm your fan. A fan!

193
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,168
I don't need a fan like you.

194
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,905
You don't need fans?

195
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,009
But I have to be a fan.

196
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:34,213
A fan's heart can hurt, but it's okay.

197
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,148
A fan is still able to congratulate.

198
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:40,252
Let me be your fan, please.

199
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,921
You're not a fan.

200
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:45,057
All things aside, you're a special person
who's going to sing my song.

201
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,527
So screw your head on right
and listen carefully.

202
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:06,478
This song...

203
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,481
It's the one that brought me this far.

204
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:46,011
My life is just becoming a mess.
I'm like Ko Mi-nam's nanny.

205
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:50,516
I should've never found out
that she was a girl.

206
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:12,838
Without a word,
You taught me what love was

207
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:17,276
Without a word, you gave me your love

208
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:18,377
Hold on.

209
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:20,012
That's not the right emotion.

210
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,583
Mi-nam.

211
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:27,486
Your voice color is great,
it's perfect for this song.

212
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,890
But I can see that you're not putting
any emotion into it.

213
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:34,960
I'm sorry.

214
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:38,430
There's no explosion in your heart,
nothing bursting forth.

215
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:39,965
You know, like,

216
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:43,168
it's like you're pressing down
with a stone. It feels frustrating.

217
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:44,737
Have you

218
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:46,872
ever dated before?

219
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,274
Maybe we should take a break.

220
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,943
-What?
-Have a drink. Here.

221
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:04,723
Here you go.

222
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,199
So the way I see it, this song...

223
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:17,302
It's about love.

224
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,906
Love between a man and a woman.

225
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,309
You want to see them so much,

226
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:26,445
you miss them so much

227
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:28,080
that you

228
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:33,619
can't control yourself,
and it bursts out into this song.

229
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:39,058
But of course, you couldn't have
experienced that before.

230
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,629
What do I do now?

231
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,032
Oh, didn't you say

232
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:51,203
you'll be visiting your father's grave
with your aunt?

233
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:52,938
How about you

234
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:57,743
try to tap into the love and longing
you feel for your parents

235
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:59,511
and we can go from there.

236
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,415
I'll try. I'll do my best.

237
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,250
Remember, it has to be bursting
with emotion.

238
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:09,154
Freaking Hwang Tae-gyung.
He should be here with you

239
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:11,256
giving you advice, but no.

240
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:13,192
He just had to go and date Yoo He-i.

241
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:15,327
What is this?

242
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,429
Man.

243
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:21,100
KOREA'S FAIRY IN ANGEL'S ARMS!

244
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,901
THE BIRTH OF THE BEST COUPLE!

245
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,471
Hello everyone! I'm currently

246
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:27,573
at the VIP premiere for Korea's Fairy,

247
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:33,011
and now Angel's Lover,
Yoo He-i's new movie!

248
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:34,746
Let's go meet her!

249
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:36,248
Hello, He-i!

250
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,349
Hello.

251
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,617
How do you feel?

252
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:40,953
I'm excited and nervous.

253
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:43,388
I hope you'll love and enjoy the movie.

254
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,424
Could you tell us briefly
what the movie is about?

255
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:46,959
-Yes, the movie is about--
-Wait!

256
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:49,328
Oh, the one who has shared
a real, sweet kiss with you!

257
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,530
It's Hwang Tae-gyung!

258
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:53,899
Come on!

259
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,335
Tae-gyung!

260
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:59,938
Tae-gyung, you brought your teammates
with you to support your lover!

261
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:02,274
I did.

262
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:05,978
So I hear that He-i has a kiss scene
in Sweet Kiss,

263
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,580
don't you feel jealous
as her actual lover?

264
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,584
No. I don't.

265
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,621
Oh, I see. Work is work.

266
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:17,389
You're keeping it super cool!

267
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:22,394
You! You should've said
that you felt jealous!

268
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:24,863
I was playing the role
of a considerate lover.

269
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:26,732
Is that right?

270
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,469
Then my considerate lover

271
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:33,872
will escort me to the VIP after party
after this.

272
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,743
For the last few days, I did
every press conference and interview

273
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:39,411
you demanded of me.

274
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,114
Today's agreement was attending this.
That was it.

275
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,816
I'm an unpredictable
yet adorable lover, you see.

276
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:49,054
Just pretend you like me so much
that you followed me to the party.

277
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:52,724
I'll tell you the next schedule
at the party!

278
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:04,403
Tae-gyung.

279
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:06,538
So,

280
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,808
I know we should stay and watch
your lover's movie until the end but...

281
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,011
Anyway, Mi-nam

282
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,714
has to leave in the middle.
I hope that's okay.

283
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:16,748
Why?

284
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:18,650
It's the anniversary
of her father's death.

285
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:23,155
It's her first time going to the grave at
her father's hometown, so be easy on her.

286
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:24,856
She's going alone?

287
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,327
I'm going with her, all right?
Don't worry. Her aunt has already left.

288
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:29,895
Is that so?

289
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,166
Have a safe trip.

290
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,368
Take this time as an opportunity
to take a step back and...

291
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,771
I'll study hard and practice.

292
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:43,175
But I'm still nervous, going down
to my hometown for the first time.

293
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:47,412
If you like it, don't forget to take me
with you next time.

294
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,615
You want to come, too?

295
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:57,823
Because I want to get closer to you.

296
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:07,399
Thank you.

297
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,901
I'm your fan, He-i!

298
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:11,003
Thank you.

299
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,880
Take this with you.
I'll go in Hwang Tae-gyung's car.

300
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,084
You're obedient today, boyfriend.

301
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:28,220
How was I to...

302
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:33,859
Something very urgent came up
with Tae-gyung.

303
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:35,494
So he left.

304
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:38,964
He personally asked me

305
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,332
to drive you safely.

306
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,435
Would it be possible to take a selfie

307
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,537
since we couldn't last time?

308
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:57,849
Aren't you picking it up?

309
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:00,218
I'm way too busy driving,

310
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:02,354
so I can't pick up the phone.

311
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,957
I'm staying overnight, so for you

312
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:09,094
to drive me down and come back up...
You'll be exhausted.

313
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:11,430
Who said I'm coming right back up?

314
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:13,932
Today and tomorrow,

315
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,668
I'm going to be very busy
with you, Ko Mi-nam.

316
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:20,272
Very busy? With me? Doing what?

317
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:23,642
They told me you sang like a wreck!
A disaster!

318
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:27,312
You heard about that?

319
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:30,615
Of course. The reason I'm coming
down with you

320
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:33,251
is to focus on your vocal training.

321
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:35,954
I'm already so busy as it is.

322
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:38,056
But thanks to you,
I'm going to be even busier.

323
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:42,361
Sorry for being a nuisance.

324
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,201
YOO HE-I

325
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,972
What a nuisance!

326
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:10,989
This is the deep countryside.

327
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:13,658
The air is fresh,
the scenery is beautiful,

328
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:15,927
and best of all, it's quiet.

329
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:18,296
I was pretty tired the last few days,

330
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,165
so this will be good rest for me.

331
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,301
I hurried back because you said
you were busy.

332
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:24,503
Ko Mi-nam.

333
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,406
I'll be the one to decide the schedule.
Stop butting in!

334
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:34,246
What the heck is this!

335
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,617
I'm sorry! I ran back as fast as I could,
I think I shook it too much.

336
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,621
For a second, I almost forgot.

337
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:46,224
With the accident-prone Ko Mi-nam
in tow, how can I rest?

338
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:51,229
We're almost there, so I'll wash it
for you as soon as we get there.

339
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,467
I cannot do anything wearing

340
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:57,002
such dirty and sticky clothes!

341
00:23:57,502 --> 00:23:58,804
Then what do we do?

342
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:19,257
It's Mr. Ma's so it is a bit small.

343
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:20,926
But it's still new!

344
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:24,129
I put it on since I have to drive,

345
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,566
but I don't feel good about this. At all.

346
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:30,502
But you look super cool!

347
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,103
And

348
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:34,039
everything will be fine. I'm sure of it.

349
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:42,647
Now! Listen up!

350
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:45,517
My nephew is coming
and he's a famous singer now!

351
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:47,686
Be excited! Look forward to it!
You won't be disappointed!

352
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:53,325
How famous is he anyway?

353
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:56,194
People recognize him at first glance!

354
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:59,998
Then is he more famous than Hyun Cheol?

355
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:02,734
Of course! He's the best!

356
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,737
We're about to see a famous singer,
how exciting!

357
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:17,616
This is also my first time here,
at my father's hometown. It's pretty.

358
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,452
Did you know nothing about him
while growing up?

359
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:25,123
I only knew that my father was a composer
and my mom was a singer.

360
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,025
Really?

361
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:29,394
Must be why you're a decent singer.

362
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:47,979
We're almost here.

363
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:57,455
Go faster.

364
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:12,437
I should've brought my own car.

365
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:26,785
They're so famous, you see them
every time you turn on the TV!

366
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:28,219
When is he getting here?

367
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:29,654
He'll be here any minute!

368
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:31,523
-Yeah?
-I'm dying to see him.

369
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,624
-There he is!
-Is that him?

370
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:34,159
A car is coming in!

371
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:36,394
It's not that car.

372
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:40,765
Famous singers have these huge cars
that can't even compare.

373
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:42,567
But it's coming this way!

374
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:44,035
I'm telling you, it's not his car.

375
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,337
But it's getting closer!

376
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:46,972
It's stopped!

377
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:50,642
That's not his car, though...

378
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:55,313
Aunt Mi-ja!

379
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,483
Mi-nam.

380
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:00,452
Where's the singer?

381
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,687
Oh, so, the thing is...

382
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:04,322
Tae-gyung came with me.

383
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,157
What?

384
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:08,760
That's good. If your leader is here
that's all we need!

385
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:10,962
His team's leader is here too!

386
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:13,164
You'll know him when you see him.

387
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:21,806
So he's the singer?

388
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:24,943
Yes, he is a singer, but...

389
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,578
-My goodness.
-What is this?

390
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:29,547
-That's not a singer.
-My goodness.

391
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:31,583
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

392
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:36,187
-Move, move.
-Wasting our time!

393
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:37,422
-My goodness.
-All right then.

394
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:40,225
You need to stop fibbing!

395
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,227
My goodness gracious.

396
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,896
You should've come in your van!
Why did you come in this?

397
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:48,033
And Leader, what happened to you?

398
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,567
I'm so embarrassed.

399
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:51,870
This is Mr. Ma's car

400
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,539
and Tae-gyung's clothes
got some stuff on it.

401
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,909
I have to wash it now,
where can I go do that?

402
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:00,045
We're going to stay
at Big Grandma's place,

403
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:03,615
so bring it over. No one recognized you,
I'm so embarrassed!

404
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:08,553
Are you two really singers?

405
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,188
Yes, we are.

406
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:14,392
I think I've seen him somewhere.

407
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,828
Have you ever been
on National Singing Contest?

408
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:18,463
No, we have not.

409
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,799
They must not be popular.

410
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:24,002
If you're singers, do you go on TV?

411
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:26,604
Yes, we do.

412
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:29,708
I'm sure I've seen him somewhere.

413
00:28:29,774 --> 00:28:32,377
I don't think they're popular.

414
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,213
Have you ever been on Hometown Report?

415
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:37,382
No, we have not.

416
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:40,351
I told you, they're not popular.

417
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:44,856
Mi-ja, this bitch lied through her teeth.

418
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:49,594
I'm so certain I've seen him somewhere.

419
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:53,498
They're not popular. We don't know them.

420
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:57,068
They're grandmas living in the countryside
so they won't know us.

421
00:28:58,369 --> 00:28:59,604
That's fine by me.

422
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,606
It will just make me
that much more comfortable.

423
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,948
THE LATE KO JAE-HYUN

424
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:17,956
We're done, ma'am.

425
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:23,261
Pay them extra, like you've always done
and ask them to keep up the care.

426
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:24,662
Yes, ma'am.

427
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:41,880
How have you been?

428
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:45,884
I brought you some good news.

429
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:50,355
The song you made for me

430
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:53,224
will see light again.

431
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:57,529
I hope you're as happy about this as I am.

432
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,861
Is this the car I saw before?

433
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:31,696
Leader!

434
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:34,332
I'm not going.

435
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,567
Right.

436
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,671
I was just going to tell you to wait
anyway. You can't go anywhere like that.

437
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:42,006
We'll be right back.

438
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:46,010
It's that way.

439
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:59,891
I'm growing old now, seriously.

440
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:01,559
I can't breathe.

441
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:14,606
Is she doing a fashion show
in the mountain?

442
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:16,241
So unnecessarily flashy.

443
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:18,843
Pointy heels, clunky accessories,
my goodness.

444
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:55,213
Do any of Father's friends
still live here?

445
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,816
Your father pursued music at an early age

446
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,386
and he left our hometown young.

447
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:03,922
He only came back to see me with you two

448
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:05,423
when he was about to die.

449
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:10,461
He didn't tell me anything about
who your mom was, how they met

450
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:14,799
and had you twins, and how she died.
Nothing.

451
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,771
He brought and entrusted you two
to me and passed away soon after.

452
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:23,808
You said Father was a composer
and Mom was a singer.

453
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:25,810
There should be someone who knew them.

454
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,579
I'm sure there is,

455
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:31,449
but I've no way of contacting them.

456
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:38,923
Still,

457
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:41,759
your father was such a sweet,

458
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:44,429
kind man. He was a good man.

459
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:47,598
We're here!

460
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:48,967
It's here.

461
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:51,436
What the...

462
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,875
It's here, I'm certain.

463
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:00,478
But somebody has tidied it up already.

464
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,181
Look, flowers.

465
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:06,150
They're fresh, so whoever it was
must have just come by.

466
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:09,187
There's no one who would come.

467
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,822
Just right now?

468
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,261
Aunt Mi-ja!

469
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:20,264
Mi-nam!

470
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:56,167
Tae-gyung, pick up!
Pick up and don't let them leave!

471
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:14,952
Excuse me!

472
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:16,354
Hold on!

473
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:18,623
Excuse me!

474
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:27,932
Excuse me!

475
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:35,807
I lost them.

476
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:37,875
It must have been her...

477
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:48,019
If Tae-gyung was here, I would
at least know what she looked like.

478
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:49,487
Where did he go?

479
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:06,537
I haven't felt this peaceful
in a long time.

480
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:10,007
To be free from all the eyes

481
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:12,143
is such a freeing feeling.

482
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:30,928
Perhaps because it's the countryside?

483
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:35,032
He's greeting me
and he don't even know me.

484
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:24,015
In this place, where there are no
reporters or fans following me...

485
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,050
why is there

486
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:28,819
a pig coming after me?

487
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:38,196
It's a pig! Run!

488
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:41,499
It's dangerous! Run!

489
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:43,067
Run!

490
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:44,502
Run!

491
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,204
Run away!

492
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:48,839
Run as fast as you can!

493
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:50,141
Run!

494
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:06,891
We are looking for a singer from Seoul

495
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:10,461
named Hwang Tae-gyung.

496
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:13,965
If you find a young man

497
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:15,866
wearing a white hoodie,

498
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:19,904
please contact Byung-sook's house,

499
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:22,406
-the Persimmon Tree House.
-Where did he go?

500
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:24,141
The leader?

501
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:28,479
He's our team leader, we need him...
Oh, Mi-nam!

502
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:32,950
The pig has been found and returned.
Any news on Tae-gyung?

503
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:37,021
If a pig can make it back,
so can a person.

504
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:41,025
Tae-gyung has no sense of direction
so he gets lost easily

505
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:44,128
and he can't see in the dark either.

506
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:48,566
I am so certain I saw him on TV.

507
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:52,470
But he's not even popular.

508
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:56,674
The sun will set soon,
if Tae-gyung doesn't get back by then,

509
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:58,309
what do I do?

510
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,280
This is the place where A.N.JELL's
leader, Hwang Tae-gyung,

511
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:04,849
has gone missing
after being chased by a pig.

512
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:06,984
Let's hear what an eyewitness has to say.

513
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:11,555
I told him to run away. I did.

514
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,692
A.N.JELL HWANG TAE-GYUNG MISSING

515
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:17,395
But he was standing like this...

516
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,368
And he stayed like that without moving.

517
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:27,672
How big was the pig chasing
Hwang Tae-gyung?

518
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,008
About this big.

519
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:32,643
It was a big.

520
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:38,082
The search for Tae-gyung
is actively ongoing.

521
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:40,718
How do you feel?

522
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:42,753
A word, please

523
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,455
He-i, look over here!

524
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:57,468
Despite the shock
that has taken over Seoul,

525
00:38:57,535 --> 00:39:00,404
we are all wishing and waiting
for Tae-gyung's safe return.

526
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:03,874
If Tae-gyung never comes back,

527
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:06,911
I'll never be able to eat pork again.

528
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:09,180
With no current leads
on Tae-gyung's whereabouts,

529
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:12,383
this music player

530
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:14,318
is singing a sorrowful tune.

531
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,355
No!

532
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:20,424
I'll go look for him
before any of that happens!

533
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:24,195
Mi-nam! How are you going
to even look for him!

534
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:25,796
Do I need to go too?

535
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:36,207
You won't even pick up my calls?
I'll find out exactly how busy you are.

536
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:39,110
HWANG TAE-GYUNG

537
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:41,812
Well, would you look at that.

538
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:44,348
I thought you were busy.

539
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:45,516
Miss Yoo He-i?

540
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:47,618
Who is this?

541
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:50,388
Something happened to your boyfriend,

542
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:52,089
shouldn't you come down?

543
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:53,858
What?

544
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:56,427
Yes,

545
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:58,896
I'll text you the address.

546
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:00,931
Come quickly, Miss Yoo He-i!

547
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:04,635
She's an actress, you said?

548
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:07,104
Yes!

549
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,607
A super famous actress.

550
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:11,075
It's for real this time!

551
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:14,645
Oh, my, an actress is coming!

552
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:25,389
If it gets any darker, it will be
dangerous for Tae-gyung.

553
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,159
They said the pig came down from that way,

554
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:31,162
which means Tae-gyung
must have ran up that way.

555
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:33,164
He must be in that mountain!

556
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,576
Which way would he have taken?

557
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:50,314
I hate the darkness.
Don't turn off the lights.

558
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,584
The brighter way.

559
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:11,035
Oh, there's a lot of trash here.

560
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,609
That's disgusting, Ko Mi-nam.
Clean up that trash now!

561
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:22,613
He would have avoided the trash.

562
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:26,417
Tae-gyung!

563
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:27,952
Tae-gyung!

564
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:29,920
Tae-gyung!

565
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:37,728
These are his footprints!

566
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,564
He stepped in cow dung, I see.

567
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:42,867
He must have been overwhelmed
by the smell...

568
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:45,469
Water!

569
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,105
I have to find a water source!

570
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,249
He must have washed up here.

571
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:00,751
He should be nearby.

572
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:03,120
Tae-gyung!

573
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:05,155
Tae-gyung!

574
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:07,424
Tae-gyung!

575
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,627
Tae-gyung!

576
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:12,530
-Tae-gyung!
-I'm right here.

577
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:20,204
What's with the desperate cries?
Did I die?

578
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:21,739
Tae-gyung!

579
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:30,381
We got worried when you went missing
after being chased by the pig.

580
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:32,683
It has already spread?

581
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:38,756
I bet that grandpa who was waving
blabbered to everyone.

582
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:42,526
What about the pig?

583
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,461
It went home.

584
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,830
I was going down soon too.

585
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:51,268
I just washed off the sweat and dust
and I was waiting for my shoes to dry.

586
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:53,637
It's dry. Let's go.

587
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:55,606
I'm so thirsty from all that running.

588
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:58,976
I thought you'd say that.
I brought you some water.

589
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,249
What's with the bag? Why is it so big?

590
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,353
Oh, I packed a few things
when I set out to find you.

591
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:14,224
A change of clean clothes
in case you got cold.

592
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:16,193
Some towels,

593
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,829
and some first aid in case you got hurt.

594
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:20,297
And in case you were hungry,

595
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:25,402
I packed some food, too.

596
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:29,006
How did you even find me?

597
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:31,342
I just...

598
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:34,812
Thought about you while searching
and I found you.

599
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,650
Seeing how you packed a huge bag
and set out to find me,

600
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:41,819
I guess you're not an ungrateful person.

601
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:44,188
Let's go.

602
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:49,326
Tae-gyung.

603
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:50,761
It's that way.

604
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,964
It's my first time here,
that's the only reason.

605
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:55,432
It's my first time too...

606
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,201
Whatever.

607
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:03,741
Hwang Tae-gyung.

608
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:07,077
You dare blow me off
and go get chased by a pig?

609
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:10,047
I'm going to laugh so hard
when I get a look at you.

610
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:16,086
He's not hurt, is he?

611
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:19,523
It's not like the pig
would have eaten him up. Right?

612
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:22,159
Do pigs bite?

613
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:24,428
Do they or do they not?

614
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:26,430
They might bite rude jerks...

615
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:31,769
Ko Mi-nam.

616
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:34,872
Slow down. It's dark and I can't see well.

617
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:37,374
Okay.

618
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:39,977
Oh, while I was looking for you,

619
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:42,279
I noticed how far you ran from the pig.

620
00:44:43,914 --> 00:44:46,250
I wasn't running away.
I was actively avoiding it.

621
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:49,253
Do you think I was scared of the pig?

622
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:51,689
I was avoiding it because it's dirty
and it shocked me!

623
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:53,624
Of course.

624
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,195
Wait!

625
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:00,964
Did you hear that?

626
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:02,166
Yes.

627
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,268
I did hear something.

628
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:06,970
Is it a wild animal?

629
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:09,973
We're not even that far from the mountain.

630
00:45:11,008 --> 00:45:12,276
It's still a mountain.

631
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:18,882
What could it be?

632
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:21,452
Wait.

633
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:23,120
Are there rabbits in this mountain?

634
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:25,589
What's wrong with rabbits?

635
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:28,425
I abhor rabbits.

636
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:32,463
What? Why? They're so cute and sweet.

637
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:34,965
Have you ever been bitten by one?

638
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:37,801
If not, don't even speak.

639
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:42,039
It looked cute and cuddly
so I approached it, with my guard down,

640
00:45:42,806 --> 00:45:44,041
and it bit me hard.

641
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:47,578
Rabbits are dangerous.

642
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:52,049
Oh, that's where you got bit.

643
00:45:54,718 --> 00:45:56,220
Now that I think about it, you...

644
00:45:57,054 --> 00:45:59,389
You only look sweet and nice
but you are actually dangerous.

645
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:01,258
Just like a rabbit.

646
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:04,795
I'm like a rabbit?

647
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:07,364
Yes, you rabbit!

648
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,235
Come on, hurry up.

649
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:26,617
This turned off.

650
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:28,652
There are no other lights.

651
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:30,387
It's way too dark.

652
00:46:30,754 --> 00:46:34,491
We're almost there, we just have
to be careful. It will be fine.

653
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:40,230
My legs are aching, I'm exhausted.

654
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:43,567
And most importantly,
I can't see anything.

655
00:46:46,036 --> 00:46:47,037
Then

656
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,039
Let's take a break here.

657
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:54,645
Oh, how pretty!

658
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:57,014
Look at all the stars, there are so many!

659
00:46:57,347 --> 00:47:00,684
I can't even see you clearly,
you think I can see the stars?

660
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:04,755
Then can you see the moon?

661
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:08,258
Over there.

662
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:11,295
The only star you can see
is the moon, then.

663
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:13,664
The moon is not a star.

664
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:17,668
It's the brightest one
in the night sky but it's not a star?

665
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:20,337
The moon just reflects sunlight.

666
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:23,707
Only those that shine on their own,
like the sun, are real stars.

667
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:27,411
The moon only shines
by mooching off the sun.

668
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,383
Even so, it's still useful.

669
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:36,353
Isn't a moon shining brightly
in the night more useful

670
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,389
than a sun shining uselessly
in bright daylight?

671
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:42,793
Ko Mi-nam.

672
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:44,328
That "useless sun"

673
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:47,030
is the very reason
that the day is so bright.

674
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:50,400
Oh. Right.

675
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:55,072
Day, night, it's all

676
00:47:55,772 --> 00:47:57,875
monopolized by stars like the sun.

677
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:04,014
If you think about it, I'm like the moon,

678
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:05,482
mooching off a star like you.

679
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:08,018
But it doesn't mean the moon is useless.

680
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:11,588
Yes, there are other stars
in the night sky

681
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:13,957
but the only thing I can see is the moon.

682
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,134
Tae-gyung...

683
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:26,370
Me too.

684
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:29,406
I can only see one special star.

685
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:31,842
What?

686
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:33,777
You said there were a lot of stars.

687
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:36,947
There are,

688
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:41,151
but one of them in particular
keeps shining so amazingly bright.

689
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:44,154
I can't help but keep looking at it.

690
00:48:44,988 --> 00:48:46,123
There's a star like that?

691
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:48,091
Yes.

692
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:51,094
It's a star beloved by millions.

693
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,032
It wouldn't be a crime for me

694
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:56,967
to like it as well,

695
00:48:58,535 --> 00:49:00,070
as one of many, right?

696
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:03,740
You need to get permission
to like stuff like that?

697
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:07,878
Ask the star.
I'm sure you can see it right now.

698
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:09,513
Yes.

699
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:13,216
I'm looking at the star right now.

700
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:17,387
Is it okay...

701
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:20,424
If I like that star?

702
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,105
Yoo He-i?

703
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,742
It really is her.

704
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:13,577
What are you two doing?

705
00:50:14,244 --> 00:50:16,313
You said you were busy!
What are you doing here?

706
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:23,687
Why is she even here?

707
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:27,257
You ignored all my calls,
like you were so busy in this countryside!

708
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:29,059
What is this place?

709
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:34,531
That hurts.

710
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:37,634
What?

711
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,202
Even your hands are lovely.

712
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:45,008
It's a small sprain, you'll be okay soon.

713
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:49,679
At least you rolled through a field
of cow dung, that brings good luck!

714
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:51,281
Your movie will be a huge hit.

715
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:53,517
Oh, the smell.

716
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:55,152
I'll change the water.

717
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:57,988
I touched Yoo He-i's hands!

718
00:50:59,956 --> 00:51:01,358
My hand's going to get so dry!

719
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:06,196
You're an actress?

720
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:07,497
Yes, I am.

721
00:51:08,098 --> 00:51:11,768
I think I've seen her somewhere too.

722
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:14,771
Were you ever on Country Diaries?

723
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:17,240
No, I wasn't.

724
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:20,510
She's not famous either.

725
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:23,647
I'm pretty sure I've seen her somewhere.

726
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:26,516
My goodness.

727
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:29,119
That Mi-ja lied to us again!

728
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:32,389
-My goodness.
-She looks so familiar...

729
00:51:32,722 --> 00:51:34,124
Oh, dear.

730
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:36,393
-Oh, my legs!
-My legs are aching.

731
00:51:37,227 --> 00:51:38,862
I wiped your heels clean,

732
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,464
you can wear them now.

733
00:51:41,998 --> 00:51:43,300
Thank you, Ko Mi-nam.

734
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:04,054
You two looked really serious back there.
What were you talking about?

735
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:06,523
Oh, right...

736
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:09,559
We were talking about the stars.

737
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,595
The stars?

738
00:52:12,362 --> 00:52:13,897
So nothing of importance?

739
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:15,932
Yeah.

740
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:20,303
I thought he was reprimanding you
or something.

741
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,373
He wasn't, no.

742
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:25,809
That's good to hear.

743
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:29,880
He gets really sensitive
when you're mentioned.

744
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:33,450
Did you do something

745
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:35,519
to burden or pressure him?

746
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:36,686
What?

747
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:41,158
I mean, I am imposing on him a bit.

748
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:42,893
And I'm sorry.

749
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:44,528
I hope

750
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:48,532
you don't take this the wrong way
or be offended by it.

751
00:52:49,566 --> 00:52:51,868
Tae-gyung and I are so busy,
we have to set apart

752
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,471
what little time we have to meet.

753
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:58,408
But if you take up
all of his time like this,

754
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:01,044
I honestly feel upset.

755
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:03,280
I see...

756
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,349
Could you be more careful from now on?

757
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:11,054
Yes, I'll be more careful from now on.

758
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:17,627
Oh, honey, you're all changed.

759
00:53:18,662 --> 00:53:21,264
Thank goodness I asked your stylist
for a change of clothes.

760
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:27,204
If we leave now,
we'll be able to get back soon.

761
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:29,940
Ko Mi-nam. Let's go.

762
00:53:30,674 --> 00:53:32,909
Ko Mi-nam is coming with us?

763
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:40,183
Tae-gyung, I'll stay with Aunt Mi-ja
for a bit longer before going back up.

764
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:42,786
Just tag along now.

765
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:49,192
I'm too sleepy to get
in the car right now.

766
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:50,927
You can go.

767
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:53,463
Yeah, Ko Mi-nam says he's tired,
let him get some rest.

768
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:59,536
I should get to bed. Have a safe trip.

769
00:54:03,306 --> 00:54:04,307
Ko Mi-nam.

770
00:54:08,178 --> 00:54:11,581
Remember to bring my clothes with you.
Come back up tomorrow.

771
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:30,834
Hey! Don't get in yet, hear me out.

772
00:54:31,134 --> 00:54:33,169
I'm Mi-nam's aunt

773
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:35,538
and I heard you

774
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,374
used him last time!

775
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:42,746
Your wrist is sprained and swollen anyway
so why don't you spend the night here?

776
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,748
Come on, stay!

777
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:47,284
Just one night is not hurting anybody!

778
00:54:50,887 --> 00:54:52,722
I apologize for all
the ruckus I've caused.

779
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,024
Thank you for everything.

780
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:56,493
Is that your girlfriend?

781
00:54:57,494 --> 00:54:58,495
Yes.

782
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:02,198
I'm certain I've seen you and her before.

783
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,436
If she's your lover,
what about the other one?

784
00:55:07,837 --> 00:55:09,906
This day has just been
packed with lies, I see.

785
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:15,845
You and that kid, I know for sure.
I'm pretty sure.

786
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:20,884
My goodness, how popular you are!

787
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,288
That kid,

788
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:26,856
what were they talking about?

789
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:29,626
They don't even know who we are...

790
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,721
The star is too far for me...

791
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:20,643
Tae-gyung.

792
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:22,746
Did you say something
to Ko Mi-nam while you were there?

793
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,448
Is he not coming back
because he's terrified?

794
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:28,651
It has been three days.
He won't pick up his phone either.

795
00:56:30,687 --> 00:56:32,021
He'll come when he's ready.

796
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:04,187
I miss him so much...

797
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:10,627
No, I can't.
I can't see him until my heart is empty.

798
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:15,365
But I miss him...

799
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:21,271
Mi-nam!

800
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:24,040
Someone came

801
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,975
to get you from Seoul, finally.

802
00:57:28,678 --> 00:57:31,047
He came to get you!

803
00:57:33,216 --> 00:57:35,018
Someone came to get me?

804
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,287
Go and see who it is.

805
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:41,391
I...

806
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:43,393
I...

807
00:57:44,394 --> 00:57:45,495
I want to see him.

808
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:15,391
Tae-gyung!

809
00:58:40,483 --> 00:58:41,784
Were you expecting Tae-gyung?

810
00:58:44,554 --> 00:58:45,755
Shin-woo.

811
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,158
I'm fine,

812
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:50,527
even if you weren't waiting for me.

813
00:58:51,127 --> 00:58:53,730
I came to take you back home.

814
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:12,081
Everyone is waiting for you.

815
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,717
Do you not want to go back?

816
00:59:18,321 --> 00:59:19,889
I want to see...

817
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:23,893
Mi-nam.

818
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:26,362
Do you want to stay here?

819
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:32,535
You drop everything that burdens you
and stay here.

820
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:36,272
I'll stop

821
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:38,241
treating you

822
00:59:38,775 --> 00:59:39,776
like a little brother.

823
00:59:41,978 --> 00:59:43,046
Want to do that?

824
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:46,816
Shin-woo.

825
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:56,859
I'm sorry for disappointing you.

826
00:59:59,162 --> 01:00:00,463
I was being selfish.

827
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:04,867
You and Jermy and Mr. An

828
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:08,204
must be having a difficult time
because of me,

829
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,541
but I didn't even think about that.

830
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:15,278
Is it that overwhelming

831
01:00:16,312 --> 01:00:17,380
for you?

832
01:00:20,917 --> 01:00:22,018
I can endure it.

833
01:00:22,752 --> 01:00:23,620
I must.

834
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:28,791
I'll go up with you.

835
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:40,470
What do you want me

836
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:42,372
to do for you?

837
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:50,580
Can I ask you to continue

838
01:00:51,514 --> 01:00:53,549
to treat me like a little brother?

839
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:56,853
I'm sorry

840
01:00:57,587 --> 01:00:58,655
for acting like a kid.

841
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:05,194
I'll be a good older brother.

842
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:08,097
I won't add

843
01:01:08,765 --> 01:01:10,466
to your burdens.

844
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:14,837
Just let go and rest,

845
01:01:16,072 --> 01:01:17,173
at least when you're with me.

846
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:47,103
Tae-gyung! Ko Mi-nam's here.

847
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:48,705
Shin-woo brought him back.

848
01:01:49,939 --> 01:01:50,807
Is that so?

849
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:53,042
He's getting ready to record,

850
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:54,777
want to come?

851
01:02:00,483 --> 01:02:03,086
I would have gone to hunt you down
a day later.

852
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:06,456
You're pretty lucky, Ko Mi-nam.

853
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,534
How is Mi-nam's condition? Good?

854
01:02:20,703 --> 01:02:21,671
Let's get this started.

855
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:24,307
Mi-nam,

856
01:02:24,373 --> 01:02:25,875
remember what we talked about?

857
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:27,910
You miss them,

858
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:29,712
you long for them,

859
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:32,381
until the emotions burst forth.

860
01:02:32,615 --> 01:02:34,784
You can do it, Mi-nam.

861
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:40,256
I shouldn't have

862
01:02:40,523 --> 01:02:42,959
I should have ignored you

863
01:02:43,126 --> 01:02:44,093
As if I...

864
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:47,096
The start was a bit weak.
Let's try that again.

865
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:17,960
I shouldn't have

866
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:20,263
I should have ignored you

867
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:23,299
As if I couldn't see

868
01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:27,003
As if I wasn't able to see you

869
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,138
I should have

870
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:34,977
Never set my eyes on you

871
01:03:56,265 --> 01:04:01,037
Without a word,
You taught me what love was

872
01:04:01,571 --> 01:04:06,342
Without a word, you gave me your love

873
01:04:06,876 --> 01:04:09,145
You made me like you

874
01:04:09,545 --> 01:04:12,181
Down to the breaths I take

875
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:17,286
And like this, you just run away from me

876
01:04:17,587 --> 01:04:22,425
Without a word, love leaves me

877
01:04:22,925 --> 01:04:27,797
Without a word, love abandons me

878
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:30,933
The words you've yet to speak

879
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,536
In your closed lips

880
01:04:33,836 --> 01:04:38,608
Must have scared me

881
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:42,545
Because you came, without a word

882
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:46,949
Yes! That's it!

883
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,484
That was incredible!

884
01:04:49,252 --> 01:04:51,320
Fantastic! Amazing! Yes!

885
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:55,992
Where is he going?

886
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:59,795
I think he may be a bit overwhelmed
by his emotions.

887
01:05:06,969 --> 01:05:08,938
-Mi-nam.
-Don't look at me!

888
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:12,041
No one can see me.

01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:16,379
I can't hold on much longer.

01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:19,448
They'll find out...

891
01:05:33,529 --> 01:05:34,764
I'll hide you,

892
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:36,866
so no one will be able to find you.
