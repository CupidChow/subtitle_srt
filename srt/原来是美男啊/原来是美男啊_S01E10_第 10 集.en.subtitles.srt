1
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:17,017
Don't say my name.

2
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:20,320
Tell me. Who do you like the most?

3
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:23,456
Want me to be specific?

4
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:27,827
Jermy? Kang Shin-woo? Or...

5
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:29,662
Hwang Tae-gyung?

6
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:47,580
You like Hwang Tae-gyung, don't you?

7
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:50,316
I...

8
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:54,454
You won't even deny it.

9
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:56,956
Then I'll just tell him now.

10
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:09,202
What, that doesn't fly with you?

11
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:13,473
Then shut your mouth
and go with whatever I do.

12
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,676
Honey! Come over here, quick!

13
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:21,748
He's really sick, Tae-gyung.

14
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:25,752
Are you okay, Mi-nam?
Look at him sweating!

15
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:31,091
Mi-nam. Is it that bad?

16
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:33,893
Mi-nam, you said you were going
to take some medicine. Did it get worse?

17
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:36,863
Ko Mi-nam. Get up.

18
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,144
Mi-nam! What's wrong?

19
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:54,214
He caught a cold yesterday
and I think it has gotten worse.

20
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,317
I think his sweat cooled down due
to the lights and worsened his condition.

21
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:02,055
Yeah? My goodness,
you've got a fever! You look pale too.

22
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:04,424
Mi-nam, you should go back home.
I'll let the director know.

23
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:07,093
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:08,928
You don't have to be sorry.

25
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:12,132
Mi-nam will shoot another time,
so you three finish it as scheduled, okay?

26
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:13,700
Let's go.

27
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,916
Mi-nam, are you sure you don't have
to go to the hospital?

28
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:32,352
Yes. I won't go to the hospital.

29
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:34,687
It's best to get some rest at home.

30
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,257
He-i, thanks so much
for taking care of Mi-nam.

31
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:42,729
If anything happens to Mi-nam,
it also affects Tae-gyung.

32
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:47,800
Mi-nam, you need to take care of yourself.
It's going to get hectic real soon.

33
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:51,404
I take it you have a lot of things
going on since Mi-nam came in?

34
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:56,142
Mi-nam will be the catalyst for A.N.JELL,
they'll go farther than ever before.

35
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:59,312
There are so many projects
that we've started.

36
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,982
And Ko Mi-nam, you're playing a key role
in all of it!

37
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:08,054
If something happens to Mi-nam, A.N.JELL
and you, Mr. An, will be in big trouble.

38
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:11,891
Of course! If something happens to him,
we're all in big trouble for sure.

39
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:15,161
You heard that, right, Mi-nam?

40
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,498
Take care of yourself
so nothing happens to Tae-gyung.

41
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:24,704
And be sure not to tell anyone
about the secret talk we had.

42
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:30,510
If you spill, I can't hold onto
your secret either. Okay?

43
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:35,615
What secret? What is it?

44
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,418
It's a very surprising one.

45
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:41,054
You can just drop me off at my agency.

46
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:43,189
We'll end it here for today.

47
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:54,934
I had so many limes,
even the water tastes sour.

48
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,104
I had no idea Ko Mi-nam
had such a bad cold.

49
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,173
She can't even go to the hospital.

50
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,275
-Excuse me.
-What?

51
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:06,045
Can I take some of these?

52
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,848
You still want to eat more?

53
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:11,451
It's not for me.

54
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,157
-Excuse me.
-Yeah?

55
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,560
-Can I take a few?
-Sure.

56
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:24,030
-I think it'll be good for colds.
-Yeah, sure.

57
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:27,567
Hey, sir, excuse me! Hold on!

58
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:30,703
-I can take this much, right?
-Yeah.

59
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,940
These have so many vitamins!

60
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:37,510
My friend is really sick so I wanted
to give these to him. Thanks, sir!

61
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:40,513
They must really like limes.

62
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,662
The car smells very refreshing today.

63
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,365
It's fruity. What is it?

64
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:54,487
There's a lot of traffic.

65
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:02,929
Here's the thing.

66
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:07,967
I don't know where the twins,
Mi-nam and Mi-nyeo, are.

67
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:13,773
So any money concerning
their father's copyright,

68
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:17,110
you can give it to me. I'm his only
blood relative, after all.

69
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,514
His only living, verifiable blood relative
is his sister. That's me.

70
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,817
Is there no way to find the kids?

71
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:31,457
I've looked everywhere for them,
but I was not able to find them.

72
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,561
I don't know
if they were adopted abroad...

73
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,600
Wherever they are,
I'm sure they're living well.

74
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:46,973
So for money issues,
I'm the one you should talk to. Yes.

75
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,244
So...

76
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:59,819
Dad. Mi-nam.

77
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,423
I'm so scared.

78
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:08,594
What if he gets hurt
because of someone like me?

79
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,172
Someone like me can't like him.

80
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:31,918
Someone like me can't ruin him.

81
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,154
I cannot let that happen.

82
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:45,364
Aunt Mi-ja!

83
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:50,203
Is she upstairs? Aunt Mi-ja!

84
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:54,774
Aunt Mi-ja!

85
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:59,579
Where is she? Ko Mi-nam!

86
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:01,747
Ko Mi-nam! Are you okay?

87
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:04,383
Were you alone? Where's Aunt Mi-ja?

88
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:07,420
She went down to the countryside
to meet a friend.

89
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:09,889
Are you feeling better?

90
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,294
How's your fever?

91
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,798
You're still burning up.
Did you take some medicine?

92
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,668
I did. I'll be better after I sleep.

93
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:29,609
If you were sick, you should've said
something! The shoot is ruined now!

94
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:36,649
I'm sorry. I'll make sure nothing
is ruined because of me from now on.

95
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:40,419
As you should.

96
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:47,293
Don't pay attention to him,
he's just saying that.

97
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:49,962
Today's shoot went perfectly well.

98
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:56,035
Tae-gyung ate all the limes and we did
well too. You'll just shoot later.

99
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:59,872
Why is Ko Mi-nam so calm?

100
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:02,475
Is she just used to it now?

101
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,511
Is she weak from being sick?

102
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:13,653
If you're down like that,
what fun is it for me to be mean to you?

103
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,065
How do I feed this to her anyway?

104
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,467
It's too sour to just eat it raw.

105
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,041
I should slice it thinly first.

106
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:42,949
You brought some too?

107
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,919
Yeah. I thought of Ko Mi-nam
immediately when I saw them.

108
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:48,788
You brought some too!

109
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:51,123
Let's make her some hot tea with them.

110
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,193
No. I'm going to make her some juice.

111
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:57,897
Damn it...

112
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,033
Tae-gyung!

113
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,270
Did you bring limes too?

114
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:06,706
Yeah. Why?

115
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,143
You brought them to eat?

116
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,579
Yeah. Why?

117
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,481
Aren't they sour?

118
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:18,818
Not a bit. I got used to the flavor
after having so many.

119
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:25,291
Yeah? Well, we've brought a lot,

120
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:28,961
so you can have as many as you want.
Here you go.

121
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:31,731
Thank you so much.

122
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,267
Just have those, though.

123
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:37,570
Gee...

124
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,879
I feel like my teeth will fall out.

125
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:54,153
Since everyone's fussing over her,
I don't need to take care of her.

126
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:05,297
You can have these.
They're pretty sour though.

127
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,515
She's deep asleep.

128
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:27,053
The tea will go cold
if she doesn't drink it now.

129
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,326
I should leave her to get some rest.

130
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:37,797
I'll just heat it back up later.

131
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:52,545
Mi-nam.

132
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,316
Don't be sick, Mi-nam.

133
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:02,488
When you're like this,
I can't bear to just stand by and watch.

134
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,950
I have the room to myself in a while,
so why can't I sleep?

135
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,592
Maybe I had too many of these?

136
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,764
Did her cold disappear after eating these?
She's awfully quiet.

137
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,506
What the heck? You surprised me!

138
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:00,279
Hey. What's wrong with you?

139
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,116
I... Just wanted some water...

140
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:10,189
You're burning up!
Ko Mi-nam! Wake up! Hey!

141
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:31,343
What were you doing until now!
You should've called someone. Anyone!

142
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,179
You should have said something!

143
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,995
EMERGENCY RESPONSE CENTER

144
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:00,039
Ko Mi-nam. Wake up.

145
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,913
Where are we?

146
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:12,151
The hospital. Can you walk?
Or get on my back. I'll carry you.

147
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:16,021
I won't go.

148
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,358
You have to.
Your temperature is way too high.

149
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:23,229
No. I can't. They'll find out.

150
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:27,499
Even if they do, you have to go in.
I won't let you stay like this.

151
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:31,670
Let me be! I won't go in!

152
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:36,909
Ko Mi-nam! Are you out of your mind?

153
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,550
Let's just go in,
I'll do whatever I can...

154
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:45,918
I told you, I won't go!

155
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,822
Aren't you scared at all?

156
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:52,658
What if they find out?
What will you do then?

157
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,061
Someone like me...

158
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,831
A nobody like me...

159
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:01,433
I'm afraid that you'll get hurt

160
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,003
because of somebody like me.

161
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:08,941
It's not the time to worry about me.

162
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:13,479
And when I promised to look over this,
I prepared myself for anything!

163
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:18,050
I'll take care of myself.
So let's go inside and get treated.

164
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,756
I also made a promise not to get caught.

165
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:25,557
So...

166
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,794
I won't go inside. I won't.

167
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:31,463
Are you serious right now?

168
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,601
I can endure through it.

169
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,871
Please. Take me home.

170
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,227
Ko Mi-nam.

171
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:39,565
You can cry if you want.
You can throw up if you want.

172
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,568
You don't have to clench your teeth
and bear it like that.

173
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:14,967
What's wrong?

174
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,703
Ko Mi-nam has gotten worse.

175
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,826
I'll take care of him.
You don't have to worry.

176
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:50,169
Once his fever comes down, he'll be fine.
Just leave him to me and go.

177
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,428
It's a fever reducer.

178
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,565
Swallow.

179
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:17,322
It's 39 degrees Celsius?
Her temperature is still so high.

180
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:21,260
Ko Mi-nam. Open your mouth.

181
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:26,031
Drink it all. You can't get dehydrated.

182
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,069
Is this room too dry?

183
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,594
37.5 degrees Celsius.

184
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,397
Her fever is almost gone.

185
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:18,016
Tae-gyung.

186
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,955
"Thank you"?

187
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:28,994
Where's your "I'm sorry"?

188
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:35,634
Are you all right?

189
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:43,976
Guess you're not.

190
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:48,213
I suppose you can't be,
if your temperature was over

191
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,449
40 degrees Celsius.

192
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,686
Ko Mi-nam. What is this?

193
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,691
Your palm.

194
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,928
The answer is five.

195
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:06,198
Guess you kept your sanity
and mind pretty intact.

196
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:11,203
Now, get your head together
and listen to me carefully.

197
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:19,144
Even when you were that sick,
you were deathly worried about me.

198
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:21,446
Which shows your sense of loyalty.

199
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,551
And you really bore through it,
which showed me your tenacity.

200
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:35,060
I didn't want to acknowledge it
and had been trying to deny it until now,

201
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:38,297
but I've accepted it as a fact
due to this incident.

202
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:42,200
I'm on your side, Ko Mi-nam.

203
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:46,838
So I'll bear the responsibility
to protect you.

204
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,977
And take responsibility for everything
that concerns you.

205
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:57,115
I really am sorry.

206
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:02,387
I'll think a lot more
on what I should do from now on.

207
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:03,622
And...

208
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:08,627
Thank you for saying that.

209
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:14,399
Don't do things you'll be sorry for

210
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,169
and discuss with me what we should do.

211
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,305
Just be thankful at all times.

212
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:26,078
I'm exhausted. I'm going to sleep now.

213
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:28,146
You should sleep too.

214
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:41,059
I can't do this anymore.

215
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:44,162
Before everyone else finds out,

216
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,132
before anyone else gets hurt,

217
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:50,469
Ko Mi-nam has to disappear.

218
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,560
Is she better now?

219
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,880
Now... I'll stay just a bit longer,

220
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:38,617
until I get better.

221
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:50,128
Precious beauty! Ko Mi-nam, forever!

222
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:52,130
You just watch,
Ko Mi-nam will be a superstar!

223
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:56,067
Her song, her music video,
they're all freaking amazing!

224
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:59,871
You're finally seeing some light
after enduring with the fake Ko Mi-nam.

225
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:02,474
-Nicely done.
-That's right.

226
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:05,110
Mi-nam's ttakjis are out now

227
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:10,615
so I prepared a legendary tale to spread
among the fan club too.

228
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,617
Mi-nam's legendary tale?

229
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:16,154
Yeah, everyone else in A.N.JELL has one,
so Mi-nam should too!

230
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:17,222
She has her own ttakji too!

231
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,025
Let's hear it.

232
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:23,495
Okay. So I took some of the other members'
and changed it up a bit.

233
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:29,668
-Firstly, what is a man without action?
-Action!

234
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:31,736
-And who's the best at it? Bruce Lee!
-Bruce Lee!

235
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,005
So Mi-nam is Bruce Lee's disciple!

236
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,494
Hey. Kids these days don't know
who Bruce Lee is!

237
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:57,662
Really?

238
00:24:58,730 --> 00:24:59,865
Dang, that's no good then.

239
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,101
What should I do?

240
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:08,507
Then Mi-nam should dance
with a princess too.

241
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,976
Since Jermy has an English princess,

242
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:13,879
Mi-nam will dance with...

243
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:15,413
How about an Indian princess?

244
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:17,249
An Indian princess?

245
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:38,703
Are there princesses in India though?

246
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:40,605
I don't think there are any.

247
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:42,407
Yeah?

248
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:47,312
Okay, my mistake.
Then there's only one left.

249
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,781
A secret about his birth.

250
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:55,820
Ko Mi-nam's mother is a mysterious
but amazing woman.

251
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,345
Who is Ko Mi-nam's mother?

252
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:24,316
How dare you! Show some respect!

253
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:30,555
I am

254
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:35,193
Ko Mi-nam's mother!

255
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:44,336
"I am Ko Mi-nam's mother!

256
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,204
Mi-nam..."

257
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,974
Of all the things to use for a story!
Don't be ridiculous!

258
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,677
-Why?
-This is why they say you're childish.

259
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,113
What's childish about it?

260
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:57,916
I'm so serious right now.

261
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:00,452
It's so childish!

262
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:05,457
Stop making up childish stories
and take care of Mi-nam.

263
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,160
Did you even know that Mi-nam
was sick yesterday?

264
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:13,865
Mi-nam... I was making these ttakjis!
Mi-nam was sick?

265
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:20,205
I just need to buy something
that screams "I'm a woman!"

266
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:21,906
For emergencies, of course.

267
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:28,513
But what do I put on her?

268
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:38,957
Something like that, I guess.
She'd definitely look like a woman.

269
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:57,809
But that posture is weird.

270
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,249
Pink and lace.

271
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,651
That's feminine for sure...

272
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:22,901
That's not my type either.

273
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:31,676
That looks good.

274
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:54,733
Yes. I'd like it if Ko Mi-nam
wore something like that.

275
00:28:57,001 --> 00:29:01,606
Why do I have to like it?
It's for an emergency, it can be anything.

276
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:06,311
Welcome.

277
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:09,314
-I'll take that.
-Yes, sir!

278
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:15,220
You're Hwang Tae-gyung, right? I'm a fan!

279
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:17,922
Are you buying it for your girlfriend?

280
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:21,693
Miss He-i doesn't accept clothes from us,

281
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:24,996
so thanks to you, we'll see her
wearing them!

282
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,531
Here you go.

283
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:31,469
I don't know. She'll just wear
whatever she wants.

284
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:39,878
Hwang Tae-gyung, you're ignoring
my phone calls again?

285
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,418
But since he hasn't called me

286
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:52,624
I guess Ko Mi-nam is staying quiet
like I told her to.

287
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:56,060
He-i, here.

288
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,262
What's this?

289
00:29:57,328 --> 00:30:00,732
A company sponsored them for the shoot
last time but they gifted them to you.

290
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:08,606
These are the rings I wore with Hwang
Tae-gyung during the music video shoot.

291
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:20,819
If I asked him to wear them,
he probably wouldn't.

292
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:30,061
I wish I could wear them with him...

293
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:46,744
He bought a hairpin for someone
like Ko Mi-nam though.

294
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,781
Goodness, I hate her so much!

295
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:56,387
Now, shall I go catch the little thing?

296
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:03,928
Ko Mi-nam. You can't just stay
in your room because you're sick.

297
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:06,097
You have to get some fresh air!

298
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,799
Here, do what I do.

299
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:19,577
Oh, there's this too.

300
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:22,947
Here.

301
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:30,021
Is it too sour?

302
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:33,458
I dumped in so much honey
into this. Is it still sour?

303
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:35,293
It's good.

304
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:39,264
Here. You need to stay warm.

305
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,765
Yes, you should.

306
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:47,805
Mi-nam!

307
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,646
I came to visit you since you're sick.

308
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:03,655
Here we go.

309
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:05,890
Where's Tae-gyung?

310
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,928
Tae-gyung went out.
You didn't call him beforehand?

311
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:11,663
I wanted to surprise him.

312
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:16,634
Visiting Mi-nam was an excuse,
to be honest. I wanted to see his home.

313
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:18,703
I hope that's okay, Mi-nam.

314
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,873
I thought you might come.

315
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:26,044
I brought some fruit as a gift,
but I think I left it in my car.

316
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:29,514
Could you bring them over, Shin-woo?

317
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:31,082
Yeah.

318
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:42,060
I'm so thirsty. Can I get a glass
of what Mi-nam is having?

319
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:47,799
Yeah, sure. I'll get you some.

320
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:54,238
It'll be all right. Right?

321
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:03,448
Hey. Where's your room?

322
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:05,650
Let's go.

323
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:23,401
I thought you'd get scared and run away,
but you're holding out pretty well.

324
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:26,771
I won't run away like this.

325
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:29,407
For someone as clumsy as you,
that's brave.

326
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:32,910
All those people doting on you
makes you all courageous, right?

327
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:37,749
When they find out who you really are,
they'll all turn on you.

328
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:43,254
I could go down and tell them right now.
You should be begging on your knees.

329
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,525
I'll tell them everything.

330
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:52,830
I'll tell Shin-woo and Jermy everything.

331
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:58,102
They won't be able to forgive me,
but I'll leave after confessing the truth.

332
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:04,609
Yeah? Then can you confess
that you like Hwang Tae-gyung?

333
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:09,714
Do I have to tell them that too?

334
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:13,918
Of course.
That's how I caught you, remember?

335
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:16,954
Because you forgot your place
and fell in love with him.

336
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:25,096
Fine. I'll tell them that too.

337
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,070
Fine. Tell them everything.

338
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:34,939
When Tae-gyung gets back,
gather them all together and confess.

339
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:38,242
I'll make sure to watch
what happens to you then.

340
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,212
You don't deserve all this treatment.
It's over now!

341
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:48,152
What's going on?

342
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:52,023
Mi-nam, why are you doing this?

343
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:55,293
Just because I touched a few things?
Isn't this a bit too much?

344
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:00,298
I'm sorry.

345
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,470
Don't. Leave it.

346
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:08,005
I'll pick them up, you might get cut.

347
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:12,276
It's fine, I'll clean it up.
Could you bring the vacuum?

348
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:15,580
Be careful. I'll be right back.

349
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:39,170
Mi-nam is acting strange.

350
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:41,906
I feel like he's hiding something.

351
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:46,077
Maybe there's something
I'm not supposed to see.

352
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:51,449
No one likes it when people touch
their things without permission.

353
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:57,221
But that kind of reaction is over the top.

354
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:03,628
If he's like that to me, he might even
be hiding something from you.

355
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:05,696
Doesn't that make you feel suspicious?

356
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:08,633
I'm not the type to poke
and pry at something

357
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:10,001
the other person wants to hide.

358
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:13,738
But doesn't it make you feel angry?

359
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:15,473
I'm sure they have a reason.

360
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,543
If it's understandable, then no.
I won't be angry.

361
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:24,682
What the heck?

362
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:30,354
If Ko Mi-nam's story is understandable
he won't be angry?

363
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:34,392
Does he think he is some kind of saint?

364
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:42,433
Did something happen?
Did you say something to Ko Mi-nam?

365
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:48,206
It wasn't me.
Mi-nam did something wrong to me.

366
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:50,408
Oh, is that right?

367
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:54,845
He's not feeling his best right now,
so you should understand.

368
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:58,416
Do you just take it in
whenever Mi-nam does something wrong?

369
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,585
He doesn't really do anything wrong.

370
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:06,190
But there might be something big he did
that you may not know about.

371
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,792
How about that?

372
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:12,530
I'll take it in stride.

373
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:15,132
I really like Ko Mi-nam, you see.

374
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:18,102
Since I like him,
anything he does is fine.

375
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:23,040
Wait! His glass broke, right?

376
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:26,244
Ko Mi-nam! Are you okay?

377
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,545
Everything is fine?

378
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:31,315
Then will he be fine with finding out
that she's a woman?

379
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:36,887
Who does he think he is, Ko Mi-nam's mom?
Dad? How can it all be fine?

380
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:46,897
What?

381
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:51,936
I said I won't wear their brand.
Stop bothering me about it.

382
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:58,342
What? Hwang Tae-gyung
bought me clothes from there?

383
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,345
He bought women's clothes? You're sure?

384
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,180
Okay.

385
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:07,918
Hwang Tae-gyung bought women's clothes?

386
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,322
He wouldn't ever buy my clothes.

387
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:14,458
He-i.

388
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:18,696
I think Tae-gyung has just arrived.

389
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:21,799
Did he?

390
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,110
It really is that brand.

391
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,747
He really did buy women's clothes.

392
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:44,955
Why are you here?

393
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,359
I came to see Mi-nam since she's sick.

394
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,494
That's a lie, huh?

395
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:53,631
And to see you while I'm here.

396
00:38:57,635 --> 00:38:59,970
Fakey. You're acting a bit off.

397
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:01,739
Are you, by any chance...

398
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:07,278
Forget it. I won't think about it.

399
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:11,082
So it isn't mine, then.

400
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,184
Then what, it's Ko Mi-nam's?

401
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:17,221
Hwang Tae-gyung.
I have something to give you.

402
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:19,623
Now, what?

403
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:23,928
This. They're matching rings
for me and you.

404
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:28,332
-What?
-I need proof that you're mine.

405
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:31,769
You wear this.

406
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,874
It's a pretty ring.

407
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,179
You look great with both. You wear them.

408
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:46,984
Oh, by the way, Fake Fairy. I'm telling
you just in case you were confused.

409
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:50,454
Let's make this one thing clear.
I'm not yours.

410
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:55,359
And I'm not yours!
It was just something to show the public.

411
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:59,096
We're showing them enough.
No need to go the extra mile.

412
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:06,203
He keeps refusing me.

413
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:09,573
Even if Ko Mi-nam confesses to him,

414
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:12,309
he'll reject her too. Right?

415
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:28,292
Oh, you're here. Ko Mi-nam said
he had something to tell all of us.

416
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:51,048
What if they all find out
Ko Mi-nam is a girl,

417
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:54,919
but they say that they're fine with it?

418
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:16,607
And what if Hwang Tae-gyung finds out
Ko Mi-nam likes him?

419
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:21,011
I can't let her tell him!

420
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:25,082
What did you want to tell us?

421
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:28,486
Did you get in trouble again,
the moment you got better?

422
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,557
What I wanted to tell you was...

423
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:42,666
I can't let her say it!
I have to stop her!

424
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:46,070
To be honest, I...

425
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:57,414
Honey. I came to tell you something...

426
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:04,021
Did you just... dry heave?

427
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:07,358
Is this the thing I saw in dramas?

428
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:08,993
Is it?

429
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,928
I wonder.

430
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,365
What the heck are you doing?

431
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:19,703
Honey...

432
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:21,639
I'm sorry...

433
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:32,483
Wait. Tae-gyung. Then do we have

434
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:35,052
to throw a congratulatory party?

435
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,588
Hey. Go take care of her!

436
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,791
It has to be yours.

437
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:42,726
I'll kill you, you Fake Fairy.

438
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:52,169
Why is He-i doing that?

439
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:06,016
I think I'm a genius.

440
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:09,887
I shut Ko Mi-nam up
and screwed with Hwang Tae-gyung.

441
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:20,864
Do you really think it's real?

442
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,567
Then is Tae-gyung becoming a dad?

443
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:35,346
-Hello.
-You. Don't say anything for now.

444
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:41,785
You confessing everything now
won't help Tae-gyung at all.

445
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:44,555
Reveal everything
in front of a bigger crowd.

446
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,957
Take responsibility by yourself.

447
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:53,163
You don't want the members to get hurt
on your account, do you?

448
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:57,401
Yes. You're correct.

449
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:02,806
It just happens that there is a premiere
for your music video.

450
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:06,777
Perfect. End it there.

451
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,816
Yes. I'll do that.

452
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:31,769
You. What the heck was that dry heave?

453
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,638
And what? "Honey, I'm sorry"?

454
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,107
Chill. Relax.

455
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:40,978
We're not even wearing matching rings,
why are you all angry?

456
00:44:43,914 --> 00:44:46,316
Where do you think you're going?
Explain yourself!

457
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:50,220
Oh my, Hwang Tae-gyung.
Are you clinging onto me right now?

458
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:53,924
But dear me, I'm not yours
so I'm not listening to you.

459
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:03,133
Hey!

460
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,373
You're mad because of this, huh?

461
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:15,212
You should've listened to me
the first time. Don't get me mad.

462
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:21,251
What, are you going to chuck
my phone this time?

463
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,623
I'm not number one on your speed dial?

464
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:28,859
Of course, you're not. My dad is!

465
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,995
Why? Do you want to be?

466
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:35,265
Is your father a scary person?

467
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:37,868
My dad is super-duper scary.

468
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:41,271
If my dad ever saw you,
he'd probably rip out all your hair.

469
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,244
I'm glad to hear that he's scary.

470
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,281
DAD, I'M PREGNANT

471
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:53,717
Are you crazy?

472
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:57,054
Hey, give that back! Give it back,
you can't send it! You can't!

473
00:45:57,187 --> 00:46:01,225
Give it back! Don't you dare send it!
My dad will kill me!

474
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:11,869
Did you just... Did you just send that?

475
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:16,173
Oh, dear. He is totally going to kill you.

476
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:21,345
Hey!

477
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:32,489
Dad! No, it's not true.

478
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:37,795
What? No, you don't have to come! Dad?

479
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:43,467
She had an upset stomach. That's all.
Don't go crazy with your imagination.

480
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:47,337
I just told you not to!

481
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:51,241
Anyway, it's between you two,
so we'll turn a blind eye.

482
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:53,944
Mi-nam, what did you want to tell us?

483
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:56,580
Oh, so...

484
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:03,821
I felt so bad for causing trouble
to all of you so I wanted to apologize.

485
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:06,323
You were sick, it's fine. I understand.

486
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:09,459
Ko Mi-nam. It's fine.
Everything is fine now.

487
00:47:09,526 --> 00:47:14,031
It wasn't like it was your first time,
there's was no need to do this.

488
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:20,003
It's totally fine.

489
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:27,211
It's fine, really.

490
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:34,084
Reverend Mother. I've received
undeserving love and care here.

491
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:40,090
Please give me courage so I can do well
and let no harm befall them.

492
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:42,059
Are you mad?

493
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:46,530
You're mad?
Don't be mad, I was just joking!

494
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:48,832
Come on.

495
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:53,103
Ko Mi-nam!

496
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:55,839
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

497
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:57,241
It has been so long!

498
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:02,112
Oh, that's delicious.

499
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:07,084
So I was talking to Mo Hwa-ran
about my brother, right?

500
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:13,690
And her eyes were so soft,
I'm sure she had feelings for him!

501
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,326
Maybe they dated.

502
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:19,329
No way. A star like Mo Hwa-ran?

503
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:20,697
I'm telling you, it's true!

504
00:48:21,798 --> 00:48:26,737
Maybe Mo Hwa-ran knows
who the twins' mother is?

505
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:31,208
What if it's Mo Hwa-ran? You said
it looked like they liked each other!

506
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:32,276
What?

507
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:35,712
No way, don't be ridiculous.

508
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:38,949
Mo Hwa-ran is not even married.
If she went around with a huge stomach

509
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:41,785
everyone would've known already!

510
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:45,389
Wait a second.

511
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:50,727
Hey. When Mo Hwa-ran
was at her peak of popularity,

512
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:54,197
didn't she say she'll retire
and go on a long hiatus?

513
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:57,434
Did she?

514
00:48:57,501 --> 00:49:00,737
Yeah, she did! I'm a huge fan of hers,
so I remember it clearly.

515
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:03,807
That was what, 20 years ago?

516
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:11,181
It feels that it matches up
with the twins' ages too...

517
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:32,970
This song,

518
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:38,141
you made this for me
so I'll come back to you.

519
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:41,111
Right?

520
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,016
You made this for me.

521
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:51,555
You...

522
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:55,258
You only loved me.

523
00:49:58,495 --> 00:49:59,963
You only loved me.

524
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:05,802
Like how I've done.

525
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:38,568
These are some heartbreaking lyrics.

526
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,305
Is this why you left me?

527
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:44,041
Because he begged you like this
to come back?

528
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:53,150
MO HWA-RAN
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU

529
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:54,885
WRITTEN AND COMPOSED
BY KO JAE-HYEON

530
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:58,789
Ko Jae-hyeon. Because of this man?

531
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:14,104
Can you understand that woman
for asking me to remake this song?

532
00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:20,610
When I'm feeling like this,

533
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:23,380
the real Ko Mi-nam
is much more useful than you.

534
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:46,103
I can't see the stars clearly.
Is it too dark?

535
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:48,939
It's because it's too bright.

536
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:50,674
Tae-gyung.

537
00:51:52,142 --> 00:51:55,178
If you want to see the stars,
go turn off the lights.

538
00:52:09,693 --> 00:52:11,194
I can see them clearly now!

539
00:52:12,395 --> 00:52:14,231
I can't, it's too dark for me now.

540
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:20,470
It's dark so I can see the stars
clearly now.

541
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:23,306
Why are you out here at this hour, anyway?

542
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:25,942
Are you worried
about the premiere tomorrow?

543
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:29,880
I will do well tomorrow!

544
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,617
You heard that we're not going
tomorrow, yes?

545
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:38,822
Yes. I heard Mr. An arranged it for me.

546
00:52:38,955 --> 00:52:41,158
You should be in the spotlight,

547
00:52:41,224 --> 00:52:43,827
and we're not going so we won't steal
your thunder.

548
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:46,563
That's good. I'm glad.

549
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:50,133
I can't imagine how you would've reacted
if we said we'll go.

550
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:57,407
Tae-gyung. When I look back
on this place, it'll feel like a dream.

551
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:03,813
You, Shin-woo, and Jermy are all stars,
far away from me.

552
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:06,516
But I got to stay with you guys
for a while.

553
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:17,127
You can see stars from wherever you are.

554
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:20,263
So I'll get to see you,
even if I'm not here.

555
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,568
But I can't see you.

556
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:30,840
It's frustrating not being able to see.

557
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:34,511
So don't stay where I can't see you,
Ko Mi-nam.

558
00:53:36,479 --> 00:53:39,849
But you can't see me now
even if and I'm right next to you.

559
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:50,327
I can. I can see enough
to know that you're there.

560
00:53:52,662 --> 00:53:55,765
Can you really see me?

561
00:53:56,933 --> 00:53:59,069
Yes. I'm looking at you right now.

562
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:04,107
So stay this close when it gets dark,
so I can see you.

563
00:54:06,543 --> 00:54:08,445
Yes. I will.

564
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:12,882
But Tae-gyung. I have a favor
to ask of you.

565
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:18,021
When I'm done being Ko Mi-nam
and go back to being a woman

566
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:22,892
please pretend you can't see me,
no matter how bright it is.

567
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:25,128
What?

568
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:28,798
I'll also pretend that I can't see you.

569
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:32,936
So you want to pretend
that we don't know each other?

570
00:54:33,136 --> 00:54:37,107
Yes. When I'm a woman,
don't acknowledge me.

571
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:39,376
Promise me that. Please.

572
00:54:43,313 --> 00:54:44,814
Of course.

573
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:46,816
I promise.

574
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:50,887
Let's never acknowledge each other.

575
00:54:53,757 --> 00:54:55,225
Thank you.

576
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:58,561
I'll turn on the lights and go inside.

577
00:55:05,902 --> 00:55:09,839
So once all business is over,
let's pretend to be strangers?

578
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:13,343
That ungrateful little jerk.

579
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,612
That little rabbit!

580
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:41,671
What is this?

581
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:50,447
It's for emergencies, so you can slip out.
Keep it safe.

582
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:54,117
When you're wearing clothes like this,
I'll never acknowledge you.

583
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:57,420
Please don't. Please.

584
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:14,304
Okay, mic check. Double check
and make sure everything is there.

585
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:15,972
Don't forget the pamphlet!

586
00:56:16,406 --> 00:56:19,042
-The reporters?
-On their way.

587
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:24,547
A.N.JELL KO MI-NAM'S FIRST SINGLE ALBUM

588
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:02,585
Ko Mi-nam! Good luck, come back soon!

589
00:57:02,652 --> 00:57:03,920
I'll set up a congratulatory party!

590
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:05,388
Don't be nervous.

591
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:08,024
Be nervous. Ko Mi-nam.

592
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,730
I'll be off, then.

593
00:57:39,823 --> 00:57:42,926
-Oh, He-i!
-I'm looking forward to it.

594
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:44,894
As you should! It'll be amazing.

595
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,598
Where's Mi-nam?

596
00:57:49,065 --> 00:57:50,467
He'll be here any minute.

597
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:52,368
-Show her to her seat.
-Yes.

598
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:57,707
It's me. Mi-nam is all ready, yes?

599
00:57:58,374 --> 00:58:00,109
Yes, there are so many reporters here!

600
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:10,987
Yes.

601
00:58:12,021 --> 00:58:15,925
Yes, he's all ready. We'll be there soon.

602
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:21,531
Excuse me, ma'am. Where did Mi-nam go?

603
00:58:21,598 --> 00:58:24,200
He was just here a minute ago.

604
00:58:25,101 --> 00:58:29,506
What? It's almost time. Mi-nam!

605
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:35,378
Mi-nam?

606
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:46,222
Mi-nam!

607
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:49,459
Ko Mi-nam!

608
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:53,763
Mi-nam!

609
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:05,508
Ko Mi-nam. Are you ready?

610
00:59:05,775 --> 00:59:08,011
Yes. I am.

611
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:16,653
What? What do you mean, Mi-nam
disappeared?

612
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,621
There's no time. Go find him!

613
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:26,963
I am. I'm looking for him right now
but he won't pick up!

614
00:59:27,797 --> 00:59:28,798
Yes.

615
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:31,200
Mi-nam disappeared?

616
00:59:31,868 --> 00:59:34,704
Mr. Ma is looking everywhere,
but he's gone. He won't pick up his phone.

617
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:36,439
There's no time left.

618
00:59:37,106 --> 00:59:40,109
There's no way he'll just disappear.
Do you think something happened?

619
00:59:43,146 --> 00:59:44,981
We should go and be there.

620
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:48,618
If Ko Mi-nam fails to show up,
we need to be there to cover it up.

621
01:00:03,466 --> 01:00:05,168
Where did the pin go?

622
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:32,161
When I'm done being Ko Mi-nam
and go back to being a woman

623
01:00:32,695 --> 01:00:34,397
please pretend you can't see me,

624
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:36,666
no matter how bright it is.

625
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:44,741
Just what were you thinking?
Why are you doing this now?

626
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:13,469
It's time. What do we do?

627
01:01:15,805 --> 01:01:18,107
We have to buy time.
Turn on the music video first.

628
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:20,076
-Yes, sir.
-Jesus!

629
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:34,457
After you've finished recording
your message, please press pound.

630
01:01:35,491 --> 01:01:37,193
Ko Mi-nam. Just run away.

631
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:39,262
If you come here in that,
all hell will break lose!

632
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:42,532
I'll bear full responsibility and take
care of everything here. Don't come!

633
01:01:48,604 --> 01:01:50,273
"WITHOUT A WORD"

634
01:01:57,914 --> 01:01:59,682
I have to be responsible
for what I've done.

635
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:01,918
I can't let any other person
take responsibility.

636
01:02:05,488 --> 01:02:09,192
-Tae-gyung!
-Can I get an autograph? Please!

637
01:02:09,258 --> 01:02:10,593
-Tae-gyung!
-An autograph, please!

638
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:27,643
-Tae-gyung!
-Shin-woo!

639
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:35,351
-I love you!
-I love you!

640
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:40,356
We'll now begin the premiere
for A.N.JELL's music drama.

641
01:02:41,724 --> 01:02:45,194
Oh, you're here. Come take a seat.

642
01:02:49,632 --> 01:02:52,635
"WITHOUT A WORD"

643
01:02:59,542 --> 01:03:00,610
I can't see a thing.

644
01:03:04,213 --> 01:03:08,151
I can't see anything, I can't find him.
Go find Ko Mi-nam.

645
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:10,853
What are you talking about?

646
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:12,655
Ko Mi-nam is here?

647
01:03:13,523 --> 01:03:16,058
He'll be somewhere nearby.
We have to find him quickly.

648
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:19,462
This song was written
by A.N.JELL's leader, Hwang Tae-gyung

649
01:03:19,529 --> 01:03:20,863
-and sung by...
-Okay.

650
01:03:23,933 --> 01:03:25,034
Look for a woman.

651
01:03:28,671 --> 01:03:29,739
A woman?

652
01:03:30,273 --> 01:03:33,776
She'll be wearing
an ivory coat with a pink skirt.

653
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:39,649
But you said to look for Ko Mi-nam?

654
01:03:42,685 --> 01:03:44,954
That woman is Ko Mi-nam.

655
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:51,227
There's no time to explain.

656
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:53,196
We have to find her
and get her out of here.

657
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:55,064
I'll look outside.

658
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:02,872
Shin-woo. How is that woman Ko Mi-nam?

659
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:07,109
He said there's no time to explain.
Let's look for her first.

660
01:04:18,254 --> 01:04:20,356
-It's Tae-gyung!
-Tae-gyung!

661
01:04:20,423 --> 01:04:23,059
-Tae-gyung?
-It's Tae-gyung!

662
01:04:39,942 --> 01:04:41,878
Girls, come on! Let's go!

663
01:04:48,684 --> 01:04:50,219
We'll begin shortly.

664
01:04:59,128 --> 01:05:01,264
"WITHOUT A WORD"

665
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:29,825
I can't see anything.

666
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:32,061
I can't see Ko Mi-nam!

667
01:05:33,863 --> 01:05:35,698
I told you not to stay
where I can't see you!

668
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:38,935
Tae-gyung?

669
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:43,172
-Who was that?
-What's going on?

670
01:05:48,711 --> 01:05:52,682
Don't look at me here.
You shouldn't see me.

671
01:05:57,186 --> 01:05:58,287
-Tae-gyung!
-Tae-gyung!

672
01:05:59,922 --> 01:06:01,691
-Tae-gyung!
-Oh, my goodness!

673
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,882
-What's going on?
-Who is that?

674
01:06:28,584 --> 01:06:29,719
What happened?

675
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:34,690
-What's going on?
-Look over here, please!

676
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:38,027
-Look over here!
-Over here!

677
01:06:38,094 --> 01:06:40,529
-Do the other members know about this?
-Please, over here!

678
01:06:58,814 --> 01:07:00,016
