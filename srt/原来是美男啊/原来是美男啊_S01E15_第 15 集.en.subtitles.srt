1
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:26,292
Please hear me out!

2
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:30,196
Stay out of my sight.

3
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:32,432
I don't want to see you.

4
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,440
Reverend Mother.

5
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:45,278
He was abandoned because of my father.

6
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:48,415
My mother, my brother, and I

7
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:51,317
were abandoned because of his mother.

8
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:56,156
I couldn't say that I didn't care,
that it didn't matter.

9
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:59,159
I had to let him go.

10
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:05,165
I can't see my star anymore.

11
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,262
When it's dark, I can't see anything.

12
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,666
I can't see anything because it's dark.
That's all it is.

13
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,033
Ko Mi-nam and Ko Mi-nyeo

14
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:49,702
is one person, and a woman.

15
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,004
Right?

16
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,138
I don't know.

17
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,008
Then do Jermy,

18
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:58,444
Shin-woo, and Tae-gyung know?

19
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:02,749
I don't know! Why are you asking me?

20
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,151
Ask them directly if you're curious.

21
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,223
But I know they'll say they don't know,

22
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,325
just like you.

23
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,260
I'm telling you I don't know
because I don't know.

24
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:18,398
If you want to find out about Ko Mi-nam,
go get Ko Mi-nam yourself.

25
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:22,902
Oh, so just go after Ko Mi-nam?

26
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:26,339
Planning to cut ties
with the "I don't know" card, are you?

27
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:30,843
I knew it.

28
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:34,113
In this industry,
it doesn't even surprise me.

29
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:42,522
But I'm not one to be satisfied
with small fish like Ko Mi-nam.

30
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:45,391
I've got bigger fish to catch,
like the Yoo He-i, Jermy,

31
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:49,462
Kang Shin-woo, and Hwang Tae-gyung!

32
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,866
He-i. If you don't want
your name involved,

33
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,802
tell me everything.

34
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,672
The three of them know, don't they?

35
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,876
They're all in this together, aren't they?

36
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,945
What, exactly, is their relationship?

37
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,187
He-i!

38
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:17,457
He-i! Wake up!

39
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,926
Don't put on a show, get up!

40
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,061
Answer me! He-i!

41
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:24,430
-He-i--
-He-i! Oh, my goodness, He-i.

42
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:25,832
Hold on, I'll get someone.

43
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:27,667
Manager!

44
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,569
If you're acting like this,

45
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:34,007
I'll take it as confirmation that
there is definitely something going on.

46
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:38,578
Let's make a deal.

47
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,848
You stay quiet

48
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,685
until I find out what that something is.

49
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,488
If I get A.N.JELL,

50
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,958
I'll make sure you're not involved.

51
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,301
So, I think we should send
Mi-nam away in advance.

52
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:03,236
Why?

53
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,773
The real Mi-nam will be here in no time.

54
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:07,774
Is something wrong?

55
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:13,880
Mr. Kim requested an interview
with Mi-nam and Mi-nyeo, together.

56
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:16,783
It would be a good way
to avoid that as well.

57
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,619
We definitely need to avoid that.
What do we do?

58
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:25,124
We should go to the fan meeting in Japan,
the one we refused last time.

59
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,793
I'll adjust your schedules.

60
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,629
Get us on the earliest
possible flight, please.

61
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,602
We're going to fly to Okinawa today.

62
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:37,904
What about you?

63
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:40,173
I'm going separately, later.

64
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,811
Okay, then we'll take Mi-nam with us.

65
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,627
Mi-nam will be back

66
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:04,630
from the States the day
we get back from Japan.

67
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:09,402
Then you can come back
to Korea in your real self, Mi-nyeo.

68
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:10,937
Ta-da!

69
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:15,675
Then after we get back from Japan,
I don't have to be here anymore?

70
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,413
It's finally the end
as an A.N.JELL member.

71
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,617
Think of this trip
as a farewell trip, of sorts.

72
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:29,122
Oh, but Tae-gyung's going separately.

73
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:30,823
You must be disappointed.

74
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,661
No. I'm happy that I get to travel so far.

75
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,769
Why are you packing all that?

76
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,537
It's not like
you're not coming back here ever.

77
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:47,440
You can pack leisurely
when your brother gets back.

78
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:51,811
No, I would rather pack up
everything now while I'm at it.

79
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,566
Tae-gyung, I'm going now.

80
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:47,560
Ko Mi-nam...

81
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,396
Did something happen
with her and Tae-gyung?

82
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:53,766
Let's just turn a blind eye to it.

83
00:08:58,571 --> 00:08:59,772
Guys! Today's schedule is...

84
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:02,408
Nothing! It's a free day.

85
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,145
Get some rest. Here, your room keys.

86
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:08,481
And Mi-nam, you're in the next room...

87
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,721
As expected, they tried to run away.

88
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,723
But I'm hot on your trail.

89
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:21,093
When they're completely off-guard,

90
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:23,763
their true relationship will be revealed.

91
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:26,532
Oh, shoot!

92
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:31,604
Why isn't Hwang Tae-gyung here with them?

93
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:33,873
I need to get all of them in the picture.

94
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:45,184
Should I tell Hwang Tae-gyung
about Mr. Kim?

95
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:49,922
No, I can't.

96
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:51,557
Then I can't get myself out of it.

97
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:56,395
I can't believe he didn't come visit me
when I'm in the hospital

98
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:57,830
even if I'm faking it.

99
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:05,938
Is there no way to get him out of it?

100
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:08,975
If something happens to him,

101
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:11,777
I might actually get sick.

102
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:37,637
All I see are stars
the moment I step into the room.

103
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,821
I feel so relaxed here.

104
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:57,189
Yes?

105
00:10:58,391 --> 00:10:59,792
Why didn't Tae-gyung come today, anyway?

106
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:05,498
If he did I was planning
to set him up with Mi-nyeo.

107
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:06,899
Who knows,

108
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:10,403
they could have turned out
like those newlyweds

109
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:11,604
over there.

110
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:14,974
But...

111
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,710
for a husband, Tae-gyung's a bit...

112
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,046
not great.

113
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,582
As a woman,

114
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:28,320
the best husband is someone like Jermy.
Cute and fun.

115
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,058
Then should I set her up
with Jermy now before it's too late?

116
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,371
You're so cute!

117
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:53,312
-So cute!
-So cute!

118
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:02,455
That's so childish though.

119
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:03,723
Is it?

120
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,126
Then would Shin-woo be better?

121
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:08,994
He's more romantic and mature.

122
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,064
That's why I was pulling for him.

123
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:15,868
I shouldn't have given up.

124
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,349
It will taste different,

125
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,917
since it was made by yours truly.

126
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,588
How's your coffee different, honey?

127
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:42,628
If this is coffee that other people make,

128
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,296
the coffee I make is like...

129
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,841
Don't make it for other girls, okay?

130
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,851
Do you see these goosebumps? Just boil me
and eat me, that would be better.

131
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,486
Why? It's romantic.

132
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:08,721
I got goosebumps.

133
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:12,291
It's better than Sassy Tae-gyung!

134
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:15,995
That's why I was so flustered
when I heard she liked him.

135
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,466
Just imagine their future...

136
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:33,345
Ko Mi-nam,

137
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:35,981
I'll give you permission to marry me.

138
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:37,683
Consider it an honor.

139
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,552
Thank you.

140
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:44,623
Should I call you Darling? Or Honey?

141
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:47,660
I'll decide the endearments.

142
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,528
Don't interrupt.

143
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:54,600
Tae-gyung!

144
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,971
The wedding ceremony isn't over yet.
Tae-gyung!

145
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:00,506
I'm a busy man.

146
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:01,707
I'll decide the schedule.

147
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,743
Don't talk back to me.

148
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,079
This isn't a marriage!

149
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:08,814
I'm not doing this anymore.

150
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:10,115
Ko Mi-nam.

151
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:11,984
It's over. You're out.

152
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:18,891
Tae-gyung! I'm sorry! Take me with you!

153
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:23,095
Tae-gyung's a bit too full of himself,
it worries me.

154
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,665
Should I switch over
to Shin-woo and Jermy?

155
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,035
Why worry? They're getting along fine.

156
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:32,905
Worry about me,
who's here with you at this age.

157
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,112
I'm getting tipsier than I thought

158
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:42,715
on these cocktails.

159
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:45,951
More than you thought?

160
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:50,823
Then, here. Have another.

161
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,959
So, how about we...

162
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:01,300
Relax and enjoy our drinks?

163
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,416
The ocean is so beautiful.

164
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,818
This is my first time seeing the ocean.

165
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:21,487
Ko Mi-nam!

166
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:23,555
Is it really your first time?

167
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,126
I've seen pictures of it and on TV,

168
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,662
but I've never stood
in front of one before.

169
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:32,298
Want to borrow a yacht and go out to sea?

170
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:34,466
No, it's fine.

171
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,002
I'm fine just looking at it like this.

172
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:40,572
It's so large and wide...

173
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:45,411
I feel like just crossing
this ocean will let me go

174
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,413
far enough that no one can see me.

175
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,824
Ko Mi-nam!

176
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:03,395
The earth is round so no matter
how far you go, you'll come back

177
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,732
to where you started,
like a bus on a circular route.

178
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:10,936
I suppose you're right.

179
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:14,239
But it's so large,

180
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,676
it will take a long while.

181
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:25,951
Don't go.

182
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,522
Don't go by yourself.

183
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:33,625
I'm going to hold onto you from the back.

184
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,670
Don't hold onto me, Shin-woo.

185
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:51,810
It's my first time seeing the ocean,
I want to at least dip my feet in it.

186
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,839
Yes. The beach!

187
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,677
That's it.

188
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:27,346
There we go.

189
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,520
The song was great.

190
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:38,724
It's sophisticated but also doesn't lose
the flavor of the original song.

191
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:41,193
All Tae-gyung's brilliance, of course.

192
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,429
And it suits you better
than the original song.

193
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:46,265
Oh, I heard the original track
wasn't yours at first.

194
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:50,569
What?

195
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:52,905
Who said that?

196
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:56,575
Well, Jun,

197
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:02,581
Mr. Kim Jun said that this was originally
for another rookie singer--

198
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:03,849
Don't be ludicrous.

199
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:07,019
This song was made for me,
from the beginning.

200
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:15,627
I want to pay my gratitude for the song,

201
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:18,097
where's Hwang Tae-gyung?

202
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,598
USB CONNECTED

203
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,668
COPYING TO "MUSIC" FOLDER

204
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:42,754
Is she all right? She left in a hurry.

205
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:44,356
Ask her yourself.

206
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:47,826
I was very drunk that day.

207
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:52,030
If she didn't bring up her mom
and provoke me,

208
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,533
it wouldn't have turned out like that.

209
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,236
You know her mother?

210
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:05,277
Did you tell her who she was?

211
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:09,448
She wouldn't want to hear it from me.

212
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:11,850
And I don't want to talk about it either.

213
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,823
They can't find her.

214
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:20,859
She's not in this world anymore.

215
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:24,163
My mom's...

216
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,399
She's gone. I can't meet her.

217
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,201
Hold on.

218
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,504
Tell me about her.

219
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:36,241
If you don't want to,

220
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:38,911
at least tell me her name.

221
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:43,515
She said she didn't know anything.

222
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,151
She should at least know her mom's name.

223
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:59,231
Her name was Lee Su-jin.

224
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:03,936
Is this Ko Mi-nam's mother?

225
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,820
Oh, this is where Sister Maria is.

226
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:26,058
If I get on the right train
without getting lost, I should be able to

227
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:27,960
go see her even if I don't know Japanese.

228
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:36,969
I wonder how long I can stay

229
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,471
in Japan with this much money.

230
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:54,686
Shin-woo.

231
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:42,534
The glass walls let you see inside
from the outside.

232
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:46,738
You must have seen
how I was looking at you.

233
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:49,007
Yes.

234
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,076
I did.

235
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:57,849
And you must have seen what my face
was when I came in here.

236
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,752
Yes, the answer was written all over it.

237
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,722
"I'm sorry. I don't think I can."

238
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:05,757
So,

239
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:09,394
I want to ask you a difficult question
you didn't expect.

240
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:14,299
Mi-nam.

241
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,369
Do you know
from when you were a woman to me?

242
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:22,941
At the premiere.
That's when you found out.

243
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:27,879
Do you remember Kang Shin-woo
and Ko Mi-nyeo's clumsy love story?

244
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:30,749
Yes.

245
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,219
Where did we first meet?

246
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:40,359
When I was first introduced
as A.N.JELL's new member, on the roof...

247
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:44,763
Yes.

248
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:48,667
I met the real you there
for the first time.

249
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,439
Do you remember the story
about the clumsy woman?

250
00:22:57,509 --> 00:23:01,380
A member of the organization found out
about her secret and helped her out.

251
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:06,418
After I found out you were a girl,
I kept an eye on you,

252
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,020
trying to help you out when I could,

253
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:11,590
and ended up falling in love with you.

254
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,461
The woman I wanted to introduce to you,

255
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:18,764
the woman who I liked...

256
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:20,599
it was you.

257
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:35,347
Oh, Tae-gyung!

258
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:38,216
I thought you were coming tomorrow.

259
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:41,920
Ko Mi-nam wasn't at the room.
Where is she?

260
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:43,488
She's not?

261
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:45,657
Maybe she went for a walk or something.

262
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:47,993
This place is great. Okinawa's great.

263
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:01,406
The first thing he looks for is Mi-nam.

264
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:05,977
They must have fought
and now he wants to make up.

265
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:09,080
Shall I prepare an event for them?

266
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,271
I showed you everything today,

267
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:37,509
so no matter how hard you try
to not see it, it will be visible.

268
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:47,652
I won't take my eyes off of you,

269
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,521
as I have always done.

270
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:54,793
So don't hide where no one can see you.

271
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:56,795
Just look at me.

272
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:16,441
Shin-woo.

273
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,844
Let go of me, please.

274
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:37,696
Thank you for watching out for me...

275
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:41,366
and helping me.

276
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:46,037
It saddens me even more,

277
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:48,640
and hurts my heart knowing it...

278
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:52,644
but my answer is the same.

279
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:58,783
Don't hold onto me any longer.

280
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:03,722
I don't want to burden you any further.

281
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:23,141
She's left for the last time.

282
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:25,610
I have nothing else...

283
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:30,415
to hold onto.

284
00:27:58,743 --> 00:27:59,577
Mr. Ma.

285
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:02,947
I'll leave something for Ko Mi-nam
at the front desk. Get it for her, please?

286
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:04,683
It's something important to her.

287
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:06,551
Tae-gyung!

288
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:10,455
If it's that important,
just bring it over to me.

289
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:12,290
I have something pressing to discuss.

290
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:18,763
Where are you?

291
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:24,703
Mi-nam!

292
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:30,508
Tae-gyung's here.
You didn't see him yet, did you?

293
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,712
He's here?

294
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:36,181
He looked for you the moment he got here.

295
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:39,517
He looked for me?

296
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:41,553
Come on. He'll be waiting.

297
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:43,588
He's waiting? For me?

298
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:44,656
Where?

299
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:45,990
You'll know when you get there.

300
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:58,236
It's too dark in here.

301
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:12,784
Hoon-i?

302
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:28,199
Were you looking for me?

303
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:33,404
I was. I had something for you.

304
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:37,709
I was going to give it to Mr. Ma
but he just had to bring you here.

305
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:42,347
What is it you have to give me?

306
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:44,549
I'll take it and leave.

307
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,018
You seem busy.

308
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,654
What, is there someone waiting for you?

309
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:55,093
I know you don't want to see me,

310
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:57,762
so I'm trying
to disappear quickly for you.

311
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,698
You're so thoughtful.

312
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,270
If you're not busy and there
isn't anyone waiting for you,

313
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:07,038
take a look before you go.

314
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,507
There are a lot of fish here,
it's worth a look.

315
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:12,443
Pardon?

316
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:16,881
Nothing.

317
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:19,450
I'm sure you're busy. Just go.

318
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,319
Don't mind me.

319
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,292
Why are you still standing there?

320
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:32,497
You said you had something to give me.

321
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:41,673
Here.

322
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:53,384
Who is this?

323
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:56,888
Your mother.

324
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:00,959
What?

325
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,394
Your mother.

326
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:06,164
Ms. Lee Su-jin.

327
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:18,877
She's...

328
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:22,380
She's my mom?

329
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:31,956
My mom's name is...

330
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:36,661
Lee Su-jin...

331
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:33,284
Did you tell people that I stole
that song from Lee Su-jin?

332
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:37,455
I just remembered Jae-hyeon saying

333
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:41,459
that he made the song
for his lover, that's all.

334
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:45,630
Your memory must be going with your age.

335
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:48,666
Don't go around spewing garbage.

336
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:53,171
I have nothing if not a sharp memory.

337
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,073
Want me to tell you exactly what he said?

338
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:59,010
Jae-hyeon said he made the song
for his lover because you kept causing

339
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:01,312
misunderstandings between them.
It was to capture her heart!

340
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:03,581
But you bought out the song and stole it!

341
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:04,649
Shut up!

342
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,250
Freaking ridiculous.

343
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,063
The person he loved...

344
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:22,567
was me.

345
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:36,814
Did your mother tell you

346
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:41,119
about my mom?

347
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,256
I wouldn't have had to go
through all that trouble

348
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,125
if you just found out by yourself.

349
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:52,630
Well,

350
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:56,401
it must have been hard to ask,
since your parents

351
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:58,336
broke up because of my mother.

352
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,810
This all happened because your father

353
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:07,412
wrote a song like this.

354
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:18,423
You must have been curious about
how your father's song will turn out.

355
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:22,193
Here. Take a listen to it.

356
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:32,603
My mother almost became...

357
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:35,973
your stepmom because of that song.

358
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:43,181
Ask your could-have-been stepmom
all about your mom,

359
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:46,851
and have a fun time with her.

360
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:50,521
Don't be so crude.

361
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:54,792
Yes.

362
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:57,095
Because of this song,

363
00:34:58,029 --> 00:34:59,764
my mother was abandoned.

364
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:04,235
I know you were also abandoned,

365
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,571
and that the scar must run deep.

366
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,342
But my mother was also hurt deeply.

367
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:14,946
She left on her own,

368
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,548
and died alone while giving birth to us.

369
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:23,020
"Have a fun time"?

370
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,592
How can I, with your mother?

371
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,595
Are you that full of yourself

372
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:33,131
that you can't see anything
around you properly?

373
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:40,104
I apologize for not telling you
I knew about your mother.

374
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,440
You looked so heartbroken

375
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:45,243
that I couldn't bear to say that I knew.

376
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:49,780
I'm sorry I didn't say anything
even though I knew you were

377
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:52,016
working on my father's song.

378
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:55,620
I really didn't know
what the story was behind it.

379
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:03,161
You told me not to appear in front of you.

380
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:08,199
Well, it's hard for me to see you too.

381
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:11,435
So I'm going far away,
where we can't see each other.

382
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:14,772
No longer...

383
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:19,577
We don't have to see each other

384
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:21,712
and suffer anymore.

385
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:50,401
Hwang Tae-gyung!
You went back to Korea alone?

386
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:53,137
Our schedule's over. Bye.

387
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:03,748
Thank goodness you came back early.

388
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:07,752
I'm going to Bali for a photo shoot,
want to come with me?

389
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:11,789
Do you think I'll go with you?

390
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:16,560
If people really believe
that you're my boyfriend,

391
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,629
even when Ko Mi-nam's
true identity is revealed,

392
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,464
you won't get into a lot of trouble.

393
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:24,235
If people find out that you knew
she was a girl and covered for her,

394
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:26,137
the press will have a field day.

395
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:29,774
It's just in case
something problematic happens.

396
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:33,711
You threatened to make sure I'm involved
if anything problematic happens, remember?

397
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,713
I've barely been able to sleep since then.

398
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:38,883
The real Ko Mi-nam's coming back today.

399
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:41,886
He'll set everything right.
You've nothing to worry about.

400
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,721
While you're here,

401
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:45,790
let's end our fake relationship.

402
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:49,160
That's the first thing...

403
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:51,362
you have to say?

404
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:53,631
Once we end this,
you have no reason to be involved with us.

405
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,700
I'll make sure it doesn't get to you.

406
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,369
So you go your own way
and sleep however much you want.

407
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:03,541
We agreed that you can end this
however you want it to.

408
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:04,742
So I'll do anything you want.

409
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:07,645
Let me know what lie we'll be ending

410
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:09,180
this lie with.

411
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:12,483
Hwang Tae-gyung!

412
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:16,520
You know immediately
when I'm lying or faking something,

413
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:19,190
but why don't you know
my true feelings and actions?

414
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:24,428
You may not be embarrassed
when you get caught lying,

415
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:26,997
but you will be if your true emotions
are revealed.

416
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:31,836
Farewell, Yoo He-i.

417
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:39,677
You!

418
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:42,446
I'm going to dump you so badly.

419
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:45,383
You don't know how scary
my fans are, do you?

420
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:49,687
I'll make you a million anti-fans
who will write insults on your articles.

421
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:52,289
You airhead!

422
00:39:57,762 --> 00:39:59,263
I don't need anything else,

423
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:03,367
just certain proof that Ko Mi-nam
is a woman.

424
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:08,005
Let's put on a disguise so no one
knows who I am.

425
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:09,507
Man...

426
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:11,509
Is this too obvious?

427
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:14,111
I'll put on a hat but still...

428
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:22,620
Oh my, oh my freaking,
I can't believe this! What the frick!

429
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:25,022
Oh, man!

430
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,191
It's right here.

431
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:29,493
It's so pretty!

432
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:41,705
It was filled
with useless pictures, anyway.

433
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:43,674
If I can get just one picture,

434
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:44,975
how do I use this?

435
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:52,016
Man, why aren't they holding hands

436
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:53,751
or hugging or something?

437
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:57,021
Why are these young people so chill?

438
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:00,958
Damn...

439
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:05,629
They're all so bright and colorful!

440
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:09,500
They brighten you up
just by looking at them,

441
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:10,734
like you, Jermy!

442
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:12,636
Really?

443
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:16,140
I'm a delicate person just like glass,
so treat me carefully

444
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:18,576
and treasure me so I don't break, okay?

445
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:21,111
Of course. I'll treasure you
in my memories.

446
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:26,784
Can I take a picture of you,
as a treasure?

447
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:31,088
My modeling fee is pretty expensive.

448
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:33,757
All righty then.

449
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:35,292
Photographer Ko?

450
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:37,695
What expression do you want me to make?

451
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:40,498
A cute face?

452
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:43,367
A sexy face?

453
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:47,171
Or a truly wild look?

454
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,480
Hey. I didn't even pose yet.

455
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:00,417
You're the coolest just as yourself.

456
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:03,454
Since there's only one of this
in the world, I'll take it.

457
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:05,656
Sure.

458
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:08,058
Here, I'll take a picture of you too.
Let's go that way.

459
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:13,230
Jermy.

460
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:16,066
Thank you for always making me laugh.

461
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:21,272
Thank you so much for your best words.

462
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:27,077
I'll treasure this with a grateful heart.

463
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:47,364
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

464
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:57,207
Would you like to order
a cup of hot coffee?

465
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:01,779
Thank you for your order.
I'll bring it out shortly.

466
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:12,723
It's a cup of warm coffee
and a piece of soft cake.

467
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:23,167
You always comforted me warmly and softly.

468
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,004
I'm so sorry that I cannot

469
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:29,440
offer the same comfort to you.

470
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:30,975
It's fine.

471
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:32,810
You probably didn't know,

472
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,145
but I've been dumped by you
at least 100 times.

473
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,180
I can get over it.

474
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:38,315
Good thing I had lots of practice.

475
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:46,690
It's warm.

476
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:48,492
It's comforting.

477
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:50,861
That's wonderful to hear.

478
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:03,941
You looked so warm.

479
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:08,078
Since there's only one of this,
I'll keep it.

480
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:11,515
Let's eat it together.

481
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:13,717
I'll help you out, then.

482
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:29,867
It's so good!

483
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:55,592
Well, my favorite star is always
shining next to me right now.

484
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:12,843
Oh, Tae-gyung.

485
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:14,545
I'm heading over to the studio
with Hwa-ran.

486
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:15,446
You should come too.

487
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,480
No. I won't.

488
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:32,229
Aren't you going to the studio?

489
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:34,965
No.

490
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:35,999
Man.

491
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,602
Hwa-ran is seriously annoying me.

492
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:42,272
I got in so much trouble with Mr. Jun.

493
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,243
The one who told us about Ko Jae-hyeon?

494
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:47,411
Yes.

495
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:50,881
I guess Hwa-ran went to him
and threw one heck of a fit.

496
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:53,484
Why?

497
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:59,757
Because he said she stole this song.

498
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:02,192
Stole the song? What?

499
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:06,897
Hwa-ran apparently clung onto Ko Jae-hyeon
and begged him to take her back.

500
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:09,133
He had a girlfriend at the time.
So Hwa-ran bought the song

501
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:12,102
he made for her to break them up.

502
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:14,538
Hold on a second, please.

503
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:15,572
We'll begin soon.

504
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:33,056
"Come back to me, please.

505
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:36,393
Without you, I cannot go on."

506
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:40,097
He must have written this
after they broke up.

507
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:44,568
I thought you weren't coming.

508
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:53,477
This song isn't yours, is it?

509
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:56,113
He wasn't asking you
to come back to him, was he?

510
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:01,084
You stole this song, didn't you?

511
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,988
You stole it,
so she could never come back.

512
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:10,928
It was all a lie.

513
00:47:13,597 --> 00:47:15,232
He didn't love you.

514
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:17,768
Aren't I right?

515
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,944
I decided to stay here.

516
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:05,215
The real Mi-nam's waiting for us
at Incheon Airport.

517
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:06,850
We thought it would be best
for fake Mi-nam

518
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:09,019
to stay low while everything settles down.

519
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,755
She'll stay here for another week or so.

520
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:13,757
Will you be all right alone?

521
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:15,025
I'll be fine.

522
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:16,326
I'm going to have a fun time.

523
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:17,561
Should we stay too?

524
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:20,297
No, you guys go and help my brother.

525
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:23,300
Please take good care of him.

526
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,402
Then come back after a week, okay?
Just one week.

527
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:27,537
I'll protect your brother.

528
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:29,573
Let's go, guys.

529
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:32,776
Here.

530
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:35,612
Treat yourself to good food
while you're here.

531
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:39,249
Mr. Ma. Miss Wang.

532
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:41,752
Thank you so much.

533
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:44,621
No, it's nothing.
We'll see you soon anyway.

534
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:46,323
-Let's go.
-Stay safe!

535
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:49,826
You should go too.

536
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,431
I'll call you often.

537
00:48:55,198 --> 00:48:58,101
The shows we did,
Japanese TV channels air them often,

538
00:48:58,669 --> 00:48:59,903
so wait for us while watching them.

539
00:49:03,073 --> 00:49:03,907
Let's go.

540
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:22,292
Shin-woo. Jermy.

541
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:25,028
Goodbye.

542
00:49:40,877 --> 00:49:43,180
Did they all leave for the boarding gate?
I'm running out of time!

543
00:49:43,347 --> 00:49:46,083
I need to rush at them as soon
as I arrive at Incheon.

544
00:50:21,718 --> 00:50:23,387
I want to stay for a few days at Bali.

545
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:35,465
KO MI-NAM

546
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:54,785
Where's Ko Mi-nam?
Has he already gone ahead of them?

547
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:04,394
Hey, Mi-nam!

548
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:07,998
Yes, in front of the arrival gates, yes!
I'll see you there.

549
00:51:08,432 --> 00:51:09,633
All right, okay.

550
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:19,976
Wait. Isn't that Ko Mi-nam?

551
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:22,145
-I think so!
-Right?

552
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,581
-Ko Mi-nam from A.N.JELL!
-Yes.

553
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:39,262
Where the heck is the coffee shop?

554
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,500
-Hwang Tae-gyung!
-It's Hwang Tae-gyung!

555
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:45,735
-Tae-gyung?
-Hwang Tae-gyung!

556
00:51:45,802 --> 00:51:46,736
Hwang Tae-gyung?

557
00:51:46,803 --> 00:51:48,305
-Hwang Tae-gyung!
-It's Hwang Tae-gyung!

558
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,108
Did he come to go to Bali...

559
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:53,410
Wait.

560
00:51:53,743 --> 00:51:55,345
He said the real Ko Mi-nam
was arriving today.

561
00:51:57,581 --> 00:51:59,282
Then Mr. Kim will be here too.

562
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:01,651
Is everything blowing up today?

563
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,688
I should just get on the plane to Bali.

564
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:20,604
No.

565
00:52:21,071 --> 00:52:23,440
I have to see Hwang Tae-gyung for myself.

566
00:52:32,215 --> 00:52:34,284
Oh, there he is! Ko Mi-nam!

567
00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:35,218
Mi-nam!

568
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:37,187
Mi-nam!

569
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:43,260
There he is, Ko Mi-nam.

570
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:45,962
I'll get to the bottom of this!

571
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:06,583
Ko Mi-nam!

572
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,598
Ko Mi-nam. I know you're a woman.

573
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:37,547
It's not there...

574
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:41,585
Who are you?

575
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:44,020
You're not a girl.

576
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:48,191
Hey, hey!

577
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:51,962
Say hello, he's Mr. Kim from Nara Daily,
he's a reporter.

578
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:55,365
You know, the one who interviewed
your sister and Shin-woo!

579
00:53:56,032 --> 00:53:57,200
What are you doing here?

580
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,104
Mr. Kim.

581
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:12,916
Mr. Kim.

582
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,785
You asked me before
if Mi-nam was a girl, right?

583
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,393
How did you come up with that idea?

584
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:24,961
You're so funny.

585
00:54:25,629 --> 00:54:27,497
I almost believed it, myself.

586
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:29,532
Mi-nam. Isn't it so funny?

587
00:54:30,233 --> 00:54:31,668
Tae-gyung, you're flustered too.

588
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:43,413
It all made sense, you had to be a girl.
It all came together.

589
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:46,383
I followed you all the way from Japan...

590
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:51,388
You must have made a mistake
because Mi-nam and Mi-nyeo are twins!

591
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,556
You were confused!

592
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:55,625
You're so silly. What is this, a drama?

593
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:59,496
-Come on.
-There's no way my instinct was wrong!

594
00:55:02,198 --> 00:55:04,834
A.N.JELL is harboring a secret

595
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:06,036
and that secret is Ko Mi-nam!

596
00:55:06,102 --> 00:55:09,906
Any bad rumor about A.N.JELL will turn
the Korean Wave into a cold wave.

597
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:10,940
-Come on.
-Ko Mi-nam.

598
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,089
Hey. I'm Ko Mi-nam.

599
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,329
That face isn't bad seeing it in guy form.

600
00:55:37,133 --> 00:55:38,802
You really do look like her.

601
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:42,272
But his vibe's pretty different from hers.

602
00:55:46,976 --> 00:55:47,911
Where is she?

603
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:49,979
She stayed behind in Japan.

604
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:52,082
Stayed behind?

605
00:56:01,157 --> 00:56:02,759
I have to get to Tokyo first.

606
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,495
I got on a plane once before,
I can do it again.

607
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:14,304
Maybe I should have got in a cab.

608
00:56:15,505 --> 00:56:17,140
The bus stop's further than I thought.

609
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:21,010
Oh, it's a cab!

610
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:23,480
Excuse me!

611
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:56,379
I see.

612
00:56:58,047 --> 00:56:58,915
So this song...

613
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:03,319
was made by my dad for my mom.

614
00:57:07,023 --> 00:57:07,957
That's...

615
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:10,794
truly wonderful to know.

616
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:15,031
I'm so glad to hear that

617
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:17,434
my dad didn't abandon my mom.

618
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:22,739
I'm sorry.

619
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,141
It's...

620
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:28,912
It's all my mother's fault.

621
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:32,348
I'm so sorry.

622
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:37,420
You were also hurt, Tae-gyung.

623
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,723
You don't have to apologize.

624
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:43,660
Like you said,

625
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:46,529
I was so full of myself

626
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:50,934
that I didn't hear you
and didn't see your heart.

627
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,337
All I did was take out my anger on you.

628
00:57:57,373 --> 00:57:58,842
If I gave it a little more thought,

629
00:57:59,876 --> 00:58:01,911
it would have been clear to me
that you would be more hurt.

630
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:06,516
At least you realized it now.

631
00:58:08,952 --> 00:58:11,087
But I am hurting so much right now,

632
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:15,291
that I can't tell you I'm all right.

633
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:18,695
To be honest...

634
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:24,067
I really dislike your mother.

635
00:58:28,204 --> 00:58:29,172
I have a favor to ask.

636
00:58:31,808 --> 00:58:32,642
Please.

637
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,579
Don't let your mother
sing this song again.

638
00:58:37,947 --> 00:58:39,215
This is my mom's song.

639
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:43,052
I don't want it to be taken away again.

640
00:58:47,056 --> 00:58:48,057
I'll give it back to you.

641
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:50,326
I promise.

642
00:58:51,961 --> 00:58:55,064
Thank you for your promise.

643
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:00,937
I'm so glad that I got to say
my last farewells...

644
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:03,706
to you in person.

645
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:08,811
Tae-gyung.

646
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:13,316
Goodbye.

647
00:59:41,377 --> 00:59:43,112
I don't know when,
but one day, way in the future,

648
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,015
when I am in less pain...

649
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:50,753
I'll let you know that I'm all right.

650
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:55,892
So you won't have to feel
sorry for me any longer.

651
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:27,684
HWANG TAE-GYUNG YOO HE-I BREAK UP

652
01:01:28,151 --> 01:01:31,487
-Sixth Album is a success!
-A success!

653
01:01:31,554 --> 01:01:34,891
-A success!
-A success!

654
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:39,696
-A success!
-A success!

655
01:01:40,596 --> 01:01:44,000
I'm falling so hard for Mi-nam recently.

656
01:01:45,568 --> 01:01:47,737
He's got so much charisma.

657
01:01:48,237 --> 01:01:51,140
And he's sweet and kind,
just like Shin-woo.

658
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:54,444
And he's just as funny
and good with words as Jermy.

659
01:01:54,744 --> 01:01:56,913
-Mi-nam's the best!
-Mi-nam's the best!

660
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:02,485
The kids are never home these days.

661
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:04,921
There's no joy in cooking
these meals anymore.

662
01:02:05,455 --> 01:02:08,191
When album promotions start,
they're so busy they can barely sleep.

663
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:09,992
Their schedules are jam-packed.

664
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:12,528
It's a whole new world
from when Mi-nam used to be here.

665
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:15,865
Oh, you mean when Mi-nyeo was here?

666
01:02:16,532 --> 01:02:18,367
Back then,

667
01:02:18,534 --> 01:02:22,939
they were all home all the time.
It was so nice.

668
01:02:23,506 --> 01:02:27,143
The whelk always threw parties,

669
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:30,379
Shin-woo would make me tea,

670
01:02:30,613 --> 01:02:33,616
and Leader would whine
and it was the cutest thing!

671
01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:41,290
By the way, how is Mi-nyeo doing?
Mi-nam knows where she is, right?

672
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:44,026
I'm sure he does.

673
01:02:44,227 --> 01:02:47,630
But I guess Mi-nyeo told him
not to tell anyone

674
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:49,732
because he won't tell me anything.

675
01:02:51,701 --> 01:02:53,536
She went through so much for him,

676
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:55,605
it's only right he listens to her.

677
01:02:56,706 --> 01:03:00,109
I still want to see her, though.
I didn't even give her a proper goodbye.

678
01:03:01,244 --> 01:03:04,213
I can barely eat when I think about it.

679
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:09,118
-Are they on TV today?
-Of course.

680
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:10,386
Which show?

681
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:17,126
Ko Mi-nam took my motorcycle again.

682
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:19,796
He seems to be seeing He-i recently.

683
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:22,198
What if he takes her for a ride?

684
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:30,072
Man! They're holding
a popularity vote at our fan cafe

685
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:31,674
and Ko Mi-nam's first place!

686
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:35,111
I should reply with some funny comments

687
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:36,946
and boost my score.

688
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:41,150
This is a funny ID.

689
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:43,119
"Pig Rabbit"?

690
01:03:45,354 --> 01:03:47,557
The title's "I'm all right"?

691
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:50,726
It's a video.

692
01:03:52,461 --> 01:03:53,329
Let me see.

693
01:03:58,701 --> 01:04:00,469
I'm quite all right now.

694
01:04:02,038 --> 01:04:05,308
You still shine so brightly.

695
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:10,146
I'll always watch you, from afar.

696
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:16,052
For every step I let you go

697
01:04:16,419 --> 01:04:21,023
I can't help but cry

698
01:04:21,724 --> 01:04:26,529
For every step you take away from me,

699
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:30,199
My tears begin to fall

700
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:32,401
-It's that song.
-I reach out

701
01:04:32,468 --> 01:04:33,936
-What's wrong with you?
-For you

702
01:04:34,437 --> 01:04:36,372
-It's her.
-I reach out my hand

703
01:04:36,973 --> 01:04:42,111
-She's the one singing.
-But you grow farther and farther away

704
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:47,950
To a place I can't reach, but all I can do

705
01:04:48,017 --> 01:04:52,622
Is cry, watching you leave

706
01:04:55,524 --> 01:05:00,129
What do I do? What do I do?

707
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:05,268
You're walking away

708
01:05:05,334 --> 01:05:10,539
What do I do? What do I do?

709
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:15,678
You're walking away, leaving me here

710
01:05:15,778 --> 01:05:20,850
I love you, I love you

711
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:25,955
I cry out as loudly as I can

712
01:05:26,989 --> 01:05:31,527
But you can't hear me

713
01:05:31,894 --> 01:05:35,131
For it's only

714
01:05:35,197 --> 01:05:39,502
Within my heart

715
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:43,139
That video was uploaded just now.
Where is that?

716
01:05:43,205 --> 01:05:47,443
Isn't it one of those karaokes
that let you directly upload them online?

717
01:05:47,576 --> 01:05:48,778
They have been opening recently.

718
01:05:52,148 --> 01:05:54,116
I looked up that karaoke machine
you told me about.

719
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:55,885
There's only one in Hongdae.

720
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:08,197
I'm all right.

721
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:15,371
It's been 20 minutes already.
Would she already be there?

722
01:06:15,438 --> 01:06:16,272
We should still look.

723
01:06:16,339 --> 01:06:18,140
Why won't Tae-gyung even try
to look for her?

724
01:06:24,347 --> 01:06:27,016
I waited for you to come tell me
you're all right,

725
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:29,652
and this is how you decide to tell me?

726
01:06:30,753 --> 01:06:31,887
This is it?

727
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:35,391
So you plan on staying
where I can't see you?

728
01:06:37,259 --> 01:06:38,694
You don't want to ever cross paths again?

729
01:06:39,028 --> 01:06:41,130
Fine. I don't have to see you.

730
01:06:44,734 --> 01:06:45,668
I don't have to see her.

731
01:06:46,569 --> 01:06:48,504
I don't have to see her.
I don't have to...

732
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:51,774
I have to.

733
01:06:53,409 --> 01:06:54,377
I have to see her.

734
01:07:02,451 --> 01:07:03,452
Tae-gyung!

735
01:07:14,563 --> 01:07:16,165
-Shin-woo!
-Shin-woo!

736
01:07:47,363 --> 01:07:50,433
-Tae-gyung! Can I get a picture?
-Tae-gyung!

737
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:54,637
