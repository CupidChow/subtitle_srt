1
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,225
-Tae-gyung!
-Tae-gyung!

2
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:31,731
Tae-gyung!

3
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:43,243
Oh, stars.

4
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:03,496
Can I get your autograph?

5
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,267
Could you sign this?

6
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:45,972
Did you just leave without a word?

7
00:01:57,817 --> 00:01:59,919
It will only cause him trouble
if I act like I know him.

8
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:04,157
Sister.

9
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,426
Mr. Ma.

10
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:12,198
You saw me, said hi and bolted?

11
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:19,405
Tae-gyung!

12
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,941
Where's Ko Mi-nam?

13
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:25,145
Mi-nam? Didn't you go back together
after shooting the show?

14
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:27,580
He came back alone.

15
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:29,782
Where is he?

16
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,417
These freaking sons of a...

17
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:34,521
Mi-nam's with Hoon-i, right? Call him.

18
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,791
Mi-nam?

19
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:45,999
Your brother's

20
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:48,501
actually on his way down to Jinju

21
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:50,470
for an university festival.

22
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,206
I didn't know he was so busy.

23
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:57,644
He sure is. He's doing all sorts
of activities and promotions, for me.

24
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:01,581
Could I see him once before I leave?

25
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,416
Of course. Of course you should see him!

26
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,787
I heard you're leaving for Africa.

27
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:09,656
Yes.

28
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:13,626
A Sister who I was close to
is currently volunteering there,

29
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,428
so I decided to go help her.

30
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:16,896
I see.

31
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:19,432
Then are you leaving

32
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,235
without meeting the guys?

33
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,405
Don't you want to see

34
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,275
Shin-woo and Jermy and Tae-gyung?

35
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,012
I'm always watching them from afar.

36
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,815
I can see them on TV

37
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:40,386
and keep up with their news
in the paper and online.

38
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,591
Oh, you still kept up with them. I see.

39
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:48,228
Tae-gyung, that jerk, never asked me
about you once!

40
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:50,463
He and Mi-nam don't even speak

41
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,298
to each other at the dorm.

42
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:54,500
They completely ignore each other.

43
00:03:56,502 --> 00:04:00,206
Did something happen between you
and Tae-gyung at Okinawa?

44
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,912
When does Mi-nam get back from Jinju?

45
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:10,016
He has to stay until the night
festivities end,

46
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,017
so probably late at night.

47
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,019
Next morning, at the latest.

48
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:17,957
Yes.

49
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:23,329
What? Mr. An's looking for Mi-nam?

50
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,033
Really? No, no way.

51
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,636
Yes! He said bring him this instant!

52
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,773
If he finds out you've been booking
extra activities for Mi-nam on the side,

53
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:35,942
you're done for!

54
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,077
But he's probably at Jinju by now!

55
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,346
We've already received the payment,
we can't cancel!

56
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,787
Did you send Mi-nam to Jinju?

57
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:50,223
What?

58
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,859
Remember Mr. Choi, who used to work here?

59
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:54,394
He says he saw Mi-nam at Jinju.

60
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,865
Does he have something there
that I don't know about?

61
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:00,900
Of course not!

62
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:05,071
Then get Mi-nam in front of me
in 30 minutes.

63
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,072
Right now.

64
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,777
Hoon-i, you heard that, right?

65
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,546
Bring Mi-nam over right now, okay?

66
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,481
Right now!

67
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,489
How do I get Mi-nam over there?

68
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,727
Did something happen to Mi-nam?

69
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:40,573
Sister.

70
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,109
Can you save me? Please?

71
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:46,546
What are you doing?

72
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,349
Just for a bit.

73
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:51,484
Just for a tiny bit.

74
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:54,554
Can you be Mi-nam?

75
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:56,656
What?

76
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,026
Sister, please! I'm begging you.

77
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,961
I can't. He'll notice immediately!

78
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,030
You just have to see Mr. An once!
That's it!

79
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:07,100
You just have to say that you were
in Seoul and that you never went to Jinju!

80
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,801
That you haven't had extra schedules!

81
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:09,836
I can't!

82
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,805
Do you know why Mi-nam went
all the way to Jinju?

83
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,176
It was for me! Because I...

84
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,079
I'm becoming a dad soon.

85
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:22,682
What?

86
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,085
Before my baby's born,

87
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,055
Mi-nam said he'll take on extra schedules,
so I can afford

88
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:30,390
an apartment for my new family.

89
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:31,724
But if anyone else finds out,

90
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,360
I'll be fired and the baby's mom also...

91
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:37,897
Who's the baby's mother?

92
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,232
Miss Wang!

93
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:41,567
At Okinawa, we...

94
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:46,506
You're having a baby with Miss Wang?

95
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:50,309
Our baby's fate rests
in your hands, Sister.

96
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,078
Sister.

97
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:56,315
Please, just once.

98
00:06:58,751 --> 00:06:59,886
Help me out!

99
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:10,062
Maybe she didn't see me.

100
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:12,298
No.

101
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:14,500
She even bowed to me before she left.

102
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:16,169
There's no way she didn't see me.

103
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,372
She just ignored me, that's what it is.

104
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:22,775
Pig Rabbit.

105
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,777
Why did you do that?

106
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:35,354
I have decided to become a nun.

107
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:38,157
I'll pray for you, Tae-gyung.

108
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:49,268
No way.

109
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:52,071
She said so herself,
she gave up that path.

110
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,542
It's not something you can
pick back up again easily anyway.

111
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,782
I've decided to become the future
Mrs. Pharmacist.

112
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:06,519
I'll send along iron supplements
and vitamins for you.

113
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:14,427
No.

114
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,364
Kim Dong-jun said he'll go see her
after his military service is over.

115
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:21,367
There's no way
they would have met already.

116
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:29,141
-Emperor Tae-gyung, Hwang Tae-gyung!
-Emperor Tae-gyung, Hwang Tae-gyung!

117
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,744
-Emperor Tae-gyung, Hwang Tae-gyung!
-Emperor Tae-gyung, Hwang Tae-gyung!

118
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:34,347
-Emperor Tae-gyung, Hwang Tae-gyung!
-Emperor Tae-gyung, Hwang Tae-gyung!

119
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:38,484
I have decided to become a normal fan.

120
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:41,888
I'll send you a letter as a fan.

121
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:46,292
-Emperor Tae-gyung, Hwang Tae-gyung!
-Emperor Tae-gyung, Hwang Tae-gyung!

122
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,129
If she's a fan, shouldn't she have asked
for an autograph?

123
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:55,801
Is she not even a fan anymore?

124
00:08:58,437 --> 00:08:59,805
Did she completely dump me and move on?

125
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,078
Oh, you were in Seoul.

126
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,516
What the heck did Mr. Choi see in Jinju?

127
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:12,885
Hoon-i.

128
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,487
Sorry...

129
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,057
-Keep it up, Ko Mi-nam!
-Yes sir!

130
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,859
Jackpot!

131
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,027
Jackpot!

132
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,462
Thank goodness.

133
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,499
I can't believe I'm seeing you
like this again.

134
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,270
This son of a gun got you involved again!

135
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,439
Didn't you? You jerk!

136
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,375
Don't do that! You have to be careful!

137
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,411
Think of the baby!

138
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,147
Baby?

139
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:45,785
Baby, you did well for your daddy.

140
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:48,187
Congratulations!

141
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:51,357
Now, come with me.

142
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:54,260
Ko Mi-nam! I will get answers
from you today.

143
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,395
Where the heck is your sister?

144
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,932
-You're running away again?
-Whoa.

145
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,602
Jermy always asked about you
to your brother.

146
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:05,871
He even let Mi-nam borrow his motorcycle
just to find out where you were.

147
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,107
I'm sorry, Jermy.

148
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,075
Ko Mi-nam.

149
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:11,577
I need to talk to you.

150
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,379
Mi-nam has to go somewhere urgently.

151
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:14,313
Go on.

152
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:18,117
Shin-woo. I need to talk to you.

153
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,452
Let me talk to him first.

154
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,687
I need to talk to you about your style!

155
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,589
So for the...

156
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,893
I'm sorry, Shin-woo.

157
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,371
I don't want to admit it,
but I've been dumped.

158
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,774
I believed that she would come back
after she became better,

159
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,909
but that was my delusion.

160
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,647
Pig Rabbit seemed just fine.

161
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,449
I was the one obsessing and being clingy.

162
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,721
Before I become even more of a joke,

163
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,958
I have to tell her I'm all right.

164
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,871
Reverend Mother.

165
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,641
I need to leave him, as a star
far, far away from me,

166
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:20,079
but why is he shining so brightly
right in front of my eyes?

167
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:29,855
Ko Mi-nam?

168
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:38,998
Tell your sister that
I did receive her message well,

169
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,067
telling me that she's all right.

170
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:45,037
It would have been uncomfortable
if she had told me in person,

171
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,940
but she ended everything very cleanly.

172
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:49,542
So tell her thank you very much.

173
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:55,448
And I saw her briefly this afternoon

174
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:57,717
but I couldn't say hello
because of the fans.

175
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:02,221
Make sure you tell her that I'm doing well
and I'm perfectly all right.

176
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:18,137
Thank goodness you're doing well.

177
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:25,244
I will also do better and be well now.

178
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:40,826
I'll go now.

179
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:41,894
Sister.

180
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,530
Are you really not going to see
Tae-gyung before you go?

181
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,065
You're going to Africa!

182
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:48,367
It will be bye-bye forever!

183
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,204
He'll be all right, I know it.

184
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:56,976
I think it would be best for me
not to see them before I leave.

185
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,278
But they won't be
on any African TV channels.

186
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:03,682
But I'll see plenty of stars there.

187
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:04,917
What?

188
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:08,521
Sure. I'll drive you back.

189
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:10,923
-Oh, it's fine.
-No, no. Let me drive...

190
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,092
Ko Mi-nam. Ouch.

191
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:16,695
I arranged that meeting
you asked me for today.

192
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:19,665
-What?
-What meeting?

193
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,101
It's all on you now. Let's go.

194
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,969
-Where are you going?
-Come on!

195
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:26,205
The baby!

196
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:35,614
She seemed a bit excited
when I said I'll bring you.

197
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,116
I think all the time you doted on her

198
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:40,419
after she broke up with Tae-gyung
is finally paying off.

199
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,721
Love is best when you act upon it.

200
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,858
The love Mi-nam acted upon?

201
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,561
He-i!

202
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:51,897
Hope you weren't waiting too long!

203
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,132
I just got here too.

204
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,769
You look like a proper princess today.

205
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,838
Your help is so priceless to us.

206
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:01,574
The person my brother doted on
was Yoo He-i?

207
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:06,145
I mean, he did show some interest...

208
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:09,048
What if she recognizes me?

209
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,285
I feel bad for Mi-nam but...

210
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:16,055
don't say a word to Yoo He-i.

211
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,457
Don't look at her,

212
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:20,226
don't give her a moment of your time.

213
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,564
Thank you.

214
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:33,772
Ko Mi-nam.

215
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:35,541
Are you serious?

216
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,177
Wasn't following me around enough?

217
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,812
You even brought Mr. An into this?

218
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,349
He-i.

219
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:44,316
What?

220
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,319
You like me? You love me?

221
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:49,688
I told you, you're not my type.

222
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,558
So, I--

223
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,493
I saw the concert tickets you sent to me.

224
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:59,198
What, are you going to really
confess to me at your concert?

225
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,066
You're so childish, seriously.

226
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:04,470
Front-row seats? Really?

227
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,043
I'll go to your concert,

228
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,145
but don't you dare do anything.

229
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:18,317
Does Hwang Tae-gyung even know
that you've been chasing after me?

230
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,720
Does he not care?

231
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:29,461
Anyway. So you didn't tell Hwang Tae-gyung
anything about your sister, right?

232
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,165
If you let her meet with him again,

233
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,367
I'm not going to see you ever again.

234
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:36,735
Got it?

235
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,188
Would she have heard my message?

236
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:00,592
When she does, she'll assume I'm over her

237
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:03,595
and not think about seeing me again.

238
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:05,965
What do I do now?

239
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:12,171
Mr. An,

240
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,773
we should give them some space.

241
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:16,909
No...

242
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,112
I promised Mi-nam my support,
I can't just leave.

243
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,548
We have to support him now!

244
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,783
I called Shin-woo and Jermy too,

245
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,553
so you help Mi-nam out too, Hoon-i.

246
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,555
I have to go. Nature calls me.

247
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,057
Wait. They're, they're coming here?

248
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:39,631
Now it's you, Hwang Tae-gyung?

249
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:42,468
Mr. Ma. Where's Ko Mi-nam?

250
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,351
Drink.

251
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:04,656
Isn't this hard liquor?

252
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:07,760
I might black out if I drink this.

253
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:09,161
That's why!

254
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:12,331
This situation is going to take a turn
that you can't handle when you're sober,

255
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,033
so just down this and faint.

256
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:16,068
I'll take care of everything after that.

257
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,037
-Go on.
-But...

258
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,106
Come on! Mr. An's going to suggest

259
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,709
going to the sauna after this,

260
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:24,877
what will you do then?

261
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,078
Sauna!

262
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:29,148
Just drink this and black out.

263
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,785
I'll take care of everything.
Go on, drink. Mi-nam will be here soon.

264
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,688
Come on. Drink!

265
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,091
Chug! Down it!

266
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,463
They'll figure it out when you're sober,

267
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,698
so you have to get wasted.

268
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:48,167
That's the only way.

269
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,688
-Ko Mi-nam!
-Oh, you're here.

270
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,057
Ko Mi-nam! Ouch! What the!

271
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,293
-Ko Mi-nam, wake up!
-Whoa, Mi-nam's drunk.

272
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:17,529
-He's drunk. There, there.
-He, I...

273
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,332
I was going to get answers from him today.

274
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:23,235
-Hey! Get up!
-There, there, Jermy. Behave. Okay?

275
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:24,703
He's drunk.

276
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:29,441
-Is Mi-nam drunk?
-Yes, he's totally wasted.

277
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:33,045
He usually holds his liquor,
he's a heavy drinker. What's going on?

278
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:36,648
He must have been nervous
with you here, He-i.

279
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:40,552
I think I upset him with what I said
and he drank too much.

280
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,889
Maybe I should have told him to do
what he wants at the concert...

281
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,692
Tae-gyung.

282
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,868
What? What's wrong with him?

283
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,402
He's really drunk.

284
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,608
Mi-nam, are you okay?

285
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,749
Mi-nam? Are you all right?

286
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,784
Mi-nam, wake up!

287
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:19,791
Are you okay, Mi-nam? Wake up!

288
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:23,128
Are you okay?

289
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,330
Let's leave him until he wakes up

290
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:26,798
and have a drink.

291
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:28,901
It's been a while since we got together.

292
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:34,106
You've all been busy doing
your own things recently,

293
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,410
so how about a drink together?

294
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:42,915
Yes, take a seat. Have a seat.

295
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,490
If you just stay asleep,
I'll take you home safely.

296
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,231
The concert prep is perfect!

297
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:01,133
The tickets are all sold out, Jermy!

298
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,501
-Sold out?
-Yes!

299
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:05,270
We've hit the peak with the Oricon Chart,

300
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,473
so the next target is Billboard!

301
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:11,476
Cheers! You too, He-i.

302
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:15,214
-Wow! Billboard!
-Billboard!

303
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:18,884
He-i, I heard this
was really good for women.

304
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,720
-No, I'm all right.
-What's that? Parsley?

305
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:22,955
Try it.

306
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:24,256
Leave it, kid.

307
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,724
When did he get so wasted?

308
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,093
A little while ago?

309
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:32,831
Did you see him calling his sister,
by any chance?

310
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:35,701
I don't know. Why?

311
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:37,903
Just because.

312
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,505
Did he ever say
that he mentioned me to his sister?

313
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:47,412
You never asked about her once.
You were never interested. Why?

314
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:52,517
How could we rank on the Billboard charts?
Have you thought about it?

315
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:55,287
-Push through with our original style.
-No, we have to go pop.

316
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:59,391
-Pop!
-With lots of English lyrics, Shin-woo...

317
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,427
Hey, Mi-nam. Yes, Mi-nyeo's here.

318
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:04,596
I think you need to get in here soon.

319
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,298
Yes, okay.

320
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,602
Let's kill it at the concert!

321
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,537
He-i, you're coming, right?

322
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:15,440
Of course. I'll be cheering for Mi-nam.

323
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,768
Once this concert's over,
we'll start the Asia tour.

324
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:20,572
At the Tokyo Dome. Think of the cheers!

325
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:23,575
A.N.JELL! Jackpot!

326
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:25,410
-Jackpot!
-Jackpot!

327
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,045
It will be amazing! Cheers!

328
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:33,719
-Tokyo Dome holds 30,000.
-Wasn't it 60,000?

329
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:35,821
Ko Mi-nam's out like a light.

330
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:37,956
I'm heading home,
so I'll take him with me.

331
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,193
Sure.

332
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,768
My head hurts.

333
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:58,677
He-i! Want to eat this?

334
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,812
Yes, right.

335
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,649
I'll take your sister home
and you can take her place.

336
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,619
All right then. Yes. See you soon.

337
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:10,856
Okay.

338
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:13,725
Jermy, stop eating that.

339
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:15,827
He-i said she'll eat it
if you down this in one shot.

340
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:16,928
In one shot?

341
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:18,330
Where's Mi-nam?

342
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,968
Tae-gyung took her.

343
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:25,270
Tae-gyung?

344
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:27,773
I think he figured it out.

345
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,309
Mr. An hasn't noticed yet,
so it will be fine.

346
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,713
Oh, yes? Thank goodness.

347
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,151
You knew it too?

348
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:49,528
It wasn't intentional,
but if Tae-gyung took her,

349
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:52,230
they might work things out.

350
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:56,435
Wow, now this is
an unexpected turn of events.

351
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:19,257
Mr. Ma?

352
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:22,561
Where are we?

353
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:27,699
Mr. Ma?

354
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:31,036
Ko Mi-nam.

355
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,971
Do I look like Mr. Ma to you?

356
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:39,277
Tae-gyung?

357
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:47,118
You were pretty drunk,
so I brought you home.

358
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:51,056
What do I do?
Why is Tae-gyung in front of me?

359
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:55,327
Mr. Ma was supposed to drive me
back after I blacked out.

360
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:56,895
Where am I?

361
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:01,933
Why are you looking around like that?

362
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,834
We're home.

363
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:11,243
Let go of me. Please let go of me!

364
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:25,390
Ko Mi-nam.

365
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,792
I'm not holding you,
nor have I ever held onto you.

366
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,661
You must be really drunk.

367
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,840
I have caught a drunk pig rabbit
pretending to be Ko Mi-nam.

368
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:49,447
I should just come clean and leave.

369
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:51,883
Oh, my stomach hurts.

370
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,252
It would be too embarrassing
to say who I am

371
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:55,854
and then go to the bathroom.

372
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:59,190
I should tell him after I go.

373
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:08,133
Look at her running in,
like she still lives here.

374
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:16,207
She's not fazed at all.

375
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:18,810
But it's Pig Rabbit...

376
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:25,083
That feels much better.

377
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,526
Tae-gyung.

378
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:38,163
Oh, I'm thirsty.

379
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:48,039
I'm so thirsty. I should get
a glass of water before I reveal who I am.

380
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:10,261
Oh no. I came in this far. All I wanted
to do was use the bathroom

381
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:11,930
and get a glass of water.

382
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:14,432
Do I need to reveal who I am now?

383
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:16,968
Ko Mi-nam.

384
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,438
If you're not planning
on going in to the fridge,

385
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:21,840
close the door, will you?

386
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:27,779
Oh, it's cool.

387
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:43,261
You need to get sobered up first.

388
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:44,562
Sit down.

389
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:12,957
You coming around now?

390
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:15,593
Ko Mi-nam.

391
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:17,462
What is this?

392
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:22,801
Five.

393
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:25,904
The answer is palm.

394
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,178
Here, drink this.
Your stomach must be in an uproar.

395
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:40,351
You recognized me?

396
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:45,657
You don't have a scar
on the back of your hand Mi-nam has.

397
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:48,460
Your feet are much smaller
than that of Ko Mi-nam's.

398
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:51,796
I know much more about you
than those details

399
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,032
and you thought I wouldn't know
who you were?

400
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:58,103
I'm sorry.

401
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,540
Have you ever played
a stand-in like today?

402
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:08,246
This is my first time
after I ended the last stint.

403
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:10,415
Yes?

404
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,285
Then how long were you Ko Mi-nam today?

405
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:19,190
Was it you on the roof?

406
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,394
Yes.

407
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:26,531
I heard for myself the words you wanted

408
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:30,001
to be relayed to me.

409
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,105
Right.

410
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:35,573
So...

411
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:38,943
I'm so happy to hear
that you're doing well.

412
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:42,614
I thought you might still
feel sorry for me.

413
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:47,018
So I sang my mom's song,
the one that you made...

414
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:52,323
We could've ended it cleanly without

415
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:55,293
meeting each other awkwardly in person...

416
00:29:56,561 --> 00:30:00,064
but I annoyed you again
with my clumsiness.

417
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:09,507
I said I'll never see you again...

418
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:17,182
Then when you turned away
from me this afternoon,

419
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:20,285
you were determined to never see me again?

420
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,690
I said I couldn't, I couldn't see you...

421
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,030
You naturally attract people's eyes.

422
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:35,333
But when I'm looking at you...

423
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:38,636
it hurts.

424
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:40,672
It hurts me.

425
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,444
I spent my whole life at a convent,

426
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:50,081
I wasn't prepared
for the electric shocks I got

427
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:52,650
when I fell upside down...

428
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:57,755
into this starry world.

429
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,658
I hit the floor headfirst.

430
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:05,997
There were fireworks going off
all over in my head

431
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:10,802
and then in a split second,
thunderstorms and rainstorms

432
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:13,404
flooded through me.

433
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:18,343
Once I left the world of stars,

434
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:21,045
I saw a way out. A way to live.

435
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:27,886
That's when I knew that
I should just watch the stars from afar.

436
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:33,258
The brightest star...

437
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,261
When you see it up close,

438
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:40,565
it's so blindingly bright
that it hurts me.

439
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:44,669
So...

440
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:47,572
I'm going to go far, far away.

441
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:05,623
So you're not doing well.

442
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:08,593
You're hurt and in pain?

443
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,872
Then I can't hold onto you.

444
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:28,379
I wanted to see you clearly...

445
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:31,249
when you came back.

446
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:35,753
So I was doing all I could
to see in the dark.

447
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:40,358
I ate carrots every day,
even though I hate them.

448
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:42,493
I even ate spinach.

449
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:47,932
Just in case I lose you because it's dark.

450
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:51,469
Because I didn't want to lose you.

451
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:58,209
But I can see you so clearly right now...

452
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:01,646
and I can't reach out and hold you.

453
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:24,602
Take her home.

454
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:29,474
If you send her away like this,
you might never see her again.

455
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:34,312
She's going to help
a nun she knows in Africa!

456
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:36,981
Are you just going to send her away?

457
00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,670
Joongsan Cathedral.

458
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:01,606
Joongsan Cathedral.

459
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,908
That idiot.

460
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:09,047
You will be taking the Gangbyeon
Expressway to your destination.

461
00:34:30,868 --> 00:34:33,404
Mi-nyeo. Here.

462
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:35,673
You should at least see your brother's
first concert.

463
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,645
It's on the day of my flight.

464
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,915
I'm not sure if I can make it.

465
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:46,451
I just...

466
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,622
Were you staying at this cathedral
this whole time?

467
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:56,027
Yes. I was working at the orphanage there.

468
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:58,763
Mr. Ma.

469
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:03,101
Thank you for everything.

470
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,259
I have decided to move on,

471
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:30,561
so you can't stay in my room anymore.

472
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:32,063
You're out.

473
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:49,747
That tickles!

474
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:36,694
Did you have fun? Are you feeling happy?

475
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:46,404
Thank you for liking me.

476
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,888
The one and only Pig Rabbit

477
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:07,391
that appeared in front of me

478
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:09,760
has now become extinct.

479
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:37,388
I only found one star yesterday.

480
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:44,829
Ms. Gemma!

481
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,897
Are you looking for stars again?

482
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:50,034
I found these stars,

483
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:51,869
so I can give them to you, Ms. Gemma.

484
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:00,745
Thank you.

485
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:04,081
Keep looking for stars
even after I'm gone, okay?

486
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:08,286
Ms. Gemma, there's a star
in the sky even though it's daytime!

487
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:11,956
That's not a star, but the moon.

488
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:13,391
The moon isn't a star.

489
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:15,326
There are no stars in the day, right?

490
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:21,399
During the day, there's a star
that's the brightest of them all.

491
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:24,935
The star called
the sun is always shining brightly.

492
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:38,949
Oh, wow. Stars, bling!

493
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:40,618
All these stars in the sky and on stage!

494
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:44,322
Our stars are going to kill it today,
it will be a sight to see!

495
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:45,990
Jackpot!

496
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:48,959
My goodness, Mi-nyeo.

497
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:51,595
You should have called me earlier!
How are you?

498
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:53,364
I'm doing well.

499
00:38:54,999 --> 00:39:01,739
I'm so happy that I get to see
Mi-nam's concert with you!

500
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:03,741
Aunt Mi-ja,

501
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:08,312
I don't know if I could stay
for the whole concert.

502
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,949
I probably have to leave
after saying hello to Mi-nam.

503
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:14,919
You can't stay?

504
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:20,191
There's a long line of people
who are dying to see you, though!

505
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,428
The whelk and Shin-woo both

506
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:27,765
always asked for you and missed you a lot!

507
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:29,734
You should at least see them.

508
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:32,036
Is that right?

509
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,204
Yes!

510
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:37,908
Oh, and there's another person
who wants to see you...

511
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:43,347
But I'm just not sure
if I should recommend

512
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:47,385
you see this person or not.

513
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:51,522
So...

514
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:57,027
Mo Hwa-ran wants to see you.

515
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,989
Thank you for reaching out to me.

516
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:32,196
Have a seat.

517
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:48,479
I wanted to give this to you.

518
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:55,286
LEE SU-JIN

519
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,521
This is...

520
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:00,458
Lee Su-jin.

521
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:04,261
Is this my mom's?

522
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:06,831
Yes.

523
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:10,267
They're the songs your mom sang.

524
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,072
I found all the ones I could.

525
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:18,342
They might not be her own songs...

526
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:23,080
But at least you can hear her voice.

527
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:29,053
I thought this was the only way...

528
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:33,757
I could even begin to apologize to you.

529
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:41,265
Your father...

530
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,369
He was never tempted by me.

531
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:48,806
He...

532
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:53,010
never strayed from your mother.

533
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:57,314
Like you said,

534
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:01,652
he said my feelings for him weren't love.

535
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,725
Your mother should have known...

536
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:12,963
that the person your father loved...

537
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:17,635
wasn't me...

538
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:21,171
but herself.

539
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,814
I desperately want to believe...

540
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:34,919
that that was the case.

541
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:40,357
I thought you might not come see me.

542
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,961
So you contacting me first was a surprise.

543
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,998
I was surprised, myself.

544
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:52,636
You told me what I wanted

545
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:55,239
to confirm from you when I met you.

546
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:01,278
I'm so glad that I got to hear it

547
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,148
before I leave.

548
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:08,352
Are you really going far away?

549
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:11,689
If you leave like this,

550
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:14,625
Tae-gyung will never forgive me.

551
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:21,899
He refuses to see me.
This has never happened before.

552
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:27,972
Can you go and tell him
that you've forgiven me?

553
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:35,879
Why can't you go and ask him
for forgiveness?

554
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:43,087
The person you need to ask for forgiveness

555
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:45,089
from the most is Tae-gyung.

556
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:53,364
Ask him for forgiveness,
so that he will no longer

557
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:55,199
be hurt or be in pain.

558
00:43:57,434 --> 00:43:58,268
He's always...

559
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,138
longed for his mom.

560
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:06,076
Why would you tell me this?

561
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,681
You love him.

562
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,585
If I'm by his side...

563
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:21,125
don't you know
it will be harder for you to do so?

564
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:28,999
Because to make one abandon another
who is precious to them...

565
00:44:32,102 --> 00:44:33,470
isn't love.

566
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:44,348
This is my favorite concert venue.

567
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:46,517
Let's go crush them!
Show them what we've got!

568
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:49,820
Do you think Ko Mi-nyeo will come today?

569
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:52,723
What if she leaves without seeing us?

570
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:56,360
Oh, Tae-gyung! Can I borrow that doll?

571
00:44:57,461 --> 00:44:59,630
That pig rabbit, it's her, right?

572
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,402
I don't have it any more. I've moved on.

573
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:07,438
What? You moved on?

574
00:45:08,405 --> 00:45:10,374
Weren't you waiting for her?

575
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:13,177
What's the point in waiting
for someone who won't come?

576
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:14,445
It's over.

577
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:17,181
Have you told her
you were waiting for her?

578
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:18,549
Why would I tell her that?

579
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:22,352
If you don't tell her, that's the same
as saying you didn't wait for her!

580
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:24,188
You conceited butthole!

581
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:37,568
Hwang Tae-gyung.

582
00:45:40,537 --> 00:45:42,406
This isn't for you. It's for Ko Mi-nam.

583
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:46,910
I heard you
and Ko Mi-nam's sister broke up.

584
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:49,680
Are you really over her, though?

585
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:53,550
Yes. I'm completely over her.

586
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:56,220
So stop butting in and go away.

587
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:59,089
That's a lie, isn't it? That it's over.

588
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:01,658
Oh dear!

589
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:05,429
Having your true feelings revealed
is pretty embarrassing, isn't it?

590
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:10,000
Hwang Tae-gyung.
Keep up the lies and stay chill.

591
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,169
It would be embarrassing
if you get found out.

592
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:25,616
She's coming today, isn't she?

593
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:27,584
Don't you start that with me.

594
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:30,754
The person you took that day,

595
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:32,523
that wasn't Ko Mi-nam. It was her.

596
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:34,992
Yes. It was her.

597
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,195
She had to do it for a reason,
but she left soon after.

598
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,765
You just let her go?

599
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,301
Yes.

600
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:48,772
She said it hurt her
to stay too close, so I let her go.

601
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:50,874
That's not letting go,
you pushed her away.

602
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:56,513
Only those who held on until the end
can say they let someone go.

603
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:58,882
Have you ever clung onto her?

604
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:02,352
When you saw me in Japan,

605
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:04,655
that was me holding onto her
with everything I had.

606
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:08,358
It may have looked foolish to you,

607
00:47:09,193 --> 00:47:10,794
but I was able to let her go

608
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:12,896
because I tried. I gave it my all.

609
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,033
But you haven't, have you?

610
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:19,803
You just stand there,
unable to run after her

611
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:22,840
as she runs away, hurt.

612
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:26,877
Fine. You can salvage your stupid pride

613
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:28,712
and stand there, watching her disappear.

614
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:30,180
Oh great Hwang Tae-gyung.

615
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:48,765
A.N.JELL

616
00:47:48,832 --> 00:47:51,335
Everything from the top!
Check the audio, please!

617
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,216
Tae-gyung!

618
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:34,444
Even if I ask for your forgiveness,

619
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:36,847
even if I say I'm sorry...

620
00:48:39,016 --> 00:48:40,617
you won't hear it now, will you?

621
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:45,422
But even if you won't, I must tell you.

622
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:55,332
I'm sorry, Tae-gyung.

623
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:04,508
I neglected you because I thought
you would never be able to leave me.

624
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:09,146
I was so focused on my broken heart
that I, in turn, ended up breaking yours.

625
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,883
It's only right
that you don't call me mother.

626
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,022
Why are you saying that all of a sudden?

627
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:20,624
I became afraid.

628
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:24,494
You're actually trying to leave me now.

629
00:49:26,663 --> 00:49:29,967
I'm making an effort to hold onto my son.

630
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:33,603
That's surprising.

631
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:39,376
I never would have thought
you would be like that.

632
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:42,980
She...

633
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,216
told me to go to you

634
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:49,453
and apologize and cling onto you.

635
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:52,622
You met her?

636
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:53,857
Yes.

637
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:58,195
I met her in hopes that you might
see me again if I apologized to her.

638
00:50:02,899 --> 00:50:05,569
She's going far away. Did you know?

639
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:13,377
I have no right to say this to you,

640
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:16,880
but I hope you won't lose
the most precious person

641
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,349
to you and regret it like me.

642
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:28,158
Why are you telling me this?

643
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:33,597
I was told that making one abandon another

644
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:36,266
who is precious to them isn't love.

645
00:50:39,002 --> 00:50:40,437
Telling you this now is the love

646
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:44,574
I can show you as your mother.

647
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,922
I can't tell you that I forgive you,
at this moment.

648
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:01,958
But I'll go to you later,

649
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:04,661
to hear this apology again.

650
00:51:06,863 --> 00:51:07,764
Goodbye.

651
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:10,434
Mother.

652
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:35,459
If you don't tell her, that's the same
as saying you didn't want for her!

653
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:36,993
You conceited butthole!

654
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:42,265
That's a lie, isn't it? That it's over.

655
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,935
Have you ever clung onto her?

656
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:48,505
I hope you won't lose
the most precious person

657
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:51,074
to you and regret it like me.

658
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:01,384
There.

659
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:04,387
Where is she?

660
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:06,857
Congratulations.

661
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,868
Where's Tae-gyung?
He has to get his makeup done!

662
00:52:19,035 --> 00:52:19,970
Tae-gyung?

663
00:52:23,073 --> 00:52:24,307
He went to get his girl.

664
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:50,033
Hey, kid.

665
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:52,836
Where did Ms. Gemma go?

666
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,105
Ms. Gemma left.

667
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:56,473
Already?

668
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:59,342
Her flight's leaving in an hour,

669
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:00,844
do I need to go to the airport?

670
00:53:01,745 --> 00:53:03,280
A pink star.

671
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:04,247
What is this?

672
00:53:04,915 --> 00:53:06,583
It's Ms. Gemma's star!

673
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:08,652
Her star?

674
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:12,088
Can I see it real quick?

675
00:53:38,081 --> 00:53:39,449
When I'm far away,

676
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:43,420
I'll think of you as I find these stars.

677
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:45,655
Is this all she thought of? Ridiculous.

678
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:49,926
She said the coolest star
was somewhere else.

679
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:53,830
She said she was going to leave
after seeing it.

680
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,304
Let's go in, you guys!

681
00:54:44,714 --> 00:54:46,016
I won't be able to stay for long.

682
00:54:55,892 --> 00:54:57,260
Where were you!

683
00:55:20,383 --> 00:55:22,952
How am I supposed to find her in there?

684
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:27,891
I got to see him before I go.

685
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:29,626
Thank goodness.

686
00:55:43,373 --> 00:55:45,241
What happened? Did you bring her?

687
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:48,712
She's here. Probably in the seating area.

688
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:51,948
The seating area? As one of 15,000?

689
00:55:57,153 --> 00:55:59,055
Change the first song. I'll start.

690
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:40,897
This song...

691
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:55,645
For every step I let you go

692
00:56:55,779 --> 00:56:58,548
I can't help but cry

693
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:03,620
For every step you take away from me,

694
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,490
My tears begin to fall

695
00:57:08,858 --> 00:57:11,428
I reach out for you

696
00:57:11,494 --> 00:57:13,963
I reach out my hand

697
00:57:14,164 --> 00:57:19,502
But you grow farther and farther away

698
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,806
To a place I can't reach

699
00:57:22,872 --> 00:57:25,408
But all I can do

700
00:57:25,475 --> 00:57:30,580
Is cry, watching you leave

701
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:37,053
What do I do? What do I do?

702
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:42,292
You're walking away

703
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:47,330
What do I do? What do I do?

704
00:57:47,897 --> 00:57:52,669
You're walking away, leaving me here

705
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:57,774
I love you, I love you

706
00:57:57,941 --> 00:58:03,713
I cry out as loudly as I can

707
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:08,818
But you can't hear me

708
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:11,955
For it's only

709
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:16,960
Within my heart

710
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:21,130
I erase you all day long

711
00:58:21,197 --> 00:58:26,135
But you appear in my thoughts again

712
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:31,107
I break up with you, all day long

713
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:35,345
But you appear in my heart,
again and again

714
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:39,015
I reach out for you

715
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:41,718
I reach as far as I can

716
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:47,590
But you've gone far and far away

717
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:53,129
To a place I can't reach but all I can do

718
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:57,267
Is cry, watching you leave

719
00:58:57,333 --> 00:59:02,405
What do I do? What do I do?

720
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:07,544
You're walking away

721
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:12,615
What do I do? What do I do?

722
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:17,820
You're walking away, leaving me here

723
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:22,959
I love you, I love you

724
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:28,898
I cry out as loudly as I can

725
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:33,770
But you can't hear me

726
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:37,073
For it's only

727
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:42,412
Within my heart

728
00:59:43,846 --> 00:59:49,052
What do I do? What do I do?

729
00:59:49,218 --> 00:59:55,358
You're the only one for me

730
00:59:56,759 --> 01:00:01,698
What do I do? What do I do?

731
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:06,803
You're walking away

732
01:00:06,869 --> 01:00:09,606
-What do I do?
-I'll hold this moment in my heart

733
01:00:09,672 --> 01:00:12,442
-What do I do?
-When you're truly shining the brightest

734
01:00:12,508 --> 01:00:17,146
You're walking away, leaving me here

735
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:22,251
I love you, I love you

736
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:28,124
I cry out as loudly as I can

737
01:00:28,658 --> 01:00:33,029
But you can't hear me

738
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:36,733
For it's only

739
01:00:36,899 --> 01:00:41,638
Within my heart

740
01:00:59,856 --> 01:01:01,257
I know you're listening to me right now!

741
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:07,363
It's too bright here

742
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:09,832
and it's too dark where you are,

743
01:01:10,633 --> 01:01:12,001
so I can't see you.

744
01:01:15,371 --> 01:01:16,906
Please stop staying where I can't see you!

745
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:19,542
Come to where I can see you.

746
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:25,715
Please give me permission...

747
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:28,384
to see you.

748
01:02:07,256 --> 01:02:09,258
Turn off the stage lights
and turn on the audience lights.

749
01:03:42,752 --> 01:03:44,187
I will continue to tell you this,

750
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:46,422
so listen carefully, every day.

751
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:49,759
I love you.

752
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:29,665
There will be lots of stars
in Africa too, right?

753
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:32,501
Do you have to go?

754
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:36,405
I'll come back, safe and sound.

755
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:38,207
Wait for me.

756
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:40,910
You've gotten pretty cocky.

757
01:04:41,777 --> 01:04:44,814
Aren't you sad that
you have to leave the brightest,

758
01:04:45,281 --> 01:04:46,282
coolest star behind?

759
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:51,220
But it's not like I can take you with me.

760
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:02,198
Just pluck it out from the sky

761
01:05:08,604 --> 01:05:09,639
and wear it around your neck.

762
01:05:11,874 --> 01:05:12,842
It's a star.

763
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:25,755
You even got me a star from the sky?

764
01:05:26,355 --> 01:05:27,957
You've really changed.

765
01:05:29,892 --> 01:05:33,362
Do you like me that much that
you would get me a star from the sky?

766
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:36,999
You're getting cockier.

767
01:05:37,466 --> 01:05:38,668
Give it back, then!

768
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:41,804
No way! This is mine.

769
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:44,340
There are other jewels and diamonds!

770
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:45,508
So give me that back!

771
01:05:46,242 --> 01:05:48,611
I can't make stuff like that.

772
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:50,413
I'm not that capable.

773
01:05:50,846 --> 01:05:52,181
Then be nicer to me.

774
01:05:52,415 --> 01:05:53,349
What's that?

775
01:05:56,052 --> 01:05:57,887
I finally caught my star,

776
01:05:58,020 --> 01:05:59,522
and I'm never going to let it go!

777
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:01,958
Never let go.

778
01:06:02,258 --> 01:06:04,293
I'll shine brightly, only in front of you.

779
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:06,629
