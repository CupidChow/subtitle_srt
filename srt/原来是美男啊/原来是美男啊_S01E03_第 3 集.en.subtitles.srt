1
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:29,896
Thanks to you, no one will figure out
that I'm a woman.

2
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:40,607
Well, it looks like someone did.

3
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:44,744
You should have secured them tighter.

4
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:53,686
Ko Mi-nam.

5
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,457
You're done for.

6
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:02,729
Tae-gyung!

7
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:07,801
Tae-gyung!

8
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:12,172
Tae-gyung!

9
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:21,414
Please hear me out.

10
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,016
I don't want to.

11
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:26,653
Then at least try to understand
how I feel.

12
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:29,055
I don't need to.

13
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,268
Please don't go like this.

14
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:44,137
Freaking...

15
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:47,974
Wait!

16
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:54,013
Jermy, what are you doing?

17
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,549
It's closed. The door is closed.

18
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,518
We have to go that way. It's locked.

19
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:00,320
-I'm so--
-Sorry?

20
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:02,655
You were going to say that, right?
Well, I don't care.

21
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:05,191
-Please--
-Forgive me?

22
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,161
I don't want to. I'm done talking to you.

23
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:13,133
I'm taking this to Mr. An,
so you can talk to him.

24
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,135
I hope to see you never again,

25
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,570
Ms. Ko Mi-nam.

26
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:29,082
What do I do?

27
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,393
That little...

28
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:45,899
Ko Mi-nam!

29
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:48,134
Come back here!

30
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:53,806
How do you delete this?

31
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:55,775
Hey!

32
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,388
How do you delete it?

33
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:34,881
Let go!

34
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:36,349
Please.

35
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,185
Do you think you won't get caught
if this is gone?

36
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:42,055
Are you stupid?

37
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,290
Are you not a woman anymore
if this is gone?

38
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,796
Oh, you're right.

39
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,633
I'm a woman, and that can't be changed.

40
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:58,338
So let go!

41
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:05,011
Damn it.

42
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,180
Why did you let go all of a sudden?

43
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:09,215
You said to let go.

44
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:10,850
Damn it...

45
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:20,927
My goodness.

46
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:24,597
Go get it.

47
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:27,100
Okay.

48
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,758
Tae-gyung! Good news! It's not broken!

49
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,293
Throw it.

50
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,668
Can you help...

51
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:04,404
Excuse me, can you...

52
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:07,240
Man, it's all scratched up.

53
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:30,630
Tae-gyung?

54
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,299
PRO DELIVERY

55
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:36,069
Tae-gyung, something doesn't feel right.

56
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,570
You're right.

57
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:39,005
This isn't turning on!

58
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:43,976
Oh, it stopped.

59
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,913
Yes, it's not even turning on.

60
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,948
Ko Mi-nam, you!

61
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:52,719
Tae-gyung.

62
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:54,487
Why are you still up there?

63
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,656
Can you please help me?

64
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:58,358
Oh, no!

65
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,259
Tae-gyung!

66
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:05,231
Tae-gyung!

67
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,133
Tae-gyung!

68
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,036
Tae-gyung!

69
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,222
Help!

70
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:35,228
Excuse me.

71
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:37,530
Excuse me.

72
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:45,238
Please stop the car.

73
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:57,583
Hello?

74
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,522
Please help me!

75
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,657
Please stop the car!

76
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,729
Reverend Mother, I'm so scared!

77
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,165
Where am I being taken to?

78
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:15,067
On my way to Busan!

79
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:16,969
Haeundae District!

80
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:18,638
Help!

81
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,308
He won't keep going
without stopping right?

82
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:26,245
No, I'm not stopping.

83
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,516
All right, I'm almost at the highway.

84
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,819
Please stop the car!

85
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:35,755
I'm losing strength.

86
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,391
I guess I will fall off this car soon.

87
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,259
What shall I do?

88
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:41,294
Ko Mi-nam!

89
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,530
Ko Mi-nam! Don't faint!

90
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,799
Hold on for a bit longer!
I'll stop the car!

91
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,068
Hey, truck! Stop!

92
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:50,770
Pro Delivery!

93
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,442
Tae-gyung...

94
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:58,411
Ko Mi-nam!

95
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,646
Hold on tight, do you hear me?
Don't let go!

96
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,415
Stop the car!

97
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:04,317
-Tae-gyung!
-Hey! Ko Mi-nam!

98
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:07,153
-Tae-gyung!
-Hold on, I'll stop the truck!

99
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:08,721
Truck, stop!

100
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,223
-Tae-gyung...
-Hey!

101
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:11,424
Ko Mi-nam!

102
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,926
Truck, stop! Hey!

103
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,162
Tae-gyung...

104
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:18,197
Hey!

105
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,591
Ko Mi-nam. Get off.

106
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:47,059
Jump off, Ko Mi-nam!

107
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,300
Come on, dummy! Quickly!

108
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:58,337
Ko Mi-nam, get off the truck! Jump off!

109
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:12,485
Ko Mi-nam, get off the truck! Jump off!

110
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,602
Now! Ko Mi-nam, jump!

111
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,490
Tae-gyung.

112
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:28,527
You ran until you were drenched in sweat

113
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,764
and your shirt ripped off
when you caught me,

114
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:34,634
Thank you.

115
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,140
You're right.

116
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,610
Because of you,
I'm dirty, smelly, sweaty...

117
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,479
and hurting.

118
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:51,450
You're hurting? What should we do?

119
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,453
"What should we do?"

120
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,056
"What should we do?"

121
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:01,060
How can something like this happen to me?

122
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:07,867
This is just so unbelievable.
Objectively ludicrous.

123
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:10,736
Maybe it's just me being crazy.

124
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,041
But is this, by any chance,

125
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:16,742
Hidden Camera?

126
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,177
Excuse me?

127
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,114
Is this Hidden Camera?

128
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,019
Lee Kyung-kyu?

129
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,689
Are you there?

130
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,267
I knew it.

131
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:43,936
I really am losing my mind.

132
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,106
Hidden Camera? Really!

133
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:51,510
Tae-gyung, calm down.

134
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:52,878
How can I?

135
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:56,549
I'm out here, rambling like a lunatic,
and you think I can be calm?

136
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,252
This isn't me!

137
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:02,855
I'm...

138
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,660
Yes. That's who I am!

139
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:25,010
I'm sorry for making things difficult.

140
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,546
I meddled in things
I should've stayed away from

141
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,448
and made everything worse.

142
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,054
Do you know what people call you?

143
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,556
A nuisance.

144
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:44,363
I sincerely apologize
for causing you trouble.

145
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:49,168
I'll do anything you say.
Do what you will with me.

146
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,006
What would you have me do?

147
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:01,480
No matter how much I think about it,

148
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:05,918
getting tangled up with you
gives me an ominous feeling.

149
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,588
Ko Mi-nam, I don't know why,

150
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:11,590
but you are too dangerous.

151
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,460
Here!

152
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,140
You're an accident-prone zone.

153
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,943
One has to make sure
to give them a wide berth.

154
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:51,964
It's only a small
bumper-to-bumper right now.

155
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:53,566
That's all this is going to be.

156
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:56,068
I'm not

157
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:58,771
going to get involved anymore.

158
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:01,106
Then...

159
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,576
will you turn a blind eye to it?

160
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:07,146
Not getting involved
doesn't mean I'm looking over it!

161
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:09,682
So...

162
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:14,687
you tie up all your loose ends,
clean up your mess,

163
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:17,223
and disappear.

164
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:32,838
I understand.

165
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:37,343
I will quit being Ko Mi-nam

166
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:41,280
so there will be no trouble for you.

167
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:54,827
They found out you're a woman?

168
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,096
Yes.

169
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,032
I'm sorry for disappointing you.

170
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:06,238
But you said Tae-gyung
hasn't told anyone else, right?

171
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:11,343
He said he didn't want to get involved
and told me to take care of it and leave.

172
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:15,981
So, Tae-gyung the jerk is the only one
who knows by far.

173
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,752
Then, if we do something about him...

174
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:21,287
Do what, exactly?

175
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,791
If he disappears, our problem is solved.

176
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:31,630
Should we lock him up somewhere?

177
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,975
I've had fried dumplings for 15 years.

178
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:44,944
Who am I?

179
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,712
Are you out of your mind?

180
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,847
Dumplings, my ass!

181
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:51,150
I'll make you into fried dumplings first!

182
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:54,820
-You hear me?
-Okay. Then, let's do this.

183
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,156
Then...

184
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:01,460
should we try arguing that the person
Hwang Tae-gyung met...

185
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,431
was someone else?

186
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,734
The person you met wasn't Ko Mi-nam.

187
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:10,836
It was Koo Mi-nam!

188
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:12,371
What do you think?

189
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:15,007
You good-for-nothing idiot!

190
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:18,010
I'll paint a mole on my face
and have my revenge on you!

191
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,446
Okay, then there's only one way left.

192
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,814
Only one way.

193
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,852
We have to beg until our hands wear down.

194
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:41,700
Sorry, sorry, I am sorry

195
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:43,235
Oh man.

196
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,070
Mr. Ma.

197
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,039
Don't lose your mind, sir.

198
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:52,478
Sister, how could you get caught?
What do I do now?

199
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:57,616
Please explain it well to Mr. An.

200
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,386
I'll get ready to leave.

201
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,058
Oh, my goodness.

202
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,259
As for you...

203
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:09,261
get ready to die.

204
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:29,181
It was rash of me
to try to catch that much weight

205
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,516
falling from that height.

206
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:34,486
She got hurt too.

207
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,881
Good thing I decided
not to get involved anymore.

208
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:06,485
I have to be careful
not to get tangled up in that mess.

209
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:25,938
Please don't leave like this!

210
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,043
Hey, did you get in trouble
with Tae-gyung again?

211
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,815
Yes. I'm a nuisance.

212
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,419
You made things difficult for him, right?

213
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:42,821
Yes.

214
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:46,625
I'm an accident-prone zone,
causing bumpers to crash into each other.

215
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:48,193
I must be avoided.

216
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:49,828
What?

217
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:51,797
You must be avoided?

218
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,432
Then what happened back there,

219
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,968
that was Tae-gyung running away from him?

220
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:00,272
Please hear me out.

221
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:02,341
I don't want to.

222
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,511
Then at least try to understand
how I feel.

223
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:07,246
I don't want to!

224
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:10,582
Please don't leave like this!

225
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:12,718
Let go of me!

226
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,121
Tae-gyung!

227
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,658
Get a hold of yourself! There's no way!

228
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:20,993
No way!

229
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,530
Why did you call for me?

230
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:01,733
If there was an accident,
first aid should be administered.

231
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:03,502
Come here.

232
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:10,075
Have a seat.

233
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,014
Hand.

234
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:23,255
Good.

235
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,858
I think I know
how Jermy feels raising Jolie.

236
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,728
Jolie?

237
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:32,731
His dog?

238
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,002
So now,

239
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:40,606
regard me akin to a dog.

240
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:43,809
I didn't mean it like that.

241
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,412
You're like a lost puppy, somehow.

242
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:49,848
I feel like I need
to keep looking after you

243
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:50,916
and care for you.

244
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:54,553
That still means I'm a dog though.

245
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:57,923
Want to hear a story about a guy
who got dumped because of a dog?

246
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:02,794
He was from Gyeongsang Province.

247
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,763
He was in love with a Seoul girl.

248
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:08,934
He had a really thick accent, you see,

249
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,036
but he wanted to talk...

250
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:14,339
like he was from Seoul,

251
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,741
all nice and sweet.

252
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:17,409
He kept it up for a while.

253
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:19,611
And?

254
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:21,013
But then,

255
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:23,815
he wanted to ask her if she lived nearby.

256
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:25,651
In the Gyeongsang dialect,

257
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:27,586
you usually ask,

258
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:29,288
"Is your house close?"

259
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,124
If Seoul people
who didn't know that dialect heard that

260
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,727
it would have sounded like,

261
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,429
"Does your family hunt dogs?"

262
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:40,432
And when she heard that,

263
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:43,769
she started crying and saying
they wouldn't ever do such a thing!

264
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,207
This is a super sad story.

265
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:54,246
Because that boy was me.

266
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:57,282
That...

267
00:21:58,183 --> 00:21:59,017
What?

268
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:00,519
It was me.

269
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,955
After I got dumped then,
I practiced super hard.

270
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:06,291
What do you think?

271
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:07,826
You can't tell, right?

272
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,429
Not at all! I didn't have a clue.

273
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:13,665
Do the others know?

274
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:14,833
No.

275
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,369
You're the only one who knows this secret.

276
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:19,705
If you tell anyone else,

277
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:22,174
I'll kill you.

278
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,981
Now, we've gotten pretty close,
don't you think?

279
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,617
Yes, we're close indeed.

280
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:35,921
But you shouldn't hunt dogs though...

281
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,290
Shall I treat you like a little brother?

282
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,025
What?

283
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:41,927
Don't bark all confused at me.

284
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:43,895
Want me to treat you
like a little brother?

285
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:47,899
That's a bit...

286
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:52,137
Then, do you want me
to treat you like a little sister?

287
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:53,271
Excuse me?

288
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:57,142
Exactly.

289
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,011
So, I'll treat you
like a little brother like Jermy.

290
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:03,348
Right.

291
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:05,817
Thanks, Shin-woo.

292
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:07,886
Good.

293
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:25,771
I spilled a secret already.

294
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:27,739
I need to be more careful.

295
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:37,149
It's getting a bit weird
with Shin-woo too.

296
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:41,586
Get a hold of yourself! There's no way!

297
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:42,921
No freaking way!

298
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:45,157
Jermy.

299
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:49,094
Jermy.

300
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:52,731
You dropped this.

301
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:07,245
Isn't this your apple, Jermy?

302
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:16,955
Jermy.

303
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:18,256
Here you go.

304
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,958
No, you eat it.

305
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,295
Thank you!

306
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,971
Oh, my goodness.

307
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:38,944
There is something about him. I know it.

308
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:40,912
I better be careful.

309
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:50,655
They were all so good to me.

310
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:54,593
But by tomorrow,
they're going to be so disappointed.

311
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:10,342
Sorry, Mi-nam.

312
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:13,979
I wanted to protect your dream,

313
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:16,314
I wanted to find our mom,

314
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,918
but I've ruined everything.

315
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:23,722
Why am I like this?

316
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,031
Reverend Mother.

317
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,168
You told me to see more of the world,

318
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:39,638
but I feel like...

319
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:45,010
I'm worthless in this world.

320
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,999
What do you think you're doing, young man?

321
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,801
No, I...

322
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:10,769
Let me go!

323
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:12,103
Ma'am, please!

324
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:15,740
I'm here to meet Ko Mi-nam of A.N.JELL!

325
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:17,576
Why won't you let me in?

326
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:20,011
You can't enter, ma'am!

327
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:23,248
If you really want to see him,
wait out here.

328
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:25,584
Don't you see the other fans waiting?

329
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:26,651
What?

330
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,253
You've got to be kidding me.

331
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:32,557
I'm not like these little baby kids
skipping school

332
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:34,759
to chase after celebrities!

333
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:38,363
I'm an A.N.JELL member's aunt!
Aunt, I tell you!

334
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,633
If you're their aunt,

335
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,269
they're all their little sisters!

336
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:45,670
-I...
-Just wait here.

337
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:48,873
I'm telling you the truth! I'm his aunt!

338
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,976
-Ma'am, please!
-I'm serious...

339
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:52,344
ALL THE WAY TO HEAVEN WITH A.N.JELL

340
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,244
Hey.

341
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:55,580
Hey.

342
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,049
What?

343
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:00,685
Move over.

344
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:02,520
I was just curious.

345
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,424
How long do you have to wait
to see A.N.JELL?

346
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:07,926
Look lady.

347
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,695
Do you think it's easy to meet them?

348
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:14,232
You can wait here all day,
and even then, your odds are slim.

349
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:17,936
"All day"?

350
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:21,640
My goodness, this is the worst.

351
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:23,842
It's urgent, I have to see him quickly!

352
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:28,146
I even skipped out
on getting my money pool!

353
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:31,282
I skipped school today,
and it was my day on duty!

354
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,353
That's nothing to brag about.

355
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:40,925
Anyhow, my nephew, Mi-nam,
really has become successful

356
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:44,562
if it's this hard to meet him.

357
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,298
He grew up so well.
He grew up well indeed!

358
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:51,269
How happy will he be

359
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:55,640
if he gets to see this picture
of him and his dad?

360
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:04,416
The person you're calling
is currently unavailable...

361
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,720
Why isn't Mr. Ma picking up his phone?

362
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:17,829
The person you're calling
is currently unavailable.

363
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:19,164
Please leave your...

364
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:22,133
I hope he told Mr. An the whole story.

365
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,143
I confessed everything.

366
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:36,081
My heart feels much lighter now.

367
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,651
You should be spilling the beans
to Mr. An at the agency,

368
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:41,686
not to a priest, idiot!

369
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:42,954
You're hopeless.

370
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:44,789
What are you going to do about her?

371
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:47,358
What did I do wrong?

372
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:50,895
I asked for God's forgiveness
on behalf of Mi-nyeo,

373
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:54,899
and she'll ask for Mr. An's forgiveness
on behalf of me!

374
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:57,335
Oh, sure. That will be easy.

375
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:59,537
Mr. An's a Catholic too, you know.

376
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:03,441
I've thought it all out.
There's a reason behind all my actions.

377
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:05,210
Look at those sisters.

378
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:08,713
If he finds out that Mi-nyeo
will become a sister like them,

379
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:11,783
then Mr. An, as a believer,

380
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,551
would have to let her go.

381
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:17,822
Reverend Mother.

382
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:20,391
Where in Seoul is Gemma staying?

383
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:22,861
Could we visit her while we're here?

384
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:27,432
Gemma has made her choice
by stepping out into the world.

385
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:32,537
Let's leave her be for now
and let her discover her own path.

386
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:48,319
Yes, Tae-gyung.

387
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:49,888
What's up?

388
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:50,789
Hey.

389
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:52,724
Is everything all right with Ko Mi-nam?

390
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:53,625
What?

391
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:58,963
Everything's fine. Why?

392
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:02,433
Tae-gyung.

393
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:06,271
Why are you so worried about Ko Mi-nam
all of a sudden?

394
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,742
It's nothing big. I'll see you there.

395
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,413
You haven't come clean yet.

396
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:17,182
Ko Mi-nam,

397
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:18,783
what are you planning to do?

398
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:37,836
Oh, it's A.N.JELL!

399
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:46,578
Get out of the way!

400
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,292
What is this?

401
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,494
I just went to go pee, and they're here?

402
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:05,897
Hey, Ko Mi-nam! Mi-nam!

403
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,905
Mi-nam!

404
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,506
Mi-nam! Ko Mi-nam!

405
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:22,447
Mi-nam! Ko Mi-nam!

406
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,082
Ko Mi-nam!

407
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:27,118
Darn it!

408
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:29,320
Why did he have to come now?

409
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:30,855
What?

410
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:36,160
Give this to Tae-gyung, please!

411
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,428
Be quiet!

412
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,297
An adult's speaking!

413
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:43,334
-Hey.
-Yes?

414
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:48,339
-Could you deliver this to Mi-nam?
-Yes, sure.

415
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:51,976
Please make sure Mi-nam gets it.

416
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:54,178
Please tell him I'm waiting for him here.

417
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:55,947
-You look handsome.
-Sure thing, ma'am.

418
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:57,582
-Please! Don't forget!
-Excuse me, girls.

419
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:08,092
These are Tae-gyung's, these are Jermy's.

420
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,228
And these are Shin-woo's.

421
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:11,329
Excuse me.

422
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:12,497
Yes?

423
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:16,734
When is Mr. An getting back?

424
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,437
He said he had things to tend to,
so he'll be back late.

425
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:21,806
I see.

426
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,710
I have something I need
to talk to him about in private.

427
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:28,546
May I wait for him in his office?

428
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,648
Sure.

429
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:43,628
Seriously,

430
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:47,165
when is Mi-nam coming out here?

431
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:57,942
Hey, what's going on?

432
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:00,178
Me?

433
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:08,119
I've come to meet
my famous nephew, of course.

434
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:12,757
What did you say?

435
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:15,660
She ran away with the money pool?

436
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:21,299
Oh, my goodness!

437
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:24,402
My money! I can't believe this!

438
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,542
Mr. An.

439
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,883
A lady asked me
to deliver this to you, Ko Mi-nam.

440
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:40,685
To me?

441
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:41,586
Yes.

442
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:44,522
It's your very first fan letter, Mi-nam.

443
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:45,857
Congratulations.

444
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:48,826
My fan?

445
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:50,762
Who could it be?

446
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:53,731
She was wearing a red dress
and was super cool.

447
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,244
This is...

448
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:08,880
This is...

449
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:11,549
These twins...

450
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:14,786
This is me and Mi-nam!

451
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,254
This is us!

452
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,529
Excuse me!

453
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:27,832
Excuse me!

454
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:31,335
Who gave this to you? Where is she?

455
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:34,739
She said she will be waiting downstairs.

456
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:41,412
Oh, my.

457
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,482
Oh, Mi-nam! It was you!

458
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:46,083
What did you have to tell me?

459
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:48,319
Well, what I needed to...

460
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,154
So, what it was is...

461
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:51,923
I'll tell you later!

462
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:57,862
I came as fast as I could for you. Mi-nam!

463
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,769
It might be Mom!

464
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:07,538
We have to kick Ko Mi-nam out somehow.

465
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,044
Excuse me.

466
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:15,680
It's Ko Mi-nam.

467
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:18,983
Was there an old lady here?

468
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:20,551
Pardon?

469
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:23,287
A lady wearing a red dress.
Did you see her?

470
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:26,924
She...

471
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:29,694
just went towards the subway station.

472
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:32,396
Thank you!

473
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,483
Ko Mi-nam?

474
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:19,310
-Excuse me!
-What the heck?

475
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,212
I'm Ko Mi-nam.

476
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:23,814
What a strange young man.

477
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:02,453
-Isn't he part of A.N.JELL?
-I think he is.

478
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:06,390
Are they really A.N.JELL?

479
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:08,359
-It's them!
-I think they're from A.N.JELL!

480
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:10,027
-What?
-Oh, my goodness!

481
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:15,499
I have to find someone.

482
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:16,968
They're A.N.JELL!

483
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:18,169
Oh my god!

484
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:21,539
If you don't want people
to swarm all over you,

485
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:22,773
drop it.

486
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:25,076
-It's A.N.JELL!
-It's A.N.JELL!

487
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:28,813
-It is!
-It is!

488
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:40,858
The lady who came to see me
with this picture

489
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,160
has to be someone who knows us.

490
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,197
Perhaps, she might be...

491
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:49,300
She might be our mom.

492
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:52,136
This feels so surreal.

493
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,939
I won't be disappointed
even if she's not our mom.

494
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:58,943
If I can hear anything about her,
that would be more than enough.

495
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:02,847
She will come back, won't she?

496
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:06,851
She came to give me this picture.
I'm sure she will be back.

497
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:24,902
So what if she does?

498
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:29,507
Pardon?

499
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,876
Even if she does, you won't be here.

500
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,482
You promised that
you will leave immediately.

501
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:40,351
Don't you remember?

502
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:43,487
Tae-gyung.

503
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:46,590
I might be able to find my mom.

504
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:47,491
Stop it.

505
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:50,661
Laying out stories of your pitiful past
and clinging on

506
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:51,929
is what I hate the most.

507
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:54,965
Tae-gyung.

508
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,769
Please let me stay
just until she comes back.

509
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:02,206
No.

510
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:03,941
Ko Mi-nam.

511
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:05,309
You're out.

512
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,044
Nothing has changed.

513
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:32,703
Are you avoiding me deliberately?

514
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:42,079
You knew I was here,
but you didn't move to another hotel.

515
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:45,449
Was it because you hoped

516
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:48,018
to run into me again?

517
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:53,824
Those are some high hopes, ma'am.

518
00:39:57,628 --> 00:39:58,729
If not, then that's fine.

519
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:10,641
Welcome, madam. This way.

520
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:14,478
You're more beautiful than ever.

521
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:16,480
-Thank you.
-I'll lead the way. This way, please.

522
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:17,548
Yes, shall we?

523
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:23,421
TIME FLYING BACKWARDS

524
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,472
Mother...

525
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:49,246
What were you hoping for
in a woman who abandoned you?

526
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:51,682
You're such a fool.

527
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,954
So, you had something to tell me?

528
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:58,255
What is it?

529
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:05,262
Is it too hard to talk about?

530
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:07,998
Tae-gyung seemed to know.
Do you want me to ask him?

531
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:09,667
I...

532
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:12,470
I...

533
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:17,641
I...

534
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:24,181
I can't leave here.

535
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:26,584
What?

536
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,520
I cannot leave no matter what.

537
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:32,957
I will stay here as Ko Mi-nam
until the end.

538
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:38,229
Until now, I viewed this
as something I was dragged into

539
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,498
and being forced to fill a spot.

540
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:43,067
But it's different now.

541
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:45,936
I believe that there is a reason
for Ko Mi-nam to be here.

542
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:49,874
I will not leave under any circumstances!

543
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:03,454
Are you here to beg again?

544
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:06,023
Yes. I am.

545
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,659
This is my most ardent hope.

546
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:12,363
I also ardently hope to get rid of you.

547
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,098
Tae-gyung.

548
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,501
Take this as collateral.

549
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:21,672
What's this?

550
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:26,243
The person who raised me and my brother
gave us one each.

551
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:29,480
She said it was in place
of our mom and dad.

552
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:32,283
It's the most precious thing
in the world to me.

553
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:34,385
So?

554
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,487
Take this,

555
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:38,489
and take me at my word.

556
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:42,259
I will do my best in everything.
I won't cause any more trouble.

557
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:44,795
So, please let me stay.

558
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:47,431
And if you cling on like that,

559
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:50,601
do you think you'll be able
to find your mom?

560
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:52,870
With an earnest, desperate heart,

561
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:55,139
I believe I can.

562
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:02,580
Shall we see if you can find everything
with such an earnest, desperate heart?

563
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:07,184
My ring!

564
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:18,028
Once you abandon it, it's over.

565
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:21,065
Your mom abandoned you. It's over.

566
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:22,733
Same goes for that ring.

567
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:25,769
So, don't bother trying to stay
as Ko Mi-nam,

568
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:27,638
and just end it here.

569
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:38,816
I told you it was something
important to me!

570
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:42,052
See?

571
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,755
You're getting angry
because you know you can't find it.

572
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:47,658
I will find it.

573
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:51,795
Fine. Then, find it.

574
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,530
If you really do,

575
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:56,967
then I'll take you at your word
and let you stay.

576
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:04,041
I will find it! I will!

577
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:07,144
I will find it and show you!

578
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:45,749
You can't find it.

579
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:47,785
Once you let go, it's over.

580
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:51,822
Ko Mi-nam.

581
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:56,460
I'm teaching you a valuable lesson.
Once you let go, it's over.

582
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:33,430
I can find it.

583
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:03,527
I have to find it.

584
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:04,995
I can find it.

585
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:21,145
Are you an idiot?

586
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:23,647
Do you really think you can find it?

587
00:46:30,854 --> 00:46:32,089
You will never be able to find it.

588
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:33,891
Give up, Ko Mi-nam.

589
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:09,026
There's no way.

590
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:11,028
She would've left by now.

591
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:13,964
Yes.

592
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:15,232
She should've left.

593
00:47:29,913 --> 00:47:31,148
I knew it.

594
00:47:45,062 --> 00:47:46,697
Hey...

595
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:05,716
What are you doing?

596
00:48:06,783 --> 00:48:08,118
You're still looking for it?

597
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:10,988
I will find it.

598
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:13,924
Just give it up and come out.

599
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:19,129
Hey! Ko Mi-nam!

600
00:48:19,863 --> 00:48:20,697
I have to find it.

601
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:22,299
I can find it.

602
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:36,680
You don't have to look anymore.

603
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:38,282
Come out.

604
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:46,823
The ring...

605
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:50,227
It's right here.

606
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:12,950
Fine, you proved
how single-minded you are.

607
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:14,851
That's enough.

608
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:24,361
Found it.

609
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:30,267
I found this.

610
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:33,937
This ring was hidden
in your untrusting heart,

611
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:36,206
but I found it.

612
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:39,009
Fine.

613
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:40,677
You found it.

614
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:48,285
What?

615
00:49:48,785 --> 00:49:49,886
Are you going to hit me again?

616
00:49:57,861 --> 00:49:59,396
Thank you, Tae-gyung!

617
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:01,431
Thank you so much!

618
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:12,409
I'm pretty well-known.

619
00:50:14,044 --> 00:50:15,278
Don't make things difficult for me.

620
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:42,339
Ko Mi-nam.

621
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:44,641
I've left a change of clothes
in front of the door.

622
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:47,310
Yes, thank you!

623
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:49,312
Thank you, Tae-gyung!

624
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:12,536
Be quiet!

625
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:30,554
Are you returning to the dorm as well?

626
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:33,023
Yes.

627
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:36,760
I'm speeding 240 kilometers per hour
into the accident-prone zone.

628
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:42,432
I won't cause any more trouble.
I'll do my best, Tae-gyung.

629
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,034
No.

630
00:51:44,468 --> 00:51:46,503
I will do my best, Tae-gyung!

631
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:52,175
As promised, I will overlook this issue.
But I will not help you.

632
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:56,012
I won't annoy you.

633
00:51:57,514 --> 00:51:58,348
Good.

634
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:03,019
I hope you realize the best way to do so
is leaving on your own two feet.

635
00:52:04,421 --> 00:52:06,923
I'll see just how long you last.

636
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:20,437
Jolie, I'm a part of the family now.

637
00:52:21,004 --> 00:52:22,072
So, please don't bite me.

638
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:31,014
Good morning!

639
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:34,317
Ko Mi-nam.

640
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:35,719
Are you happy?

641
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:37,254
Yes!

642
00:52:37,454 --> 00:52:41,224
I will do my best to become
a worthy and useful person for everyone!

643
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:45,195
Oh, do you know we're filming today?

644
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:46,863
Yes.

645
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:50,100
I heard that we're pre-recording a video
for the Asian Music Festival.

646
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:51,902
I will do my best!

647
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:54,371
Sure. Give it your best shot.

648
00:52:58,141 --> 00:52:59,109
Oh, by the way.

649
00:52:59,776 --> 00:53:01,912
Did you know we're filming it
at a swimming pool?

650
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:04,614
A swimming pool?

651
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:06,616
Yes, a swimming pool.

652
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:09,319
So, do your best.

653
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:16,626
A swimming pool.

654
00:53:18,328 --> 00:53:19,296
What do I do?

655
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:43,954
I didn't know we were keeping
our clothes on!

656
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:46,489
We're keeping all our clothes on,
Tae-gyung!

657
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:52,696
Everyone ready?

658
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:56,933
This is the first time we'll showcase
the new member of A.N.JELL!

659
00:53:57,634 --> 00:53:58,969
So, to symbolize a new beginning,

660
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:02,339
all four of you
will be hugging each other underwater!

661
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,441
All right, let's get started!

662
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:06,409
A.N.JELL, please get in the water.

663
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:10,380
Do we just go in like this?

664
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:21,124
Like a baby deep asleep in the water,

665
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:22,993
you know what I mean?

666
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:25,195
Pose naturally.

667
00:54:25,996 --> 00:54:27,163
Imagine it.

668
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,866
I'm a baby. What pose would I be in?

669
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:31,701
Mi-nam! Are you imagining it?

670
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:34,070
All right, let's go!

671
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:37,173
Ready. Action!

672
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:57,127
No!

673
00:54:57,494 --> 00:54:58,328
Mi-nam!

674
00:54:59,062 --> 00:55:01,765
Don't flail! Act natural!

675
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:04,034
Let's try it again, Mi-nam.

676
00:55:04,534 --> 00:55:06,503
I'm sorry.

677
00:55:26,556 --> 00:55:28,325
Why are you coming up so early?

678
00:55:41,304 --> 00:55:43,673
Go back under and stay there longer.
Stop flailing!

679
00:55:44,808 --> 00:55:45,642
Oh, my...

680
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:02,192
Drink up.

681
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:03,927
We won't have time for dinner.

682
00:56:03,993 --> 00:56:06,129
We have to finish
before the rental time's up.

683
00:56:09,899 --> 00:56:12,335
I drank so much pool water, so I'm full.

684
00:56:14,003 --> 00:56:15,705
Everyone's first shoot goes like that.

685
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:19,042
You get nervous, so you make mistakes,
then you get yelled at,

686
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:21,144
which makes you more nervous.

687
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:25,548
Were you like that in the beginning too?

688
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:27,584
My first shoot?

689
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:31,020
I held a wine glass
and had to drink out of it, all cool-like.

690
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:35,492
You must've been much cooler than me,
drinking all this pool water.

691
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:37,861
But then the director said to me,

692
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:41,498
"Kang Shin-woo! It's a one-shot!"

693
00:56:42,298 --> 00:56:44,200
It meant that the camera
was focused on me,

694
00:56:44,534 --> 00:56:45,969
but I gulped down the whole thing.

695
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:48,371
What?

696
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:49,706
The wine.

697
00:56:50,106 --> 00:56:51,641
I downed it in one.

698
00:56:54,644 --> 00:56:55,879
There goes another secret.

699
00:56:57,881 --> 00:56:59,582
What do you think? Are we close?

700
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:01,317
Yes, we're closer.

701
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:12,128
Shin-woo's just a sweet, kind person!

702
00:57:14,297 --> 00:57:15,765
Don't doubt his kindness!

703
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:17,734
You're such a bad person.

704
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:19,636
Standby! We're starting!

705
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:23,606
Take your time.

706
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:31,314
Quickly!

707
00:57:58,174 --> 00:58:00,910
I told you, I'm avoiding
the accident-prone zone.

708
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:03,580
Of course, you are.

709
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:06,082
Thank goodness
you didn't fall over with me.

710
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:10,053
Anyway, I'm very disappointed.

711
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:13,223
We came to a pool,
and we can't even see you in a swimsuit.

712
00:58:14,457 --> 00:58:17,627
If you had come with just
swimming trunks on, like a man,

713
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:19,362
that would've been a sight to see.

714
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:23,500
There's nothing to see!

715
00:58:24,534 --> 00:58:25,502
Is that right?

716
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:28,538
Why? Are you scared?

717
00:58:29,939 --> 00:58:31,574
I suppose you're right.

718
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:41,050
Tae-gyung too.

719
00:58:41,317 --> 00:58:43,820
He just grew closer to him. That's all.

720
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:46,055
We're in the same team.
That's a good thing!

721
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,997
Cut! Good work, everyone!

722
00:58:54,063 --> 00:58:56,466
-Good work!
-Good job, you guys!

723
00:58:56,766 --> 00:58:58,968
-Come on!
-Good work!

724
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:00,870
-Come on.
-Let's go!

725
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,074
Mi-nam.

726
00:59:06,509 --> 00:59:07,677
Go change in the lockers.

727
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,112
The lockers?

728
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:10,647
Come out after you've changed.

729
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,615
Yes. Thank you.

730
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:15,718
THE MEN'S LOCKER ROOM

731
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:19,455
Mr. Ma's not here and neither is Ms. Wang,

732
00:59:20,123 --> 00:59:22,125
which means I can't go
into the women's locker room.

733
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:23,459
What do I do?

734
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:27,697
I know there's not much to see,
but I'll look forward to it.

735
00:59:28,164 --> 00:59:29,599
Come in like a man.

736
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:44,113
THE MEN'S LOCKER ROOM

737
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:45,348
Good work today!

738
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:47,717
Come on.

739
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:49,218
-Good work!
-Great job today.

740
00:59:49,285 --> 00:59:50,253
Let's go!

741
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:52,689
-Oh, Mi-nam!
-Yes?

742
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:54,090
-Great job today!
-Thank you.

743
00:59:54,157 --> 00:59:55,692
-Aren't you washing up?
-What?

744
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:57,427
What? Did you leave something?

745
00:59:57,493 --> 01:00:00,229
-Oh, no.
-Let's go!

746
01:00:15,745 --> 01:00:17,580
I should go quickly change in a corner.

747
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:33,830
Of course, she couldn't have come in here.

748
01:00:38,868 --> 01:00:40,370
-Director.
-Yes?

749
01:00:41,104 --> 01:00:44,140
Have all the staff in today's shoot
leave the pool area?

750
01:00:44,374 --> 01:00:45,274
Yes.

751
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:48,277
Wasn't Ko Mi-nam there?

752
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:51,781
Mi-nam? He came down with me.

753
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:54,450
Did he not even change before he left?

754
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,055
Ko Mi-nam again?

755
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:01,824
We need to talk about this.

756
01:01:23,946 --> 01:01:25,014
Great job today.

757
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:27,016
When will the footage be ready by?

758
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:28,151
The day after tomorrow.

759
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:31,320
The day after tomorrow?
Then if we need additional--

760
01:01:31,387 --> 01:01:33,356
Sir, can you turn on the pool lights?

761
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:35,258
We forgot some of our equipment.

762
01:01:35,558 --> 01:01:37,794
How do you even forget them?

763
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,562
Don't you know how expensive they are?

764
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:42,465
How could you leave them behind?

765
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:50,239
You can go inside and check.

766
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:52,175
I'm so sorry, we'll be out in a jiffy.

767
01:01:52,241 --> 01:01:53,176
Sure thing.

768
01:01:59,482 --> 01:02:01,150
She's going to get caught like this.

769
01:02:05,154 --> 01:02:07,590
-Where is it?
-I am so sorry about this.

770
01:02:07,657 --> 01:02:08,491
What do I do?

771
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:11,294
-It was my mistake. I'm sorry!
-Take a look around.

772
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,729
I'm going to get caught if I stay here.

773
01:02:15,598 --> 01:02:16,666
Have you looked over there?

774
01:02:16,933 --> 01:02:18,301
Yeah, over there. Go.

775
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,235
Yes, there.

776
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:28,244
It's not here.

777
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:29,545
It's not here either.

778
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,447
Darn it.

779
01:02:31,514 --> 01:02:32,882
Maybe it's over there?

780
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:34,383
So sorry about this.

781
01:02:40,823 --> 01:02:43,126
Tae-gyung! Are you here to help?

782
01:02:57,006 --> 01:02:59,976
She must have been here.
Where the heck is she hiding?

783
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:28,938
What are you going to do?

784
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:31,374
Everyone is going to find out.

785
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:42,919
I must endure.

786
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:45,688
If I go up now, it's all done for.

787
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:52,762
It's been way over a minute.

788
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:54,931
How long are you going to keep this up?

789
01:03:55,364 --> 01:03:56,332
Reverend Mother.

790
01:03:57,533 --> 01:03:58,968
I must endure.

791
01:03:59,936 --> 01:04:02,071
I must until I cannot.

792
01:04:16,919 --> 01:04:18,154
Reverend Mother.

793
01:04:19,322 --> 01:04:21,691
Someone's coming to get me.

794
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:24,160
Is he...

795
01:04:24,727 --> 01:04:25,895
an angel?

796
01:04:39,408 --> 01:04:41,410
