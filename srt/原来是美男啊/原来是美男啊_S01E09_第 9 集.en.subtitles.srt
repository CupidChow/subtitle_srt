1
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:57,023
FROM MO HWA-RAN

2
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,426
So she's Tae-gyung's mother...

3
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,596
I shouldn't say anything, right?

4
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:23,016
Is he all right?

5
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:25,685
It's his birthday today...

6
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,955
His heart must be aching too...

7
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:34,060
I'm so useless.

8
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,314
Water!

9
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,924
Thank you.

10
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:49,235
Lights!

11
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,124
That's strange.

12
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,613
This is strange too.

13
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,360
I'd kill for a cup of coffee.

14
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,963
A very hot cup of coffee.

15
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:05,378
It was you, Ko Mi-nam?

16
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:21,327
Ko Mi-nam?

17
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:34,440
What are you doing?

18
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:38,511
Tae-gyung.

19
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:41,547
Is this your part-time job?
Delivering coffee?

20
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:45,652
Oh, I...

21
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:46,786
It was you, wasn't it?

22
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:49,589
The one who kept lurking around?

23
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:51,424
What are you playing at?

24
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,328
Did you see something?

25
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,031
Oh, so...

26
00:04:58,197 --> 00:04:59,599
What I saw was...

27
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:04,437
I saw your present!

28
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:06,706
What?

29
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,410
My aunt opened a package
delivered to you from the States

30
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,011
and I saw it.

31
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,214
Please forgive me!

32
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:19,786
I knew it.

33
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,755
So you've come to ask me
for forgiveness again?

34
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:26,125
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

35
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,130
You're offering me a bribe
instead of just words now?

36
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,466
That's an improvement.

37
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:38,004
Oh, it's hot! Why is it so hot?

38
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:42,075
You said you wanted very hot coffee...

39
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:50,550
Tae-gyung. I know you might get
even angrier if I say this but...

40
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,453
Happy birthday.

41
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:58,358
I'm sorry I caused more trouble
on your birthday.

42
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,861
You can berate me as much as you like
until you feel better.

43
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:04,997
What?

44
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:08,568
That makes it sound like I live
for berating you or something.

45
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:18,111
Of all the birthday wishes,
that was the most unexpected.

46
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:21,247
Tae-gyung!

47
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:22,815
Happy birthday!

48
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:27,820
Bribing and kissing up to people?

49
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,155
Ko Mi-nam,

50
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:30,556
you're improving by the day.

51
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:36,763
That's hot!

52
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:50,343
It wasn't anything, my goodness.

53
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:54,614
I should tape this back together
so Mi-nam doesn't get yelled at.

54
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:58,785
Aunt Mi-ja, I'm about to have some tea.
Would you like a cup?

55
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:00,219
What?

56
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:02,355
Oh, sure.

57
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:06,359
What a sweet gentleman Shin-woo is.

58
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,203
Nampo-dong, Busan's Legendary
17 Versus 1 Fight.

59
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,173
That was our very own Shin-woo!

60
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:22,875
Hey, Shin-woo?

61
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:27,513
You didn't get into fights or anything
in school, did you? You didn't, right?

62
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:30,149
Well...

63
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:33,753
boys get into one or two fights in school.

64
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,758
So what,

65
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:40,593
he did get into fights?

66
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:43,963
Can I get some juice, Shin-woo?

67
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,267
Oh, this cream puff is good!

68
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,639
He eats like a beggar.

69
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:04,217
Princess Amy, the 23rd in line
for the English throne

70
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,486
was Jermy's fiancÃ©e.

71
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:09,121
Hey, whelk.

72
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,624
Do you know

73
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,759
a Princess Emy or other?

74
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,628
You don't, right?

75
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:16,963
Amy?

76
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,332
We keep in touch.

77
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:24,270
So he does know a princess?

78
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,274
Wait a second.

79
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:31,410
So those legendary tales
weren't all made-up?

80
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:33,513
Then wait.

81
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:38,084
There really is a secret
behind the leader's birth?

82
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,087
Aunt Mi-ja, is Mi-nam upstairs?

83
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,924
Right, I think he went

84
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:48,561
to beg to your leader
for forgiveness over this.

85
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,463
What's that?

86
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:56,569
Tae-gyung, you really don't have anything
you want to do? It's your birthday!

87
00:08:57,603 --> 00:09:00,006
I said I didn't,
but you dragged me out here

88
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:01,474
so you think of something.

89
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:06,712
But whenever I'm with you,
you decided on everything.

90
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,715
You hated me butting in or talking back.

91
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,720
I decided that you'll decide what to do.

92
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:16,322
So think of something.

93
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,593
What did you do on your fake birthday?

94
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:23,496
My fake birthday?

95
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:24,530
Yes.

96
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:28,000
We can do what you did
on your fake birthday today!

97
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,869
I'll do it for you.

98
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:32,438
Okay.

99
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,107
You'll do it for me?

100
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:37,810
That's not a bad idea.

101
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:43,115
First, rent an indoor gymnasium,

102
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:46,819
preferably one that can hold
about 15,000 people.

103
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,421
What?

104
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,256
And you can invite

105
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:53,793
15 singers, actors, and comedians

106
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:57,763
as special guests, I trust?

107
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:58,965
What?

108
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,200
Can you gather
all the various news outlets

109
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:04,070
throughout Asia by today?

110
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:07,974
Your fake birthday party was that big?

111
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,110
Yes.

112
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:15,381
You seem to have a patchy picture
of who I am because I share a room with

113
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:17,516
the likes of you,
but I am actually all that.

114
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,853
Now, what will you start with?

115
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,224
The start to any birthday...

116
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,461
is seaweed soup!

117
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,466
SEAWEED SOUP

118
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:41,240
This is the only seaweed soup
I could get at this hour.

119
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,011
Ko Mi-nam.

120
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,346
There's sesame oil in seaweed soup, yes?

121
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,016
Yes, it's not good if it isn't.

122
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:52,685
What do you make sesame oil out of?

123
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,287
Sesame seeds...

124
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:57,757
Oh, that's right.

125
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,359
You're allergic to sesame seeds!

126
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,396
I almost died on my birthday,
thanks to you.

127
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,831
I'm sorry.

128
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,769
Moving on. What's next?

129
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,807
On your birthday,
you should get a birthday present!

130
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,817
This is the only place nearby
that sells present-worthy stuff.

131
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:29,055
You mean, the only place
within your price range.

132
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,092
Choose anything you want.

133
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:37,396
They have all the pencils
and clean notebooks that you use.

134
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:41,967
Oh! Tae-gyung!

135
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:48,607
Isn't this you?

136
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:49,642
What's me?

137
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,280
On here, on the ttakji! It's you!

138
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:57,750
What, why would I be on a ttakji?

139
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:00,519
His name's Tae-gyung!

140
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:03,489
And his eyes are all like this,
it's you for sure.

141
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:06,525
What the heck is this?

142
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,461
Why is this here?

143
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,864
This one's Shin-woo and this one's Jermy!

144
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,234
Mr. An...

145
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,170
When did he even make and sell these!

146
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,806
Tae-gyung, look! There are stickers too!

147
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:26,245
That A.N.JELL ttakji is our best seller.

148
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,982
I guess I don't have one yet...

149
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,185
Ko Mi-nam. What are you doing? Let's go.

150
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:48,400
Mr. An told us he would only
put these characters

151
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:51,537
in triangle kimbap and bread!

152
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:53,706
How dare he make these ttakjis?

153
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:57,610
Only the most popular people
have ttakjis made of them.

154
00:12:57,843 --> 00:13:02,281
Oh, and they said that yours
is the number one seller!

155
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:03,749
Congratulations.

156
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,218
Oh, thanks so much.

157
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:10,656
Hope you get popular soon,
so you can have your own ttakji.

158
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,895
All right, then.
Let's see how well you fly.

159
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,500
What? That's it?

160
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:24,170
You think that's really it?

161
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:26,338
Move out of the way.

162
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,509
Here comes the Hwang Tae-gyung ttakji!

163
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:38,117
Shin-woo's went further!

164
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,188
You just watch. The real game starts now.

165
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:46,192
What the heck?

166
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:47,927
Look at that!

167
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:49,528
What? Why is mine the only defective one?

168
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:52,331
Call them. Return them all.

169
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,700
Did you see that?
Shin-woo's went all the way over there!

170
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,869
Don't overreact, mine can go that far too!

171
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,307
Tae-gyung!

172
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,276
Oh, Jermy...

173
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,778
Did you see that?

174
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:07,112
I didn't, no...

175
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,548
Behold.
This is the Hwang Tae-gyung Ttakji!

176
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,285
-Yes!
-Where did it go?

177
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,587
That way, idiot!

178
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,227
Your birthday's almost over, Tae-gyung.

179
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:25,030
You didn't have birthday soup,
you didn't get a birthday present.

180
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:27,766
I did nothing for you today.

181
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,705
It was certainly chaotic,
but it was a good way to kill the time.

182
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:34,540
Otherwise...

183
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:37,176
The day would have been

184
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:39,178
devastatingly long.

185
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:42,181
Because of you,

186
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,250
because I had you,

187
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:46,785
I lost that precious thing.

188
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:49,288
Yes.

189
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,291
You must have been devastated
because I left you.

190
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:53,926
But,

191
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:55,895
when I had lost him...

192
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,430
because of you,

193
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:00,900
I was devastated too.

194
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:12,177
Tae-gyung!

195
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,347
There are still five minutes left.
Want me to finish it off?

196
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,583
How?

197
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,952
My Reverend Mother, who raised me,

198
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:22,988
used to always do this for me
before my birthday ended.

199
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:24,957
What was it?

200
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:27,993
Don't get mad, okay?

201
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,429
If you think I'll get mad, don't do it.

202
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,600
You told me to decide for today,
so I'll do what I want.

203
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:50,482
Today is the most precious day,

204
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,885
for you were born.

205
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,889
Thank you for being born.

206
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:03,329
Ko Mi-nam.

207
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:07,499
No informal speech. I won't have it.

208
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:27,820
Reverend Mother,

209
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:31,557
I want to give him
all the warm consolation and comfort

210
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,727
that I received every birthday.

211
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:37,162
Please...

212
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:39,264
comfort him.

213
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,883
Your birthday's over now, Tae-gyung.

214
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:01,020
We should get inside quietly.
Everyone must be sleeping.

215
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,963
Ko Mi-nam was pretty useful today.

216
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:27,913
For the security of the organization

217
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:30,149
and for her peace of mind

218
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,117
I tried to be cool.

219
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,455
But I didn't think it would be this hard.

220
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,471
Leader, I'm sorry about yesterday.

221
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:53,505
I'm so sorry.

222
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:58,210
Ma'am.

223
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:01,380
-Yes?
-I'll look over you touching my package,

224
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:04,550
but I cannot be lenient
on you touching me.

225
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,120
Oh, sure. Yes, got it.

226
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:12,691
Wow.

227
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,327
So we're on ttakjis too?

228
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:16,462
These are a bit silly.

229
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:19,898
They said they were all the rage
among the elementary school kids.

230
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:23,402
Mi-nam's will be released soon.

231
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:26,171
I'm in charge of them.

232
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:33,479
Ko Mi-nam.

233
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:35,814
Which of these three
do you think is the best?

234
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:38,517
I don't know...

235
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,921
They said Tae-gyung's is the most popular.

236
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,791
But what do you think?

237
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:49,261
Which one do you like the most?

238
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,033
Out of these...

239
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:01,907
I like this one the best.

240
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:03,675
Shin-woo's?

241
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,782
Why! Mine's cute too!

242
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,751
Do you really like Shin-woo's the most?

243
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:14,987
I just like

244
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:17,089
these kinds of smiling faces.

245
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:19,992
Yours is cute too, Jermy.

246
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:23,095
Yes? So that means I'm second, then.

247
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,033
You don't know
the first thing about ttakjis.

248
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,202
The one that sells the most
is the best one.

249
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:40,379
I can't believe...

250
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:46,852
You heard that, didn't you?

251
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,387
She likes Shin-woo the most.

252
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,490
Tae-gyung, could you keep
an eye on Shin-woo?

253
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:53,325
Why should I?

254
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:54,927
You're last to her,

255
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,596
so you're the safest.

256
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,533
Let's keep a lookout
when she's with Shin-woo.

257
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:03,368
I should go keep an eye on him.

258
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,707
I never went last
in any popularity contests.

259
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:09,841
How dare you, Ko Mi-nam.

260
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:13,845
Whatever. It doesn't matter.

261
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:15,948
You get mad, you lose.

262
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:21,153
Freaking...

263
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,424
It's here?

264
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:26,491
Yes.

265
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:30,462
So, I really have to see Mr. An.

266
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:33,031
Tell Hoon-i, he'll relay it to him.

267
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:34,499
Well, I...

268
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:37,936
I just want to tell him
thank you for everything.

269
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:40,105
I should say that in person.

270
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:44,243
He's with a visitor right now,

271
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,711
but you can wait here.

272
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:47,946
-Shall I, then?
-Sure.

273
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:49,214
Thanks!

274
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,917
Oh, by the way, don't tell Mi-nam!

275
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:57,089
Since Hoon-i runs away
whenever I mention money,

276
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:00,225
I better just take it up with the boss.

277
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,362
Excuse me! Hello!

278
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:07,432
Oh wow. This is for Tae-gyung?

279
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,936
You're going this far to ask him
for the remake?

280
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:15,874
It's a bit complicated for me
to give it to him directly,

281
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:18,277
so just give it to him for me.

282
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,313
Tell him it's for various reasons.

283
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:26,885
I'm really sorry, but I don't think I can.

284
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,692
He's allergic to pollen too, so...

285
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:37,596
Is he?

286
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:41,767
Nothing goes right with us, it seems.

287
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,570
I'll still let him know, though.

288
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:50,442
Anyhow, the song you requested,
"What Do I Do?"

289
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:53,312
Did you work out the copyright issues
with the original composer?

290
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:54,713
I heard he passed away.

291
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:58,150
Mr. Ko Jae-hyeon has kids
who survived him.

292
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,920
I'm pretty sure
they're living with a relative.

293
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:06,091
I'm looking for them right now,
so it will be taken care of soon.

294
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:13,565
Miss! How much longer will he be?

295
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:14,866
A little bit longer, ma'am.

296
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:15,934
Okay, thank you.

297
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:18,437
This is so tiring.

298
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:21,640
If he's releasing a solo,

299
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:23,675
he'll make more money for sure.

300
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:27,679
And who else better to manage
the money than me,

301
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,349
his only relative? Yes.

302
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:41,159
Oh, it's Mo Hwa-ran.

303
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,264
Hello! Excuse me!

304
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:48,200
You're Mo Hwa-ran, aren't you?

305
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,036
I'm such a big fan of yours!

306
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:52,037
Thank you.

307
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,105
Oh, hold on.

308
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:56,875
You were beautiful back then
and you're still so lovely!

309
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:59,111
Can I get an autograph?

310
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,447
Autograph...

311
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:03,982
Oh, here we go.

312
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,517
-Can you...
-Sure.

313
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:09,755
I really love all your songs, I really do.

314
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:12,657
Oh, my little brother composed
a song of yours.

315
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,394
Is that right?

316
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,829
Yes, of course! It's...

317
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:23,268
This was so unexpected,
meeting such a star. I'm blanking.

318
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:25,871
It was like, do something or other...

319
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,539
Give him my best.

320
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:29,040
Do something or other.

321
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:33,578
It was definitely like,
"Let's do something somehow..."

322
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,116
Oh, "What Do I Do"! That's it.

323
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:39,651
Mo Hwa-ran...

324
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,656
When will I ever see Mo Hwa-ran again?

325
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,732
We'll film the two leads promising
eternal love to each other today.

326
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:56,134
A heartbreaking scene.
It's also the last scene,

327
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,269
so let's do our best!

328
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:02,507
If you break up, you break up. That's it.

329
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:04,543
Why is this scene even needed?

330
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:09,281
The director explained that
there has to be a pretty scene like this

331
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:11,383
before a breakup to amplify the sadness.

332
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,154
Mi-nam, the director said we need
to touch up on your makeup. Let's go.

333
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,326
I need to talk to the director
more about this.

334
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:40,078
Let's find you another tie. Hold on.

335
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:54,092
She's so pretty...

336
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:01,566
I need a bigger mirror.

337
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,034
Oh, there was one over here.

338
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:17,916
These are so pretty.

339
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,219
I have a pretty hairpin too.

340
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,960
This one, that Tae-gyung gave me
is pretty too.

341
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:30,829
This is all I need. Yes.

342
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:34,633
Is this too simple?

343
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:35,934
I think it's fine...

344
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:46,778
Why are you touching
other people's things, Mi-nam?

345
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,246
That's mine, isn't it?

346
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:51,116
No. This is mine.

347
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:52,884
What?

348
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:56,788
That's strange.

349
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,925
Why does a guy have a hairpin like that?

350
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:04,195
It's my little sister's.

351
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:06,965
Little sister?

352
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:08,466
Okay.

353
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:13,004
I think it will look good
on you too, Mi-nam.

354
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:18,610
You're cute and delicate, you'll pull off
a female look perfectly. Don't you agree?

355
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:22,480
Yes, if we apply the right makeup,
he might really pass for a woman.

356
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,617
You're so right. Let's try it!

357
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:30,455
You'll be so cute just applying this.

358
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:31,856
I want to see!

359
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:34,492
I don't want to. Stop it, please.

360
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,928
It's just for fun, don't be like that.

361
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:37,829
Hold him.

362
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:41,499
Hold still now, I'll put some on you.

363
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:42,901
Stop it, please.

364
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:43,868
Hold tight.

365
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:45,503
All right, here we go.

366
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:50,275
This isn't funny. Stop it.

367
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:52,410
Ko Mi-nam told you "No"!

368
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:54,813
It was just for fun.

369
00:26:56,147 --> 00:27:00,352
Mi-nam, did I make you mad?
I just wanted to be friends.

370
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,221
No, I'm all right.

371
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:04,389
Are you really all right?

372
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:06,558
Yes. What brings you here?

373
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:09,995
We heard it was your last day of shooting
so we tagged along with Mr. An.

374
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:11,796
You look great today.

375
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:16,201
You really look like a handsome man!

376
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:18,637
Did you eat?

377
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:20,872
I hate her so much.

378
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:23,541
I have half a mind to spill everything
and blow her stupid cover.

379
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:27,545
No, then it's the end for me
and Hwang Tae-gyung too.

380
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,147
I don't want that.

381
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:39,924
All right then.

382
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,993
you're very sad, mournful,

383
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:44,462
as you're putting the ring on each other!

384
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:58,677
Okay.

385
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:03,415
Now gaze into each other's eyes sadly,
ever so sadly!

386
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:07,085
Now, Tae-gyung!
lean in, slowly, that's it!

387
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,960
Mi-nam, you're doing great!

388
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:18,163
Nice.

389
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:32,744
Doesn't this remind you of that day?

390
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:36,014
Why should it?
It was and still is just an act.

391
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,750
It's nothing memorable.

392
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:42,554
An act...

393
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:47,058
Why isn't he giving us the cut?

394
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:48,593
This is way too long.

395
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,528
He must not be satisfied with our acting.

396
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:53,198
Let me do it properly so we can end this.

397
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:14,819
Cut!

398
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:19,090
Okay! That's a wrap!

399
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:20,692
I knew it.

400
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,962
The vibe is really different with
actual lovers. That was great.

401
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,865
-Thank you.
-Good work.

402
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:28,800
Did I surprise you?

403
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,437
Just relax. Look how quickly
we ended with proper acting.

404
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:40,445
"Relax"?

405
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:42,714
What's wrong with that Fake Fairy?

406
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:54,459
Ko Mi-nam!

407
00:29:58,096 --> 00:29:59,197
You were amazing, Ko Mi-nam!

408
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:01,533
Thanks, Jermy.

409
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:04,702
Go change.
Mr. An is throwing a wrap-up party!

410
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:07,172
Let's go!

411
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:18,650
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

412
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:19,617
Sure.

413
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:22,320
I'll wait for you.
Let's go to the party together.

414
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:24,122
Sure! Let me take care
of the sponsorships first.

415
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,994
It's Ko Mi-nam's.

416
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:33,865
Get it dry cleaned
and back to the sponsors.

417
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,800
-Yes, ma'am.
-Make sure to return it in time.

418
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:36,701
Yes, ma'am.

419
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,671
He-i, let's go!

420
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:40,638
Yes!

421
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:42,774
Ms. Wang!

422
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:45,276
Have you seen my clothes?
The one I wore before.

423
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,177
What's wrong?

424
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:52,851
Where did it go? It's gone.

425
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,720
Did you see anything in here?

426
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,088
I didn't see anything, no.

427
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:58,423
Where did it go?

428
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,826
Make sure you look carefully,
just in case you miss it, Mi-nam.

429
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:05,463
I'll head out first, come to my car, okay?

430
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:06,497
Oh, sure.

431
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,835
What are you looking for?
We have to get going.

432
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:14,038
I have to find it. Go ahead without me.

433
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:19,310
What are you saying? This is a wrap-up
party for your music video! You must go.

434
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:21,179
Look for it later.

435
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:22,747
-No, I--
-Let's go,

436
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,148
-they're all waiting!
-I...

437
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:28,386
I have to...

438
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:33,791
To the success of Ko Mi-nam's
single album! Cheers!

439
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:35,526
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

440
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:40,098
Congrats!

441
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:45,003
Ko Mi-nam! Have a glass!

442
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:47,538
Yes, have a glass.

443
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:49,641
Mi-nam, drink up, come on!

444
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:51,776
The shoot ended well,
but why the long face?

445
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:53,478
Did something happen?

446
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:56,781
I lost something really important.

447
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:57,949
Yes?

448
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:01,085
If it's that important to you,
let's go look for it after.

449
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:01,986
I'll help you.

450
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,990
Really? Thank you, Shin-woo.

451
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:09,360
I'm telling you, get a chopper in the air
and throw in an explosion!

452
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,728
My idea isn't bad!

453
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:16,301
Hey. Tae-gyung.

454
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:17,902
Look.

455
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,672
You get Mi-nam. I'll mark Kang Shin-woo.

456
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:24,342
Okay, here we go.

457
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:28,613
Yes, Shin-woo,
I had something to tell you.

458
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:39,324
Look at her face change
the moment Shin-woo leaves.

459
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:41,826
She's got some guts.

460
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,528
She's going to get caught at this rate.

461
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:50,668
Why you...

462
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:53,271
You only act close to me
when you need something from me,

463
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:55,740
but you won't even look at me now?

464
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:08,886
-Hey.
-Where are you going?

465
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,490
Hey, take a shot before you go!

466
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,196
This is so cheap.

467
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:22,533
Guess she really is a girl
seeing how she wants stuff like this.

468
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:28,172
Let's see how agitated
Ko Mi-nam can get, yes?

469
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:34,112
PRICE 3000 WON

470
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:42,920
Mi-nam, what are you doing?
It's your party.

471
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,625
Hey... That hairpin.

472
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,060
What?

473
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:51,462
That hairpin... You found it, right?

474
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,498
What are you talking about?

475
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:58,536
That's my hairpin. The one you saw before.

476
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:01,105
What? What do you mean?

477
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:05,109
Why would I find another person's hairpin
and pin it on my head?

478
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,111
This is mine.

479
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:10,081
But it looks exactly like mine.

480
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:13,151
You mean yours looked exactly like mine.

481
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:15,853
Did you lose yours?

482
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:17,889
Oh, you poor thing.

483
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:20,391
Didn't you say it was your sister's?
How did this happen?

484
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:24,395
It looks so much like mine.
Can I have a look?

485
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:30,368
Do you really want this that badly?

486
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:35,106
It feels like your sister's an excuse,

487
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:38,142
and in fact it's you
who's desperate to get it.

488
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:40,645
You're acting like a girl.

489
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:46,284
It's so weird for a guy to carry
a hairpin around. You're not a girl.

490
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:48,686
Forget the hairpin,

491
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,857
and buy your sister a better one
when you see her next time.

492
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:56,828
Yes. You're right.

493
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:59,730
It's best I don't look for it.

494
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:13,244
For the next music video...

495
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:15,046
Of course!

496
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:15,947
Mr. An!

497
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,282
I'm heading out early with Mi-nam.

498
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:20,651
What? Why? We're just getting started!

499
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:24,622
Mi-nam lost something on site
so we're going to go look for it.

500
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,492
Yes? Okay, go and come
right back after you find it.

501
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:31,395
Shin-woo, I didn't finish what
I wanted to tell you! You can't leave!

502
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:32,597
I have to go with Mi-nam--

503
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:33,965
Oh, well,

504
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:36,134
Tae-gyung! You go with him.

505
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:39,303
Shin-woo and I have things
to talk about. Thanks, Tae-gyung.

506
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:42,607
So about the ttakjis. I was thinking...

507
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:46,244
Yes, Shin-woo seems busy.
You go, Tae-gyung.

508
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:51,749
What did you do now, Ko Mi-nam?

509
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:05,496
Hwang Tae-gyung!

510
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:10,735
Are you going to go take care
of Ko Mi-nam again?

511
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:12,370
I mean,

512
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,907
she's so out of it all the time,
it must be tiring to take care of her.

513
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:17,875
Yes. It's tiring.

514
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:20,511
Because she's not good
at faking and lying, unlike you.

515
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:24,782
No, I think she's pretty good at them.

516
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:29,954
She demanded I give her my hairpin
because it was the one she lost.

517
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:33,991
Guess her girl side came out
and she was jealous.

518
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:35,226
What?

519
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,496
Wait. That hairpin...

520
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:40,431
Yes, this one.

521
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:43,634
She told you she lost that one?

522
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:45,303
This one is mine.

523
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:50,241
I just told you, she lost hers
and kept insisting I give her mine.

524
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:54,111
Probably because
it was the exact same one.

525
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:57,848
Did you even see hers? I did
and it doesn't look like this at all.

526
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,920
PRICE 3000 WON

527
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:07,391
Hey, Fakey. Do you know
how much that hairpin is?

528
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:08,459
It's cheap.

529
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:10,962
Like, 3,000 won?

530
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:13,965
No. It's worth 100,000 won.

531
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:15,499
What?

532
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:18,469
Give it here. That's Ko Mi-nam's.

533
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,538
How do you know that?

534
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,242
I bought it for her,
so I know it very well.

535
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:25,443
Give it to me.

536
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:28,813
You bought it?

537
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:30,648
For Ko Mi-nam?

538
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:31,749
Yes, I did.

539
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:35,219
And you just had to lie and steal it
from that clumsy idiot?

540
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:36,721
Give it to me. Now.

541
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:49,900
Good thing you're not embarrassed
about lying in front of me.

542
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:53,104
Otherwise, how mortifying
must this have been?

543
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:10,621
Ko Mi-nam.

544
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:12,323
I heard you lost something.

545
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:16,427
Yes.

546
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:21,132
I lost the hairpin you bought for me.

547
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,735
You're so annoying.

548
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:26,837
You couldn't keep your head together
for one second?

549
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:30,241
But no need to be so upset.

550
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,009
I'm all right.

551
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,147
You are?

552
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:41,052
I won't look for it.
It doesn't suit me anyway.

553
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:43,387
I hope someone else finds it

554
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:45,723
and uses it well.

555
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:50,594
Fine. Don't look for it.

556
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:53,331
That hairpin ran away
because it knew it didn't suit you.

557
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,966
I'm sure it's happy now with a new owner.

558
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:58,269
That's what I hope as well!

559
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:01,238
Forget it, Ko Mi-nam.

560
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:03,341
Don't you think about looking for it.

561
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:05,710
If you do, I'll kill you.

562
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,378
I won't!

563
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:17,722
Hold it in, control yourself.

564
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:22,560
KO MI-JA, 010-5374-8255

565
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:24,995
You found her already?

566
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:26,897
Yes, just the phone number though.

567
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,834
It seemed like she didn't have
a permanent address.

568
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:33,504
Well, if we have the phone number,
we're set.

569
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:37,842
It seems that she's currently
going through some monetary issues.

570
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:41,078
All the better for me.

571
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,447
If she needs money,

572
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,550
settling for a sum in exchange
for the copyright should be easy.

573
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:49,353
Will you contact her directly?

574
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:57,928
Is there really nothing left to sell?

575
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:00,598
Any of Leader's stuff
will go for a high price...

576
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,609
Is this Miss Ko Mi-ja's cell phone?

577
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,578
Who is this?

578
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:17,114
Your brother...

579
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:19,517
was Mr. Ko Jae-hyeon, right?

580
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:22,386
Yes?

581
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,757
There's something concerning him
that I have to talk to you about.

582
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:29,593
I was hoping we could talk in person.

583
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:32,430
Yes!

584
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,532
Oh, there! Yes.

585
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,701
Yes, I'll see you there, then.

586
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:39,437
May I get your name--

587
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,072
Hello?

588
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:45,209
What the heck, she just hung up on me!

589
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:50,381
"Contact my secretary"?

590
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:52,750
Is she a high-ranking person?

591
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:54,552
Who could it be?

592
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:02,359
Anything worth selling? Leader, I'm sorry!

593
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:04,528
MO HWA-RAN
TIME FLYING BACKWARDS

594
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:09,233
Jae-hyeon.

595
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:12,736
It will all work out.

596
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:16,607
Soon...

597
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:19,944
I will be able to meet these kids as well.

598
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:24,215
They must be a grown up by now.

599
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:14,031
-Oh my goodness.
-Get off the stage!

600
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,267
I can't look!

601
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,458
Wasn't tonight super fun?
I think it will go down in history!

602
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:43,561
Quiet, Mi-nam's sleeping.

603
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:45,095
Oh, is he?

604
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:49,300
Wait, didn't he say
he was going to go look for something?

605
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:50,868
He decided not to.

606
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:53,304
He said he wasn't in the circumstance
to keep it.

607
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:54,905
What was it?

608
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:56,106
I don't know.

609
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:59,643
But he seemed worse off when he said that

610
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,579
than when he was flustered

611
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:03,581
about losing it.

612
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:08,786
Maybe because he knew he couldn't find it
even though he wanted to?

613
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:11,255
Whatever it may be,

614
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:14,024
that's really sad. I feel bad for him.

615
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:39,249
Just say you want to find it
if you want to.

616
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:43,220
Why say you don't want to and get me
into this complicated mess?

617
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:47,858
I told her not to go look for it,
but if I give it to her saying I found it,

618
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:49,259
I'll look like a fool.

619
00:43:50,894 --> 00:43:52,863
Forget it. I won't give it to her.

620
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:56,934
No.

621
00:43:57,434 --> 00:43:59,069
Let's be calm and think it through.

622
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:02,806
What can I do to give this back to her

623
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:04,875
without looking like a fool?

624
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:11,215
This pig rabbit is annoying me to death!

625
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:14,318
Yes, that's it.

626
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,353
Pig Rabbit!

627
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:25,429
Damn...

628
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:41,178
I must find one rabbit and one pig.

629
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:52,823
It's a rabbit!

630
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:55,159
Pig...

631
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:03,167
A pig!

632
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:30,327
Now, it's time for surgery, you two.

633
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:48,579
This is about the right length.

634
00:45:52,716 --> 00:45:53,550
Pig.

635
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:55,486
I need your nose.

636
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:33,290
This will require utmost precision.

637
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,027
Oh, dear.

638
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:01,451
Success!

639
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:13,530
Ten minutes have past.

640
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:16,366
Now, let's see how well it stuck.

641
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:23,373
Perfect.

642
00:47:27,644 --> 00:47:30,881
I will give this to you, Pig Rabbit.

643
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:42,559
There.

644
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,461
Now, let's go to Ko Mi-nam.

645
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:04,381
A rabbit with a pig's nose.

646
00:48:07,484 --> 00:48:08,485
A pig rabbit?

647
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:16,760
A pig rabbit... Is this me?

648
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:20,464
Wait!

649
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:21,965
My hairpin!

650
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,167
Why does she have it?

651
00:48:58,535 --> 00:49:01,171
You're in a good mood today.

652
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:03,774
When I woke up today morning
there was a present at my bedside.

653
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,876
Santa must have came by or something!

654
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:08,178
Right.

655
00:49:08,545 --> 00:49:09,746
You must have been dreaming again.

656
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:27,164
You must have caught a cold.

657
00:49:38,275 --> 00:49:40,344
Ko Mi-nam. Drink some water.

658
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:44,414
Mi-nam, you sound like you have a cold,
have a warm cup of tea.

659
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:48,952
Ko Mi-nam! Juice delivery!
Have some juice.

660
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:53,890
What do you want to drink, Mi-nam?

661
00:49:57,194 --> 00:50:00,130
Do you want tea? Water?

662
00:50:01,565 --> 00:50:02,666
Juice?

663
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:06,203
I want...

664
00:50:10,874 --> 00:50:12,342
I think something warm.

665
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:19,916
Ko Mi-nam. Drink this too,
juice is good for colds too.

666
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:50,414
All right, A.N.JELL! Let's see you
express your signature color.

667
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:51,782
Make sure it fits the image.

668
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:41,998
This is so sour, my tongue's going numb.

669
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:44,301
Why the heck am I Lime?

670
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:46,169
Can't I change the color?

671
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:51,007
Like Yellow! That banana looks good.

672
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:54,811
Tae-gyung. Eat a bunch of these
and you'll want to throw up.

673
00:51:55,378 --> 00:51:57,547
It wants to eat me or something.
It keeps biting me!

674
00:51:58,548 --> 00:52:00,484
I really do like flowers.

675
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:04,321
Ko Mi-nam. Don't come near me.
You're getting pollen all over the place.

676
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,959
We have barely started,
you can't get tired already!

677
00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:10,994
Look at how many we have got.

678
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:17,734
It's going to be hard eating them all.

679
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,769
My tongue will rip out if I do.

680
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:22,139
I'll turn into a monkey.

681
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:24,007
I'll do my best!

682
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:27,978
Why? Want to get in the advertiser's
good graces?

683
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:29,312
Flatterer.

684
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:30,647
Calm down, kiddo.

685
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:35,919
All right, A.N.JELL!
You're shooting well so far, yes?

686
00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:39,489
I brought someone for support
so you can cheer up!

687
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:40,457
Ta-da!

688
00:52:57,274 --> 00:53:00,677
Honey, your color's Lime?
That's my favorite!

689
00:53:01,478 --> 00:53:02,445
It's perfect.

690
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:11,588
Women in their twenties and thirties
prefer that color the most, so Tae-gyung.

691
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:14,791
The cute yellow that kids love
is for Jermy.

692
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:19,329
Black for Shin-woo, whose calm disposition
makes him a favorite among guy fans.

693
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:23,099
And Mi-nam is white
for his innocent image!

694
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:25,769
Aren't they perfect matches?

695
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:30,740
So that means Tae-gyung
is the most popular with women.

696
00:53:32,108 --> 00:53:33,944
I should be happy about it, right, Mi-nam?

697
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:38,048
Of course! Thank goodness
they do even like him that much, really.

698
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:40,283
"Thank goodness"?

699
00:53:41,284 --> 00:53:45,388
Yes. All you do is scowl but they love you
and not hate you, thank goodness.

700
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:51,161
You're the coolest, Tae-gyung!

701
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:57,634
Then what color do you like
the most, Mi-nam?

702
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:01,972
Oh, I...

703
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:04,007
I'm a guy, so...

704
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:07,444
I like black, the color guys prefer.

705
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:12,015
Black?

706
00:54:23,226 --> 00:54:24,127
Oh my.

707
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:26,930
I can't believe this, my goodness.

708
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:28,999
The one looking for me was

709
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:31,134
none other than you, Miss Mo!

710
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,069
Oh, my goodness gracious.

711
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:36,906
Are you really Jae-hyeon's...

712
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:40,443
Are you really Mr. Ko's

713
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:43,213
older sister?

714
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:44,881
Yes, I am!

715
00:54:45,515 --> 00:54:46,816
Ko Jae-hyeon, Ko Mi-ja.

716
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:48,752
We are siblings, yes we are!

717
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:51,921
I told you when we last met, remember?

718
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:53,590
Or you don't remember...

719
00:54:54,357 --> 00:54:56,559
I told you my brother made you a song.

720
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,362
It was "What Do I Do?"

721
00:54:59,562 --> 00:55:01,231
Where are Mr. Ko's children?

722
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:04,200
Excuse me?

723
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:05,802
Twins, right? A boy and a girl.

724
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:08,138
Right?

725
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:11,441
Yes.

726
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:12,542
I must...

727
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:15,412
meet those children.

728
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:17,781
Where are they now?

729
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:23,987
Can I meet them immediately?

730
00:55:32,128 --> 00:55:33,363
Are you sure you don't have a cold?

731
00:55:33,963 --> 00:55:35,098
Want me to go buy some medicine?

732
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:41,871
Mr. Ma gave me some medicine to take.

733
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:43,673
I'll go take one.

734
00:55:48,812 --> 00:55:49,913
I hate her!

735
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:52,549
Why are they treating her like glass?
Like, what is she even?

736
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:10,433
Ko Mi-nam.

737
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:16,306
I really couldn't care less
about your preferences

738
00:56:16,606 --> 00:56:20,009
but it irks me that you keep treating
me this way. It irks me very much.

739
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:23,947
Tae-gyung. Just pay no heed to my
preferences, like you have been doing.

740
00:56:24,981 --> 00:56:26,750
My ttakji sells the most,

741
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,586
and I rank number one
on all the popularity contests.

742
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:31,488
Who are you to challenge that?

743
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:33,823
Okay, I understood.

744
00:56:34,624 --> 00:56:36,126
All the first places are yours, Tae-gyung!

745
00:56:37,293 --> 00:56:38,128
Hold on.

746
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:40,630
Tell me honestly.

747
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:43,400
What's your favorite color?

748
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:44,467
What?

749
00:56:45,635 --> 00:56:47,604
I said it was black already...

750
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:51,374
Yes, a made-up answer
because you're pretending to be a guy.

751
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:53,877
What's your actual favorite color?

752
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:55,311
What?

753
00:56:56,279 --> 00:56:57,447
Well, which is it?

754
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:01,718
Tell me. As your true female self.

755
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:19,702
To be honest...

756
00:57:22,472 --> 00:57:24,340
I like the color white.

757
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:29,312
Look at you slithering your way out.

758
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,449
Ko Mi-nam. You've gotten better
at making up answers too.

759
00:57:33,049 --> 00:57:34,451
Just improving day by day?

760
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:43,860
I can't.

761
00:57:45,695 --> 00:57:47,997
I can't have my nose turn red,
we have to shoot soon.

762
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:51,167
I'll wash my face instead.

763
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:05,548
Hwang Tae-gyung.

764
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:08,518
Have you been regarding Ko Mi-nam
as a woman?

765
00:58:38,615 --> 00:58:39,549
Are you here?

766
00:58:41,317 --> 00:58:42,151
What?

767
00:58:42,652 --> 00:58:43,653
You are.

768
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:46,389
Ko Mi-nam. Get out here.

769
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:56,399
He-i.

770
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:58,635
I thought you walked into the wrong one

771
00:58:59,002 --> 00:59:01,271
so I came after you to help you out.

772
00:59:04,073 --> 00:59:05,808
This is the men's room...

773
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:08,811
Yes, it is the men's room.

774
00:59:10,513 --> 00:59:12,015
So why are you here?

775
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:14,684
You should be at the women's.

776
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:20,256
You're a woman, Ko Mi-nam.

777
00:59:21,024 --> 00:59:22,125
I know everything.

778
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:26,329
I can't stand you
strutting about any longer.

779
00:59:26,429 --> 00:59:27,297
Follow me.

780
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:30,266
What are you doing? Let go!

781
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:32,101
He-i, let go of me! Please!

782
00:59:32,168 --> 00:59:33,002
Shut up!

783
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,571
-He-i!
-Come on!

784
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:44,547
You were having the time of your life as
a fake guy, hanging out with them, right?

785
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:50,787
Which color do you like the most?

786
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:54,023
Yellow?

787
00:59:54,624 --> 00:59:55,525
Black?

788
00:59:56,025 --> 00:59:56,859
Or...

789
00:59:58,261 --> 00:59:59,095
Lime?

790
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:03,466
He-i.

791
01:00:05,735 --> 01:00:07,503
Don't say my name.

792
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:10,173
Tell me. Who do you like the most?

793
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:13,876
Want me to be specific?

794
01:00:14,911 --> 01:00:18,114
Jermy? Kang Shin-woo? Or...

795
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:20,383
Hwang Tae-gyung?

796
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,965
