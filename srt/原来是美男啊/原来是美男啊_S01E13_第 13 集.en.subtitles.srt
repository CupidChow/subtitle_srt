1
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:20,620
Tae-gyung.

2
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:26,593
Ko Mi-nam.

3
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,229
From now on, you have my permission

4
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:31,664
to love me.

5
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:39,973
Really?

6
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:43,309
Can I really like you?

7
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:48,148
Won't you feel upset?
Wouldn't it be ridiculous?

8
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:51,317
I mean,

9
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:53,887
it's a bit surprising
and I feel rather strange,

10
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,488
but it's not bad.

11
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,525
Will it really not be...

12
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,828
troublesome to you?

13
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:03,897
Ko Mi-nam.

14
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:07,534
I receive love from millions of people.

15
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,335
That's my job.

16
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:13,773
One more person joining those millions

17
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:15,442
isn't going to trouble me at all.

18
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:18,078
It's just who I am.

19
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:19,813
So you can like me.

20
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:22,248
I'll allow it. It's fine.

21
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:25,852
Thank you.

22
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:28,188
Thank you for letting me like you,

23
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:31,191
even just as your fan.

24
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,126
Thank you so much.

25
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:35,628
Fan?

26
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:39,099
I mean... Sure, fan.

27
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:41,568
Ko Mi-nam.

28
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:43,503
Come here.

29
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:06,793
Welcome to my fan club.

30
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,150
You're a special fan.

31
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:32,418
Consider it an honor.

32
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,882
That woman who ran away,

33
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,518
she met with Kang Shin-woo here for sure.

34
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:14,060
It must be the same one he said

35
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:16,496
was his girlfriend last time.

36
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:21,334
Why was she here?

37
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:24,837
What was she doing?

38
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:27,373
Did she sit here?

39
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,778
Oh, it's a picture.

40
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:37,116
A picture...

41
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,986
Wait, she's dressed like that woman!

42
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:41,521
This has to be her!

43
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,560
Her face looks familiar...

44
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:54,934
Ko Mi-nam?

45
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:04,444
It was Ko Mi-nam?

46
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:17,257
Reverend Mother.

47
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:20,059
Thank you for comforting me.

48
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,195
I have to go now.

49
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:27,634
Is he your star, Gemma?

50
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,169
Yes.

51
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:35,608
A star, far, far away from me.

52
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,820
Reverend Mother.

53
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,123
Stay healthy. Be well.

54
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:52,325
Goodbye.

55
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:19,085
And that star came all that way
to find you, Gemma.

56
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:25,692
You two twinkle so brightly,
it's beautiful.

57
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,830
As stars that shine brightest in darkness,

58
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:34,600
I pray that they will not lose their light

59
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:39,806
even when darkness overcomes them.

60
00:05:58,157 --> 00:05:59,459
They're all the same person, right?

61
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:02,962
Who is she?

62
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,764
Please explain.

63
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:18,311
What is that?

64
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,614
They're from Reverend Mother.

65
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:25,718
Oh, it's sour.

66
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,656
It's too sour, don't eat it, Tae-gyung.

67
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,259
I like sour things.

68
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,495
You know I like lime, right?

69
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:36,996
Give me one.

70
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,870
Ko Mi-nam. I'm driving right now.

71
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:47,340
Do you know how much concentration
is required for me when I drive at night?

72
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,175
Oh, I'm sorry.

73
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:01,687
I can't take my hands
off the wheel for a second.

74
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,335
You really do like sour foods.

75
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:20,306
I'll find you the most sour-looking one.

76
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:26,345
Ko Mi-nam!

77
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:28,381
Don't be near Shin-woo

78
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,116
dressed like that from now on.

79
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,554
Oh, right. You said it didn't suit me
and that it was ridiculous.

80
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:38,357
I should get changed
into guy clothes quickly.

81
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:39,792
It's fine when you're with me.

82
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:42,028
But not Shin-woo.

83
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,897
This is why Hoon-i, Miss Wang,

84
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,600
and even I thought you liked Shin-woo.

85
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:51,337
Did they really?

86
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,841
I made things difficult
for Shin-woo again,

87
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,276
when he was nothing but kind to me.

88
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:01,247
I should be better to him from now on.

89
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:03,716
Be better to Shin-woo?

90
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,785
What kind of a conclusion is that?

91
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:10,823
Shin-woo?

92
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,054
Shin-woo.

93
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:45,124
Is it true? The reporter found my picture?

94
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:46,225
Yes.

95
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,927
The girl part of you was found out.

96
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,309
Oh, so this lady

97
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:07,213
is Mi-nam's twin sister.

98
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,816
Here, take a look.

99
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:14,053
Twins, born on the same day!
Does that answer your question?

100
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,954
KO MI-NAM, KO MI-NYEO

101
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,056
They are twins indeed.

102
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:23,195
That must be why

103
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:26,065
she was at his concert,

104
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:30,136
solo album premiere, and his photo shoot.

105
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,841
So you're saying Mi-nam's sister

106
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:37,910
is dating Shin-woo?

107
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:39,512
Exactly.

108
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:44,216
Shin-woo said
he'll bring his girlfriend over,

109
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,419
so you can see for yourself.

110
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,288
We don't have time. We have to go now.

111
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:52,992
I'm really scared.

112
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,761
Do you think he really won't notice?

113
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,364
Just stay calm.

114
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:01,734
Shin-woo, fend off all the questions.

115
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:05,871
You only answer in yes or no's
when you absolutely have to.

116
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:10,643
You'll do great. I know you will.

117
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:15,548
Can I pass as a woman,
instead of Ko Mi-nam?

118
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,892
You're definitely a woman in my eyes.

119
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:43,442
She's my woman now.

120
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:45,211
I'll take her now.

121
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:26,552
I know it has to be done,

122
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,688
but that's the second time
I had to hear that.

123
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,757
"My woman"?

124
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:39,999
They're here.

125
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,240
Oh, my goodness!

126
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,678
Wow! This is insane!

127
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,547
This is seriously an exclusive!

128
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,053
I can't believe this! What luck! Wow!

129
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,064
This is so amazing!

130
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:16,469
She's just a normal person,
so she's very nervous right now.

131
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:21,540
I ask that you don't reveal
too much about her.

132
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:24,009
Oh, sure. I'll make sure of that.

133
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:29,181
You promised, an exclusive
special interview with just me.

134
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,050
This is going to be

135
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:35,020
the cover story for our weekly magazine
this weekend!

136
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:36,856
If this story is released somewhere else,

137
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:39,992
I can't make good
on the promise to protect her.

138
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,828
I trust you so trust me!

139
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,197
I'll look forward to a great article.

140
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:49,168
Exclusive! Special!

141
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,037
See him off, will you?

142
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:05,918
Tae-gyung.

143
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:12,758
You knew everything already, didn't you?

144
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:22,201
Shin-woo seems to really like
Mi-nam's sister.

145
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,237
Yes?

146
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:27,072
He gave her high heels when he confessed.

147
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:29,441
I think he wanted
to make her into Cinderella.

148
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,245
You're only Cinderella if the shoe fits.

149
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:38,784
Don't just focus on your loves.
Remember to take care of your fans too,

150
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:40,920
They fawn over you now,

151
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,189
but they can just as easily
find someone and get married.

152
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:44,590
You know well...

153
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:48,627
that the love you receive as a star
has its limits.

154
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:56,769
Yes.

155
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:59,839
Fans can easily change their hearts.

156
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,675
They can choose another man
over us at any time.

157
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,811
But you can't go and argue with them.

158
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:08,881
What do I do?

159
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:31,804
I wanted more time with my girlfriend,

160
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:34,406
but my brother-in-law appeared too early.

161
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,877
Shin-woo. I'm so sorry.

162
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,346
Still, you did well during the interview.

163
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,282
That was all you, honestly.

164
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:46,952
I was so nervous, I could barely speak.

165
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:47,987
That's true.

166
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:49,488
You were pretty awkward.

167
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,792
We should prepare, just in case
something like this happens again.

168
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,494
I'll do anything necessary
as best as I can.

169
00:14:56,395 --> 00:15:00,399
Then let's first make up Kang Shin-woo
and Ko Mi-nyeo's clumsy love story.

170
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:01,901
Love story?

171
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,072
Should we start from our first encounter?

172
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,142
You and I first met

173
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:12,611
on the roof of the club.

174
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:32,231
That day,

175
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:36,235
Ko Mi-nam was first introduced
as the new member of A.N.JELL.

176
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,637
Oh, I remember that day.

177
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,974
Even though you were a lightweight,
you had some champagne.

178
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:45,477
You were so drunk,
you could barely stand up straight.

179
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:49,214
I was actually drunk that night
and ended up blacking out.

180
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,451
This dizziness kind of feels like
I'm drunk again.

181
00:15:57,056 --> 00:16:00,125
And as you fell, all tipsy,
you fell into my arms.

182
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,296
Tae-gyung, you all right? Let's go!

183
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,732
He's completely out of it.

184
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:09,134
Hey. Ko Mi-nam!

185
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:27,152
That's the first time I met you.

186
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:31,623
"Hello, Miss Ko Mi-nyeo!"

187
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:34,560
I acted all familiar with you
the moment I met you

188
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:38,864
and we were able to start off
as a man and a woman.

189
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:43,669
Hand.

190
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:50,876
If you called me Miss Ko Mi-nyeo,

191
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,978
how did I call you?

192
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,949
Shall I treat you like a little brother?

193
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,885
-What?
-I'll treat you like a little brother

194
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:01,120
like Jermy.

195
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,289
Right.

196
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:06,792
Thanks, Shin-woo.

197
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,999
I said you didn't have to be formal,
and to just call me Shin-woo.

198
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,403
So you agreed
and called me Shin-woo immediately.

199
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:19,505
And that's how we became close.

200
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:21,807
Go on.

201
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,845
Shin-woo.

202
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:31,250
Trying to call you in a girly way
feels awkward.

203
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,325
We moved along pretty quickly
in our relationship.

204
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:43,996
I asked you out on a date,
to the amusement park.

205
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,698
Oh, I remember that too.

206
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,401
You said you liked amusement parks, right?

207
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:51,503
You liked them too.

208
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:55,774
So our first date
was at an amusement park.

209
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,017
Shin-woo! Then should we go
to the amusement park now?

210
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:07,586
I'm exhausted right now.

211
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,054
Maybe later.

212
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:11,790
This is so fun!

213
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,734
We went on the Viking ride,
the merry-go-round,

214
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:24,570
and had a fun time.

215
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:27,539
Our date was at an amusement park.

216
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,776
And after that, we went to Myeongdong

217
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:34,179
and had noodles, ice cream,

218
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,215
and we went shopping too.

219
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:39,918
Wherever I said I wanted to go to,

220
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,087
you always came running to join me.

221
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,965
Are you here to pick me up?

222
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,467
I'll be right there!

223
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,214
Whenever you called me,

224
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:14,186
I always came running
to wherever you were.

225
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:16,488
I will memorize that.

226
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,257
We're moving along speedily.

227
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:26,999
But of all the questions reporters ask,
there's always this classic one.

228
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,403
And I don't know whether
I should make up the answer or not.

229
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:34,806
What is it?

230
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:38,977
"When was your first kiss?"

231
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,715
Can't we just say we haven't done it yet?

232
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,617
They'll just say we're lying.

233
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:58,330
Let's just say it was today.

234
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,704
I fell so deeply in love with you

235
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:09,808
that I decided to finally confess
how I feel about you.

236
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,584
I rented out a whole restaurant

237
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:20,752
and waited for you to come.

238
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:26,592
I wanted to put you
in front of a mirror...

239
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,661
and show you

240
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:32,731
that the person I like...

241
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:36,802
was this person.

242
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,137
When you stand here today,

243
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:41,773
you'll get to see the woman I love.

244
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:45,344
Then you saw yourself in the mirror

245
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,012
and got very surprised.

246
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,421
I really do see myself!

247
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:04,062
Yes. It's you.

248
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:07,466
And I said this to you.

249
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,169
I knew you were the one
from the beginning.

250
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,806
My eyes were set on you from then on.

251
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:21,013
I really, really like you.

252
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,983
Then I must have replied like this.

253
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:30,555
I like you too, Shin-woo.

254
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,327
Yes.

255
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:39,998
That's what you said to me with a smile.

256
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:48,373
But right now, it's just a shadow,

257
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:50,842
so I can't tell
what our expressions are like.

258
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:02,688
Your shadow looks excited.

259
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:08,760
Are you feeling better
about the whole Tae-gyung situation?

260
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:11,496
To be honest,

261
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,766
Tae-gyung found out how I feel about him.

262
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,470
But he didn't get mad or upset.

263
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:23,942
And for that, I'm thankful.

264
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:26,645
I see.

265
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,015
I thought as much.

266
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:35,454
At least now, I won't see you cry.

267
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:39,057
But you can tell all that
just from my shadow?

268
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:44,629
I can't tell what face you're making
just by this, though.

269
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:48,533
That shadow is just hiding it.

270
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,637
But it may be a sad face.

271
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:57,642
Shin-woo.

272
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:01,947
The clumsy love story ends
with a happy ending.

273
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:03,482
Let's go home.

274
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,390
Shin-woo didn't look very happy just now.

275
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,893
I was too distracted by the shadows
to see closely.

276
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:38,216
Mo Hwa-ran, this witch.

277
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:43,422
She drove Mi-nam and Mi-nyeo's mom
to her death!

278
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,392
What garbage did she spew
about love or whatever again?

279
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:52,798
Jae-hyeon and I were in love.

280
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,335
We broke up because of a mistake I made

281
00:23:58,603 --> 00:23:59,871
but our love never faded away.

282
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,674
What are you saying?

283
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,143
That my little brother

284
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:07,612
abandoned the woman
who was pregnant with their twins

285
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:10,582
and was having an affair with you?

286
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:15,120
He wasn't married to her,
so you can't call it an affair.

287
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,190
They dated briefly after we had broken up.

288
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:22,093
She got pregnant by mistake.

289
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:23,829
My brother!

290
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:29,501
My brother would never do such a thing!

291
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:31,770
Anyway.

292
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:34,840
She was left alone
and died while giving birth.

293
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:37,909
So I'm partly responsible
for her death as well.

294
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:42,347
What kind of a woman would be fine

295
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:45,217
seeing her man singing about love
with some other bitch

296
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,219
right in front of her?

297
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,856
You're right, she did die because of you!

298
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:54,025
That's why I told you
I'll pay off my debt to the kids!

299
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:56,628
You want to pay off your debt?

300
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:58,763
And this is the song you want to remake?

301
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:03,201
Yes, I can imagine how grateful
the kids will be when they hear it!

302
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:07,205
I can see it now, them dancing
at the song their father made,

303
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:09,574
begging his lover to come back
after ditching their mom!

304
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:11,977
I'm done here.
I've heard more than enough.

305
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:13,211
Freaking...

306
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:16,715
I'm going to give them
half of everything I own!

307
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,054
What?

308
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:25,190
If Jae-hyeon didn't die...

309
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,894
I would have been their mom.

310
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:36,201
Bring the kids to me.

311
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:41,306
Please help me pay off my debt to them.

312
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:50,549
Half of Mo Hwa-ran's wealth?

313
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,051
I bet it would be a crazy amount of money.

314
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:55,287
No...

315
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:57,622
Even if it is,

316
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:02,427
would they be grateful for the money
from the woman who took their mom's place?

317
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:06,464
Wait a second.

318
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:09,834
The money, yes.
I would be thankful for that.

319
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:13,672
If I don't say a thing, Mi-nam
would never find out.

320
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:17,008
Oh, my goodness gracious!

321
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:19,844
I don't know what the right course
of action is for this!

322
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,481
THIS IS A.N.JELL'S OFFICIAL FAN CAFE

323
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:25,383
NUMBER OF MEMBERS, 90,000

324
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,120
We have lost a significant amount of fans.

325
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,424
Pig Rabbit.

326
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:35,694
Don't you dare fall out like this,
without an ounce of loyalty!

327
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,245
You fell off that time...

328
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:59,718
Damn. Why did she even bring up
the word fan and make things complicated?

329
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:02,420
Whatever. Forget it.

330
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:04,356
She should be grateful to be my fan.

331
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:06,157
She can just be a fan and stay one.

332
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:10,562
No, let's be calm about this.
Think clearly.

333
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:14,766
What can I do to instill some sense
of a loyal fan

334
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:17,936
to this disloyal Pig Rabbit?

335
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:24,509
What is this?

336
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:25,977
By Pig Rabbit?

337
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,913
I joined the fan club today.
I'll do my best!

338
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:32,550
Did she just really
just join the fan club?

339
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:39,624
Just about anyone
could join the fan club. I didn't know.

340
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,728
NUMBER OF PEOPLE
WHO HAVE LEFT THE CAFE TODAY 345

341
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,998
And you can leave any time you want too.

342
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:52,137
NEW MEMBERS MUST PAST THE TEST
-ADMIN

343
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,538
What's this?

344
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:57,676
A test?

345
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,146
I didn't know you had to take a test.

346
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:08,553
Are you only allowed to join
if you've passed?

347
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:12,057
I got you, Pig Rabbit.

348
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:15,093
Let's see how much you know about me.

349
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:22,801
"How well do you know Hwang Tae-gyung?"

350
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:29,974
Out of ten, like...

351
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:33,111
Six? Seven?

352
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:37,082
"Seven"?

353
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:38,783
Just seven?

354
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,653
She's not that interested in me, clearly.

355
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,022
It's barely safe ground with a nine!

356
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:46,758
Next, how much you like me.

357
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:50,662
She always says I'm cool,
so this should be high.

358
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:55,767
"On a scale of one to ten,
rate how cool Hwang Tae-gyung is."

359
00:28:57,602 --> 00:28:59,204
How cool should I say he is?

360
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:04,743
Five. "Five"?

361
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,312
That's just average!

362
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:09,814
Pig Rabbit, you little!

363
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:13,952
No, you can't argue with a fan. You can't.

364
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:16,521
Let me check everything else then.

365
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:21,326
Oh, this one isn't great.

366
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,830
What? Four?

367
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:35,140
This one...

368
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:36,641
Maybe seven?

369
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:40,845
Seven again?

370
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:43,348
Now seven seems like a high number...

371
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:51,356
Oh, this one's seriously a bit...

372
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:57,762
Two. She chose two...

373
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,599
If my eyes aren't deceiving me,
this is a two.

374
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:04,969
Maybe I should have said three?

375
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:08,139
No! I have to be honest.

376
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:10,008
He's a two in this.

377
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:12,010
My average is five.

378
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,778
Exactly in the middle.

379
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:16,748
One firm shake
and she'll fall off immediately.

380
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:20,652
Maybe I shouldn't ask the last question.

381
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,555
What if my average drops?

382
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:30,395
This is more nerve-wracking
than my first piano contest.

383
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:43,942
"On a scale of one to ten,
rate how much you like Hwang Tae-gyung."

384
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:48,313
This one's...

385
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,274
Pig Rabbit,

386
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,776
I revoke my comments
about you being ungrateful.

387
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:22,347
I'm so proud. One hundred points!

388
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,952
Did I pass the test?

389
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:30,255
Why are there no more replies?

390
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,329
Ko Mi-nam. Time for a fan meeting.

391
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:39,464
Fan meeting?

392
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:59,517
I thought you didn't like rabbit songs.

393
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:01,552
Quite the opposite.

394
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:04,022
I overcame my rabbit trauma.

395
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:06,658
Take a seat.

396
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:15,199
What is a fan meeting, exactly?

397
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:20,638
When I invite the special people
who like me and have a fun time

398
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:22,840
together and make them happy.

399
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:26,144
Then you've invited me?

400
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:28,079
Thank you!

401
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:33,084
Thank you so much for coming.

402
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:36,254
Today's fan meeting
will have a special twist.

403
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:39,924
I'll receive song requests from the fans!

404
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,561
Any song you want me to sing,
please tell me.

405
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:44,662
Me?

406
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:48,866
Then you'll sing me a song I like?

407
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:52,370
Yes. Choose one, quick.

408
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:56,774
I need to choose one quick
before he changes his mind.

409
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:58,743
What would be a good one?

410
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:41,212
I'm going to pay off my debt to your kids.

411
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:45,817
Then this song...

412
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,554
will truly be mine.

413
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:54,525
A song you made for me...

414
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,129
and not that woman.

415
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:01,599
My song.

416
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:12,743
You only loved me.

417
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:17,648
You only loved me.

418
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:23,354
You only loved me.

419
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:29,494
You only loved me.

420
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:40,938
Welcome.

421
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:42,106
Hello.

422
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:45,743
The Nyx Hotel, please.

423
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:48,379
The Nyx Hotel.

424
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:50,448
The Nyx Hotel.

425
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:57,855
If the person we're going to see
is a friend of Father's,

426
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:00,258
they must know my mom well too.

427
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:02,360
Yes.

428
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,795
Well, she was just a friend
of your father's.

429
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,332
She probably doesn't know your mom.

430
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:11,102
Don't ask her.

431
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:12,303
Anyway...

432
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:17,074
she's a very close friend
of your father's.

433
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:18,075
Friend.

434
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:19,877
A singer friend.

435
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,146
Is she famous?

436
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:27,084
You'll see when you get there.

437
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,888
You know,

438
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,925
I thought about this a lot...

439
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:39,530
but I think it's best that you go.

440
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:40,865
Mi-nam.

441
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:45,169
Let's just think positively, okay? Okay?

442
00:36:57,114 --> 00:36:58,416
She brought the boy?

443
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:05,423
Didn't you say the boy was abroad
and his sister was in Korea?

444
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:07,558
Why did it change?

445
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:09,327
I am not sure why myself.

446
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,998
I guess I have to see them and find out.

447
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:15,533
Send them in.

448
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:53,504
Miss Mo?

449
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:55,706
You're...

450
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,076
You were that Ko Mi-nam?

451
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:05,549
You're my father's friend?

452
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:08,252
KOREA COMPOSERS ASSOCIATION REGISTRY

453
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:21,766
KO JAE-HYEON

454
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:22,667
Is it this person?

455
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:24,568
Ko Jae-hyeon?

456
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:26,604
He looks average. Normal.

457
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:31,475
Hey, can you tell me the singers
who sang the songs he wrote?

458
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,480
"Moon's Smile"?

459
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:39,050
That's Kim Jun's song.

460
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:43,354
Would he know anything about Ko Jae-hyeon?

461
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:48,092
Knowing Kim Jun, he would have been close
with his composers.

462
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:50,094
Want me to give you his phone number?

463
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:57,668
Ko Jae-hyeon...

464
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:00,304
You abandoned me for someone like him?

465
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,043
You must have found
those oh-so-precious kids already.

466
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,115
You look so much like Jae-hyeon.

467
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:17,655
I never would have thought
that you were my father's friend.

468
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:20,958
Since you're on the same team,

469
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:27,031
I take it you know that Tae-gyung's
doing a remake of my song.

470
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:29,734
That song

471
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:32,136
was composed by your father.

472
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:36,574
Because of you,

473
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:38,709
because I had you,

474
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,212
I lost that precious thing.

475
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:45,049
I lost him because of you.

476
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:48,619
Let me at least remember him.

477
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:51,756
Help me.

478
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,894
You said you were a friend of my father's.

479
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:01,432
That's all you were, right?

480
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,668
A friend?

481
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,171
Didn't your aunt tell you?

482
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,342
She said you were friends.

483
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:16,113
Yes.

484
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,183
We were friends.

485
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:22,620
He was so talented,

486
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:24,722
it made me sad that he didn't get
the accolade he deserved.

487
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,358
That's why I'm doing this remake.

488
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,493
It's also the song I love the most.

489
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:33,063
You're...

490
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:35,633
You're okay with it too.

491
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,334
Right?

492
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:44,208
You're a wonderful friend.

493
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:46,677
Thank you.

494
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:54,318
Could you keep it a secret

495
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,321
until the song's finished?

496
00:40:57,721 --> 00:40:59,023
That it's your father's song.

497
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:00,858
Sure.

498
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,861
By any chance...

499
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:07,131
do you know anything about my mom?

500
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:12,736
I have...

501
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:15,439
nothing to say concerning your mom.

502
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:18,742
I see. You don't know...

503
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:21,846
Where's your sister?

504
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:26,383
I thought you were in the States

505
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,153
and your sister in Korea,
so I was looking for her.

506
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:31,422
Could I meet her as well?

507
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:36,360
Not in the near future, I'm afraid.

508
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:38,929
Do you two...

509
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:41,799
still look alike?

510
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,968
It was so hard to tell you apart.

511
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:47,872
Yes, we do still look quite alike.

512
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:50,941
I had a hard time

513
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:55,112
telling you apart when you were young.

514
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,983
I tried to come up with my own method
and everything.

515
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:04,188
I don't remember meeting you
when I was young.

516
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:07,525
You were too young, probably.

517
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:12,329
I'm sorry, I don't remember.

518
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:15,065
May I use your bathroom?

519
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:24,375
That's strange.

520
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:29,313
The boy used to hate it
when I touched his ear and ran away.

521
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:33,450
That's how I told them apart...

522
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:45,696
Mi-nam.

523
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,165
Could you zip this up for me?

524
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:50,501
Sure.

525
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:57,241
Thank you.

526
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:05,916
It's not the boy.

527
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:10,921
Even if I may be much older,
there's no way he could be that calm.

528
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:14,758
Which means...

529
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:18,395
it has to be the girl.

530
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:32,076
I only talk about him
on all the talk shows,

531
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:35,112
but we have never even had
a proper meal together!

532
00:43:37,848 --> 00:43:39,617
We can. We will.

533
00:43:40,217 --> 00:43:41,485
Why not?

534
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:49,727
I came to make you lunch.

535
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:54,098
Oh, Ko Mi-nam's not here? Even better.

536
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:55,699
We're eating out.

537
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:58,869
Fake Fairy, I told you not to come here.

538
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:01,805
People think we're all so close, you see.

539
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,743
So I came to take some pictures
to upload on my social media.

540
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:07,311
Just photoshop it.

541
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:11,281
Then maybe I should write
about Ko Mi-nam on it?

542
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:13,250
My social media will become so viral.

543
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:35,806
Now, today's dish is pasta.

544
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:38,108
Jermy, you prepare the ingredients.

545
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,577
Kang Shin-woo, make the sauce.

546
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:44,014
Hwang Tae-gyung, you slice this.

547
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:47,317
I'm the head chef and the food taster.

548
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:55,492
My eyes are watering.

549
00:44:58,062 --> 00:44:59,897
Hey! Don't make a mess.

550
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:07,571
I just can't even...

551
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:17,314
This tastes weird.

552
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:24,154
You're weird.

553
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:28,258
Want some help?

554
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:31,995
I have a knife in my hand. Don't test me.

555
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:43,440
Pasta, just for me!

556
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:46,076
Jermy, take a picture of me eating it.

557
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:47,511
Yes, Your Highness.

558
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:52,983
It's going to be pretty salty.
I dumped salt in that.

559
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:01,191
You too? I threw in sugar.

560
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:07,664
I put something in too.

561
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:15,172
I'm home!

562
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,715
Oh, He-i. You're here.

563
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,350
Ko Mi-nam, just on time!

564
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:27,918
Come here and try this.

565
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:32,322
They put in a lot of effort
to make this for me,

566
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:34,358
but I suddenly don't feel well.

567
00:46:34,691 --> 00:46:37,060
But we can't throw it away,
so why don't you eat it?

568
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:38,695
Is that right?

569
00:46:39,029 --> 00:46:40,397
Then I'll gladly eat it.

570
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:45,602
Bon appétit!

571
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:47,304
Wait, hold on!

572
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:50,140
This, I'll eat it.

573
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,075
I love this pasta.

574
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:53,877
I'll eat it, thanks.

575
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:06,523
Tae-gyung.

576
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:09,126
Did you put in vinegar?

577
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:24,775
Jermy. Does it not taste good?

578
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,411
I'll eat it with you, I'll be all right.

579
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:28,712
It's fine, Ko Mi-nam.

580
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:33,217
We can't let Jermy's sacrifice
be for nothing.

581
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:35,986
Back to square one. This time, fried rice.

582
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:02,546
Tae-gyung, I looked up night blindness

583
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:05,249
and they said spinach, carrots, and liver

584
00:48:05,415 --> 00:48:07,117
among other things
are really good for your eyes.

585
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:09,553
And I don't like any of them.

586
00:48:10,821 --> 00:48:12,022
But you have to eat them.

587
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:40,851
Here you go.

588
00:48:41,885 --> 00:48:42,986
Thanks.

589
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:56,667
Oh, I bought some excellent tea recently.

590
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,436
Let's have some now, let me bring it over.

591
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:49,853
Shin-woo.

592
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:03,200
I heard you did an interview
with the female Ko Mi-nam yesterday.

593
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:06,169
Is it fun playing pretend lovers?

594
00:50:07,904 --> 00:50:08,872
Was it for you?

595
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:10,574
I mean, it was all right.

596
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:13,877
What's that? Is that from a fan?

597
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:16,680
Don't touch.

598
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:19,182
Oh, I'm sorry.

599
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:26,857
Shin-woo.

600
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:30,460
You said you won't be angry if you can
understand Ko Mi-nam's actions, right?

601
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:32,262
Then do you know this?

602
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:35,799
Ko Mi-nam likes Hwang Tae-gyung.

603
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:40,470
Does that make you angry?

604
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:44,007
Just talking to you about this
makes me angry.

605
00:50:57,154 --> 00:51:00,123
If you do that, you'll mess up your hair.

606
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:05,362
What are you doing?

607
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:13,637
I thought something smelled fishy.

608
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:18,642
Is it because he likes her that
he can understand everything she does?

609
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:24,714
I know I saw flowers
and a present in here.

610
00:51:26,783 --> 00:51:28,285
Are those Ko Mi-nam's too, then?

611
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:35,992
Ko Mi-nam. Try this.

612
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:40,163
My mom sent this kimchi and pickled radish
all the way from England.

613
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:41,098
Do you want to try some?

614
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:44,568
Next time, cook the yolk fully too.
No soft-boiled.

615
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:54,845
What is it?

616
00:51:55,712 --> 00:51:56,713
Want to try these on?

617
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,852
These heels? Why?

618
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:03,086
Just try them on.

619
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:05,655
If they fit, I'll assume they were
meant for you and give them to you.

620
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:10,527
Put them on. Now.

621
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:27,310
They fit perfectly.

622
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:29,646
They really were yours?

623
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:33,116
Why are these mine?

624
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,419
Here. These are yours too.

625
00:52:37,187 --> 00:52:38,355
Now let's go confirm it.

626
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:39,589
To who?

627
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:41,024
Let's go and see.

628
00:52:45,028 --> 00:52:46,463
I should take the heels off before--

629
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,498
You need to show them off.
They're new anyway, it's fine.

630
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:03,079
Shin-woo.

631
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:12,289
You had these shoved
in the back of the trunk,

632
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,724
so I was curious
if they were meant for someone.

633
00:53:15,592 --> 00:53:17,093
And it fits Ko Mi-nam perfectly.

634
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:26,803
He gave her high heels when he confessed.

635
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:29,072
It looked like you bought these
a while ago,

636
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:30,574
why haven't you given them to her?

637
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:38,648
Ko Mi-nam. Go on, show him properly.

638
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:43,520
Oh, these aren't mine.
They're meant for someone else.

639
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:45,989
I'm sorry, Shin-woo.

640
00:53:48,692 --> 00:53:51,061
Shin-woo. Say something.

641
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:52,929
Who are these for?

642
00:54:01,538 --> 00:54:03,173
I am so sorry, Shin-woo.

643
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:07,744
Shin-woo.

644
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:12,482
Are you okay?

645
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:14,317
I should have just...

646
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:16,620
thrown them away.

647
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:21,725
Mi-nam.

648
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:24,527
Can you throw them away for me?

649
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:48,084
Why are you butting in?

650
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:50,520
I was just trying to help Kang Shin-woo!

651
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:52,322
You.

652
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:54,190
Don't ever appear in front of me again.

653
00:54:54,724 --> 00:54:55,759
This ends here.

654
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:56,960
You...

655
00:54:57,894 --> 00:55:00,297
Aren't you afraid of what I'll do
if you end it like this?

656
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,632
What will you do?

657
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:05,368
I'll spill everything about Ko Mi-nam
and A.N.JELL!

658
00:55:06,236 --> 00:55:07,070
Yes?

659
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:08,505
If you do,

660
00:55:09,205 --> 00:55:12,542
how will you get out of it,
Korea's Fairy, Yoo He-i?

661
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:15,979
I...

662
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:18,782
I'll pretend I don't know.

663
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,717
But I will. I'll come after you.

664
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:23,753
Aren't you afraid of what I'll do?

665
00:55:27,624 --> 00:55:28,525
Hwang Tae-gyung.

666
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:32,095
This time, I really just meant to help.

667
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:34,964
We don't need it. Go.

668
00:56:07,397 --> 00:56:08,264
Shin-woo.

669
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:14,671
You always comforted me greatly
when I went through hard times.

670
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:17,741
So I want to comfort you somehow

671
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:20,410
but I don't know how.

672
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:22,479
Can you just...

673
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:24,581
come sit by me?

674
00:56:55,278 --> 00:56:56,112
Thanks.

675
00:56:57,614 --> 00:56:59,816
Do you feel better now?

676
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:03,153
Those heels...

677
00:57:05,722 --> 00:57:07,624
All my heart went into that present.

678
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:09,859
But seeing them like that...

679
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:12,362
made me a bit upset.

680
00:57:14,564 --> 00:57:16,199
It was so stupid of me to agree to her.

681
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:19,102
Don't throw them away, Shin-woo.

682
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:21,004
They're beautiful.

683
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:25,208
I shined them so please, give them to her.

684
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:30,647
I didn't get to confess once

685
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:33,183
but it feels like I got dumped 100 times.

686
00:57:35,151 --> 00:57:38,721
Now, if I do actually get rejected,
I don't think I'll even be embarrassed.

687
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:42,392
Shin-woo. Don't forget
there are people like me too.

688
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:46,262
I'm a troublesome nuisance
who got berated all the time

689
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,164
and was barely permitted to like him.

690
00:57:49,532 --> 00:57:51,267
So don't be embarrassed, Shin-woo,

691
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:53,403
when there are fools like me.

692
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,639
We're just a bunch of idiots.

693
00:57:57,774 --> 00:58:00,577
We'll just be cool idiots
who love with all their hearts.

694
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:02,312
What if she never looks at me?

695
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,049
Can I still be cool to the end?

696
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:10,820
You will be, but that would also be sad.

697
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:15,391
But you can't make them like you.

698
00:58:17,594 --> 00:58:20,129
If it can't be done,
it just cannot be done.

699
00:58:21,397 --> 00:58:24,734
For people like us,
throwing tantrums doesn't really work.

700
00:58:31,474 --> 00:58:33,176
I just end up comforting you again,
it seems.

701
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,546
No! I'm going to comfort you.

702
00:58:41,651 --> 00:58:43,052
Then let's see you do it properly.

703
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:46,789
Shall I sing you a song, like you did?

704
00:58:47,457 --> 00:58:49,392
Or a cup of tea, maybe?

705
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,194
Is he better now?

706
00:58:53,563 --> 00:58:55,231
If those heels were really Ko Mi-nam's,

707
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:57,901
what is Ko Mi-nam to Kang Shin-woo?

708
00:58:59,102 --> 00:59:00,203
Let's think more on it.

709
00:59:01,804 --> 00:59:02,772
Is Shin-woo better now?

710
00:59:04,307 --> 00:59:05,575
And yes, he is. Good.

711
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:07,277
Shin-woo!

712
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:10,113
Shin-woo! Are you feeling better now?

713
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:12,949
Shin-woo...

714
00:59:19,122 --> 00:59:21,791
I wanted to check on the song's progress
and hear how it changed.

715
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:24,961
Tae-gyung's in the studio,
you can go see him.

716
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:26,696
Mr. An.

717
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,433
There's a kid named Ko Mi-nam here, right?

718
00:59:30,934 --> 00:59:31,768
What's he like?

719
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:33,703
Mi-nam?

720
00:59:35,438 --> 00:59:37,373
I have the most hope in him.

721
00:59:38,007 --> 00:59:41,811
His single album's coming out soon.
Oh, Tae-gyung wrote that too!

722
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:44,714
Is that right?

723
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:48,217
They're really close,
so you should go talk to him.

724
00:59:50,186 --> 00:59:51,220
They're really close?

725
00:59:51,654 --> 00:59:55,425
Tae-gyung is a bit snappy, for sure,
but he takes care of Mi-nam really well.

726
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:09,439
The song you're working on right now,

727
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:12,041
it's Miss Mo Hwa-ran's song, right?

728
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:13,543
Yes.

729
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:15,979
This is a very unpleasant project.

730
01:00:16,913 --> 01:00:17,747
Ko Mi-nam.

731
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:20,883
Stay right by my side, as my fan.

732
01:00:22,418 --> 01:00:23,987
But I have to go to Busan, though.

733
01:00:25,154 --> 01:00:26,589
What? Busan?

734
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:28,257
Yes.

735
01:00:28,324 --> 01:00:31,961
Shin-woo said he's going down
to go explain to his parents

736
01:00:32,595 --> 01:00:34,931
before the article releases,
so I'm going with him to help explain.

737
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:39,402
And while we're going, Mr. Ma,
Miss Wang, and Jermy are all

738
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,638
coming along for a little trip.

739
01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:44,207
You should come too.

740
01:00:45,408 --> 01:00:46,943
I have a lot of work piled up. I can't.

741
01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:49,245
It's a day trip, then?

742
01:00:50,346 --> 01:00:51,948
No. We're coming back tomorrow.

743
01:00:52,582 --> 01:00:56,519
Shin-woo said he'll give us a Busan tour
and buy us delicious eel.

744
01:00:58,421 --> 01:00:59,255
Ko Mi-nam!

745
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:01,424
There's eel in Seoul too.

746
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:03,926
If you come back early today,

747
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:05,995
I'll take you to the best eel place
in Seoul.

748
01:01:08,064 --> 01:01:11,000
They said that Busan eel was the best!

749
01:01:12,402 --> 01:01:14,337
Like you have ever had eel in Seoul.

750
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:18,408
Have you ever been to Busan, then?

751
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:20,643
Of course.

752
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:24,147
There's almost nowhere in the world
that I haven't gone to.

753
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:26,282
Really?

754
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:28,918
Then have you gone to Uganda?

755
01:01:30,153 --> 01:01:30,987
Uganda?

756
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:33,723
-Not yet.
-He's so comfortable with her.

757
01:01:36,726 --> 01:01:39,529
He wouldn't even look at her
when he finds out she's Jae-hyeon's child.

758
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:44,467
I should turn a blind eye
until the song's done and released.

759
01:01:52,942 --> 01:01:53,810
Wait.

760
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:57,113
Is he acting like that to her
knowing she's a girl?

761
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:06,956
I'm afraid I have to join up
with Jermy on his schedule.

762
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:11,260
I knew the producer since my rookie days,
so I couldn't refuse. Sorry, Mi-nam.

763
01:02:11,861 --> 01:02:12,795
I see.

764
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:14,530
It would have been nice if we all went.

765
01:02:17,133 --> 01:02:18,801
You two go, have fun.

766
01:02:19,102 --> 01:02:20,203
Here you go.

767
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:23,106
Shin-woo.

768
01:02:23,539 --> 01:02:26,242
Take good care of Mi-nam, will you?

769
01:02:29,445 --> 01:02:31,047
This is how I repay favors, yes indeed.

770
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:40,256
Tae-gyung!

771
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:44,460
What? Why are the three of you here?

772
01:02:44,727 --> 01:02:45,862
A schedule came up for me.

773
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:46,863
What about Busan?

774
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:48,598
We couldn't make it.

775
01:02:48,664 --> 01:02:50,466
Shin-woo and Ko Mi-nam went by themselves.

776
01:02:58,174 --> 01:03:00,510
Just Shin-woo and Ko Mi-nam went?

777
01:03:10,186 --> 01:03:12,955
We have to go in separately
for the security checkpoint.

778
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:16,058
Yes, I know. I'll manage, don't worry.

779
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:20,129
You go in first. I'll change
into girl clothes and follow after you.

780
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:22,632
Mi-nam.

781
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:27,103
When we get to Busan,
should we say we're really dating?

782
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:29,005
What?

783
01:03:30,339 --> 01:03:31,507
You're actually a girl.

784
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:34,110
If we actually date

785
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:38,181
then when the article is released,
it will actually be real too.

786
01:03:39,448 --> 01:03:40,416
Shin-woo.

787
01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:46,322
But we both have people who we like.

788
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:49,959
Why don't you and I

789
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:53,162
just let go of the people
who won't look at us

790
01:03:54,864 --> 01:03:56,566
and start over?

791
01:03:56,933 --> 01:03:57,767
You and me.

792
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:01,504
Start over?

793
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:06,442
Will you like me?

794
01:04:07,276 --> 01:04:09,178
I'll like you in return.

795
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:25,328
Ko Mi-nam gave me 100 points.

796
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:28,564
But why am I worried?

797
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:33,002
Because I'm afraid she won't continue
to give me 100 points.

798
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:36,239
Then in order to keep getting 100 points,

799
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:38,474
what do I do?

800
01:04:42,678 --> 01:04:44,447
Then I have to tell her.

801
01:04:45,348 --> 01:04:48,784
That I want to be 100 points,
that I don't want to lose a single point.

802
01:05:07,603 --> 01:05:09,972
I'm not asking you to give me
your heart all at once.

803
01:05:11,173 --> 01:05:13,409
If you're willing to give me your heart,
even just a little bit,

804
01:05:14,343 --> 01:05:15,311
that's our beginning.

805
01:05:19,382 --> 01:05:20,216
And I have...

806
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:22,051
already begun.

807
01:05:28,991 --> 01:05:30,026
I'll head in first.

808
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:33,863
If you're willing to start as well,
come to me.

809
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:36,265
I'll be waiting.

810
01:07:23,472 --> 01:07:25,107
What if when she returns,
I'm not 100 anymore?

811
01:07:25,574 --> 01:07:28,277
What happens if I lose point by point
while she's in Busan?

812
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:31,981
I can't say what I didn't say at 100
at some other lower percentage!

813
01:07:34,116 --> 01:07:34,950
Okay.

814
01:07:35,084 --> 01:07:38,287
If I start driving now,
I'll arrive in five hours.

815
01:07:41,424 --> 01:07:42,691
If I take the Gyeongbu Expressway...

816
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:48,864
Ko Mi-nam.

817
01:07:49,865 --> 01:07:50,833
You didn't go?

818
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,401
Tae-gyung?

819
01:07:58,007 --> 01:07:59,241
Why are you here?

820
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:11,854
Ko Mi-nam.

821
01:08:12,888 --> 01:08:14,390
I give you the same score as you did me.

822
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:18,727
