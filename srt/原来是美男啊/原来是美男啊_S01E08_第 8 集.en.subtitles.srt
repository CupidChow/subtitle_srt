1
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:16,249
Mi-nam!

2
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:25,425
Mi-nam!

3
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:29,095
That's it! That's what I'm talking about.

4
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:30,630
If he keeps this up, we're set.

5
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:32,532
-He totally changed.
-Right?

6
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:34,834
Hoon-i.

7
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,336
Is Ko Mi-nam sick?

8
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:37,971
Well, he...

9
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:41,174
Mi-nam is...

10
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:49,549
Mi-nam.

11
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:50,650
What's going on?

12
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,319
Did something happen
before she went in to record?

13
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,354
What do we do?

14
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:56,222
Did you see her emotions explode?

15
00:00:56,956 --> 00:00:58,224
What about it?

16
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,226
Well, I told her
she should let loose her love,

17
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:02,228
her emotions when she sings your song.

18
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,696
So they really exploded.

19
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:05,632
What?

20
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:09,436
Her emotions have exploded!
Towards Shin-woo!

21
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:19,813
Ko Mi-nam.

22
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,220
I knew something was up when she agreed
to come back with Shin-woo.

23
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:30,890
Why did it have to be him? It would've
been better for us if it was me.

24
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,359
What do we do, Tae-gyung?

25
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,468
Where could she have gone?

26
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:53,546
I'm sorry, Shin-woo.

27
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,031
-What?
-Don't go.

28
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,933
Let him have some time to himself.

29
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:23,042
Where's Mi-nam?

30
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:24,978
He went outside to pull himself together.

31
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,746
I tried comforting him,

32
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:28,948
but I think he just needs some time alone.

33
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,185
Did he say anything else to you?

34
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:33,453
Just that he was overwhelmed.

35
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:36,256
He must have been stressed over
his first recording session.

36
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:48,668
Okay, so I don't think Shin-woo
has any idea.

37
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:51,571
So should we pretend we don't know either?
Tae-gyung!

38
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:54,240
Why are you asking me?

39
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:58,545
What?
Hey, we're on the same side, remember?

40
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:04,517
Not once have I ever thought
that I was on your and Ko Mi-nam's side.

41
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,219
You two take care of it.

42
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:11,958
Ko Mi-nam's emotions exploded
towards Kang Shin-woo?

43
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:14,661
Ridiculous.

44
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:21,701
Reverend Mother.

45
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,971
My emotions keep flowing out,
I can't control myself.

46
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:28,007
I wish I could disappear,

47
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:31,244
so no one could discover how I feel.

48
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:34,714
If I just disappear, like this,

49
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,517
then no one would be able to see me.

50
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:38,618
Ko Mi-nam.

51
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:50,630
Jermy?

52
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:53,066
Can you see me?

53
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:55,802
Of course.

54
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:57,837
I've been looking at you for a while.

55
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,042
That must be why I didn't disappear,
because you were looking at me.

56
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:12,952
You can't disappear.

57
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:17,023
We have to go have a party to celebrate
your first recording session.

58
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,397
Hello everyone!

59
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,000
Ko Mi-nam, you say hello too!

60
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,568
Hello!

61
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,874
You must really like
having celebratory parties, Jermy.

62
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:37,277
Congratulating others is a good thing.

63
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,513
Hey, Ko Mi-nam. You're not
having any fun, are you?

64
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,016
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:43,916
Yeah?

66
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,320
Then I'll help you cry all you want.

67
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:57,063
You were right, I can't stop crying.

68
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,434
It's super spicy, right?

69
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,904
This store has ten spicy levels

70
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,140
and this is level eight.

71
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,509
What do you think? Are you down for more?

72
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:13,546
Yes, I am!

73
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:17,717
I need to cool my mouth down
with some ice cream.

74
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:19,986
We were pretty amazing, though.

75
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:23,723
If they had a level 11, I bet
we would've succeeded in eating that too.

76
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:26,459
Of course. We would've ate everything!

77
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:29,128
Oh, it's gone.

78
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:33,366
Ko Mi-nam. Now that you've cried
all you want, I'll make you laugh.

79
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:35,702
Let's go!

80
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,465
Hello!

81
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,834
Jermy, this is so much fun!

82
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,235
Yeah! Say hi to them. Hello!

83
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,405
I love you! Please look forward
to our sixth album!

84
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:21,214
This bus is a treasure bus
that I discovered myself.

85
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:23,549
You're the only person
I'm sharing this with.

86
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,688
It's just like you said, there's barely
any passengers on this bus.

87
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,626
So this bus takes exactly one hour
to finish a full cycle.

88
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,896
When I felt down, I stayed
until it finished a full cycle.

89
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,499
And when the bus
came back to where it started

90
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,733
my heart came back home too.

91
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,904
Do you think my heart will be able
to come back as well?

92
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,439
Of course!

93
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:49,075
My treasure bus is a magical bus, you see.

94
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,078
I'll see you in an hour.

95
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:39,592
An hour later...

96
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,195
everything comes back to normal.

97
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:45,698
For an hour...

98
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,568
I like you.

99
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,403
Ko Mi-nam.

100
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,613
I'm glad you took a break with Jermy
and had a fun time.

101
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:37,984
Everyone must have been surprised
at how I rushed out.

102
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,218
I'm sorry about that.

103
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,687
It's all right. You sang wonderfully.

104
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:45,758
It was great that your emotions
exploded for the song.

105
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:47,660
But the more important thing

106
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,162
with emotions

107
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:52,431
is being able to rein it back in.

108
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:55,902
It gets difficult if it becomes too much.

109
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:59,338
So I didn't do well in controlling it?

110
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:00,506
Yes, so I was looking

111
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:04,577
for medical treatments
that could help you.

112
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,680
You know acupuncture points?

113
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,654
If your food cravings get too much,
press here. Right here.

114
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:20,393
And poop. If you have to hold
your poop in, press here.

115
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:26,399
If you have to stay awake, press here.

116
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:31,237
Oh, I think I've heard of this before.

117
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:35,374
And if your emotions
are overwhelming you...

118
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:41,414
press your nose, like this.

119
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,083
Here?

120
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,987
Exactly. Right there.
If you feel like you're bursting

121
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:51,624
and your heart drums against your chest
when you see a certain someone,

122
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,859
press right here!

123
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:58,731
Won't I look a bit strange?

124
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:01,000
No. I mean, a bit, but it's effective.

125
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:03,502
Remember, when it gets too much,

126
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:05,037
press it like this!

127
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:08,207
It's more effective
the stronger you press it.

128
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,577
Thank you, Mr. Ma,

129
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:12,945
for being so thoughtful.

130
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:16,949
I mean, sure, yeah.

131
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:21,287
I'll be sure to remember it.

132
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,868
She really bought it.

133
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,770
She's such a sweet angel and I just...

134
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,107
Please forgive me, Sister.

135
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:44,844
But you have to hide your feelings,

136
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:47,747
even if it's through this,
so you don't get caught.

137
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:54,220
I'LL LET IT PASS

138
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:11,570
Ko Mi-nam.

139
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,005
Come here.

140
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:19,245
So I thought about your situation
and have come up with...

141
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,382
What the heck are you doing?

142
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,720
I'm pressing on
my acupuncture point. I need to.

143
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:29,689
Acupuncture point?

144
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:34,493
It's nothing.
Don't worry about me, please go on.

145
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:36,595
Are you making fun of me?

146
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,431
Oh, I see what this is.

147
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:40,933
You're pretending to be that pig
that chased me, aren't you?

148
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,869
What, being like a rabbit wasn't enough?

149
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:45,604
You dare to imitate a pig in front of me?

150
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:48,340
That's not what I...

151
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:50,409
I'll stop.

152
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,778
Don't! Stay like that while you listen.

153
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:54,213
Take your finger off and I'll kill you.

154
00:11:58,451 --> 00:11:59,719
Listen carefully, Pig Rabbit.

155
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,354
This is my proposition for your future.

156
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:05,925
Firstly,

157
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,161
tell Shin-woo everything
and that you're a girl.

158
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:11,664
What? Why?

159
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:14,266
You like Shin-woo, don't you?

160
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,603
-What?
-Yes, I also thought it was

161
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,971
ridiculous the first time I heard it,

162
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:20,906
but I saw a way once I calmed down.

163
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:24,276
Ko Mi-nam!

164
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,912
I will hand you over to Kang Shin-woo.

165
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:31,650
It's not like that. You're mistaken.

166
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:32,718
Hand!

167
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:38,157
When you confess to Shin-woo,
there are two possible outcomes.

168
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,359
First, he accepts you.

169
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:44,730
I feel bad for Shin-woo,
but you get to confess

170
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:46,632
and I get to get rid of you,
so it's a win-win.

171
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:48,601
Second, he doesn't accept you.

172
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:51,103
This is a win only for me,

173
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:55,374
but you should beg and cling to him
so it doesn't happen.

174
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:59,111
If you do half of what you did to me,
you'll be good.

175
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:03,883
Tae-gyung. You're mistaken. Really!
That's really not the case.

176
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,685
Anyhow, I approve of telling Shin-woo.

177
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:09,054
Good luck, Ko Mi-nam.

178
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:20,533
I didn't get caught,
but he misunderstood me.

179
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,336
It's not a circle for me here.

180
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:29,408
What's that?

181
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:33,746
I was just folding something.

182
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,317
What are you making?

183
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:40,920
An airplane!

184
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:46,392
Wait, this isn't it.

185
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,929
You're so clumsy.

186
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:58,070
You have to fold it like this
so you can't see the inside.

187
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:00,739
Oh, I see.

188
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,610
Want me to tell you a story
about a really clumsy woman?

189
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,948
She infiltrated an organization

190
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,716
but she had a huge secret.

191
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,985
The clumsy woman?

192
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:13,919
Yeah.

193
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,322
She was so clumsy that she got caught

194
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:19,458
almost immediately by one
of the members of the organization

195
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,528
but she didn't know and continued
her undercover mission.

196
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,832
Why did that person leave her be?

197
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:30,636
Because he thought it would be interesting
to see what happened.

198
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,338
He was a seriously

199
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:34,373
bored dude, you see.

200
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:45,351
But the more he watched her,
he realized how clumsy she was.

201
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,127
-Nice.
-You improved a lot.

202
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,100
He thought it was funny,
but he also felt kind of bad for her.

203
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,236
-Ko Mi-nam!
-Mr. An!

204
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:05,704
-Let's go to the sauna.
-What?

205
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:08,641
Oh, I have atopy,
I have really bad eczema, so--

206
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:11,076
All the more reason to go!
Sulfur hot spring water is good for--

207
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:13,178
No, I really don't go to saunas.

208
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,614
We're both guys, it's fine. Let's go!

209
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:17,716
The girls who work there are super pretty.

210
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,421
-The girls?
-Yeah.

211
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:23,622
-Sung-chang.
-Yeah?

212
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,658
Want to go eat instead?

213
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:28,761
The best way for two guys to get close
is going to sauna together though.

214
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,362
Then Mi-nam. Want to go eat with me?

215
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,397
What?

216
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,966
Eat? Sure, I'd love to!

217
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,968
-His eyes kept following her.
-Hey!

218
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:40,105
That was probably the first time
he was that interested in a person.

219
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:43,008
And as time went on,

220
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,977
he ended up helping her.

221
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:47,513
Mi-nam, can you take this off me?

222
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,848
She must have been so grateful.

223
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:24,883
She doesn't have a clue.

224
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:26,819
She's as clueless as she's clumsy.

225
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,156
But why didn't he tell her?

226
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:34,193
For the security of the organization
and her safety and peace of mind.

227
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:35,594
He decided to stay silent.

228
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:40,866
But when it's time, his heart
and intentions will be made known.

229
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:43,002
Here you go.

230
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:45,938
Thank you.

231
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,075
It's cold, come back inside soon.

232
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,423
Shin-woo is a good person.

233
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:06,325
I can't possibly tell him.

234
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,296
I know it's hard, but stay strong

235
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:13,665
and stick with Tae-gyung.

236
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,138
I couldn't get any work done
because of her

237
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,440
and yet her emotions
have exploded towards who?

238
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,611
At least she sings well enough.

239
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,948
You like him so much

240
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,250
that you burst into tears?

241
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:35,054
This must be the trouble
she got herself into!

242
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:37,923
I shouldn't have let my guard down.

243
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:40,092
You little rabbit!

244
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:43,262
You little ungrateful jerk!

245
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,710
She left a while ago,
but she's still not back?

246
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:01,880
Did she confess everything
to Shin-woo already and cling onto him?

247
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:04,450
I mean,

248
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:08,587
that is her specialty.
She probably got it done in a flash.

249
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,197
Is she there again?

250
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:28,307
She's not here either.

251
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:34,513
She's not courageous enough
to have actually confessed.

252
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,116
Where could she have gone?

253
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:44,123
Tae-gyung. Please don't hand me
over to Shin-woo.

254
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,992
I will make sure to stay out of your hair!

255
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,148
Ko Mi-nam.

256
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:12,818
Are you saying that you're only going
to cling onto me till the end?

257
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:20,292
You do know you're a huge
inconvenience to me, right?

258
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:26,331
If you do, don't take up so much space

259
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:27,933
and fold your covers in half.

260
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:29,868
That's how you can be
less of an inconvenience.

261
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:46,552
So annoying, seriously.

262
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,181
Mi-nam's song came out great!

263
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,584
Once we shoot a great music video
and upload it,

264
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:19,985
it will be a huge hit!

265
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,154
It would be so helpful

266
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,424
if Yoo He-i and Hwang Tae-gyung
appear in the music video.

267
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:27,859
Good idea!

268
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:32,130
Hoon-i, that's the first great idea
you've had to date.

269
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:33,065
Right?

270
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:35,634
The hottest couple in entertainment
as the co-leads!

271
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:38,403
We'll hit the jackpot! Jackpot!

272
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:41,506
And the music video story should also be

273
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,809
you know,

274
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:47,112
like a spectacular action blockbuster!

275
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,413
For example...

276
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:52,718
A solitary assassin and a sexy assassin.

277
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:56,488
They travel all over the world,
on missions.

278
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,925
In Paris, France.

279
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:11,637
In Rome, Italy.

280
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:15,607
In the deserts of Egypt.

281
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,046
No.

282
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,916
Who has the budget to film
a global thing like that?

283
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:28,854
Besides, going abroad and shooting guns
and all that isn't always great!

284
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:31,523
It doesn't match the song's concept. Next.

285
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:33,558
Mr. An.

286
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:36,028
Then how about...

287
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:41,733
an erotic adult love version?

288
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:46,305
That sounds good too, Mr. An.

289
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:48,807
A bit sultry, you know?

290
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:50,976
Like this.

291
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:55,280
The solitary assassin
and the sexy assassin

292
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,150
fall into a whirlwind of passion

293
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,320
and gaze into each other's eyes.

294
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:05,957
Their eyes are burning
with the fires of passion!

295
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:08,360
And finally, the two of them

296
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:12,798
slowly walk to each other...

297
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:21,006
They reach out, slowly,

298
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:23,675
slowly, carefully,

299
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:26,178
so carefully...

300
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:29,348
The sexiness hanging thickly
in the air, they slowly...

301
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:34,753
They caress like this...

302
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:37,322
No.

303
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:40,092
What kind of a concept is that?

304
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:42,728
Our main target are the teens!

305
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:45,163
We can't try to attract attention
with love scenes.

306
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,433
The love that came
and left without a word.

307
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:50,635
The nostalgia of a first love.

308
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,574
All we have to do is trust
in our young, vibrant, beautiful kids.

309
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:59,344
-Let's go for the hit! Yeah!
-Let's go!

310
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:01,279
The explosion will be so good,
my goodness.

311
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,718
Mi-nam, you don't have
to do any complicated stuff,

312
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,488
you just have to be jealous
of He-i and Tae-gyung.

313
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:12,758
You're much more experienced,
so take care of him, yeah?

314
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:14,760
Again?

315
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,962
Goodness, so annoying.

316
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:19,231
I'm sorry, Tae-gyung.

317
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:21,199
Come on, guys.

318
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:24,436
Because of your scandal with He-i,
her movie was such a huge hit

319
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:26,738
and she made lots of money.
We should also...

320
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:33,278
I know, I'm sorry I'm trying to use
your love for business, but...

321
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:35,747
It's fine. It's not going away
anytime soon anyway,

322
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,816
so you should at least rake in
some money when you can.

323
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:39,751
I thought you would agree. All right then.

324
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:42,621
He-i said she'll be here as soon
as her theater rounds are over.

325
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:47,526
Don't just focus on your girlfriend
and take care of Mi-nam too, okay?

326
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:49,161
Break a leg!

327
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:51,596
Director Oh!

328
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:54,366
"Girlfriend," my ass.

329
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:59,070
I won't get in your way. Don't mind me.

330
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:03,442
Ko Mi-nam. When Yoo He-i gets here,
stay right by my side.

331
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,878
No, it's fine. I'll stay far away.

332
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:07,813
Ko Mi-nam?

333
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:11,149
I'll decide where we'll go.
Don't talk back.

334
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:16,354
Then I'll stay this close.

335
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,123
Get closer.

336
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:19,791
This close?

337
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:21,760
Are you gum or something?
That's too close!

338
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:24,629
Closer!

339
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,298
Stop.

340
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:31,169
We have to get this done
before the sun sets, so don't fool around.

341
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:32,304
Yes, Tae-gyung.

342
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:33,371
What?

343
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:35,340
That's Mi-nam.

344
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,611
Should I say hi to him?

345
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:42,481
Man...

346
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,349
Let's get started!

347
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:45,851
Hey, someone get that chair out!

348
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:46,918
Yes, sir!

349
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,688
Yes, that's it. Yes, good, good!

350
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:52,591
All right, you're doing great!

351
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:54,226
Perfect.

352
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:55,694
Okay!

353
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:58,597
Get a little closer.

354
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:00,999
All right, good!

355
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:03,568
Look this way, yes.

356
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:05,036
Great.

357
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:06,905
Great.

358
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:10,575
A little brighter, yes, perfect!

359
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:11,977
Not so thick!

360
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,578
Okay.

361
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,682
-Where are you going?
-Oh, my, Shin-woo!

362
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,719
Excuse me.

363
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:25,056
I've been looking for this woman,
right here.

364
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,592
After the last festival performance

365
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:30,462
I think I saw her with Tae-gyung.

366
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,697
Do you know who she is, by any chance?

367
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,934
The Asian Music Festival?

368
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:38,737
Tae-gyung was with Ko Mi-nam.

369
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,106
Ko Mi-nam?

370
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:44,175
No way.

371
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:46,912
No, I'm sure. He was with Ko Mi-nam.

372
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,548
I don't know any girl who looks like that.

373
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:50,682
Really?

374
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:56,254
Then I should go and ask Ko Mi-nam.

375
00:25:57,756 --> 00:25:58,957
Thank you for your help.

376
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:06,998
All right, everyone focus on the teacher!

377
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:10,869
Tae-gyung, you're looking out
the window, thinking of He-i.

378
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:14,806
Keep thinking about her.

379
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,475
Longingly...

380
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,613
She's outside, walking in your direction.

381
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:25,083
Mi-nam. You turn your head
to look at Tae-gyung quickly!

382
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:27,285
A quick glance.

383
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,695
Hey, you!

384
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:39,431
I said, focus on the teacher!
Don't turn around!

385
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:40,899
Sorry.

386
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,588
Cut! Okay!

387
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:08,259
Move the lights only! No one else moves.

388
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:13,732
What's wrong?

389
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:15,533
He keeps looking at you.

390
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:17,268
Who is he?

391
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:18,937
Who?

392
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:26,111
He has been acting strange.

393
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:28,446
Do you know him?

394
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:33,284
I'm not sure.
I don't know a lot of people.

395
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:43,028
Oh, no! It's my brother's friend!

396
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:46,865
He was my brother's best friend
in high school!

397
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:51,436
What do I do?

398
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:53,938
He's going to think
it's strange that I can't remember

399
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:55,640
my high school best friend.

400
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:00,745
Act like you do and just say hi.

401
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:06,951
Oh, but I don't remember his name.

402
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,255
Tae-gyung...

403
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:19,497
I noticed you kept looking over
at my direction.

404
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:21,199
You must be my fan.

405
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:22,734
No.

406
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:24,669
I wasn't looking at you.

407
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:27,839
I'll sign something for you.
What's your name?

408
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,507
It's quite all right.

409
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:34,646
What is your name?

410
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,215
Kim Dong-jun.

411
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,484
Kim Dong-jun.

412
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:44,289
Dong-jun!

413
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,659
Mi-nam! You did recognize me!

414
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,228
Of course! You're my best friend!

415
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,130
You little...

416
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:56,000
I thought you were ignoring me
because you became famous!

417
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,502
I was so upset, dude!

418
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,704
Hey, I would never do that.

419
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:01,806
Dong-jun? It's okay.

420
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,278
It's been so long, Ko Mi-nam.

421
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:10,749
You really achieved your dream
and became a singer.

422
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:14,085
You're so awesome, dude!

423
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:18,656
Ko Mi-nam.

424
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:22,494
We have to get ready for the shoot.
Come back inside. Now.

425
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:25,330
Yes, Tae-gyung!

426
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:27,031
Right, you must be busy.

427
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:28,933
You're the main character, after all.

428
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,737
Yes!

429
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,778
-What?
-Where did your scar go?

430
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:42,413
What?

431
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,350
You fell off your bicycle that one time
and ripped here really badly.

432
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:49,621
It was a huge scar, but it's all gone now.

433
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:52,991
Oh, so...

434
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:57,362
There's no need to hide from your friend
that you had surgery done.

435
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:02,233
Didn't you say you got a lot
of things done before debut?

436
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,837
Right, yes. I did.

437
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:08,940
Oh, makes sense.
A celebrity has to be flawless.

438
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:13,144
Your face seems to have gotten
slimmer too.

439
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:16,681
Yeah, I got a lot of things done,
you know.

440
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:18,683
Stop staring.

441
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,119
It's all good, I totally get it.

442
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,456
All right, we're starting soon,
so go to the bathroom now!

443
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,425
Hey, Mi-nam.

444
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,828
Want to go together, for old times' sake?

445
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:31,663
-What?
-Let's go!

446
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,466
Do you remember how we always bet
on who could shoot the farthest?

447
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,335
Want to bet again?

448
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:38,770
Tae-gyung!

449
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:42,006
Gosh.

450
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:44,475
Let's pee!

451
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,781
It's been so long since we've come
to the bathroom together.

452
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,695
Kim Dong-jun?

453
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,365
I see that you're a fan of ours,

454
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,701
what's your favorite song?

455
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:13,838
I'm sorry, but I don't know
a lot of A.N.JELL's songs.

456
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:15,206
But...

457
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,909
I'm sure you know this song, yes?

458
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:21,079
I will promise you

459
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:25,750
I'll live holding only you in my eyes

460
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:27,051
Oh, yes!

461
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:29,587
I will promise you

462
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:31,656
I'll live holding only you

463
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,291
-in my arms
-Oh,

464
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:34,959
I'm done.

465
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:36,561
Already?

466
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,897
Yeah. I'll be outside.

467
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:45,536
I can't believe I got to sing

468
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:47,639
with a famous celebrity like you
in the bathroom.

469
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:48,806
It was an honor.

470
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:56,080
If I had handed you over,

471
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,583
it would have been Kang Shin-woo
here singing this song.

472
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:10,395
So this is the place where Yoo He-i,
Ko Mi-nam, and Hwang Tae-gyung all are?

473
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:13,531
So everyone's here? Time to poke around.

474
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:18,937
All right, lunch time!

475
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,673
It's a music video,
so none of the actual audio's going in,

476
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:25,209
so everyone be natural
and have lunch like you would at school!

477
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,221
Hey.

478
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,324
Is your character a rich kid?

479
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:41,392
Your side dishes are so good.

480
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:48,366
Your character is poor, so you only have
dried anchovies, Tae-gyung.

481
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:51,736
I'd give you this rolled omelet,

482
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:54,005
but it would not fit our characters,
so I can't.

483
00:32:58,076 --> 00:32:59,410
That reminds me

484
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:01,379
of your sister.

485
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:05,516
You gathered everyone's rolled omelets
and took it to her class

486
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:07,185
because she really liked them.

487
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,656
Yes, I did.

488
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:14,058
So even though I didn't like eggs,

489
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,627
I begged my mom to pack them
in my lunch every day.

490
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:18,863
Because I knew

491
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:21,132
she would have them.

492
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:25,036
You did?

493
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:28,072
What, you liked her or something?

494
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:32,710
I have not told you then...

495
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:37,148
but I actually really liked your sister.

496
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,618
I couldn't say anything,
since she was your sister.

497
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:42,987
But your sister...

498
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:45,823
was my first love.

499
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:51,496
You have to be freaking kidding me.

500
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:56,434
I really had no idea.

501
00:33:58,136 --> 00:33:59,771
I'm actually going to the army tomorrow.

502
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:04,842
I thought of your sister a lot recently,
to be honest.

503
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:07,412
And now seeing you...

504
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:09,914
it feels like I saw her.

505
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:12,884
Really?

506
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,024
Ko Mi-nam.

507
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:24,195
Is it good that you look like your sister,
when you're a guy?

508
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:27,698
Yes, you're right, Tae-gyung!

509
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:31,502
Look at you, all straightening up
at your senior's words!

510
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:33,137
You're so cute, dude.

511
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:42,980
You're smiling?

512
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,982
Letting down that guard, are you?

513
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:54,425
Ko Mi-nam. Shouldn't your guard be up
a little more than that?

514
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,161
I thought you were about to light a fire
with all that cheek-rubbing.

515
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,698
He's his closest friend,
I couldn't just push him away.

516
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:03,067
Mi-nam!

517
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:07,105
Tae-gyung! Can you hold Dong-jun off
while I go to the bathroom?

518
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:09,540
Mi-nam!

519
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:12,243
Kim Dong-jun.

520
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:13,878
Tae-gyung.

521
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,314
Here, have a drink.

522
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:24,922
I heard you were living together.

523
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:26,757
Mi-nam is a handful, isn't he?

524
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:30,394
He is. A huge handful.

525
00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:33,131
Oh, by any chance...

526
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,368
does Mi-nam's sister visit at all?

527
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:41,439
Ko Mi-nam's sister?

528
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,241
I mean, yes, I've seen her.

529
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,577
Really? Isn't she so pretty?

530
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:48,913
If you're going to the army soon,

531
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,984
why don't you ask Ko Mi-nam
if you can meet her?

532
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:54,919
It's all right.

533
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,221
I'm going to see her after I'm discharged.

534
00:35:58,356 --> 00:35:59,290
After you're discharged?

535
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:00,992
I'm currently in pharmacy school, you see.

536
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:03,494
And I'm planning on opening a pharmacy
back home after I graduate.

537
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:05,229
I'm going to find her then.

538
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:09,000
And do what?

539
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,135
My dream is to get married,

540
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:14,605
open a pharmacy
and have a lovey-dovey life with a wife.

541
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:21,179
Oh, keep it a secret from Mi-nam.

542
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:28,519
Ko Mi-nam.

543
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:31,255
When you leave, you'll be Mrs. Pharmacist.

544
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:49,473
Hello!

545
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,475
Hello!

546
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:52,877
Hello!

547
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,646
He-i!

548
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,348
You're late!

549
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:58,716
I had other things to do.

550
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:00,818
Oh, by the way, He-i.

551
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,287
Your relationship with Tae-gyung

552
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,089
must have been a boost
to your movie promotions!

553
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:09,460
Don't make it like I opened up
about my relationship for promotions.

554
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:13,130
And thanks to you, this music video
will be a huge hit too!

555
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:16,200
Tae-gyung must be so happy.

556
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,703
Our relationship is not
for business benefits.

557
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:19,937
It's real.

558
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:22,139
Oh, is that right?

559
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:26,444
You do remember this picture, don't you?

560
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:31,115
We weren't official yet at the time,
so I couldn't tell you.

561
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:34,518
I'm sorry for lying to you then.

562
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:35,987
Don't be.

563
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:38,155
Because you're lying now.

564
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:39,757
Excuse me?

565
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:41,959
You weren't with Tae-gyung then, were you?

566
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:44,028
This is not you, He-i.

567
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:49,300
You're making things quite difficult.

568
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:55,640
I heard Tae-gyung was with Mi-nam
at the time.

569
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,275
Then...

570
00:37:57,341 --> 00:37:59,277
I should go ask Mi-nam

571
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,746
whether or not this is you.

572
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:04,215
You do that. Goodbye.

573
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:07,585
What trail did he catch?

574
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,820
I have to tell Hwang Tae-gyung right away.

575
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:13,791
I knew it.

576
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:16,527
This wasn't Yoo He-i.

577
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,865
They will have talked it over
with Ko Mi-nam already.

578
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,334
How shall I bait him?

579
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:28,406
All right, you two!

580
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:31,008
Act close, talk naturally.

581
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:33,344
Ready, action!

582
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,881
Ko Mi-nam.

583
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:39,383
I didn't realize I was
with the future Mrs. Pharmacist.

584
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:42,720
I'm not Mrs. Pharmacist. Stop it.

585
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:47,491
Send me some vitamins and calcium
supplements later on.

586
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,663
That's the least you can do, considering
how much trouble you're causing me.

587
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:57,435
Tae-gyung. The director told us to act
as close friends in this scene.

588
00:38:57,868 --> 00:38:59,303
So you can be mean to me later.

589
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:04,075
You're already at the level
where you can give me advice?

590
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:06,444
What, do you think
even if you quit A.N.JELL,

591
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:10,147
you'll be future Mrs. Pharmacist,
so you've got nothing to be scared of?

592
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:14,218
Mi-nam! Continue to act close
and throw some leaves at him.

593
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:19,890
Tae-gyung, stop it already.

594
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,868
You little!

595
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:41,379
Yes, that's exactly it.

596
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:44,515
The best of friends.

597
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:13,944
Cut! Okay!

598
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:15,713
That was great!

599
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:19,116
The piggy nose at the end,
that was a great ad-lib!

600
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,885
All right, next scene!

601
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:32,363
Ko Mi-nam. Why are you doing that again?

602
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:36,700
It was just an ad-lib for a funny moment.

603
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:38,169
For a funny moment?

604
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:40,304
Oh, it's so funny.

605
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:42,406
Try it again, you Pig Rabbit.

606
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:43,707
Do it again!

607
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,143
Oh, He-i's here.

608
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:49,547
Yes, hello.

609
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,094
You were great in that scene.

610
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:07,398
You two are such naturals.

611
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:10,668
Acting is like breathing to you,

612
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:12,436
we can't compare to that.

613
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:14,738
I'll take that as a compliment, Honey.

614
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:18,342
You have so much dust on you.
Is it from the leaves?

615
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:32,022
My hands and feet are curling in
from all this acting. Don't overdo it.

616
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:33,858
Why? You were so good just now.

617
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:36,760
Give me a smile, like the one you acted
out just now and I'll give you a prize.

618
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:39,663
That wasn't acting.

619
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:45,536
Then you really smiled because of her?

620
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,873
Fine. Have a fun time.
Laugh while you can.

621
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:51,775
I'm never going to tell you
about that reporter snooping around.

622
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:57,114
-Oh, wow.
-Oh, my gosh.

623
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,449
Have you eaten this before?

624
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:01,385
How can I possibly eat that?
It looks so sweet and sour.

625
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:02,419
It really is!

626
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:03,521
Oh, my goodness!

627
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,558
This is so good!

628
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:08,492
It's freaking good.

629
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:11,328
Hey. Let's get started.

630
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:13,264
We came here for a reason.

631
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:16,467
All right. I thought you might want these

632
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,769
so I brought a few things.

633
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:21,539
Let's get down to business. Pick one!

634
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:24,308
Oh, my goodness!

635
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:26,243
Wait, this one!

636
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:28,512
Oh, that's Jermy's.

637
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:31,949
Oh, he must've washed his face
with this today.

638
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:34,084
-What about this one?
-That? It's Shin-woo's.

639
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,186
It's Shin-woo's razor.

640
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,589
I want to be his facial hair.

641
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:40,324
-Me too.
-I want to be...

642
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:43,894
You didn't bring anything of Tae-gyung's?

643
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:45,596
Hey.

644
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:48,866
Leader is way too quick.
If I touch anything of his, I'm doomed.

645
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:51,201
There won't be any future sessions.

646
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:56,106
But I have some top-secret information.

647
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,509
My dear Mi-nam's music video

648
00:42:59,009 --> 00:42:59,877
will have Leader in it

649
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:02,279
and he'll be wearing a school uniform.

650
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:04,181
-A school uniform?
-Tae-gyung is...

651
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,449
Like us?

652
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:06,517
Yeah.

653
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:09,320
That sounds so amazing.

654
00:43:09,386 --> 00:43:10,421
Oh, my.

655
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:13,157
Do you like them that much?

656
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:15,426
To me, they're just

657
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:19,597
all lanky and skinny and fragile
and just... I don't know. I don't see it.

658
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:20,664
Lanky?

659
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:22,666
You don't see it? Lady!

660
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:25,703
Lady. Don't you know of their legends?

661
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:29,473
-Legends?
-The Angel Legends!

662
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:34,578
First, when you hear
Kang Shin-woo's legendary tale,

663
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,780
you'll never be able to call him
lanky and fragile.

664
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,222
Search him, he must have money.

665
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:08,545
Who's that bastard?

666
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:11,081
-What the hell?
-Hey!

667
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:45,382
Nampo-dong, Busan's Legendary

668
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:47,184
Seventeen to one fight.

669
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:50,320
That was our very own Shin-woo.

670
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:53,557
But he's such a gentleman!

671
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,392
He was a delinquent?

672
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,494
No way.

673
00:44:57,895 --> 00:44:59,530
If you hear Jermy's legendary tale,

674
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,700
you would never be able to deny
that they're awesome.

675
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:21,151
You heard that Jermy's grandfather
is Scottish nobility, right?

676
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,855
Princess Amy, the twenty-third
in line for the English throne

677
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:27,324
was Jermy's fiancée.

678
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:41,305
Wait, hold on.

679
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:43,107
So the little whelk

680
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,276
came to Korea to be a singer
and left the princess?

681
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:48,278
No way.

682
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:52,583
If I were in Princess Amy's shoes,
I would be devastated.

683
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:55,753
But for us, it's a blessing!

684
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:58,322
The stories these kids come up with.

685
00:45:58,756 --> 00:45:59,790
Hey.

686
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:01,892
Then what is Leader's legendary tale then?

687
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:13,036
Tae-gyung has a truly amazing
legendary tale concerning his birth.

688
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,339
His mother

689
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:18,542
was a super famous, beautiful,
and amazing person.

690
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:23,847
But besides Tae-gyung and his father,
no one knows who she is.

691
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:27,284
Really?

692
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:28,352
Yes.

693
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:32,055
Even his birthday is a mystery.

694
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:34,458
The day we celebrate his birthday

695
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:37,895
is just the date on his legal records.

696
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:39,730
But it's not his real birthday.

697
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:43,567
Only Tae-gyung and his father
know his true birthday.

698
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,508
Yes, Father.

699
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:54,044
I didn't even know it was my birthday.

700
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,547
There's another day to celebrate that

701
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,415
so today is meaningless to me.

702
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:00,851
Nevertheless, I sent your present over.

703
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:04,488
I made sure it would be delivered
to you today.

704
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:06,690
How was your Seattle performance?

705
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:08,692
Are you well?

706
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,794
Ms. Cho Hyun-a, too?

707
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:13,997
Give her my regards.

708
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,432
Yes.

709
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:21,638
I could've forgotten
about the whole day entirely,

710
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,475
but he always has to remind me like this.

711
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:32,549
Where the heck did Hwang Tae-gyung go?

712
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:35,586
He better not be with Ko Mi-nam!

713
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:44,261
What is she doing?

714
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,630
With another guy?

715
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:50,334
Is she pretending to be a guy
so she can only be around guys?

716
00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:57,875
I'll wear this

717
00:47:58,408 --> 00:48:00,210
when I go to the army tomorrow.

718
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,248
Here you go.

719
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:06,984
Mi-nam.

720
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,219
Have you seen Tae-gyung?

721
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:12,256
Weren't you filming together?

722
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:14,791
He left as soon as we finished
and I don't know where he went.

723
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:18,095
Who is this?

724
00:48:18,695 --> 00:48:20,497
I'm Mi-nam's friend from high school.

725
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:24,801
I'm meeting so many famous people
because of you. Thanks, dude!

726
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:26,670
High school friend?

727
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:29,373
Mi-nam

728
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:31,608
must have changed a lot since then.

729
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:34,177
No, he's exactly the same.

730
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:37,414
Oh, really?

731
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,082
All right then. See you.

732
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,619
The dense ones play
with the dense ones, I see.

733
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:46,590
It would be fun to throw that reporter
into this mix!

734
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:49,893
Let's see how anxious Ko Mi-nam would get.

735
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,296
Oh, wow.

736
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:55,899
Thanks so much, Mi-nam.

737
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:57,834
No problem. What are friends for?

738
00:48:58,502 --> 00:48:59,536
Take my gratitude!

739
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,274
I'll take your gratitude as well!

740
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:06,209
Hey!

741
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:08,278
Oh, man.

742
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:11,949
What?

743
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:14,885
Mi-nam.

744
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:17,788
Are these really your shoes?

745
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,723
Yes. Why?

746
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:22,426
Nothing.

747
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:25,595
Ko Mi-nam.

748
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:26,863
Hey.

749
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,168
Dong-jun, have a safe trip

750
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:34,171
and when you get discharged,
call Ko Mi-nam, okay?

751
00:49:48,118 --> 00:49:50,420
Mi-nam had the same shoe size as me.

752
00:49:52,055 --> 00:49:54,257
Is there plastic surgery
to make your feet smaller?

753
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:00,931
Excuse me!

754
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:06,003
I heard from Miss Yoo He-i

755
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:09,006
that you're a high school friend
of Mi-nam's.

756
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:10,640
Is that right?

757
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:17,514
Did you secure being Mrs. Pharmacist?

758
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:21,485
Don't tease. He's just
a very good friend of my brother's.

759
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:23,453
Did you say goodbye?

760
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:24,855
I did.

761
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:27,457
But he didn't look all that well
at the end.

762
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:29,526
Was he sad?

763
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:31,461
I signed his shoe, too.

764
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:33,230
You might as well

765
00:50:33,296 --> 00:50:37,067
have exchanged shoes as a token
of promise for the future or something.

766
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:39,536
Shoes...

767
00:50:45,275 --> 00:50:46,309
Mi-nam.

768
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:48,745
Are these really your shoes?

769
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:51,114
The shoe sizes

770
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:53,116
are different.

771
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:57,521
My brother and I
have very different shoe sizes.

772
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:12,602
He's a reporter.

773
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:14,805
Dong-jun

774
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:17,441
must have figured out
that I'm not my brother.

775
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:23,580
Ko Mi-nam?

776
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:45,168
Mi-nam...

777
00:51:46,336 --> 00:51:48,038
is my closest friend.

778
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:50,373
He's a great dude...

779
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:53,677
and a truly amazing...

780
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:56,113
guy.

781
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:17,467
When I go

782
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,837
to the army tomorrow,
I have no chance to meet anyone else.

783
00:52:22,072 --> 00:52:23,473
And you know I keep secrets well, right?

784
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:28,145
I'll be going now.

785
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:30,680
Stay healthy, Mi-nam.

786
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:33,783
Goodbye, Dong-jun.

787
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:48,131
I

788
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:49,900
really

789
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,601
liked your sister!

790
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:58,208
Goodbye! Thank you!

791
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:12,722
Look at that little... Is she really
planning on becoming Mrs. Pharmacist?

792
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:15,625
Hwang Tae-gyung.

793
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:21,164
You brought your car, right?

794
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:23,433
I didn't bring mine. Drive me home.

795
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,468
I came in the van. I don't have my car.

796
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:27,971
Yeah? Then drive me home in my car.

797
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:31,541
Aren't you embarrassed
to turn your words around?

798
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:34,778
You know I'm like this already.
Why be embarrassed?

799
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:38,114
As long as the others
are kept in the dark, it's fine.

800
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:41,384
I see you're not denying
your identity as a lying fake.

801
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:42,886
I'll applaud you on that.

802
00:53:43,086 --> 00:53:44,921
There's something else to clap for.

803
00:53:45,288 --> 00:53:48,992
I noticed that reporter snooping around
so I diverted him.

804
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:50,727
That's a lie, isn't it.

805
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:52,629
Think what you will.

806
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:56,666
When there are eyes on us,
be chivalrous, okay?

807
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,838
If I ask you to hold my bag,
you're going to say no, huh?

808
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:17,954
Hey! This isn't heavy!

809
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:19,489
Can't you just hold it once?

810
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,864
Don't cause trouble for him.

811
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:37,707
Mi-nam, we'll be off.

812
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:03,199
How was the shoot? Did it go well?

813
00:55:03,266 --> 00:55:04,234
Shin-woo!

814
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:08,471
Shin-woo is so sweet and kind to Mi-nam.

815
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:10,273
He doesn't know yet, does he?

816
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,576
He's going to feel so betrayed
when he finds out.

817
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:16,613
That's why she would rather not tell him.

818
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:21,518
Tae-gyung is gone?

819
00:55:22,018 --> 00:55:25,055
You didn't have to come.
I could've just gone in the van.

820
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,824
But I did come, so let's go in my car.

821
00:55:30,293 --> 00:55:32,729
Hwang Tae-gyung. Aren't you hungry?

822
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:34,197
I'm not.

823
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:35,799
I am!

824
00:55:36,399 --> 00:55:38,401
I must have some spaghetti.

825
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:41,938
If you go a little further,
my favorite pasta place will come up.

826
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:44,774
I want some, so head that way, okay?

827
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:55,118
Hello?

828
00:55:58,822 --> 00:55:59,789
What is it now?

829
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:01,358
Let's meet today.

830
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:05,061
There was that unfortunate mistake
I made last time at the restaurant.

831
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:09,733
I won't forget it this time,
so let's have some dinner and talk.

832
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:11,234
I'll see you there.

833
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,777
Haven't changed a bit, have you? Telling
me to come whenever you feel like it.

834
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,145
Who was it?

835
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,614
Where's the pasta place?

836
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:27,717
Over there! You just have to turn now.

837
00:56:41,598 --> 00:56:42,565
Hey.

838
00:56:44,534 --> 00:56:47,404
I dropped you off like you wanted me to.
Have fun eating pasta.

839
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:50,073
Hey! Where are you going?

840
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:55,145
Thanks for dropping me off, Honey! Bye!

841
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:00,917
Aunt Mi-ja!

842
00:57:00,984 --> 00:57:04,187
You can't just open Tae-gyung's posts!
This one is from the States.

843
00:57:04,554 --> 00:57:08,691
It wasn't anything anyway!
Besides, if it's going to be opened,

844
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:10,326
it doesn't matter who does it.
I have to pee!

845
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:20,136
How do I tape this back together
so he doesn't notice?

846
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:30,480
It's the album you've always wanted.

847
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:33,082
Happy Birthday. From Father.

848
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:34,984
Birthday?

849
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:39,522
Today is his birthday?

850
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,799
It's the first time in ten years
that she's called me

851
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,701
on this day.

852
00:57:53,903 --> 00:57:56,339
It has been a long while
since I've released an album.

853
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:57,474
Really?

854
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:59,042
Congratulations.

855
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:00,710
I hope you'll help me out a lot.

856
00:58:00,777 --> 00:58:02,946
Of course. That's what I should
be asking you!

857
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:04,180
Of course.

858
00:58:05,548 --> 00:58:06,516
He's here.

859
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:11,488
Tae-gyung. You're here.

860
00:58:12,255 --> 00:58:13,723
I'm Mr. Choi from Asia Daily.

861
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:16,326
I interviewed you before,
I'm sure you remember.

862
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:20,563
I heard that you were doing a remake
of Mo Hwa-ran's song

863
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:22,599
and we urgently requested
for an interview.

864
00:58:22,899 --> 00:58:24,868
Thank you for coming.

865
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:29,138
Have a seat. We'll talk as we eat.

866
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,575
You can't eat shrimp, right?

867
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:34,944
I made sure to exclude them this time.

868
00:58:36,112 --> 00:58:37,413
You even know what he can't eat.

869
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,583
You must be very close
with your junior artist, Hwa-ran.

870
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:43,753
I'm sorry.

871
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:45,822
But due to personal reasons...

872
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:48,491
I can't stay.

873
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:51,060
I apologize.

874
00:59:00,937 --> 00:59:02,205
TO TAE-GYUNG
FROM MO HWA-RAN

875
00:59:03,773 --> 00:59:05,141
Good thing I kept this.

876
00:59:05,675 --> 00:59:08,444
He will love it if I give this to him
as a birthday present

877
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:09,946
since he's a fan.

878
00:59:12,615 --> 00:59:15,118
Oh, Tae-gyung is a fan of yours, Ms. Mo.

879
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:16,185
Tae-gyung?

880
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:18,221
He's my fan?

881
00:59:19,656 --> 00:59:23,927
I found a ton of your old movies
and albums in his room.

882
00:59:29,933 --> 00:59:30,934
Jermy!

883
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:34,571
Aren't you holding
a celebratory party today?

884
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:36,272
What? For what?

885
00:59:37,006 --> 00:59:38,741
It's Tae-gyung's birthday!

886
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,545
Today is not his birthday.

887
00:59:43,613 --> 00:59:46,516
We had a huge birthday party
for him in the spring.

888
00:59:47,684 --> 00:59:50,019
That's strange.
It said it was his birthday.

889
00:59:51,788 --> 00:59:53,790
I'll ask him when he gets back.

890
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:56,960
Tae-gyung said he won't come
back home today.

891
00:59:57,894 --> 01:00:01,464
He just called and said he'll spend
the night at the studio, working.

892
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:05,935
Jolie!

893
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:10,540
But why did his father send him
a birthday gift?

894
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,788
How dare you embarrass me like that
and leave?

895
01:00:26,322 --> 01:00:29,225
It made you so angry that you had
to come find me here?

896
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:32,929
I guess you're no longer afraid of

897
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:35,264
others finding out about this.

898
01:00:35,765 --> 01:00:36,733
Yes.

899
01:00:37,667 --> 01:00:38,768
I'm not afraid now.

900
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:41,871
What have I to lose?

901
01:00:43,439 --> 01:00:44,273
To be honest,

902
01:00:45,241 --> 01:00:47,810
I'm debating about announcing
that you're my son.

903
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:51,848
Then the spotlight will focus on me.

904
01:00:57,754 --> 01:00:58,588
Why?

905
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:01,257
Are you afraid now?

906
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:15,638
Where is he?

907
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:22,145
I will not let this new song
be swamped over on the charts.

908
01:01:22,912 --> 01:01:25,248
I want everyone to listen to it,
to pay attention to it.

909
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:27,650
And in order for that to happen,

910
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:29,285
I need you.

911
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:32,955
Did you love the person...

912
01:01:34,057 --> 01:01:35,591
who made that song that much?

913
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:40,596
You abandoned and left me...

914
01:01:42,765 --> 01:01:43,966
because of him, right?

915
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:45,835
Don't mock me like that.

916
01:01:48,171 --> 01:01:49,839
It was the most precious thing to me.

917
01:01:52,408 --> 01:01:53,976
And the most devastating to me.

918
01:01:56,612 --> 01:01:57,447
Leave.

919
01:02:00,016 --> 01:02:01,417
But I still gave birth to you!

920
01:02:06,622 --> 01:02:07,724
Because of you,

921
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:09,826
because I had you...

922
01:02:10,827 --> 01:02:12,228
I lost that precious thing.

923
01:02:13,763 --> 01:02:14,797
Yes.

924
01:02:14,964 --> 01:02:17,633
You must have thought it was devastating
because I left you.

925
01:02:18,668 --> 01:02:19,502
But...

926
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:21,537
when I had lost him...

927
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,040
because of you...

928
01:02:25,374 --> 01:02:26,476
I was devastated too.

929
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:33,983
I lost him because of you.

930
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:37,687
At least, let me remember him.

931
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:41,157
Help me.

932
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:51,200
If you want to hold the fact
that you had me as leverage,

933
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:53,703
you should, at the very least,

934
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:57,573
remember when that was.

935
01:03:06,315 --> 01:03:07,450
Was that today?

936
01:04:44,747 --> 01:04:45,915
Reverend Mother.

937
01:04:47,016 --> 01:04:48,718
My star is covered in darkness

938
01:04:49,452 --> 01:04:50,653
and it is crying.

939
01:04:52,154 --> 01:04:53,723
What do I do?

940
01:04:54,857 --> 01:04:56,759
