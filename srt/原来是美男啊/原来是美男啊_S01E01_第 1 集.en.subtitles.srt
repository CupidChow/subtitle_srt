1
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,406
Is Gemma running late again?

2
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:43,643
Probably.

3
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,307
-Thank you, God.
-Thank you, God.

4
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:49,576
Alleluia.

5
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,911
-Alleluia.
-Alleluia.

6
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:57,784
Then Jesus said to them,

7
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:02,322
"I am the living bread
which has come down from heaven."

8
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,125
-Alleluia.
-Alleluia.

9
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:10,497
"Whoever eats this bread
will live forever.

10
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:16,102
This bread is my flesh, which I will give
for the life of the world."

11
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,973
-At this, the Jews
-Turn it off, please.

12
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:24,010
began to argue among themselves

13
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:27,313
"How can this man
give us his flesh to eat?"

14
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,584
-Turn it off, please!
-Jesus said to them.

15
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:36,589
"Very truly I tell you,

16
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,792
unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man

17
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:43,496
-and drink His blood,
-She probably didn't hear me.

18
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:46,666
you have no life in you.

19
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:52,238
Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood

20
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:54,240
has eternal life

21
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:58,945
and I will raise them up at the last day.

22
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:02,715
For my flesh is real food..."

23
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,535
Oh, dear!

24
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,027
-A.N.JELL!
-A.N.JELL!

25
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,001
HWANG TAE-GYUNG, MY EVERYTHING

26
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:05,745
I'll live holding only you in my eyes

27
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:13,052
I'll live holding only you in my arms

28
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:17,824
From morning till evening

29
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,861
You're the only one I want

30
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:27,066
I love you, don't forget

31
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:36,409
In the hot summer days, I'll be your shade

32
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:40,113
In the rainy days, I'll be your umbrella

33
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:46,719
When you're tired from walking
I'll be your chair

34
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:51,157
When you laugh, I will too

35
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:54,294
So your happiness can multiply

36
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,064
When you cry, I'll be your towel

37
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,668
And wipe it all away

38
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:08,508
I'll live holding only you in my eyes

39
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:14,447
How's your throat?

40
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:17,550
We agreed to lip syncing

41
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,719
since the doctor said
you can't sing live for a while.

42
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,921
It ended well. Isn't that enough?

43
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,892
Well, Tae-gyung's voice
did shake a bit at the end.

44
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,628
But I'm sure no one noticed.

45
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:31,431
Your voice cracked?

46
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,900
When? I didn't hear it.

47
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:36,736
Hwang Tae-gyung,
you're forbidden to sing live from now on.

48
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,838
What does a singer do besides sing?

49
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:41,207
You co-wrote the sixth album.

50
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,109
You know how straining they are
to your vocal cords.

51
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,510
You're not fit to sing them right now.

52
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,249
We're bringing in another vocal
as we planned.

53
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:54,454
As you know, not anyone can sing my songs.

54
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:57,724
It's not just anyone.

55
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:01,160
We found a decent vocalist.
You'll meet him soon.

56
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:06,232
I'll look forward to whoever it is, sir.

57
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:24,384
I'll start with David today.

58
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,753
Julian, Thomas, please wait.

59
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,394
David, I'm sure you've already noticed.

60
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,829
I messed up again.

61
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:41,534
I polluted the sacred church
with unholy music.

62
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:49,776
Please forgive me, Virgin Mary!

63
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:03,022
This is so embarrassing every time,
for you too I'm sure.

64
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,291
If only you had something
like Julian or Thomas

65
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:07,927
to cover yourself with.

66
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,097
Oh, my.

67
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,666
David, there's bird poop on your butt!

68
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:25,978
Who will wipe you down
when I've gone to Rome?

69
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:30,316
Every bird in this vicinity uses your butt
as their bathroom as it is.

70
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,584
I'm so worried.

71
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,202
So one of the twins is a nun?

72
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,744
Of all things, a nun? Why?

73
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:07,553
Gemma, there's really no need
for you to go...

74
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:11,390
It's my ticket to Rome.

75
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:13,493
It's only right that I go pick it up
at the travel agency.

76
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:15,027
Gemma.

77
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:18,865
Can you avoid cows well now?

78
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:23,703
I can.

79
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:25,571
Gemma, right turn.

80
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:29,709
Left turn.

81
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,916
Are you sure about this, Gemma?

82
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,658
I'm off, Reverend Mother!

83
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,161
Left turn.

84
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:37,243
Right turn.

85
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:17,583
Sister.

86
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:19,485
You know Ko Mi-nam, right?

87
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:21,554
Who are you?

88
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:23,956
You know him, don't you? Ko Mi-nam.

89
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:26,759
Why do you ask?

90
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,228
Wow.

91
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,606
You look exactly like him.

92
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:48,247
Wow.

93
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:57,757
Ko Mi-nam.

94
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,793
He's an uncut jewel, this kid.

95
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,828
His voice is, how should I say it?

96
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,638
What the...

97
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,007
What? Why...

98
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:24,283
Hold on. Give me a minute.

99
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,220
What did I even do to...

100
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:55,648
Stop! Pull over!

101
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:58,484
Sister!

102
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:04,657
Sister!

103
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,193
Sister! Stop, please?

104
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,862
Excuse me, bike? Would you stop?

105
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,363
Sister? Hey!

106
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:17,002
Sister?

107
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,138
She won't let me even talk to her.

108
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,413
What? Mister, move!

109
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,440
Sister!

110
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,776
Ko Mi-nam, don't you know him?

111
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,745
He's your twin brother, isn't he?
Ko Mi-nam!

112
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,115
Something's happened to him!
Something big!

113
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:17,463
Ko Mi-nam will become
the fourth member of A.N.JELL!

114
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,465
Refusal will be impossible!

115
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:20,966
This is God's will!

116
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:30,709
It really is Mi-nam.

117
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:33,679
He's gotten so skinny.

118
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,917
Mi-nam, are you eating well?

119
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:40,920
Excuse me, Sister. I--

120
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,956
Oh, actually,
I'm not officially a nun yet.

121
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,158
I haven't taken my permanent vows,
you see.

122
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:47,660
I see.

123
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:50,663
Miss, the reason I'm here

124
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,900
is because I have to tell you
something important.

125
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,135
For Mi-nam.

126
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:59,305
What's happened to him?

127
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,608
Something unbelievable.

128
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,510
Our Mi-nam

129
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:08,514
has been chosen
for the super popular band, A.N.JELL!

130
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,751
A what?

131
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:16,522
A.N.JELL! Don't you know them, Sister?

132
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,859
I told you, I'm not an official nun yet.

133
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:22,695
That's not the point here!

134
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:26,832
Mi-nam has been chosen
as a member of A.N.JELL!

135
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,335
The hottest band in Korea!

136
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:30,236
I see.

137
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:33,038
Then what's the problem?

138
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:36,242
In my hour of desperate need,

139
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:40,112
I've come to you for salvation, Sister.

140
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,648
What are you doing?

141
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,849
Sister.

142
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,986
-I've yet to take my permanent--
-Sister.

143
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,354
I mean, what? What do I say?

144
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,356
Saint! Holy Mother! What?

145
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:53,926
Oh, I know. God!

146
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,928
Please.

147
00:14:56,395 --> 00:15:00,532
He's your only family, Mi-nam.
Your twin brother.

148
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,002
Please save him.

149
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:07,072
Save him... How?

150
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,375
How?

151
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:12,478
Become Mi-nam.

152
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:13,879
What?

153
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:18,417
MANAGEMENT CONTRACT

154
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:21,353
All this contract needs is his signature.

155
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,622
He should be here any minute now.

156
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,692
This is seriously amazing. Jackpot!

157
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:28,694
Isn't he a bit too pretty?

158
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,930
If I didn't know better,
I would think he was a girl.

159
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:33,032
This kind of look is the trend these days!

160
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:36,035
A boy pretty as a flower, Ko Mi-nam!

161
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,505
It's good. I like it.

162
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:00,893
Really? All I have to do is sign?

163
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,095
Nothing has happened to Mi-nam, right?

164
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,163
Nothing at all.

165
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:06,165
It was just a small accident, nothing big.

166
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:09,802
You just have to go in
and sign the contract, that's it.

167
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:10,703
Yes. That's all.

168
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:13,639
Stay here. Let me go park the car.

169
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:29,421
CREATIVE THINKING

SOFTIE SQUISHIE SHIN-WOO

Oh, my. You're all angels.

And you're a nun.

180
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,122
Are you a real nun?

181
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,157
No.

182
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,092
I've yet to take my permanent vows.

183
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:08,327
I see.

184
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:13,465
You really do stand out,
I'll give you that.

185
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:14,900
You're a genius.

186
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:17,269
She even has the ring!

187
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:20,339
They will all be looking at you.
I'm jealous.

188
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,809
Why didn't I think of this?

189
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:28,514
Are you all here to meet A.N.JELL?

190
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,216
Yes, I've been staking out here
for three days.

191
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:32,451
Haven't seen them once.

192
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:36,355
Then, what about today?
Will we not see them either?

193
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:37,923
He said we had to see them today.

194
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,626
We also have to see them today.

195
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:42,961
Midterms start tomorrow.

196
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,396
Man.

197
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:46,565
-Wait!
-Oh, my!

198
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:47,699
-They're here!
-They're here!

199
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:51,537
Oh, dear.

200
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,305
-A.N.JELL!
-A.N.JELL!

201
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,507
Excuse me? Your fan...

202
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:00,412
Excuse me, your fan...

203
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,880
-A.N.JELL!
-A.N.JELL!

204
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:03,215
A.N.JELL?

205
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:04,883
Is that them?

206
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,357
-A.N.JELL!
-A.N.JELL!

207
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,494
-A.N.JELL!
-A.N.JELL!

208
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,897
-A.N.JELL!
-A.N.JELL!

209
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:22,234
-A.N.JELL!
-A.N.JELL!

210
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,770
LET A.N.JELL'S MUSIC SOAR UP TO HEAVEN

211
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:30,676
-A.N.JELL!
-A.N.JELL!

212
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:33,145
-A.N.JELL!
-I love you!

213
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,249
Reverend Mother.

214
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,753
Today, I saw three truly angelic,
beautiful people.

215
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:46,692
They looked like David, Julian, and Thomas

216
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,027
in our church garden had come to life.

217
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:58,871
-A.N.JELL!
-A.N.JELL!

218
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:00,105
Oh, my.

219
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:01,707
Wow!

220
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:02,875
LOOK AT ME TAE-GYUNG

221
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:04,643
MY HUSBAND, TAE-GYUNG

222
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:10,549
-A.N.JELL!
-A.N.JELL!

223
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:11,817
-Bye!
-A.N.JELL!

224
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:12,718
SHIN-WOO THE HOTTEST

225
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:16,488
-A.N.JELL!
-A.N.JELL!

226
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,793
Were you an A.N.JELL fan?

227
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:23,929
Hey.

228
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,998
-Excuse me?
-No, I...

229
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:27,766
-A.N.JELL!
-A.N.JELL!

230
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,800
You're young. Makes sense.

231
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,636
Let's go. Oh, that's right.

232
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:33,405
I brought you some clothes and a wig.

233
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:34,973
-A.N.JELL!
-A.N.JELL!

234
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,141
You have to wear these.

235
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,910
-A.N.JELL!
-A.N.JELL!

236
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:39,444
I know you secretly love it. Let's go.

237
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,713
-A.N.JELL!
-This way.

238
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:53,225
Mi-nam!

239
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,667
You look exactly like him!

240
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:06,872
I don't know, this just feels
a bit like a con to me.

241
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,742
Con? What do you mean con?

242
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,911
All you're doing is signing
a piece of paper.

243
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,514
Besides, this is Mi-nam's dream,
his future.

244
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:16,682
You can't do this for him?

245
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:19,151
Just one signature
on a piece of paper, that's all.

246
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,052
Let's go.

247
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:24,323
I noticed how ripped these pants were.

248
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,592
And it keeps slipping down.

249
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:29,962
This is the trend. The latest trend.

250
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,163
Just hold it like this and walk.

251
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,264
Let's go.

252
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,434
This way. Come on.

253
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:40,038
Hey, Ko Mi-nam! Hey!

254
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:41,273
You're finally here.

255
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:45,077
Yes, Mi-nam.

256
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:47,446
You look nervous.

257
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:49,181
You've read the contract, yes?

258
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:52,317
Yes, we have. It's perfect, yes.

259
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:55,787
Let's get some signatures on it then!

260
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:56,888
Here we go!

261
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:02,060
AN SUNG-CHANG

262
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,803
Go on, sign there.

263
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:25,517
KO MI-NAM

264
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:36,828
Is that him?

265
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,130
Ko Mi-nam.

266
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,065
"The Voice of Heaven"?

267
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:47,239
Good timing, I was just about
to introduce you to him.

268
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:48,874
Where's Shin-woo and Jermy?

269
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:10,429
Are you really that great?

270
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:22,841
There's something I need to check.

271
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:24,910
Something more important
than this piece of paper.

272
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:30,115
Hey. Tae-gyung!

273
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,717
-Mr. An!
-Tae-gyung!

274
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,122
So, you're...

275
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:39,825
Ko Mi-nam?

276
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:42,761
Hey.

277
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,131
He's way shorter than I thought.

278
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:58,210
Hwang Tae-gyung.

279
00:22:58,276 --> 00:22:59,578
Tae-gyung! Open up!

280
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:04,916
Open the door!

281
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:07,753
Hey! Tae-gyung, you open this door.

282
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:09,688
-You hear me?
-Excuse me?

283
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,424
-Can you open--
-Come on, Hoon-i, try harder.

284
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:13,992
Tae-gyung! Open the door!

285
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,228
-Tae-gyung!
-Open the door, please!

286
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:18,463
-Open! Please!
-Tae-gyung!

287
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:20,632
-Please, open the door!
-Oh, man.

288
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,067
Mi-nam!

289
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:25,437
Sing it.

290
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:30,942
I have to hear you sing myself
before I decide to accept you.

291
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:33,478
If you fail my expectations,

292
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:36,248
it won't matter if you sign 100 contracts
with Mr. An.

293
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:38,417
I can't let you join our team.

294
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:43,088
Mr. An sang praises about you.

295
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:44,856
I admit I'm curious.

296
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:48,927
He said you sing beautifully.

297
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,363
Go on, sing. Let's hear it.

298
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:56,034
If you don't like that one,

299
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:58,336
just sing whichever you like.

300
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:01,640
There has to be a key somewhere.

301
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:03,975
Hoon-i, keep talking to them.

302
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:06,344
Open the door, will you?

303
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:09,314
The door. Hello?

304
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:10,982
Mi-nam!

305
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:14,186
Do something, you're his manager!

306
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,588
Hey, Ko Mi-nam!

307
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:19,291
Mi-nam, just apologize!

308
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:21,893
-Say you're sorry and come...
-What? Can't do it?

309
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,162
Hey, don't do anything rash, okay?
Do you hear me?

310
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:26,598
-Hey!
-Hwang Tae-gyung!

311
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:27,999
Open the damn door!

312
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,535
Do something, come on!

313
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,772
Mi-nam, look over here.

314
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,207
Mi-nam!

315
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:36,975
Ko Mi-nam!

316
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:38,410
Hey!

317
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:40,846
This was your life-long dream!

318
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:43,448
Don't give up now!

319
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:46,151
You've dreamed of this moment!

320
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:48,119
Ko Mi-nam's future and dream
depends on this!

321
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:49,888
You can't give up now. You can't!

322
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:52,958
Mi-nam, do you hear me? You can't...

323
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:55,093
Forget it. You aren't worth it.

324
00:24:57,462 --> 00:24:58,296
MANAGEMENT CONTRACT

325
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:11,409
MANAGEMENT CONTRACT

326
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:53,718
MANAGEMENT CONTRACT

327
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:15,974
Thank goodness, open it up. Quickly.

328
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:17,742
My goodness.

329
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:19,010
All right.

330
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,731
You do have a beautiful voice.

331
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:42,000
I got goosebumps!

332
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:44,269
Where did that beautiful voice come from?

333
00:26:46,304 --> 00:26:48,974
I think Tae-gyung approved of you too,

334
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:50,408
which means you're one of us now.

335
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,243
Welcome to the team.

336
00:26:59,150 --> 00:26:59,985
Nicely done.

337
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,455
This will be great!

338
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,490
You remind me of my debut days.

339
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,336
You twins are seriously amazing.

340
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:21,573
Even your voices are identical!

341
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:23,408
You did so well.

342
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,744
What? Why? What's wrong?

343
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:28,713
I'm all right.

344
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,183
I think I was too nervous
and tense back there.

345
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,084
Oh, dear.

346
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:35,320
I should get back and pray.

347
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:38,590
Please ask Mi-nam to come visit me

348
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,625
before I leave for Rome this weekend.

349
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:44,529
"Leave for Rome"?

350
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:47,799
Didn't Mi-nam tell you?
I sent him a letter.

351
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,635
I will be leaving for Rome soon.

352
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:54,673
I will be taking my permanent vows there
at the Veronica Nunnery.

353
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:56,841
Then, I'll get to live
my life there forever,

354
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:59,110
praying and serving the Lord.

355
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,379
You can't go.

356
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,014
Excuse me?

357
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:06,384
Just one month. Don't ask why.

358
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:08,253
Please stay as Mi-nam just for a month.

359
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:10,422
And there's a press conference
this weekend,

360
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:11,623
and you have to attend.

361
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:14,826
That's impossible!

362
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,327
Tell Mi-nam to attend.

363
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:18,196
Mi-nam...

364
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:20,165
I'll be going now.

365
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,601
Mi-nam can't close his eyes!

366
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:28,339
Excuse me?

367
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,845
This is all my fault.

368
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:38,116
I just told him to get
a small surgery right here. Just a bit.

369
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:41,086
I mean, it's nothing bad!
It's a service for the fans, really.

370
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:42,187
Right?

371
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:44,489
But I don't know
what that bastard of a doctor did,

372
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,925
but I saw Mi-nam sleeping,
and he was like this.

373
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:50,361
I was so scared,
and he's in the US right now to fix it.

374
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:54,733
If this gets out now, he's ruined.
We're ruined!

375
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,601
The second surgery and recovery
will take a month.

376
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:58,169
Just one month.

377
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,872
Please stay as Mi-nam just for that month.

378
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,975
By that, you mean...

379
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:08,046
you want me to sing and dance with them

380
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:10,381
and live as a man?

381
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:11,349
That's correct.

382
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,151
And you have to live in the dorm too.

383
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,321
-No way.
-Way.

384
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:18,189
I'll help you out with everything.

385
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,025
-I can't do it.
-Yes, you can.

386
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:22,727
I...

387
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:25,897
I can't. I won't.

388
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,299
Wait, Sister!

389
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:31,402
Sister!

390
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,194
Gemma.

391
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:01,399
It is quite late.

392
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:05,804
Reverend Mother.

393
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:10,108
You've been praying
ever since you came back from Seoul.

394
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:13,044
Did something happen to Mi-nam?

395
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:15,780
Yes, Reverend Mother.

396
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:19,284
But there's nothing more I can do to help.

397
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:20,718
I can't.

398
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,588
I am destined to be a nun!

399
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:28,159
Gemma, why do you wish to become a nun?

400
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,595
I...

401
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:33,464
I...

402
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:36,534
It's His will.

403
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:38,837
I didn't ask you for His will.

404
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:41,306
I asked you for yours.

405
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:44,175
Well, I...

406
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:46,711
I...

407
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:50,915
I grew up in the nunnery
since I was a young child.

408
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:54,953
I wanted to become a nun like you.
That's all I ever wished for.

409
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:58,623
Gemma, you have much more time

410
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:01,860
to see, experience, and think deeply.

411
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:04,963
I have made up my mind already.

412
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,432
I'm going to leave for Rome this weekend.

413
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:09,968
That is His will. God's will.

414
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:11,769
His will

415
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:15,106
cannot be decided for certain by anyone.

416
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:23,848
This is His will.

417
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:26,084
I will go to Rome.

418
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:48,873
Tae-gyung, while we're in Japan,

419
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,642
want to get wasted at Ginza?

420
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,945
All we have are two show recordings
and two interviews.

421
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:54,979
We're free at night!

422
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:57,782
We're taking the first flight tomorrow
back for the press conference.

423
00:31:57,849 --> 00:31:59,517
Oh, Ko Mi-nam?

424
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:04,389
If we don't go,
Mr. An will be pissed, right?

425
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:07,325
There will be tons of articles
about how we hate him.

426
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:11,429
It seems like Tae-gyung
still doesn't like him, right?

427
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:12,764
He doesn't like anything anyway.

428
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:14,766
And besides, Mi-nam proved himself.

429
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:16,000
He can't complain anymore.

430
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:18,937
I need some coffee.

431
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:20,471
See you on the plane.

432
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:21,372
What?

433
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,743
Even with the headphones on, you can hear
everything that needs to be heard.

434
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:42,327
Oh, I'm sorry!

435
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,229
I'm sorry...

436
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:46,931
BOARDING TICKET

437
00:32:58,343 --> 00:32:59,711
Are you really that great?

438
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:06,784
Sister! Your ticket...

439
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:08,453
Your ticket.

440
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:09,620
Sister!

441
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:11,289
Sister!

442
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:13,791
ELEVATOR

443
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:18,262
Sister!

444
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,220
Please don't mind me.

445
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:51,556
Wait, this is his.

446
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,792
Wait! My plane ticket...

447
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,563
My ticket!

448
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:05,203
Tae-gyung! It's A.N.JELL!

449
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:06,938
Hello?

450
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:09,674
Some nun dropped her ticket
in front of me.

451
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:13,077
Her plane's leaving in less than an hour.
What should I do?

452
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:15,646
We have to return it to the nun,
of course.

453
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:16,747
I'll look for her too.

454
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:19,283
If she's in her habit, it won't be hard.

455
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:28,860
Oh, no.

456
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:37,869
A nun, you said, right?

457
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:40,404
I think I found her.

458
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,179
Wait, isn't that Shin-woo?

459
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:55,653
So, you're Ko Mi-nam?

460
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,022
Sister!

461
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,527
Sister?

462
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:08,966
Jermy! Hi!

463
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,435
Where would I find a nun?

464
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:20,411
Wait a second.

465
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:26,284
Welcome to the team.

466
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:28,886
Hey, excuse me!

467
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:31,722
Excuse me!

468
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:36,594
Wait, hold on! Sister!

469
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:39,163
Oh, man! Excuse me!

470
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,801
Wait, excuse me! Wait!

471
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:45,203
I won't lose you.

472
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:47,071
Excuse me! Sister!

473
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:27,445
Wait, isn't he a singer?

474
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:29,914
-That's the one you like!
-I know. Oh, my gosh!

475
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:31,048
Oh, my goodness!

476
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:32,216
Tae-gyung.

477
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:35,720
He's so handsome.

478
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:38,289
This plane's about to leave soon.
What do I do?

479
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,392
Where has this Sister run off to?

480
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:01,712
My ticket...
I don't have much time left now.

481
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,056
What am I even doing right now?

482
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:25,102
I just can't seem to find her.

483
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,005
Yes, I've looked everywhere.

484
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:30,541
I have to get that back.

485
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,276
How though?

486
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:43,354
I'll snatch it out of his hands
fast and quick, and run!

487
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:47,258
Yes. I can do it.

488
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,572
No signs of her anywhere?

489
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:05,443
Her plane's about to leave.

490
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,777
This ticket's useless now.

491
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,480
She was a rather strange nun.

492
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:12,583
We should head in too.

493
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,085
Tae-gyung, let's go!

494
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:38,409
My ticket...

495
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,145
My ticket to Rome!

496
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:48,519
It's to Rome.

497
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:03,601
Reverend Mother.

498
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,503
What do I do now?

499
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:21,519
ROME

500
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:24,855
The 6:00 p.m. flight to Rome
will be leaving shortly.

501
00:40:57,354 --> 00:40:58,989
This is his.

502
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,606
M.U.S.I.C

503
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:18,375
A.N.JELL, sixth album, track number three.

504
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:19,276
Demo track.

505
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,378
Title, "Memories."

506
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:23,881
It's his voice.

507
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:27,051
I shouldn't have

508
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:29,920
I should have ignored you

509
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:32,656
As if I couldn't see

510
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:36,460
As if I wasn't able to see you

511
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:38,295
I should have

512
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:44,034
Never set my eyes on you

513
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:48,572
I should have ran away

514
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:51,141
-This is a good song.
-As if I couldn't hear

515
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,844
Is this the kind of music Mi-nam
wants to do too?

516
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:57,681
As if I wasn't able to hear

517
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,583
I should have

518
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:05,222
Never listened to your love

519
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:16,300
Miss!

520
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:20,170
Do you know why Mi-nam wants to sing?

521
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:24,074
He wanted to find his mom.

522
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:26,443
He wanted to find your mom.

523
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:30,614
He said if he sang,
your mom will come find you!

524
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:32,383
He said your mom will come back!

525
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:34,251
That's why he had to sing!
That's what he said!

526
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:47,264
-You guys are hobos
-You guys are hobos

527
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:50,901
-You guys are hobos
-You guys are hobos

528
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:52,670
-You guys are hobos
-You guys are hobos

529
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,572
I heard your dad died,
and your mom ran away!

530
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:56,774
There are hobos living at our cathedral!

531
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,175
-Hobos!
-They're hobos!

532
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:01,545
-You guys are hobos
-You guys are hobos

533
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:02,580
Hey, let's go.

534
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,549
-See you later, hobos!
-See you later, hobos!

535
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:17,161
Mi-nam, are we really hobos?

536
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:21,332
No! Our dad was a great musician!

537
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:24,868
And our mom was a famous singer!

538
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:26,236
Really?

539
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:28,572
When I become a famous singer,

540
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:30,574
I know we can find our mom!

541
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:47,825
Is this all also

542
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:50,160
Your will, Lord?

543
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:53,330
Where should I go now?

544
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:21,392
-Oh, hello!
-Hello!

545
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:24,294
-How are you?
-Sir!

546
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:28,132
Welcome. Thank you for coming.

547
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:29,500
Oh, my goodness. Hello!

548
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:30,834
Mr. Kim!

549
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:32,136
-Mr. An!
-Yes.

550
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:55,526
From now on,

551
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:58,162
I'll live as Ko Mi-nam.

552
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:13,844
Thank you for waiting.

553
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:15,779
Today, we will be introducing to you

554
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:19,917
the newest vocal of A.N.JELL!

555
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:35,799
It's the best group in Asia, A.N.JELL!

556
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:49,947
A.N.JELL'S NEW LEAP

557
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:21,178
And now, I give you the newest addition
to our great group, A.N.JELL!

558
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:22,446
Ko Mi-nam!

559
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:50,274
Where is he?

560
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,942
-Is he not coming out?
-What's going on?

561
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:53,777
-Why isn't he coming out?
-Where is he?

562
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:55,412
-Hello?
-What's taking so long?

563
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,880
-This is weird.
-Why isn't he coming out?

564
00:46:57,181 --> 00:46:58,182
-What is this?
-What is this?

565
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:33,884
Nice! Brilliant!

566
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:41,558
He looks good when he cleans up.

567
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:44,494
Pretty manly, right?

568
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:48,298
-Look over here!
-Over here, please!

569
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:49,867
-Here!
-Look over here, please!

570
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:52,903
-Look over here!
-Over here, please!

571
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:16,126
A.N.JELL's newest member, Ko Mi-nam,

572
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,362
has gone through three years of training

573
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:20,998
and has defeated odds of 300 to 1
for this debut.

574
00:48:21,865 --> 00:48:26,236
Alongside Tae-gyung,
he will be a vocal for a more upgraded...

575
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:27,371
It's him.

576
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:29,306
Please look forward to it.

577
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:32,743
-Look over here!
-Over here, please!

578
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:34,912
I suppose he did take after me.

579
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:38,115
-Look over here!
-Over here, please!

580
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:41,418
-Mi-nam! Ko Mi-nam!
-Over here, please!

581
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:44,988
-Look over here!
-One more picture!

582
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:55,766
Gosh.

583
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:47,117
This is his.

584
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:49,119
I should return it to him.

585
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:57,627
Oh, wow.

586
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:05,635
Oh, my goodness.

587
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:10,841
It's spotless.

588
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:17,280
I have to place it so it fits right in.

589
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:47,811
What do I do?

590
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:53,316
Oh, man.

591
00:50:56,486 --> 00:50:57,354
What do I do?

592
00:50:58,789 --> 00:50:59,890
What do I do?

593
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:42,799
What do I do?

594
00:51:49,806 --> 00:51:50,640
What are you doing?

595
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:53,743
I...

596
00:51:56,746 --> 00:51:57,914
Oh, my!

597
00:51:58,949 --> 00:51:59,883
Stop!

598
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:02,652
Stop it, please!

599
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:05,522
Stop!

600
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:07,958
MASSAGE

601
00:52:09,192 --> 00:52:10,560
Wait!

602
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,863
Hold on!

603
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:18,969
Please, calm down!

604
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:22,472
It goes on for what, 30 seconds?

605
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:35,886
Do you shower with a bidet?

606
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:47,531
I am so sorry for barging in. I apologize!

607
00:52:48,431 --> 00:52:49,399
You...

608
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:51,001
-Here.
-Go away!

609
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:58,775
I'll tell you a few do's and don'ts,
so listen closely.

610
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,378
One. Don't touch me.

611
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:03,780
I especially hate when people
run at me unexpectedly.

612
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:05,916
Two. Don't come in my room.

613
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:08,552
Do what you will with the bidet,
in your room.

614
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:11,221
Three. Don't touch my stuff.

615
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:13,857
If the things I touch
aren't in their right places,

616
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:15,792
it makes me furious.

617
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:17,928
Understood?

618
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:20,797
Yes.

619
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:25,435
If you did, wrap up that bidet-soaked body

620
00:53:26,403 --> 00:53:27,237
and get out.

621
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,374
Yes. I'm sorry.

622
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:52,662
Bidets are more dangerous than I thought.

623
00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:55,932
I better be careful.

624
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,378
Ko Mi-nam.

625
00:54:08,445 --> 00:54:11,181
You can become like them too!

626
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:12,682
Just trust me. All right?

627
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:17,721
Yes! Thank you!

628
00:54:17,787 --> 00:54:18,622
WELCOME TO A.N.JELL

629
00:54:18,688 --> 00:54:19,990
I'm never washing this hand.

630
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:21,157
Here we go.

631
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:29,666
Tonight's party is for you. Enjoy it!

632
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:31,468
People are raving about you!

633
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:34,104
All right, for Ko Mi-nam! Cheers!

634
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:35,672
Cheers!

635
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:22,319
Hey.

636
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:25,522
I'm A.N.JELL's top stylist.

637
00:55:26,456 --> 00:55:28,191
Oh, I see!

638
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:32,829
-What--
-They're not big to start with.

639
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:34,364
You'll be fine.

640
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:35,732
My goodness gracious.

641
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:39,502
She's a friend of mine, don't worry.
She's on our side.

642
00:55:41,304 --> 00:55:42,272
You'll be the death of me.

643
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,574
I'm pulling out
as soon as it gets dangerous.

644
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:46,176
Okay.

645
00:55:48,812 --> 00:55:51,781
You can treat me like
I'm your older sister from now on.

646
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:02,559
You're so cute!

647
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:04,761
Look at his skin, it's fairer than mine.

648
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,429
What are you doing?

649
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:09,566
Listen to him, he sounds adorable too!
He's so my type!

650
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:11,101
What are you...

651
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:13,503
Here, have another glass.

652
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,209
Look at him, isn't he something?

653
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,378
It's like when I debuted.

654
00:56:21,444 --> 00:56:22,946
All the women are swooning for him.

655
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:24,781
He's full of surprises, it seems.

656
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:44,267
It's been a while.

657
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,202
Yes.

658
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:54,377
Are you all right?

659
00:56:56,613 --> 00:56:57,614
Me?

660
00:56:59,048 --> 00:57:00,417
I'm...

661
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:01,918
all right.

662
00:57:02,786 --> 00:57:05,822
I am all right,
but why can't I stop smiling?

663
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:06,956
Okay, enough.

664
00:57:07,023 --> 00:57:08,958
You can get drunk on champagne too.

665
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:10,326
-Wait, that's mine--
-Okay.

666
00:57:10,393 --> 00:57:11,961
Stand up straight. Stand up!

667
00:57:12,028 --> 00:57:13,363
-Freeze!
-Freeze.

668
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,498
Look at me in the eyes. Stay right here.

669
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:16,800
I'll bring you some ice water.

670
00:57:18,034 --> 00:57:18,968
Tag. Out.

671
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:23,640
Sir...

672
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:43,927
David! What are you doing here?

673
00:57:44,828 --> 00:57:45,762
What are you doing?

674
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:49,999
-What?
-We're on the second floor.

675
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:54,571
Right, I'm a man. I'm a man, yes.

676
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:57,173
Are you not feeling well?

677
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,309
No, I'm fine.

678
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:01,878
You look drunk. Let's go!

679
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:04,080
-No, really. I'm fine.
-Come on.

680
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,915
I'm fine, I'm...

681
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:08,284
Here. This is the men's room.

682
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:11,488
I said I'm fine.

683
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:16,459
Wait...

684
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:19,562
This is a bit worrisome.

685
00:58:26,102 --> 00:58:29,939
The walls are moving.

686
00:58:35,078 --> 00:58:37,313
Stay still, please.

687
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:43,653
It's hot. Why is it so hot?

688
00:58:55,498 --> 00:58:57,033
There are reporters still around here.

689
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,968
Someone's always watching. Be careful.

690
00:58:59,035 --> 00:58:59,969
You look drunk.

691
00:59:01,404 --> 00:59:03,439
Pop a few more buttons. You look stuffy.

692
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:06,543
Wait. Don't touch me!

693
00:59:08,411 --> 00:59:09,946
I don't feel stuffy at all!

694
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:13,283
You're sweating. Take off the shirt.

695
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:16,085
I can't. I will not.

696
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:20,523
Someone's always watching.
I can't take it off.

697
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:24,460
Then, want to get some fresh air?
We can go to the roof.

698
00:59:26,696 --> 00:59:28,231
Where's the roof?

699
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:30,700
That way.

700
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,403
Oh, wait here.
I'll bring you some coffee to sober up.

701
00:59:43,613 --> 00:59:45,748
-That's all it needs.
-That's great.

702
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:48,818
How about a toast? Cheers!

703
00:59:52,956 --> 00:59:55,158
Is he about to relieve himself
somewhere that's not a bathroom?

704
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:57,594
He's drunk. This might be dangerous.

705
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:07,003
Oh, man.

706
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,738
I feel so much better.

707
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:30,860
This feels so good.

708
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:43,573
Are you out of your mind?

709
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:47,644
You almost fell over.

710
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:50,179
My stomach doesn't feel well.

711
01:00:52,015 --> 01:00:53,950
Hey. You okay?

712
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,056
Go to the bathroom. Now!

713
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:05,194
Oh, my.

714
01:01:06,596 --> 01:01:08,197
Hey, would this work?

715
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:12,301
Gosh.

716
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:15,505
What about this?

717
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:20,109
Darn it.

718
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:25,081
Here!

719
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:47,270
I feel so much better now.

720
01:01:53,242 --> 01:01:54,077
Goodness.

721
01:01:58,481 --> 01:01:59,982
The flower's so pretty.

722
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:05,421
Damn...

723
01:02:09,592 --> 01:02:10,827
Oh, you're here too.

724
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:12,995
How are you feeling?

725
01:02:15,431 --> 01:02:17,900
Yes. I emptied myself. It's good now.

726
01:02:19,035 --> 01:02:21,904
Wait! Did you really do it here?

727
01:02:25,108 --> 01:02:26,042
Oh, my.

728
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:30,012
Wait, all four of us are here now.

729
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,882
Should we have our own
welcoming party or something?

730
01:02:33,149 --> 01:02:35,451
He's so out of it.
We can't do anything with him.

731
01:02:40,189 --> 01:02:43,559
I really like this place.

732
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:51,701
He's a strange one.

733
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:55,338
Life's about to get interesting.

734
01:02:56,005 --> 01:03:00,042
We'll see if he will be
interesting or disastrous.

735
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:09,585
Wow!

736
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:14,190
The sky seems so close from here.

737
01:03:16,926 --> 01:03:18,961
I feel like I can touch heaven.

738
01:03:44,287 --> 01:03:45,388
Reverend Mother,

739
01:03:45,955 --> 01:03:48,491
I had such a strange dream.

740
01:03:54,764 --> 01:03:57,266
It was such a beautiful place.

741
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,435
And in that place

742
01:03:59,702 --> 01:04:04,941
was David, Julian, Thomas,
from our church garden.

743
01:05:01,864 --> 01:05:03,032
Reverend Mother,

744
01:05:03,633 --> 01:05:06,002
do you think that was heaven?

745
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:18,848
Reverend Mother,

746
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:21,951
do you think I'm still in heaven?

747
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:24,520
