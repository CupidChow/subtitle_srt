1
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,825
I can't see anything.

2
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:27,761
I can't see Ko Mi-nam!

3
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:31,664
I told you not to stay
where I can't see you!

4
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:33,600
-Who was that?
-What's going on?

5
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:34,834
Tae-gyung?

6
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:42,342
-Who was that?
-What's going on?

7
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,981
-Tae-gyung!
-Tae-gyung!

8
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:02,996
What's going on?

9
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:04,964
Look over here, please!

10
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:08,968
-Do the other members know about this?
-Please, over here!

11
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:10,103
-A word, please!
-Shin-woo!

12
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,154
She's my woman!

13
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:30,457
I had to keep her a secret until now.

14
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:33,493
This is the woman I love.

15
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,697
I do not wish to reveal my girlfriend.

16
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:41,000
Please, move aside so she can leave.

17
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,635
Tae-gyung, do you know
who Shin-woo's girlfriend is?

18
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,670
-Who is it?
-What's her name?

19
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:18,905
-A name!
-What's her name?

20
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:43,630
That...

21
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:46,266
Was that...

22
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,301
Yes.

23
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,875
So he was a girl.

24
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:17,130
Hey! What the heck is going on?

25
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,367
Where did Shin-woo's girlfriend come from?
You know who she is, don't you?

26
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:28,107
How am I supposed to do damage control
for this? The premiere has to go on!

27
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:38,651
What was Ko Mi-nam thinking?

28
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:42,789
How do you know that it was her?

29
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:44,924
What?

30
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,527
Oh, so, I...

31
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:50,096
I'll talk to you later.

32
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:54,901
What do I say? What do I do?

33
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:57,637
Did he figure it out?

34
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,142
I could've ended her.

35
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,212
Why did you all have to appear!

36
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,452
-Shin-woo!
-Shin-woo!

37
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,259
KO MI-NAM'S FIRST SINGLE ALBUM
MUSIC VIDEO PREMIERE

38
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:56,629
I'm sorry.

39
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:58,865
I'm actually

40
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,934
not a man.

41
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:08,508
I know you'll be very angry
if you see me now.

42
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:12,779
I can't ask you to forgive me for this...

43
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:24,857
Wow, what can I say?

44
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:31,864
This is all so sudden,
I don't know where to begin.

45
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:36,703
I wasn't prepared for a situation
like this, to be honest.

46
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:41,941
Should I be angry first?

47
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:48,781
But it'd be just as strange
to immediately say that it's all fine.

48
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:01,160
Mi-nam! You were a girl?

49
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,899
I can't believe this.

50
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,503
I understand.

51
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:15,441
Let me see you clearly. Lift up your head.

52
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:25,284
You really are a girl.
You really are pretty.

53
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,554
How did I not know this whole time?

54
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:34,594
I thought you were just clumsy,
but this is quite a feat you pulled off.

55
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,333
You were so good to me the whole time.

56
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:44,570
I'm so sorry that I completely fooled you.

57
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:51,444
We'll talk more later
about what exactly happened.

58
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,347
Anyhow. Ko Mi-nam!

59
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:58,217
I'm done treating you
like a little brother.

60
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,019
From this moment on,

61
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,122
we'll start over.

62
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:08,694
Shin-woo! Open the door!

63
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:17,437
-Shin-woo! A word, please!
-Tell us who she is!

64
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,395
As you can see, Ko Mi-nam is a woman.
I had known it before.

65
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,163
Sorry for keeping it a secret.

66
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,733
If you can't accept this
in any shape or form, speak up now.

67
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,170
I'll bear full responsibility
for Ko Mi-nam and not get you involved.

68
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,506
I've already jumped headfirst into it.

69
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,809
Shin-woo is in. What about you, Jermy?

70
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,212
Ko Mi-nam.

71
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:02,315
You were a girl this whole time.

72
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:04,350
A girl?

73
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,789
I'm sorry, Jermy.

74
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,624
Ko Mi-nam!

75
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,194
I had no idea...

76
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,944
Ko Mi-nam! You're a girl!

77
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,046
I'm so for this! I love it!

78
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:36,816
Ko Mi-nam!

79
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,187
Ko Mi-nam, I get it, I totally understand!
Am I dreaming? Is this real?

80
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:44,924
So I'll take that as a yes.
Now, to the situation at hand.

81
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:45,958
Ko Mi-nam.

82
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:47,960
Ko Mi-nam?

83
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,329
Forget it.

84
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:54,634
This is a dream. It has to be.
Right? Is it not? Is this real life?

85
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,235
Forget him too, he's lost it.

86
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,504
Shin-woo. Go get Mr. Ma and Ms. Wang.

87
00:08:58,571 --> 00:08:59,639
Right? It's real, right?

88
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:10,082
Would Hwang Tae-gyung have figured out
that it was me who put her up to this?

89
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,688
Then he'll call us off immediately.

90
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,962
Ko Mi-nam is the one who's supposed
to be ruined, not me!

91
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,967
I don't want to end this...

92
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,213
-Excuse me!
-Look over here, please!

93
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:45,451
Excuse me! We cannot and will not
reveal Shin-woo's girlfriend!

94
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:48,020
Please return to the premiere!

95
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:51,757
-Just...
-No!

96
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:53,526
Hoon-i! What... is this
Shin-woo's girlfriend?

97
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,962
It's all right. I'll take her back home.

98
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,698
The kids are all in the dressing room,
you should start the premiere!

99
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,166
Right! Thanks!

100
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:01,867
I can't see! Slow down!

101
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,940
We're really all in the same boat now!

102
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:18,918
Ko Mi-nam.

103
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,287
We're all in the same boat now.

104
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:26,258
You told me that you came all the way
here so no one else will get hurt.

105
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:33,299
If that's what you really want,
stay until the end. As the man Ko Mi-nam.

106
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,603
Now, even if you want to stop,
we cannot let you.

107
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:43,509
We'll be accountable for you,
so be accountable for us as well.

108
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,245
Tae-gyung.

109
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,314
I look forward to it, Mi-nam.

110
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:50,349
Shin-woo.

111
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,184
You better take good care of me,
Ko Mi-nam.

112
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:53,819
Jermy...

113
00:10:56,389 --> 00:11:00,092
Thank you so much. And I'm so sorry.

114
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,764
I'll make sure that I don't get caught.

115
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:08,768
Kang Shin-woo!

116
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:11,737
You...

117
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,740
You and I will talk after the premiere.

118
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,710
Mi-nam. Let's go.

119
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:21,013
We can call back the reporters.
Let's give them a great show!

120
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,549
-Let's go.
-Ko Mi-nam!

121
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,328
She's my woman!

122
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,733
Thank goodness we passed that hurdle.

123
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:46,205
It's all thanks to you.

124
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:01,487
It's broken.

125
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:08,394
I wasn't even paying attention
to the premiere.

126
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:20,072
Why would he bring her here
if he was so adamant in hiding her away?

127
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,610
Was this unplanned and unexpected?

128
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,513
Hold on a second.

129
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:33,085
Hwang Tae-gyung had been looking
for someone just before this happened.

130
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:36,956
-It's Hwang Tae-gyung!
-It's Hwang Tae-gyung!

131
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:39,492
-It's Tae-gyung!
-He's so handsome!

132
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:42,628
Hwang Tae-gyung? Who is he looking for?

133
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:45,131
We'll begin shortly.

134
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,937
This woman, who appeared out of nowhere.

135
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,775
Hwang Tae-gyung,
who was urgently looking for someone.

136
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,146
Perhaps there is a connection
between those two?

137
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,121
Kang Shin-woo's hidden lover.

138
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,991
Hwang Tae-gyung's hidden lover.

139
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,396
There has to be a connection.

140
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:20,800
Here they come!

141
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,235
Here they come!

142
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:34,146
The secret is hidden in there.

143
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,349
And I will find out what it is.

144
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:40,019
We won't take any more questions.
We are done for today.

145
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:42,087
I trust that you watched
the music video well?

146
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:46,091
Yes, I look forward
to your wonderfully-written articles!

147
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:51,030
Then today is a very great day!

148
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,498
Right?

149
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,868
Then I must have
a congratulatory party tonight!

150
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:57,469
Ko Mi-nam!

151
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,805
-Shin-woo.
-All right.

152
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:02,741
Before we do, there's another hurdle
we have to face.

153
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:04,543
What is it?

154
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:07,279
Honey...

155
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:17,156
It's a very scary hurdle. The Fake Hurdle.

156
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:25,531
Tae-gyung, I don't know
what this is all about...

157
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:30,202
Drop the act. I already know
that it was your doing.

158
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:37,042
Is that so? Figured it out, have you?

159
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:40,746
Do they all know too?

160
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:49,188
So they really forgave her
and they are okay with it?

161
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:54,260
What, do you think you're actually angels
because people call you that?

162
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:00,466
Ko Mi-nam.

163
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:04,069
You're so ridiculous,
you couldn't even pull that off?

164
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,910
But Hwang Tae-gyung.
You can't call this off. Ever.

165
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,847
Remember what I told you
when we started this.

166
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:17,483
The only one who can end this is me.

167
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,586
You agreed not to divulge anything
about Ko Mi-nam.

168
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:22,788
You broke the rules first.

169
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,092
Fine. I may have broken it first,

170
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:31,630
but if you want to keep my mouth shut,
you better keep up the act.

171
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:35,801
Hwang Tae-gyung,
keep pretending you're my lover.

172
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,471
Ko Mi-nam, keep pretending you're a guy.

173
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,608
You two keep pretending
you're a couple of angels.

174
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,114
Fine. You keep pretending
you're angelic, Fake Fairy.

175
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:50,816
Of course, I will.

176
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,757
Honey, I'll be going now.

177
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:02,127
Good night, everyone.

178
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:12,771
Tae-gyung. So you were
fake-dating Yoo He-i

179
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:15,908
to protect Ko Mi-nam?

180
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,677
Everything she just said
was actually the truth.

181
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,882
Tae-gyung, I--

182
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:27,453
All your apologies and gratitude,
I've heard them more than enough.

183
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,422
Tell them to Shin-woo and Jermy.

184
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,733
I didn't expect this either...

185
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:48,907
Please? Just one more time!

186
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,510
It will be just this one time,
Mr. Secretary!

187
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:56,682
I have to see Ms. Mo once more
and talk to her about the copyright thing!

188
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,385
-Just once!
-Fine. You may.

189
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,887
Oh, nice!

190
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,827
You'll be blessed, young man!

191
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:11,196
Ma'am?

192
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:16,235
Where could she be?

193
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:21,173
Oh, my! Look at all these bottles.
What a mess.

194
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:25,577
Wait, what is this?

195
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,748
My brother? And the twins!

196
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,318
She even has their picture.

197
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:36,021
Don't touch anything without permission.

198
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,891
I didn't touch anything.

199
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:42,694
Oh, I need to go pee.
Where's the bathroom?

200
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:46,532
Oh, this must be it.
I'm going to the bathroom so much lately.

201
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,568
Oh, I'm sorry! Excuse me!

202
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,972
Ms. Mo?

203
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:58,944
Ms. Mo?

204
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:05,884
Oh, my goodness gracious! Ms. Mo! Hwa-ran!

205
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:10,189
Hey! In here! Ms. Mo! Hwa-ran! Oh my!

206
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:20,866
"Yellow Pants" Ko Mi-ja has rescued
a nationally beloved singer. Yes, indeed!

207
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,502
Who knows what could've happened
if it wasn't for me?

208
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:27,239
Oh, man, that was a real...

209
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,641
-Here you go.
-Oh, thank you.

210
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,811
Thank you for finding and helping Ms. Mo.

211
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:35,180
Please don't tell anyone else
about this incident.

212
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:38,717
Oh, of course!

213
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:42,955
You know, I'm such a big fan of hers.

214
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,524
Hope you get better soon!

215
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:46,792
I'll be off now.

216
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:50,729
Oh, by the way.

217
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:56,768
I was wondering, has Ms. Mo
ever received surgery for everything?

218
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:59,571
She has not.
I'll have to ask you to leave now.

219
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:00,906
She hasn't?

220
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:04,109
Really?

221
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,621
Then what's the surgery scar
on her belly for?

222
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,592
Did she have a C-section?

223
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:26,565
Did she? But she's not even married!
Oh, my!

224
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,149
Not even actual brothers
and sisters share a room!

225
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:49,621
Ko Mi-nam! Even if you may be comfortable
with Tae-gyung and don't see him as a guy,

226
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:51,056
you can't stay here anymore!

227
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:56,995
I'll move all your stuff
back to your room.

228
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:18,750
Sorry for imposing on you
for so long, Tae-gyung.

229
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,457
By that, do you mean
that you will no longer impose on me?

230
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,762
How could I? I'm not that shameless.

231
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,365
I'll take everything back with me.

232
00:20:56,188 --> 00:21:01,260
Fine. So this doesn't even count as hers?

233
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,031
So cold-hearted! So disloyal! She just
throws it away after she's done with it!

234
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:15,207
She doesn't even know
that she has lost this.

235
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:20,545
I mean, it's in pieces.
She won't need this either.

236
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:24,616
Why did I even bring this back?

237
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:39,331
How could I bring Pig Rabbit with me?
I've even lost the hairpin...

238
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:49,741
Tae-gyung, you went through so much.
Thank you.

239
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:01,053
There's nothing for a party!

240
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,055
I'm pretty hungry.
Should we go out to eat?

241
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:08,960
Let's go to the market! I want to go
shopping with Ko Mi-nam, all chummy like!

242
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,796
Sure, let's take her grocery shopping.

243
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:15,233
Ko Mi-nam attracts accidents like
a magnet. You don't know what will happen.

244
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:17,769
Just leave her at home, that's safer.

245
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:21,606
Then you can stay home and be safe,
Tae-gyung. We'll take her with us.

246
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:24,643
Ko Mi-nam! Let's go to the market!

247
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,151
ALL-LOW PRICES!

248
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:34,353
Come this way.

249
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,456
I've never been to such a huge market
this late at night before.

250
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,157
Isn't it cool? There's no one here!

251
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:44,529
Vegetables!

252
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,265
Doesn't this look good?

253
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,370
Doesn't this one look tastier?
It's redder.

254
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:55,941
Maybe it is. But this one
smells really good too.

255
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,612
I'm not good at picking things out
by smell.

256
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:05,217
What else are you going to use
that pig nose for if you can't smell?

257
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:22,100
Ko Mi-nam. I'll make you a cup
of vegetable juice every morning too.

258
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,602
Let's have a glass together!

259
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:25,771
I'll blend it for you!

260
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:28,507
Really? I'd love that so much!

261
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:32,711
I'll blend these for you every morning.

262
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:36,047
I guess I'll get to see a rabbit blending
carrots every morning.

263
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:40,018
Ko Mi-nam! I like you so much!

264
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:46,191
What? What are you doing? Tae-gyung!

265
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:49,127
Jermy grew up in England so he
is used to being touchy and affectionate.

266
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:51,430
But you must never get used to it,
Ko Mi-nam.

267
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,365
-Yes, Tae-gyung.
-Tae-gyung!

268
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,303
Tae-gyung! Where are you?
Unzip this before you go!

269
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:03,208
Oh, this was our very first ad.

270
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:05,110
Do you remember this, guys?

271
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:06,912
Jermy, don't do it.

272
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,281
You'll ruin the fantasy. Don't do it.

273
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:11,850
Do you know how we shot this?

274
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:16,721
"Just one bite, and oh, my, it's so cold!"

275
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:22,127
And Tae-gyung wore icicles on his head
and Shin-woo was a snowman!

276
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:24,930
I want to see it too!

277
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:26,665
I'll show it to you when I get home.

278
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:30,001
Should we look for all the things
we shot ads for?

279
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:34,539
Let's go!

280
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,308
BIBIMYEON

281
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:41,780
Out of all the ads we shot,
this one was the best one.

282
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:45,050
Mix it, mix it, Bibimyeon

283
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:46,551
We didn't do it like that.

284
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:48,453
Wasn't it like this?

285
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:53,558
Jermy did it correctly.
We mixed it upwards and sideways.

286
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:54,726
Oh, that's right.

287
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:56,528
All right. We grabbed it like this and...

288
00:24:56,795 --> 00:25:00,599
-Mix it, mix it, Bibimyeon
-Mix it, mix it, Bibimyeon

289
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,802
Why are we doing this here anyway?

290
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:22,721
"Angel Chocolate, melting her lips away."

291
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:26,491
So greasy.

292
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:31,062
I'm melting away.

293
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,534
I'd take Bibimyeon over this.

294
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,238
Why? You were so cool!

295
00:25:59,024 --> 00:25:59,891
Ko Mi-nam!

296
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:01,626
-Strike!
-Ko Mi-nam!

297
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:04,930
-Catch!
-Mi-nam.

298
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,101
There you are.

299
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:12,304
And here we go!

300
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,175
Tae-gyung.

301
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:29,421
Ko Mi-nam. This beer is another
product we shot an ad for.

302
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:31,089
"Cheers!"

303
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:36,394
From ice cream bars to beer,
you really did a lot of ads!

304
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:40,065
If you think of all the ads we shot,
we really did get old, huh?

305
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:43,034
The kids who ate ice cream bars
became adults who drink beer.

306
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:46,504
But if another ice cream bar ad
comes in, I'll be great in it!

307
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:51,009
"It's so cold!"

308
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:58,249
Ko Mi-nam. Let's do it, the two of us.
Try it.

309
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,088
"It's so cold."

310
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:06,257
Ko Mi-nam! You're so cute!

311
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:08,360
Take me with you!

312
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:11,463
Cheers.

313
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,665
No sipping. In one.

314
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,107
They were just kids to me,

315
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:25,176
but they're all dating now,
without telling me...

316
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:30,615
They started as an idol boy group,
just kids, you know.

317
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,486
But they're all grown-ups now.

318
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:39,324
There aren't many idol groups
that have made it this far.

319
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:43,194
You can say that they've had a good run.

320
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:49,000
But! Mi-nam is here now,
they should go on and on, to success!

321
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,538
Right.

322
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:58,777
I just feel like they're hiding something
from me recently as well.

323
00:27:58,843 --> 00:27:59,711
Pardon?

324
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:09,421
They're all grown now
and they are keeping secrets from me...

325
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:16,928
I'm going to the bathroom.

326
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:28,907
Now, what?

327
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:32,911
Nothing to it.
We hold out for a bit longer

328
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:36,948
and the real Mi-nam will come,
they switch, happy endings for everyone.

329
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:43,421
Then what about her? She's just going
back to where she was before?

330
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:47,258
That's what I had initially planned...

331
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:53,498
But Mi-nyeo's situation has changed
drastically, so I'm not sure anymore.

332
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,568
What situation?

333
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:04,909
She has realized...

334
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:09,280
what love is.

335
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:14,552
Where's Shin-woo and Jermy?

336
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:16,121
They went to get more beer.

337
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:22,093
Ko Mi-nam. You're carrying
something on your head.

338
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:23,995
Looks good on you.

339
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:25,230
On my head?

340
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:30,135
Why is this here?

341
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:32,504
Carrots are 3,000 won.

342
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:37,242
My hairpin was 3,000 won too...

343
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,746
I told you, it was 100,000 won,
not 3,000 won!

344
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:49,988
Tae-gyung. I lost the hairpin.

345
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:52,957
Again?

346
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:55,627
At least, you're aware that you lost it.

347
00:29:56,327 --> 00:30:00,799
Did you see it? Where is it?

348
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:04,435
It was rolling on the floor in pieces
at the premiere venue.

349
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,406
It was? Oh no... What do I do?

350
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:12,076
What do you mean, what do you do?
It's useless now, just chuck it.

351
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:15,346
-I...
-Excuse me.

352
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,618
Are you okay? You almost fell.

353
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,520
Oh, thank you.

354
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:23,988
Be careful.

355
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:47,512
Tae-gyung! I brought more beer!

356
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:51,516
Let's go.

357
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:57,956
Let's go.

358
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,896
To me, it's the most precious thing.

359
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:14,739
I can't seem to sleep well
the past few days.

360
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,108
When did this start?

361
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,111
Was it since Ko Mi-nam left my room?

362
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,480
Maybe I'm not used to it yet?

363
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:30,154
Aunt Mi-ja? When did you get here?

364
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:33,391
I came back just now.

365
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:36,394
Everyone was sleeping
so I came back in quietly.

366
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:38,329
You surprised me.

367
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,064
Good night.

368
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:41,699
Mi-nam is sleeping well, right?

369
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,502
Ko Mi-nam is in your room now.

370
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,039
Mi-nam isn't in my room.

371
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,009
Wasn't he sleeping in your room?

372
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:55,179
I had so much soju, I'm so thirsty now.

373
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,919
-What the heck is this?
-Where has she gone this late at night?

374
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:14,866
Thank you so much.

375
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,168
It's something very important to me,
so I have to find it.

376
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:20,305
Just look for it quickly and leave.
Don't mention me if someone finds out.

377
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:24,375
Yes, sir. Thank you!
I'll leave as soon as I find it.

378
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,760
I can't find her anywhere.
Where did she go?

379
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:46,130
Wait. No way.

380
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:51,436
No. There's no way she would've
gone there to look for that.

381
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:55,406
Where could she have gone?
What did she say before?

382
00:32:57,108 --> 00:33:00,044
What do you mean, what do you do?
It's useless now, just chuck it.

383
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:03,381
-I...
-Excuse me.

384
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:06,784
Are you okay?

385
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:16,327
I didn't get to hear the rest.

386
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,731
What could she have been trying to say?

387
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:25,770
What do you mean, what do you do?
It's useless now, just chuck it.

388
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:27,105
I...

389
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:29,974
Agree with you, Tae-gyung.

390
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,710
If it's useless,
you might as well throw it away.

391
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:34,379
It's only worth 3,000 won anyway!

392
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,819
There's no way Ko Mi-nam
can talk to me like that.

393
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,855
So that can't be it.

394
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:46,224
Then...

395
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:50,361
What do you mean, what do you do?
It's useless now, just chuck it.

396
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:51,529
I...

397
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:56,000
Couldn't find a chance to throw it away,
so thank goodness I lost it!

398
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,838
It would've been embarrassing to wear that
anywhere. It's worth 3,000 won anyway.

399
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,175
No, she didn't hate it that much.

400
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:07,378
She was so happy
when she got it back from Fake Fairy.

401
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:10,381
Then... Did she?

402
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:14,318
What do you mean, what do you do?
It's useless now, just chuck it.

403
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,720
I...

404
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,289
Can't throw it away like that.

405
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:22,026
That hairpin you gave me
is really precious to me.

406
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:24,228
I will find it. I have to.

407
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:27,799
If that's what she meant to say,

408
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,602
if she's over there looking for it now...

409
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:33,838
Why would she do that?

410
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:52,290
Is it okay... If I like you?

411
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:56,961
No. She likes Shin-woo...

412
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:01,666
There's no way she would've gone
at this hour to look for that.

413
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,386
Where could it be? He said
they didn't clean the place yet.

414
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:28,059
Oh, maybe someone picked it up?

415
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:40,438
There's no way. She's not here.

416
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:43,241
I'm just here to confirm the fact
that she is not here,

417
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,742
since I can't sleep anyway.

418
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:55,353
Why can't I find it?

419
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:06,364
Maybe it's under here.

420
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:31,022
Why am I all nervous over
something like Ko Mi-nam?

421
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,897
The lights are on.

422
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:03,254
The security guard said I couldn't
get caught by anyone.

423
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:14,065
What was I thinking?

424
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:07,318
INCOMING CALL

425
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,735
It's very late. Why are you calling?

426
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:28,406
Ms. Mo is very ill.
She has been looking for you.

427
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:58,235
Oh, I found it!
Why didn't I see this before?

428
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:00,638
Thank goodness.

429
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:14,385
I don't think I could live much longer.

430
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:18,089
I mean...

431
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:24,395
What's the point in living any longer?
There's nothing to look forward to.

432
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:29,967
Is that why you need something
to look back fondly upon?

433
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:32,770
If I say yes,

434
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:36,474
will you give me such a memory

435
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,044
so I could endure my boredom
and live a long life?

436
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:46,350
If I say no, you'll call me
for something like this again.

437
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,020
I'm going to grow more ill.

438
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:54,158
When I call you,

439
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:57,495
won't you come?

440
00:39:57,962 --> 00:40:02,400
In order to prevent that,
I suppose I have to do it.

441
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:07,037
I'll make you that song.

442
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,010
I knew you would.

443
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:16,280
Because you're my son.

444
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:19,083
No mother

445
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:21,952
makes their son do something like this.

446
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,989
When that song is released,
I'll tell you everything.

447
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:29,493
What my love was like...

448
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:33,431
How big my love was...

449
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,029
I have to glue this on correctly.

450
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:08,065
I bet Tae-gyung is good
at stuff like this.

451
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:13,838
No. If Tae-gyung finds out that
I brought this back, he'll be suspicious!

452
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:17,508
He might find out my feelings for him.

453
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:22,780
Did it stick?

454
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:29,453
Oh no! Not you two!
You can't stick together!

455
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:41,999
Tae-gyung.

456
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:43,634
What are you doing?

457
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:46,136
Did you go somewhere?

458
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:50,207
I should ask you the same thing.
Where were you?

459
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,778
I was home. Why?

460
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:57,848
You were at home? Where?

461
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:01,252
Just, you know, here and there.

462
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:04,855
Anyway, I was home. I didn't go anywhere!

463
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:08,859
Yeah? I thought...

464
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:11,795
What are you doing?

465
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:17,167
Oh, something I consider precious broke
so I was gluing it back together.

466
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,302
Like what?

467
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:26,343
Oh, a cup! It's really precious to me
and it broke so I was gluing it back

468
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,681
but my fingers got stuck.

469
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:39,790
Don't worry about me!
You should go to sleep!

470
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:52,036
Did you soak it thoroughly?

471
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:53,871
Yes.

472
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:05,783
That tickles!

473
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:16,293
It's so cool, how it stuck together
like that! How could it stick like that?

474
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,496
Whose fingers are these?

475
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:22,566
Sorry.

476
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:26,570
It tickles!

477
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:31,342
I wonder why the adhesive
got on your fingers?

478
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:34,311
If it got on your mouth,
you wouldn't have been able to talk.

479
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:39,083
I'm sorry.

480
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:49,293
Tae-gyung. I got into trouble again,
didn't I?

481
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:53,998
This time is fine.

482
00:43:54,832 --> 00:44:00,537
Thanks to these ridiculous fingers,
I got to concentrate and clear my mind.

483
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:05,109
Did something bad happen?

484
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:10,581
There's a person who is making me
do something unreasonable.

485
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:14,118
But I ended up agreeing to do it.

486
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:20,924
Because of you, because I had you,

487
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:23,527
I lost that precious thing.

488
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:28,666
I lost him because of you.

489
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:32,002
Let me at least remember him.

490
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:35,239
Help me.

491
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:44,081
Strangely enough, every time my mind
was cluttered because of that person,

492
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:48,285
you were always there somehow.
It helped a lot. You were quite useful.

493
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:51,021
Like today.

494
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,834
I'm glad to hear that my fingers
were useful!

495
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:07,337
If I had known, I should've just glued
all ten of them together!

496
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:21,051
All done!

497
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,059
Why do you do that all the time?

498
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:31,862
It's good for your health!

499
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,599
Do you have some kind of a secret?

500
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:38,669
I don't!

501
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:42,473
Fine then.

502
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:46,677
I feel sleepy now,
after all this chatting.

503
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:48,846
I'm going to bed.

504
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:10,367
The secret is my heart.

505
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:29,653
First Tae-gyung, now Shin-woo!
They're both dating now!

506
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:34,291
But we are true fans,
we have to congratulate Shin-woo too!

507
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:37,928
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

508
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:42,699
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

509
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:47,805
Shin-woo, I'm really sorry. You got
involved in this mess because of me.

510
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:52,576
Seriously though. Everyone has been
nagging me to tell them who she is.

511
00:46:54,344 --> 00:46:55,746
It has to be hard. I know.

512
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,117
Moreover, the girl I like is going
through a hard time because of it.

513
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:03,987
I'm really sorry to her too.

514
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:07,524
Hasn't Shin-woo been acting the same way
even after he found out about her?

515
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:09,026
How would I know?

516
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:09,960
Whoa, whoa. Hold on!

517
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:17,634
What are you doing?
Why are you eavesdropping?

518
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:19,002
It's just for a bit.

519
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:30,280
You already have someone you like
but because of me... I'm sorry.

520
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:34,918
I should go to her now, even if it's late
and explain everything. Right?

521
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:36,620
Yes, you should!

522
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:42,826
Mi-nam. If it's needed, can you go
and explain it to her?

523
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:48,866
Yes, of course I will! It's all my fault.
As many times as you need me to!

524
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,069
Then I should set up a time
to explain everything.

525
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:54,338
You have to come with me, okay?

526
00:47:54,404 --> 00:47:56,106
Yes! I will!

527
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:10,420
Tae-gyung.

528
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:13,156
I feel so bad for Mi-nam.

529
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:18,795
She has to go to the girl that the guy
she has a crush on likes

530
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:25,102
and say, "I'm nothing.
Kang Shin-woo likes you, not me."

531
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:27,838
She has to go and say that!

532
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:32,809
Like she'd go.

533
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:36,413
She just agreed to appease him.
She'll get out of it somehow.

534
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:41,018
She's a woman too, she has pride.
She wouldn't do such a thing.

535
00:48:41,184 --> 00:48:44,655
Right? She wouldn't go there, right?

536
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:50,560
She likes him so much.
If she did end up going there,

537
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:54,932
her heart will be ripped
into a thousand pieces.

538
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,773
Mi-nam.

539
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:10,580
I don't think I can stay with you
for the time being.

540
00:49:11,014 --> 00:49:13,116
I have some business to tend to,

541
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:15,852
but if you're with me,
it's a bit difficult.

542
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:19,389
Is that so? Then good thing
everything has worked out.

543
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,758
Have a restful stay
at your friend's house, Aunt Mi-ja.

544
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:23,894
Yes, sure. I'll be off now.

545
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:31,001
Mi-nam. Have you ever seen the singer
Mo Hwa-ran by any chance?

546
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:33,503
Ms. Mo?

547
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:36,873
I have. Why?

548
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:39,843
When? When you were young? With Mi-nyeo?

549
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:42,813
No, at the broadcasting company.

550
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:46,350
Right. Of course. That's what I thought.

551
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:50,620
She has visited your agency
before too, right?

552
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:56,626
Then I shouldn't stay here with you.

553
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,096
All right, Mi-nam. I'll be going!

554
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:01,098
Yes. Stay healthy, Aunt Mi-ja!

555
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:03,533
I will. You stay safe
and healthy too, okay?

556
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:10,574
I have to take care of the copyright issue
before Mi-nam finds out.

557
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:15,312
It would be so great if the kid
Mo Hwa-ran had secretly

558
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,315
was my Mi-nam!

559
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,084
I'd get hit by a flood of money!

560
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:26,089
PERSONAL DETAILS REPORT

561
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:28,892
The older brother, Mi-nam,
is currently in the States

562
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:30,394
but we haven't found him yet.

563
00:50:30,794 --> 00:50:35,565
The younger sister, Mi-nyeo,
was at a convent which she left recently.

564
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:39,669
One is in the States
and one was at a convent?

565
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:46,043
Look for the girl first.

566
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:01,324
No, that's not it.

567
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:14,671
Doesn't she care about her heart
ripping into a thousand pieces?

568
00:51:19,943 --> 00:51:23,880
Ko Mi-nam! Let's go for a walk
with Jolie when we get home.

569
00:51:23,947 --> 00:51:25,782
I'll show you a water spring,
it's a hidden treasure!

570
00:51:26,883 --> 00:51:27,884
Sure!

571
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:31,121
The weather is great, should we play
some badminton? Loser buys beer.

572
00:51:32,155 --> 00:51:33,323
You're coming too?

573
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:35,292
Mi-nam. Do you not want me to go?

574
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:37,160
No, I want you to come.

575
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:42,199
"I want you to come." She's just digging
her own grave over there.

576
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:49,673
Ko Mi-nam. Don't think of playing
before you get all the songs down pat.

577
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,043
Don't leave my side
and memorize them all by today.

578
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:57,948
I've already got most of them memorized.
I don't have to stay by you all the time.

579
00:51:59,249 --> 00:52:02,119
I was trying to help you,
but you'd refuse?

580
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:06,957
Yes. I refuse.
I'm going to play badminton.

581
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:11,128
Yes! Ko Mi-nam! Let's go together!

582
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:15,098
What about you, Tae-gyung?

583
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,477
It really is quiet up here.

584
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:31,882
Only grandmas and grandpas come here,
so they won't pay attention to us at all.

585
00:52:32,516 --> 00:52:34,050
There's no wind either.

586
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:36,386
Right?

587
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:40,557
Smash!

588
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:42,626
Let's split the teams.

589
00:52:42,692 --> 00:52:45,962
I'll be on Mi-nam's team.
Is that okay, Mi-nam?

590
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:48,965
I'm no good at this, is that okay?

591
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:50,133
It's fine.

592
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:52,135
Then I'm okay with it too.

593
00:52:53,803 --> 00:52:54,804
Smash!

594
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:59,376
Later, it will be ripped into
a thousand pieces. So is it okay now?

595
00:52:59,876 --> 00:53:01,678
Stupid Pig Rabbit.

596
00:53:03,046 --> 00:53:04,948
One, two, three!

597
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:08,952
Ko Mi-nam? Step aside.
Shin-woo, you're on my team.

598
00:53:10,287 --> 00:53:12,522
But that's too big of a gap
between the two teams' skills.

599
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:17,761
Then it's me and Mi-nam
and Shin-woo and Tae-gyung?

600
00:53:19,629 --> 00:53:20,664
I'm fine with that.

601
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:23,767
If I'm on the same team as Mi-nam,
I'm for it.

602
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:27,971
Let's end this quickly.

603
00:53:48,124 --> 00:53:49,025
Oh, my...

604
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:57,167
Hey!

605
00:53:57,968 --> 00:54:01,938
Tae-gyung! It's just for fun!
What is this, the Olympics?

606
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,307
The game is almost over.

607
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:12,048
Mi-nam, try hitting this, okay?

608
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:28,898
See? Look how good Ko Mi-nam is
when you give it to her nicely!

609
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:58,194
You couldn't hit any of the ones
I sent over?

610
00:54:58,595 --> 00:55:02,265
How are you even bad at that?
You're not good at anything.

611
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:04,100
The game is over, so let's go.

612
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:08,004
I'm good at other things! I'm good too!

613
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:30,226
Ko Mi-nam, you're amazing!

614
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,929
I think you'll get first place!

615
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:37,867
I may not be good at a lot of things,
but I have great endurance!

616
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:41,738
Where I grew up, I beat all the boys
and went first place in this!

617
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:44,974
I get that you're amazing,
so you can come down now.

618
00:55:46,242 --> 00:55:48,411
I can keep going until I drop.

619
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:55,251
Does she want to appeal to him with that?
I'm tearing up, Pig Rabbit.

620
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:59,789
You're so good! So great. There.
Good enough? Now, come down.

621
00:56:00,724 --> 00:56:04,160
I told you I can keep going,
so why are you butting in?

622
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:07,297
I'll show you that I can endure it
until the end!

623
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:11,835
Ko Mi-nam won't even come down
when Tae-gyung tells her to?

624
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:14,838
Should I try?

625
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:20,243
"It's so cold!"

626
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:23,146
Mix it, mix it, Bibimyeon

627
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:27,283
"I melt, on her lips."

628
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:34,324
I won't fall. I can keep going.

629
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:37,127
I will show you
that there is something I'm good at.

630
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:41,097
Tae-gyung's words have no effect,
Jermy's laughs won't do anything.

631
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,866
Should I give it a go, then?

632
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,802
Whatever you do, Shin-woo, I...

633
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:01,751
Shin-woo! That's cheating!

634
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:02,986
There were no rules against it.

635
00:57:03,486 --> 00:57:05,522
Mi-nam, you lost to me.

636
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:16,266
Shin-woo, you really surprised me.
Don't pull jokes like that.

637
00:57:17,133 --> 00:57:19,903
It wasn't a joke. We bet, remember?

638
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:22,071
I'm really competitive, you see.

639
00:57:22,906 --> 00:57:25,108
Shin-woo! Don't scare Ko Mi-nam!

640
00:57:25,675 --> 00:57:26,843
Ko Mi-nam.

641
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:29,946
You take Jolie with you.

642
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:34,651
Let's go.

643
00:57:38,855 --> 00:57:40,557
Was that too surprising for her?

644
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:42,959
I have so many more surprises
in store for her.

645
00:57:48,932 --> 00:57:50,967
That scared me.

646
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:56,272
Wait. Why do I have to be scared
because of Ko Mi-nam?

647
00:58:04,581 --> 00:58:08,384
I'm honestly stressing myself out
over Mi-nam.

648
00:58:08,451 --> 00:58:09,552
Why?

649
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:13,857
If you get down to it, Mi-nam is a girl.
But she's with Tae-gyung.

650
00:58:14,858 --> 00:58:16,526
Why are you worried about that?

651
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,729
Do you think Tae-gyung would even
look at her when he has you?

652
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:22,265
Don't be silly.

653
00:58:22,632 --> 00:58:27,504
To others, I may look like a shining star,
beloved by many,

654
00:58:29,405 --> 00:58:31,307
but I'm just like any other girl.

655
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:38,114
I get jealous and I worry
over all the little things.

656
00:58:40,483 --> 00:58:41,851
You're so delicate, He-i.

657
00:58:44,053 --> 00:58:45,855
It'll be over soon.

658
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:50,760
Even if Mi-nam goes back to being a girl,
she may not leave.

659
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:56,199
She loves it here,
and everyone is so good to her.

660
00:58:57,867 --> 00:59:00,937
Why would she want to go back
to where she's from?

661
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:04,874
He-i.

662
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:08,811
He told me not to tell anyone this, but...

663
00:59:10,346 --> 00:59:12,248
Even Tae-gyung doesn't know.

664
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:14,317
What is it?

665
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:18,121
I'm only telling you because you
seem to be worrying way too much.

666
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:21,991
Mi-nam used to be at a convent.

667
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:27,130
She grew up at an orphanage
that was run by the convent

668
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:30,333
and naturally wanted to become a nun.

669
00:59:31,968 --> 00:59:36,706
But she gave up everything
for her brother and she came here.

670
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:40,443
Then will she return to the convent?

671
00:59:42,278 --> 00:59:45,515
I think that's the only place she has.

672
00:59:47,116 --> 00:59:48,618
I'm sure she'll return there...

673
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,155
But don't let anyone know, okay?

674
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:53,690
Of course.

675
00:59:54,524 --> 00:59:59,729
But if Tae-gyung and the others find out,
they'll be so shocked.

676
01:00:20,683 --> 01:00:22,986
Why do I have to worry so much
about Ko Mi-nam?

677
01:00:28,691 --> 01:00:29,626
It's Ko Mi-nam.

678
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:37,767
Jermy told me to bring this to you.
It's lime juice, your favorite.

679
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:40,236
Lime?

680
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:44,073
It's all your fault that I have to drink
this sour thing.

681
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:50,213
What? Why is this my fault?
That's a bit unfair, Tae-gyung.

682
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:55,918
Ko Mi-nam. Didn't you used to hold it in
and move on even if it was unfair?

683
01:00:57,453 --> 01:01:02,859
I'm sorry. I'm holding it in.
I'll continue to hold it in well.

684
01:01:04,394 --> 01:01:06,095
Then why didn't you hold it in back there?

685
01:01:06,596 --> 01:01:09,032
With Shin-woo. You fell immediately.

686
01:01:09,432 --> 01:01:12,335
I was caught by surprise, that's all!

687
01:01:12,402 --> 01:01:14,937
Yes. It was so obvious.

688
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:16,639
Do you think that was it?

689
01:01:16,706 --> 01:01:18,975
You wanting to be with him,
wanting to appeal to him,

690
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:20,543
your feelings are so obvious!

691
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:24,313
Tae-gyung! I told you that wasn't it.

692
01:01:24,614 --> 01:01:26,182
You won't hold out for long.

693
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:30,086
Soon enough, Shin-woo will find out
and he has to apologize to you.

694
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:34,657
That all counts as being a nuisance
and causing trouble to the other party!

695
01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:38,494
Is it that bad to like someone?

696
01:01:39,062 --> 01:01:43,700
I don't want anything, I'm doing my best
to hide it. I can't even do that?

697
01:01:43,766 --> 01:01:48,304
Like you have time for that right now?
If I were Shin-woo, I wouldn't like it!

698
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:03,352
Hey. Are you crying?

699
01:02:06,155 --> 01:02:09,826
No! I can hold it in. I won't get caught!

700
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:15,965
I mean, it's a bit annoying,
but do you want me to help?

701
01:02:16,265 --> 01:02:19,635
No. Don't help.
Don't meddle if it's so annoying to you.

702
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:22,972
Just act as if you don't know anything,
as you have been doing so far!

703
01:02:26,275 --> 01:02:30,913
Fine! Let's see how long
you can hold it in, Ko Mi-nam!

704
01:02:40,823 --> 01:02:45,461
Reverend Mother. My feelings,
my heart is nothing but a nuisance.

705
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:50,800
When I leave this place,
after holding on as long as I can...

706
01:02:55,404 --> 01:02:59,909
I'll leave my star behind, safe and sound.

707
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:22,298
Please make sure no outsiders
come in after this time.

708
01:03:23,866 --> 01:03:25,668
And please prepare everything
just as I asked.

709
01:03:25,735 --> 01:03:28,137
Yes. We'll ensure your privacy.

710
01:03:41,617 --> 01:03:46,656
When you stand here today,
you'll get to see the woman I love.

711
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:49,826
I hope you won't be too surprised.

712
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:55,598
You're going where?

713
01:03:55,898 --> 01:03:57,867
I promised to meet up with Shin-woo.

714
01:03:57,934 --> 01:04:01,671
There's someone I have to meet
and explain on behalf of Shin-woo.

715
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:04,006
Sister.

716
01:04:06,075 --> 01:04:07,643
Do you have to go?

717
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:13,616
I should. If that's the only thing
I can do for him, I need to do it.

718
01:04:23,626 --> 01:04:24,927
How can I stop her...

719
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:27,864
I'm the one who caused all this.

720
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:33,169
How can I stop her love?

721
01:04:34,403 --> 01:04:36,138
I'm the biggest sinner!

722
01:04:37,773 --> 01:04:39,742
I'm the sinner! I'm the one to blame!

723
01:04:46,849 --> 01:04:49,452
Tae-gyung, we're in big trouble.

724
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:53,956
I'm busy. If it concerns Ko Mi-nam,
don't even bring it up.

725
01:04:54,023 --> 01:04:57,727
No, it's an emergency.
I can't just stand by and watch.

726
01:04:58,361 --> 01:05:03,666
Ko Mi-nam told me not to meddle
if it's so annoying. And I don't plan to.

727
01:05:04,667 --> 01:05:06,035
Mi-nam went to Shin-woo.

728
01:05:08,504 --> 01:05:11,574
All that denial, for what?
Did she go to confess or something?

729
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:13,009
She went to confess.

730
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:14,610
What?

731
01:05:15,344 --> 01:05:17,780
Shin-woo asked her to come and explain
everything to his girlfriend.

732
01:05:18,814 --> 01:05:21,550
And Ko Mi-nam just went?

733
01:05:21,617 --> 01:05:26,756
Yes! She said she had to do everything
in her power

734
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:29,525
and she just left!

735
01:05:31,294 --> 01:05:32,628
What an idiot!

736
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:41,437
Yes. I'm on my way.
I'll be right there, Shin-woo.

737
01:05:41,704 --> 01:05:43,873
Sure, hurry. I'll be waiting.

738
01:05:57,586 --> 01:05:58,454
Tae-gyung.

739
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:02,191
I...

740
01:06:02,591 --> 01:06:06,262
I have to go! Tae-gyung,
please let go of me!

741
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:12,134
Tae-gyung, I have to go!
Why are you meddling?

742
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:17,606
Tae-gyung, why are you doing this?
Tae-gyung!

743
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:27,550
Tae-gyung! I have to go!

744
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:36,892
I'll be going now.

745
01:06:38,461 --> 01:06:39,829
Do you even know where you're going?

746
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:45,501
You. I knew you were clumsy and out of it,
accident prone, unable to do things right,

747
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:48,170
and always causing trouble
and being a nuisance to others,

748
01:06:48,437 --> 01:06:49,805
but have you no pride either?

749
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:56,078
When I look at you, you're so foolish,
and it annoys me so much!

750
01:06:56,912 --> 01:06:59,715
So don't pay attention to me!

751
01:06:59,782 --> 01:07:01,884
How can I, when you go around like this!

752
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:05,321
Why does it matter to you,
where I'm going right now?

753
01:07:05,388 --> 01:07:08,457
It doesn't cause you any trouble, so why
are you meddling and being annoyed?

754
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:10,793
Because you're like an idiot
and it makes me mad!

755
01:07:10,993 --> 01:07:13,029
Why do I have to be so mad because of you?

756
01:07:13,095 --> 01:07:17,266
Why are you angry because of me?
Just ignore me, you're good at that!

757
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,235
Just don't look at whatever I'm doing!

758
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:20,302
You keep making me look!

759
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:22,171
You can't even see anything correctly!

760
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:25,374
You're so full of yourself,
you shine so brightly by yourself

761
01:07:25,574 --> 01:07:27,943
that you can't even see anything
around you!

762
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:32,181
You can't see anything, you don't know
anything, so why are you doing this?

763
01:07:33,282 --> 01:07:35,618
I'm doing my best to hold it in
so why are you getting mad at me!

764
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:38,387
Just leave me in the dark!

765
01:07:38,587 --> 01:07:40,389
Who asked you to look at me?

766
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:10,086
