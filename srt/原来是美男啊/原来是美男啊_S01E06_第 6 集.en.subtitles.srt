1
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:54,454
Mi-nam, are you up?

2
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:56,990
Mi-nam.

3
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:34,227
What could've happened?

4
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:36,963
No.

5
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,767
No. Hwang Tae-gyung?

6
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:45,538
Did his eyes become like this?

7
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:54,614
Being here with you,
I now see you are indeed a woman.

8
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:58,017
Oh, my goodness. What are you doing?

9
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:02,255
You're cuter when you're like this.
When you're being all fussy.

10
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,491
You beast!

11
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:05,692
Go away!

12
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,501
No, no. That doesn't sound right.

13
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,169
If she tazed him,

14
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:19,939
she should've ran away,
not fall asleep next to him.

15
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:24,644
Then was it Mi-nyeo?

16
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:29,482
Did her eyes become

17
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,417
like this?

18
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:38,691
Being here with you,
I now see you are indeed a man.

19
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:40,360
What?

20
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:42,495
Why are you doing this?

21
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:45,865
You're cuter when you're like this.
When you're being all fussy.

22
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:49,936
You! You wench!

23
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,075
I wanted to lay here with you!

24
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:03,016
It feels like a dream!

25
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:10,790
Hey!

26
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:14,127
Who did you taze?

27
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,830
Answer me! Say something! Who did you...

28
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:34,380
What's taking you so long?

29
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:36,916
Oh, my,

30
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,686
sweetie, you're up!

31
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,888
Let's go and have some breakfast!

32
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:45,959
Oh, my. The leader is still in bed?

33
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:47,026
Here we go.

34
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:54,767
Leader?

35
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,537
Get up!

36
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:03,009
Mi-nam, sweetheart. Let's go, dear.

37
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,812
I made some delicious stew.

38
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:08,314
The kids are going crazy over it!

39
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:12,118
Leader, hurry up and come down!

40
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,555
What the hell?

41
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:18,057
What the heck was that?

42
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:26,399
Now, dig in.

43
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,034
Oh, my.

44
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,970
You really like the whelks? Oh, chew it!

45
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:34,007
Here, water. There you go.

46
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:36,943
Shin-woo, you even eat like a gentleman,
my goodness.

47
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,779
Mi-nam! Aren't you hungry?

48
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:42,448
Why aren't you eating?

49
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,017
Hoon-i.

50
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,953
Stop stuffing your face,

51
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,522
the kids don't have enough to eat!

52
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:53,059
Oh, leader dear, come have a seat!

53
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,694
I don't eat breakfast.

54
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:56,362
Is that so?

55
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,699
Then you can have his rice, Hoon-i.

56
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,168
Eat up. You need strength
to take care of them!

57
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,569
Ma'am.

58
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:04,937
Yeah?

59
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:06,706
While you're staying with us,

60
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:09,842
there are a few rules that you must keep.
So listen carefully.

61
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,278
First, don't touch me without--

62
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,213
Yes. My goodness.

63
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:19,352
Enough with the silly rules.
I'm an adult, after all.

64
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:24,557
Oh, I need to pee. Where's the bathroom?

65
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:25,558
Got to go.

66
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:27,527
Got to go.

67
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,519
Did you see that?

68
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,855
She just grabbed
Tae-gyung's butt like this!

69
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,525
His aunt is amazing.

70
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:01,594
Seems like Hwang Tae-gyung
has met his match.

71
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:13,840
So you accidentally tazed yourself?
That's what happened?

72
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:15,241
Yes.

73
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:17,744
Silly me!

74
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,213
Anyway, how are you feeling?

75
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,083
I'm a bit drained
and I still feel the shocks.

76
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,253
There must still be some residue.

77
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,657
Oh, how long will this last?

78
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:36,596
After a few trips to the bathroom,
it should be out of your system.

79
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:39,799
Drink a lot of water. Keep drinking water.

80
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,738
Got to drink lots of water.

81
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:53,112
Maybe it's because of the electricity.
Even the water tastes better.

82
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,215
Did you sleep well?

83
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,285
I got knocked out.

84
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:01,487
That well?

85
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,291
You shared a room with Tae-gyung

86
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:06,926
and nothing happened?

87
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:10,129
I made a small mistake

88
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,964
but I took care of it without him knowing.

89
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,967
Besides that, it was all good.

90
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,702
"All good."

91
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,839
You really don't think of him that way.

92
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,874
Should I be relieved?

93
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:25,711
What about you, are you all right?
Yesterday--

94
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,313
Because she bailed on me?

95
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:30,283
Were you worried about me?

96
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:35,188
You looked so down and upset,
so I felt really bad.

97
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:36,989
I'm fine now.

98
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:39,292
She was with another guy,

99
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:40,793
so I wasn't myself.

100
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,897
But it seems like she doesn't regard him
in that way either.

101
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:46,666
So it's all good.

102
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,403
There's no way she won't like
someone as wonderful as you.

103
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,605
Okay. I'll trust you.

104
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,708
Don't ever forget what you just said.

105
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,109
No backsies.

106
00:07:58,277 --> 00:07:59,278
Promise.

107
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:03,516
Wait, there still might be residue...

108
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:11,390
It feels fine.

109
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:13,926
I don't feel anything.

110
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,328
Feel what?

111
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,662
Oh, I was feeling a bit off

112
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:20,867
but I drank a lot of water.
I feel better now.

113
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,101
Is that so?

114
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,904
Then do you want another cup of tea?

115
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,506
Sure.

116
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:29,542
Oh, I have some cookies
in my room, I'll get them.

117
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,019
I guess
you really are close with Shin-woo.

118
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:44,624
Then you should've shared a room with him.
Why come crawling into my room?

119
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,026
But Shin-woo is a man.

120
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,529
Oh, well,

121
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,731
you're a man too.

122
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,134
Right.

123
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,736
And so is Ko Mi-nam.

124
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,239
So we're just two guys,
who had a good night of sleep.

125
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,608
That's right.

126
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,278
I need to go grab the cookies
to eat with Shin-woo...

127
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,652
"You're a man too."

128
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:15,888
Now that I think about it,

129
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,357
I really did sleep well.

130
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:19,859
I didn't wake up once.

131
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:24,497
Oh, right. I walked a lot yesterday.

132
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,465
I must've been exhausted.

133
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:33,005
Oh, my, Mi-nam!

134
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:36,375
I bought these for you
so you can eat them by yourself!

135
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,511
-Sorry.
-Dear me, here.

136
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,414
-You spilled so many. Pick them up.
-I found a toe nail in my food.

137
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:44,584
Never will I ever be a part
of that scenery.

138
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,552
Oh, I see it.

139
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:48,020
Is that Yoo He-i?

140
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,724
-So pretty.
-She's so beautiful!

141
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,161
-Oh, wow.
-Oh, my goodness!

142
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,730
She's so pretty!

143
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,600
-Oh, wow.
-Oh, my gosh!

144
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,838
Her body is perfect, head to toe.

145
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:06,939
Amazing.

146
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:08,207
So pretty!

147
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:09,442
He-i.

148
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,010
-I'm a fan.
-I'm a fan.

149
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:13,546
What's your secret?

150
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,115
It's impossible for you.

151
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:17,850
You have to be born with it.

152
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:29,428
They're tickets for the VIP premiere
of my upcoming movie.

153
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,532
You came by yourself to give me these?

154
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:37,103
She wanted to come
and ask you in person to make sure

155
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:40,072
our artists would be able to attend.

156
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,609
I'm actually rather shy and introverted

157
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,544
so I don't have a lot
of celebrity friends.

158
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:50,349
I mean, you came in person and asked
so nicely. Of course, we'll help!

159
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:53,452
I love seeing these kind of sides
to celebrities,

160
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,123
making it clear it's not beneath them
to go in person to promote their projects.

161
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,992
You're a true professional.

162
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,728
Thank you, I'm flattered.

163
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,140
Oh, this is where Tae-gyung's studio
and practice rooms are.

164
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:18,044
Want to take a peek while you're here?
He should be there.

165
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,212
-Can I?
-Let's go!

166
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,583
Is he that wonderful?

167
00:11:58,651 --> 00:11:59,852
You know.

168
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,956
I know I should be unaware of it,

169
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:05,891
so I'll leave now.

170
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:34,620
Hey.

171
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,955
Open the door.

172
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:39,959
Hwang Tae-gyung! Open the door!

173
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:55,441
Open the door right now!

174
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:00,146
"Open the door"?

175
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,615
I won't.

176
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,828
I'm here to find that girl of yours.

177
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,300
Good luck. You won't be able to.

178
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,939
So that's how you're going to play?

179
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,583
I'll keel you!

180
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,707
KEEL

181
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,189
KILL

182
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,462
Be quiet

183
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:25,397
and go away.

184
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,670
You. Open the door.

185
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:33,939
Open the door. Come out.

186
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,475
Come out! Are you going
to stay there forever?

187
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,745
I can't even... I can't believe this!

188
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,480
You come out here! Hey!

189
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,106
Why is she here?
What info is she trying to glean?

190
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,977
Mi-nam.

191
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,113
I really wanted to meet you.

192
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:15,648
I'm a big fan of yours.

193
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:19,218
-You're so lucky!
-So lucky!

194
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:20,286
Thank you.

195
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:23,055
Can I get a picture with you?

196
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:25,691
Sure.

197
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:28,260
Can you take the picture?

198
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:29,361
Of course.

199
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,636
You don't look like a guy, Mi-nam.

200
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:41,240
-Pardon?
-You don't look like a guy.

201
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,077
What are you saying?

202
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,146
Why are you so surprised?

203
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:50,482
I was just sad that you didn't even smile

204
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,217
when I linked arms with you.

205
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,621
I'm sorry.

206
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:59,825
Now, smile.

207
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,198
It's done. We made it.

208
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,368
I mean, if Korea's Fairy Yoo He-i

209
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:13,005
says she's a fan of yours, it's safe
to say that every girl has fallen for you.

210
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:17,242
I didn't know
I was such an attractive guy.

211
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:18,777
Hold on.

212
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,447
Hwang Tae-gyung likes Yoo He-i,

213
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:23,515
but Yoo He-i likes Ko Mi-nam.

214
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:27,586
Which means Ko Mi-nam won over
Hwang Tae-gyung. This is great!

215
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:32,157
Tae-gyung likes her?

216
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,595
It's top secret,

217
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,664
but Mr. An said that

218
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:42,434
Hwang Tae-gyung and Yoo He-i
had something going on.

219
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,504
I mean, he's a man,
why wouldn't he like Yoo He-i?

220
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,674
I'm not that interested, though.

221
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:51,577
Aren't you going to practice?

222
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:56,682
Right, Tae-gyung was a man too.

223
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:57,916
Miss He-i...

224
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:01,920
Yes.

225
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:06,125
I hope your movie does very well!

226
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:07,393
Oh, yes. Here.

227
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,331
So pretty.

228
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,935
So Tae-gyung likes pretty women like that.

229
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,978
It's doing it again.

230
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,182
Right. I should drink more water.

231
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:34,053
If you could sign one for me too...

232
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,888
-I'm such a huge fan.
-Me too.

233
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,122
Should I go down more?

234
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:38,690
Can I

235
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,259
get a picture with you?

236
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:41,527
-I...
-Quickly, come on!

237
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:43,595
I'm running a bit late,
so if you'll excuse me.

238
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,631
It'll only be a second...

239
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:48,100
I still got her autograph. I got it.

240
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:50,469
Oh, I'm getting a heart attack.

241
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,387
She's so out of it.

242
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:12,658
How is she managing to pretend
that she's a man?

243
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,127
Mi-nam, here. Water.

244
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,261
Thank you!

245
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:18,330
Ko Mi-nam. Are you okay?

246
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,966
Yeah, I just need some water.

247
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,602
Hey, Ko Mi-nam!

248
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:24,803
I heard you were feeling unwell.

249
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,805
Let's go eat something good, my treat.

250
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:28,107
Tae-gyung!

251
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:29,141
Tae-gyung!

252
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,911
-Where are you going?
-We'll eat! My treat. Let's go!

253
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:35,547
-Ko Mi-nam, say you want steak!
-Tell him salad bar.

254
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,649
-You can eat salad with steak, Tae-gyung!
-Jermy!

255
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:38,851
What the heck?

256
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:42,454
She's pretending to be a man
but she's treated like a princess.

257
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:43,956
Miss He-i.

258
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:47,860
Could you possibly just take
one picture with me?

259
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:49,495
-Just one!
-But steak is so good!

260
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:50,863
-Just one!
-No way.

261
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,965
-Please? Just one picture.
-But...

262
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:55,067
-Miss He-i. Please.
-No. Salad bar.

263
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,035
Just one picture!

264
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:00,205
I'm such a huge fan, please.
Just one picture.

265
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,110
-Sure.
-Thank you!

266
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:08,747
Can we act close, just for the picture?
Thank you.

267
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:11,016
And on three.

268
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:12,784
Mi-nam!

269
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,386
Are they leaving to go eat?

270
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,122
I'm sorry, maybe next time.

271
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:22,027
You're leaving me? Where are you going?

272
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:23,929
-Mi-nam!
-Oh, Hoon-i!

273
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,597
-You should've told me!
-Let's go!

274
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,232
Hello, Mr. Ma! Anyway, all I'm...

275
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:32,771
I see you're getting pampered like
you deserve it while you fake being a man.

276
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:35,407
But when you turn back into a woman,

277
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,677
you'll be a bomb that will injure
everyone around you.

278
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,213
Now,

279
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,649
how should I drop this bomb?

280
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,952
No, I don't want that! I want steak!

281
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,453
Let them have some meat, Hoon-i, yeah?

282
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,590
When are you going to release
the news about He-i?

283
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:55,060
I saw what you did with the VIP premiere.
It was pretty clever.

284
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,829
Korea's Fairy

285
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:00,132
and A.N.JELL. Not a bad pairing.

286
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,041
It doesn't matter.

287
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:10,576
There's nothing between us.

288
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:15,814
Did you think about the remake
for Hwa-ran's song?

289
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:16,949
Find someone else.

290
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,483
I'm not doing it.

291
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:21,253
Oh, dear. She really seemed
to want you to do it.

292
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:24,556
Well, anyway, we can't do anything
about that then. I'll let her know then.

293
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:26,091
But

294
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,460
there's something else
we have to start immediately.

295
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:30,829
With Mi-nam.

296
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,098
With Ko Mi-nam?

297
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:09,201
Ko Mi-nam. You're drinking water again?

298
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:11,803
You can't fill your stomach up
with water at a buffet!

299
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:14,206
Go eat all the tasty food.

300
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,508
I will.

301
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,398
Don't be sick, Ko Mi-nam.

302
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,600
Eat that first.

303
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:46,772
Jermy.

304
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:53,278
Men will like pretty women, right?
That's natural, right?

305
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:55,414
What?

306
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,417
You would too, right?

307
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:01,586
Of course! I'm a man too!

308
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,955
I only like really pretty women.

309
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:06,992
Women with pretty faces and bodies,

310
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,327
all men do. It's normal.

311
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:10,796
What? Do you think
I'll like a guy like you?

312
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:17,436
You're right.

313
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,504
I'm a man.

314
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:22,574
Ko Mi-nam. Why are you doing this to me?

315
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,710
Give it back!

316
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:38,090
Excuse me.

317
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:42,661
I heard that Yoo He-i came by?
To A.N Entertainment?

318
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:44,696
Then did you, by any chance,

319
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:48,166
see her with Hwang Tae-gyung?

320
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,335
-Well, you see...
-Well, you see...

321
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:52,671
Guys. Don't say anything.

322
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:56,808
You're a reporter, aren't you?

323
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:01,713
We keep all of A.N.JELL's private lives
as it should be. Private.

324
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:05,817
So don't even think about trying
to pry information from us.

325
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:12,057
Look at him!

326
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,359
This came out great.

327
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,398
They looked so good
at the Asian Music Festival.

328
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:21,266
Wait, Jermy is covered in this one!

329
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:23,168
-You took this one, didn't you?
-I didn't!

330
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:27,139
Did you see anything special
or out of the ordinary on this day?

331
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,407
My goodness.

332
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:29,608
Don't bother.

333
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:35,514
When is their sixth album coming out?

334
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:38,083
I wish it'll come out soon.

335
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,885
I wonder what the concept
will be this time.

336
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,321
This one's a bit blurry.

337
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:46,291
Wait, isn't that Yoo He-i?
The one I chased after?

338
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:49,694
Wait, stop! Stop!

339
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,263
That's strange.

340
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:54,332
After I took pictures of Hwang Tae-gyung

341
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:56,535
and Yoo He-i running away,

342
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:59,938
I tagged her to her agency office.

343
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:03,041
She never went down

344
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,876
to the lobby on her own.

345
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:08,079
Then the woman who ran with him

346
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:09,948
wasn't Yoo He-i?

347
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,418
Excuse me.

348
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:16,087
Can I take a look at that picture?
Just for a second.

349
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:17,622
What are you doing?

350
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:19,724
That picture came out great!

351
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,828
-Mister!
-Mister!

352
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:23,895
Get him!

353
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:25,230
-Get him!
-Mister!

354
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:28,099
It was another woman! Who is this?

355
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:31,336
I told you to give Jermy some meat,
not a plateful of waffles.

356
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:34,339
-I'm eating right now, let me call--
-I don't eat stuff like this.

357
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:37,008
Ko Mi-nam. We're going to start
promoting with you first.

358
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:47,886
We'll release Mi-nam's single
before the sixth album.

359
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:56,161
Mi-nam is not well-known or anything.
Wouldn't that be too far a stretch?

360
00:24:56,995 --> 00:25:00,565
You have to raise profile aggressively.
There's a song Tae-gyung made

361
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:04,669
that's perfect for Mi-nam.

362
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:08,306
When we release it,
it'll explode into success! Jackpot!

363
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:21,019
You know better than anyone
that if she releases a single,

364
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:23,889
she has to go run the promotion alone!
How can she do it without you guys?

365
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:25,457
Tae-gyung.

366
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:28,894
The real Mi-nam will be back
before you record the sixth album.

367
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,663
He said he will! Tae-gyung, please.

368
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,565
I won't ask after this anymore.

369
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:36,334
Can you stall this somehow
until Mi-nam gets back? I'm begging you.

370
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:41,239
I'm drawing the last line
on your ridiculous sham of a situation.

371
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:42,274
Sure.

372
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,710
You.

373
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:47,312
Can you sing my song?

374
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,017
I--

375
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:53,518
If you can, stay.

376
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:54,819
Otherwise,

377
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,254
leave.

378
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:06,398
I suppose this must be the end.

379
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:10,201
If I do take his offer,

380
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:12,270
what happens then?

381
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:21,780
It's so nice to see you.

382
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:23,181
-Hello.
-Yes.

383
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:25,750
Why don't we let them hear your voices,
one by one?

384
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:27,752
Not just television appearances.

385
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:29,354
You have to go on radio shows,

386
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:30,689
do performances.

387
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:31,923
Basically,

388
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:34,225
you'll become a bona fide celebrity.

389
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:37,829
Could I?

390
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:39,965
Do you think I can do it?

391
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:48,840
Whatever you decide
I will support your decision, Sister.

392
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,749
It's not just singing a song...

393
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:03,622
Even Tae-gyung had to grate a radish...

394
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,528
Are you worried about promoting alone?

395
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:15,066
Don't worry.
We'll be supporting you all the way

396
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,435
and it's really nothing
once you get into it.

397
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:22,040
Our job is to make
those who watch us happy.

398
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:24,442
Would they like someone like me

399
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:26,978
just because I do what they do?

400
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:31,116
You've already got one person

401
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,118
who'll like you no matter what.

402
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:37,389
No matter what you do,

403
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:40,091
I'll clap for you, praise you,
compliment you

404
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:41,559
and smile for you.

405
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,561
A pretty good fan, right?

406
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,800
You're a kind and warm person,
just like the person who raised me.

407
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:53,938
Oh, is Myeongdong Cathedral far from here?

408
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:56,675
Myeongdong Cathedral?

409
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,944
No, it's close. Want me to take you?

410
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,179
It's all right.

411
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,116
Thank you

412
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,085
for always offering me comfort.

413
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:13,658
Tae-gyung!

414
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:16,728
Tae-gyung! I'll kneel.
Look, kneeling. I'm kneeling.

415
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:17,929
Please? Tae-gyung.

416
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,699
Haven't you done that enough?

417
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:23,635
Please, just this once.

418
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,704
You said you devoted yourself
in making that song.

419
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,773
Why would you give that to Ko Mi-nam
when you can just sing it?

420
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:32,043
Tae-gyung!

421
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:41,186
Mr. Ma, I'm going to go see
my Reverend Mother.

422
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:43,588
Sorry I left without telling you.

423
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:44,989
Go? She left?

424
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:51,696
What do I do now?

425
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:54,733
How could you leave without
telling me? What do I do?

426
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:55,633
What's going on?

427
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:58,670
Ko Mi-nam left. Happy?

428
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:10,915
Ko Mi-nam left?

429
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:15,854
Ko Mi-nam.

430
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:18,423
You left just like that?

431
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:27,465
Oh, my goodness!

432
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:18,817
HWANG TAE-GYUNG

433
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:25,423
Tae-gyung.

434
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:29,027
Ko Mi-nam. Where are you?

435
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:34,632
I'm at the bus stop
near the agency building.

436
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:36,501
Stay there. Don't you dare move.

437
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:07,632
Tae-gyung?

438
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:16,808
You're really leaving like this?

439
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:17,909
What?

440
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:21,246
Yes.

441
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:24,716
You can go if you want,

442
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:26,618
but how could you leave without a word?

443
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,389
Who's going to explain to Mr. An
and the boys who don't have a clue?

444
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,157
Did you expect me to do it?

445
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:35,526
And what about your aunt?

446
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,962
You should take care of everything
before you leave!

447
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,431
Did you think if you just left,
it'd be fine?

448
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:42,967
Do you think I'll just let you leave?

449
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:45,670
Get in the car.

450
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:51,442
Tae-gyung.

451
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:54,479
Then

452
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:56,247
are you giving me a ride?

453
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:04,422
Oh, so Reverend Mother

454
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:07,358
came to Seoul so you were visiting her?

455
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:09,394
Sister.

456
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:13,598
Then you should've said that first!
You scared me.

457
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:14,766
Seriously.

458
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:18,536
Yes, I'll see her and I'll be right back.

459
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,740
Yes. I brought a change of guy clothes
with me as well.

460
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:25,276
Yes.

461
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:29,747
At least Hwang Tae-gyung's driving you,
that's better than a bus.

462
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:32,417
Yes, have a safe trip.

463
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:34,118
Bye.

464
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:36,821
Oh, my goodness,

465
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:38,790
yes!

466
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:41,726
I knew it!

467
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,695
Hwang Tae-gyung

468
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:46,698
has a soft heart. A soft heart!

469
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:49,534
This kid, such a soft heart.

470
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,736
Yes!

471
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:02,046
He refused me?

472
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:05,917
No, it's just he's a bit busy right now.

473
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,219
He has to prepare
a song for the new member's album.

474
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:10,588
I'll introduce you to another producer.

475
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:12,123
No.

476
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:13,791
I need him to do it.

477
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,863
Did you have a song in mind, Hwa-ran?

478
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,837
I want to do "What Do I Do?"
The one Ko Jae-hyeon made.

479
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:29,474
But this wasn't a hit song.

480
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,576
It has to be his song.

481
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:33,845
And I want

482
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:37,548
Hwang Tae-gyung to remake it.

483
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,052
Oh, sure.

484
00:33:58,536 --> 00:33:59,504
Is that

485
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:01,739
what you really look like?

486
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,942
Yes. Basically.

487
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:08,212
So this is the first time I'm meeting you.

488
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:12,450
The way you look right now, it feels like
I should be speaking formally.

489
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:16,854
Then should I take off the wig for a bit,
if it's too awkward?

490
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:20,091
It's all right, Miss Ko Mi-nam.

491
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,528
It's Ko Mi-nyeo.

492
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,199
Then Miss Mi-nyeo,

493
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:31,436
did you cut your hair short
to become Mister Mi-nam?

494
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:33,805
Yes.

495
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:37,375
I actually became much cooler
after becoming a man.

496
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:41,045
It must've been upsetting,
to cut your hair.

497
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:42,814
You're a woman, too.

498
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:48,252
Even if my hair is a bit short,
I am still a woman.

499
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:54,792
But the Ko Mi-nam I know

500
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:56,060
is a man.

501
00:34:57,562 --> 00:35:01,165
But my hair's all long now,
and I have a hairpin too.

502
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,835
I may not be pretty
but don't I look like a woman at least?

503
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:06,838
A woman?

504
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:08,606
Just because
you put a hairpin in fake hair?

505
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:15,379
You're right.
It doesn't look good, does it?

506
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:24,188
See?

507
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:26,757
Even the hairpin knows
it doesn't belong there.

508
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:31,362
Yes. I guess I shouldn't have bothered.

509
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:51,849
We're here.

510
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:54,719
Just leave it.

511
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:58,656
Wait, are you driving me back too?

512
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,058
You're on the way back anyway.

513
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:02,860
How long are you going to take?

514
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:05,496
Two hours. See you then.

515
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:06,864
Thank you!

516
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:27,618
I didn't do anything,
but why do I feel bad?

517
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:41,699
Reverend Mother!

518
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:43,301
Gemma.

519
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:46,270
Reverend Mother...

520
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:50,541
Has it been that rough?

521
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:53,377
I...

522
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:56,414
I cannot tell you anything right now.

523
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:59,317
Just hold me, Reverend Mother.

524
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,918
Give me strength.

525
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:23,441
-Ma'am?
-Yes?

526
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:26,310
A hairpin, please. A girly one.

527
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:29,213
Come out and choose one.
There are lots of pretty ones.

528
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:33,217
I'm good. Just give me any of them.

529
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:37,154
That doesn't help narrow things down.

530
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,460
Then

531
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:45,029
give me something prettier than this.

532
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:49,433
Is this good?

533
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,868
It's 3,000 won.

534
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,389
Sir! Your change!

535
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,628
This is a 100,000 won hairpin.

536
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:25,036
It's me.

537
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:26,437
Who?

538
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:28,339
You can't figure it out?

539
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:29,507
It's...

540
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:34,445
It's me, Yoo He-i!

541
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,615
Why are you calling me?

542
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,451
Yeah, why did I call? Guess.

543
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:41,585
I don't care. Bye.

544
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:42,620
That woman!

545
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:44,789
What?

546
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:47,725
Well, you see,

547
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:50,261
I have another picture of her.

548
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:52,963
One of my staff

549
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:55,533
took a picture of you running
with that woman.

550
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:59,937
You should've been careful,
there were so many people there.

551
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:02,106
You're lying.

552
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:04,842
Does it sound like I am?

553
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:09,580
Believe what you want to.

554
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,351
I just called you to let you know

555
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:16,253
before I send it off to Mr. Kim.

556
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:18,956
I'm hanging up now.

557
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:21,659
Hey! Where are you right now?

558
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:45,649
You really came?

559
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:48,452
It's a far cry from refusing

560
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:50,588
to open the door this morning.

561
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:52,590
Show me the picture.

562
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,392
Who is she?

563
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:59,597
She looked strangely familiar.

564
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:01,532
Is she at your agency?

565
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,234
I said, show me the picture.

566
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,535
She is, isn't she?

567
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,704
Is she an artist?

568
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:08,606
Or an employee?

569
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:13,978
Oh, I should show it to Mr. An!
He'll know!

570
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:20,017
You're playing with me, aren't you?

571
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:25,322
You figured that out now?

572
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:28,259
There was no picture.

573
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:32,096
Seriously, why would I call you?
I would've sent it off to a reporter.

574
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:36,567
You were always bragging about yourself,

575
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:38,803
but I guess you are quite dumb.

576
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,739
Where did you park your car?

577
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,274
Why?

578
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,242
Trying to take it out on my car?

579
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:46,844
My car

580
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:48,712
is way over there.

581
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:50,481
Is that so?

582
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:53,684
Good.

583
00:40:57,488 --> 00:40:58,456
Hey!

584
00:40:58,889 --> 00:40:59,857
What are you doing?

585
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:04,528
Hey! Where are you going?

586
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:20,277
Hey!

587
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:21,779
You crazy jerk!

588
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:22,746
Hey!

589
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,682
I'm going to be late because of her.

590
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:31,155
It's fine, don't worry. I'll wait here.

591
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:38,596
Hwang Tae-gyung.

592
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,698
You're so dead.

593
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,901
I'm going to tell everyone that Ko Mi-nam

594
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:44,969
-is a girl--
-Watch out!

595
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,539
Are you okay?

596
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:53,377
-It's Yoo He-i!
-It's Yoo He-i!

597
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:55,379
- Your nose!
-It's bleeding!

598
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:56,814
-Take a picture!
-Take a picture!

599
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:02,119
-Excuse me.
-Hey!

600
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,288
-Please, move.
-Look here!

601
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,257
Stop it, please. Stop taking pictures.

602
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:09,727
Please, stop!

603
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:11,395
-She's crying!
-She's crying!

604
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:12,696
-Take a picture!
-She's crying!

605
00:42:13,397 --> 00:42:14,732
Hwang Tae-gyung!

606
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:16,033
It's Hwang Tae-gyung!

607
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,535
-Tae-gyung!
-Are you getting this?

608
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:20,237
-This is crazy!
-This is so big!

609
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:22,273
Please. No pictures.

610
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,308
Move out of the way, please.

611
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:39,823
I wonder how long he'll be?

612
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:55,039
They took so many pictures.

613
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,676
It's all over the internet.

614
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,912
I'm so mortified, I can't live like this.

615
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:05,449
I'll just retire.

616
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:10,321
Isn't it more mortifying to have that
as your last photo before retiring?

617
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:16,694
Why did you do that, by the way?

618
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:18,696
Do what?

619
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:22,066
They took pictures of us together.

620
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:26,170
People are suspicious about us as it is.

621
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:28,872
Why did you help me?

622
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:34,345
I know how it feels to have
unwanted pictures taken of me.

623
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,014
I was just lending a hand

624
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:38,949
as a person in the same trade.

625
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:44,054
Well,

626
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:46,123
I'm...

627
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:48,092
-thank--
-If you're done crying,

628
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:50,894
why don't you wait in your car
until your agent gets here?

629
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:52,596
I have to go.

630
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:02,539
I need to blow my nose. Go outside.

631
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,905
KO MI-NAM

632
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,441
Ko Mi-nam?

633
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,451
Tae-gyung! It's Ko Mi-nam.

634
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:50,054
How much longer will it take
for you to be here?

635
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:53,357
Tae-gyung?

636
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:55,993
He can't go now. Don't wait for him.

637
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:10,441
Oh. He's with her...

638
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,493
Go wait in your car.

639
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,663
You need to stay with me
until my agent gets here.

640
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:34,898
I'm scared.

641
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,002
You threw my shoe away too!

642
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:51,648
Oh, my goodness gracious.

643
00:45:51,715 --> 00:45:54,885
These two! Their pictures
are all over the internet!

644
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,354
Jang.

645
00:45:57,888 --> 00:45:58,922
Oh, Mr. Jang.

646
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:01,291
The pictures? It's nothing.

647
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:02,526
You cannot upload it.

648
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:04,294
It's nothing, I'm telling you.

649
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:07,564
And no, they weren't the only ones there.

650
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:10,200
Their agents were there too.
What are you thinking?

651
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,236
Yes, I understand,

652
00:46:12,402 --> 00:46:16,373
but they're just close friends.
Close friends! Close. Friends!

653
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,542
You really can't upload that, you can't!

654
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:22,679
Tae-gyung was just being chivalrous
and he's helping her out!

655
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:25,516
I'm Yoo He-i's older brother, all right?
Want to fight?

656
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:28,519
ARE THE RUMORS TRUE
ABOUT HWANG TAE-GYUNG AND YOO HE-I?

657
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:30,788
These pictures are coming up in real-time.

658
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:34,391
Then is Tae-gyung hiding
with Yoo He-i right now?

659
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:36,660
Dude, Hwang Tae-gyung...

660
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,796
-He's the best.
-What a lucky dude.

661
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:40,964
I thought Mi-nam was with him.

662
00:46:42,032 --> 00:46:44,334
Then where's Ko Mi-nam?

663
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:46,036
She has some fine legs.

664
00:46:50,874 --> 00:46:52,609
I shouldn't be waiting for him.

665
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:01,685
I still feel the shocks.

666
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:06,757
What's going on? I drank a lot of water.

667
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:13,430
I should get home.

668
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:19,703
Oh, I can't go like this.

669
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:23,307
I should buy some clothes
before I take off the wig.

670
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:45,229
Now that I think about it, I've never gone
sightseeing since I came up to Seoul.

671
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:47,631
This is Myeongdong...

672
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:24,101
Shin-woo!

673
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:27,671
I'm in Myeongdong.

674
00:48:29,806 --> 00:48:31,441
Oh, I'm fine, you don't have to come!

675
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:49,760
Okay, if you say so.

676
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:51,261
Did you eat?

677
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:53,230
Not yet.

678
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,465
If you're in Myeongdong,
you need to try Myeongdong Noodle.

679
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,801
Myeongdong Noodle?

680
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:03,640
This looks so good!

681
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:09,279
Here you go.

682
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:11,415
This looks delicious!

683
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:21,692
A bowl of noodles for me as well.

684
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:22,826
Yes!

685
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:32,869
Oh, I'm so full.

686
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:37,474
Shin-woo!

687
00:49:38,775 --> 00:49:40,844
The noodles were so delicious.

688
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:45,015
Hearing you say that makes me feel
like I had a bowl of it too.

689
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:46,750
Oh, what do you want for dessert?

690
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:49,753
Ice cream.

691
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:50,921
Ice cream?

692
00:49:51,421 --> 00:49:53,590
You'll probably have to turn

693
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,658
right then.

694
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:58,328
Yes. I think I know where it is.

695
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:09,706
Oh, I didn't order this.

696
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:10,941
It's on the house.

697
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:15,078
This looks amazing.

698
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:23,053
I delivered it to her.

699
00:50:37,334 --> 00:50:39,903
I had another ice cream,
they said it was on the house.

700
00:50:40,604 --> 00:50:41,538
Really?

701
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:43,507
I've never gotten that.

702
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:45,108
You're lucky.

703
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:47,511
I must be lucky when it comes to food.

704
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:50,614
Oh, Shin-woo, I have to buy some clothes,

705
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,749
is there a cheap and fashionable
clothing store nearby?

706
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:54,751
How cheap does it have to be?

707
00:51:16,206 --> 00:51:19,543
I can really get such great clothes
at this price?

708
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:21,211
This is amazing.

709
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:22,946
There's an extra special sale today.

710
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:24,548
You're quite lucky.

711
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:26,283
Thank you.

712
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:34,391
How much do I owe you?

713
00:51:34,524 --> 00:51:36,426
I had great food, dessert,

714
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,995
and lucked out on a great sale,

715
00:51:39,362 --> 00:51:40,997
all thanks to you, Shin-woo.

716
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:42,632
Ko Mi-nam.

717
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:45,102
There's something
I really want to tell you.

718
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:46,803
Will you be up for a surprise?

719
00:51:48,238 --> 00:51:49,873
What is it?

720
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:53,343
You'll find out when you turn around

721
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:55,712
from where you are now.

722
00:51:58,815 --> 00:51:59,850
Hello?

723
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:25,008
Are you here to pick me up?

724
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:27,444
I'll be right there!

725
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:38,155
You were so close.

726
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:40,857
Just

727
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:43,426
one more step...

728
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:14,357
Tae-gyung!

729
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:28,505
I went to buy some clothes,
I thought you weren't coming.

730
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:30,707
You bought clothes?

731
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:33,109
Then why did you come back?

732
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:35,645
You called me, so I came back.

733
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:38,815
I'm a very punctual person,

734
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:41,051
but something came up so I was a bit late.

735
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:44,321
It's fine. You still came to pick me up.

736
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:46,556
Thank you, Tae-gyung!

737
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:51,461
Don't speak so loudly.

738
00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:54,030
Oh, right. I'll change quickly.

739
00:53:59,102 --> 00:54:00,070
Ko Mi-nam!

740
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:03,073
How about you don't change?

741
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:06,343
If you come back out in that,

742
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:10,113
I'll take you to Mr. An
and explain everything.

743
00:54:12,015 --> 00:54:13,049
I'll help you.

744
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:37,574
Do you really

745
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:39,609
want to continue being Ko Mi-nam?

746
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:42,078
Why did you

747
00:54:42,379 --> 00:54:44,614
accept Ko Mi-nam into the team?

748
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:48,551
I liked your voice.

749
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:52,622
As Mr. An said,
it was the voice I was looking for

750
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:55,625
when I wrote the track.

751
00:54:56,893 --> 00:55:00,397
Then can I ask you
to take care of my voice this time?

752
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:04,934
The voice you chose

753
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:08,171
wasn't the fake man Ko Mi-nam's.
It's my real voice.

754
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:12,709
Please, let me sing your song. I'll do it.

755
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:16,146
If you don't keep up,

756
00:55:17,013 --> 00:55:18,281
I'm throwing you out.

757
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:21,551
I'll do my best so I can stay.

758
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:23,853
Tae-gyung.

759
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:43,073
If I drop this bomb,

760
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:45,442
Hwang Tae-gyung will get hurt too.

761
00:55:55,552 --> 00:55:57,253
Since you saved me once,

762
00:55:57,787 --> 00:55:59,255
I'll turn a blind eye this time.

763
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,596
All the articles are about you
and Hwang Tae-gyung.

764
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:09,032
What do we do?

765
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:11,134
Is that so?

766
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,269
What should we do...

767
00:56:15,238 --> 00:56:16,740
The reporters should be camped

768
00:56:16,906 --> 00:56:20,243
outside both his and our agency
so let's just head home.

769
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:22,712
No.

770
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:25,882
I want to go return
Hwang Tae-gyung's jacket to him.

771
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:28,385
Let's go to A.N Entertainment.

772
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,436
This is definitely Yoo He-i.

773
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:51,274
But this isn't.

774
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:54,811
What is going on? How is this possible?

775
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:56,913
-It's Yoo He-i!
-She's here!

776
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:59,516
-A word, please!
-What is going on?

777
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:01,284
Are you and Tae-gyung dating?

778
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:03,052
Since when? Where's Tae-gyung?

779
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:22,338
Ko Mi-nam.

780
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:24,774
While you were taking out
stuff from your bag,

781
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:26,643
did you see anything?

782
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:29,112
No, I didn't.

783
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:31,181
Yeah?

784
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:34,651
Then look more carefully

785
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:36,085
when you're unpacking later.

786
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:37,754
Sure.

787
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:44,961
What's this?

788
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,300
A hairpin?

789
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:53,203
It's pretty.

790
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:55,505
That's--

791
00:57:55,572 --> 00:57:56,873
Yoo He-i's?

792
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:00,543
Why are you bringing her up right now?

793
00:58:01,444 --> 00:58:03,880
You were with her.

794
00:58:04,113 --> 00:58:06,049
She answered your phone.

795
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:09,519
Fake fairy touched my phone?

796
00:58:10,353 --> 00:58:13,957
I'll leave this here.
You should return it to her.

797
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:21,531
That's not hers!

798
00:58:22,265 --> 00:58:23,433
It's yours!

799
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:24,667
What?

800
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:27,470
Mine?

801
00:58:27,604 --> 00:58:28,605
Yes.

802
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:33,042
You looked like you were going to cry over
a broken tacky pin

803
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:35,945
so I bought one.
Only because I had time to spare.

804
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,415
This is really mine?

805
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:41,518
It's so pretty.

806
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:49,292
Why are you just staring at it?

807
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,998
I'm a guy right now,
so it won't look good on me.

808
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:58,902
When I become a girl for real
and my hair grows longer,

809
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:00,503
I'll use it then.

810
00:59:02,805 --> 00:59:03,773
Fine.

811
00:59:04,574 --> 00:59:06,543
Then I'll never get to see it.

812
00:59:08,945 --> 00:59:12,048
You won't be here by then.

813
00:59:14,784 --> 00:59:15,785
Yes.

814
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:19,088
I don't think I'll get to see you

815
00:59:20,123 --> 00:59:21,858
when I become a woman.

816
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:27,931
It may not look it
but it's worth 100,000 won.

817
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:30,667
Really?

818
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:36,606
Tae-gyung!

819
00:59:37,106 --> 00:59:40,810
You don't have to lie.
Who cares if it's only worth 3,000 won?

820
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:43,580
I gave 100,000 won for it.

821
00:59:44,948 --> 00:59:47,717
Tae-gyung, really,
it's fine if it's a 3,000 won pin.

822
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:50,320
No, I'm telling you,
I paid 100,000 won for it.

823
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:53,690
But look! It says 3,000 won.

824
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:56,059
Seriously, I paid exactly 100,000 won.

825
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:58,661
Tae-gyung, thank you.

826
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:02,031
Just wait. Let me turn this car around
back to the store...

827
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:04,968
Hold on.

828
01:00:12,508 --> 01:00:13,509
Hey,

829
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:15,678
Yoo He-i is here right now.

830
01:00:15,979 --> 01:00:18,615
We need you here to sort things out.
Come as soon as you can.

831
01:00:19,048 --> 01:00:23,119
The reporters are all over the front
so come through the back.

832
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:28,157
I can't talk alone.

833
01:00:29,592 --> 01:00:33,229
I'll tell everything after I have a chance
to talk to Tae-gyung.

834
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:35,164
I thought you were with Mi-nam!

835
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:36,899
Reporters.

836
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:39,135
When did you meet up with Yoo He-i then?

837
01:00:39,535 --> 01:00:40,670
Where is she?

838
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:42,672
Why did she even come here?

839
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:52,815
I'll give you some time. Yeah.

840
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:01,724
Why are you here?

841
01:01:05,561 --> 01:01:06,629
To give this back.

842
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:10,166
And I didn't get to finish it before

843
01:01:11,234 --> 01:01:12,235
but I wanted to thank you.

844
01:01:12,301 --> 01:01:14,504
You deliberately came all the way here

845
01:01:15,104 --> 01:01:17,140
to give this back in this situation?

846
01:01:20,643 --> 01:01:21,944
Speaking of which,

847
01:01:22,712 --> 01:01:24,514
we should figure this out.

848
01:01:25,948 --> 01:01:28,751
You said you expected this
when you helped me.

849
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:31,421
And you said it was fine.

850
01:01:33,322 --> 01:01:35,792
They won't believe us anyway
if we deny it,

851
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:38,227
so why don't we

852
01:01:39,662 --> 01:01:40,797
just say we are dating?

853
01:01:41,898 --> 01:01:42,899
What?

854
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:45,435
Me, being with you...

855
01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:47,136
I'm okay with that.

856
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:49,138
-How about you?
-I'm not.

857
01:01:50,506 --> 01:01:53,476
I refuse to say we're together.
It's simply ridiculous.

858
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:59,749
If I go out there and deny it, you'll look
like a fool for coming this far.

859
01:02:00,249 --> 01:02:02,919
So you go and explain that
nothing happened and go.

860
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:06,856
This is all your fault!

861
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:11,627
You were the one who called me there
and got us into this mess!

862
01:02:11,694 --> 01:02:13,429
Did you forget why I called you?

863
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:15,465
I told you, I know who the girl is.

864
01:02:16,933 --> 01:02:18,334
Stop with your games

865
01:02:18,668 --> 01:02:19,802
and leave. Quietly.

866
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:25,308
Games?

867
01:02:26,843 --> 01:02:27,877
Fine.

868
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:29,979
Hwang Tae-gyung!

869
01:02:31,214 --> 01:02:34,117
I won't just leave and make a fool
out of myself. Watch me.

870
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:42,258
Are you all right?

871
01:02:43,626 --> 01:02:44,660
It's nothing. I'm fine.

872
01:02:53,035 --> 01:02:55,037
MESSAGES

873
01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:09,919
I told you I know who it is.

874
01:03:10,853 --> 01:03:11,988
Not so much a game now, is it?

875
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:15,024
Let's talk it over.

876
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:20,663
No.

877
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:23,432
I'm busy.
I have to go talk to the reporters.

878
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:26,803
You dare refuse me?

879
01:03:33,676 --> 01:03:35,011
Is something wrong?

880
01:03:36,946 --> 01:03:37,914
Ko Mi-nam.

881
01:03:38,714 --> 01:03:39,916
I'll ask you again.

882
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:42,618
Do you have to stay here?

883
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:47,690
Must you stay here

884
01:03:49,025 --> 01:03:50,026
as a man,

885
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,428
as Ko Mi-nam?

886
01:04:19,822 --> 01:04:22,225
Let go! I'm going to tell them everything.

887
01:04:29,298 --> 01:04:32,468
Let go of me!
Do you think you can shut me up now?

888
01:04:32,668 --> 01:04:33,736
Let go of me!

889
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:01,397
It's Yoo He-i and Hwang Tae-gyung!

890
01:05:31,627 --> 01:05:32,895
Reverend Mother.

891
01:05:33,796 --> 01:05:35,298
Do electric shocks

892
01:05:35,898 --> 01:05:37,199
