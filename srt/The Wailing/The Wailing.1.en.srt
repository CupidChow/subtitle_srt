112
00:12:33,184 --> 00:12:35,493
there's definitely something
off with that guy.

113
00:12:35,517 --> 00:12:36,976

114
00:12:37,017 --> 00:12:39,476

115

122
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,351

don't do that to you.

But I'm right about the Japanese guy.

135
00:13:46,642 --> 00:13:48,934
If everyone's talking about him,

136
00:13:48,976 --> 00:13:51,767

00:18:47,517 --> 00:18:49,142
Son of a bitch!

187
00:18:50,642 --> 00:18:53,476
What took you so long? Ignoring my calls?

188
00:18:53,517 --> 00:18:57,142
My mother-in-law got sick.

189
00:18:57,184 --> 00:18:59,035
Now you're using your
mother-in-law as an excuse?

190
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:00,452
You were taking a nap, I can tell!

191
00:19:00,476 --> 00:19:03,434
No, I wasn't. I swear.

192
00:19:07,351 --> 00:19:10,392
Get to work.

193
00:19:14,517 --> 00:19:16,934
Excuse me, ma'am?

194
00:19:21,184 --> 00:19:22,559
What the hell?

195
00:19:26,642 --> 00:19:29,267
What are you doing? Stop her.

196
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:30,726
Yes, sir.

197
00:19:31,726 --> 00:19:33,326
Come with me, ma'am.

198
00:19:34,851 --> 00:19:36,184
Get off me!

199
00:19:37,267 --> 00:19:40,392
Sergeant, get her out of here.

200
00:19:41,142 --> 00:19:43,642
Back off, people.

201
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,142
What's wrong with her?

202
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:27,809
Please, calm down.

203
00:20:31,267 --> 00:20:32,684
That idiot...

204
00:20:44,851 --> 00:20:46,934
Calm down, ma'am.

205
00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:00,309
Jong-gu.

206
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,659
Get cleaned up, man.

207
00:21:03,226 --> 00:21:06,101
Hey, don't beat yourself up.

208
00:21:06,142 --> 00:21:07,785
It's not your fault...

209
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:11,521
that you're a little girly-man
with balls the size of peas.

210
00:21:11,726 --> 00:21:13,434
Oh jeez.

211
00:21:13,476 --> 00:21:14,726
Hello!

212
00:21:14,767 --> 00:21:16,160
- Hey.
- Hi, Hyo-jin.

213
00:21:16,184 --> 00:21:17,327
Hello, Captain.

214
00:21:17,351 --> 00:21:19,392
- How are you?
- Good.

215
00:21:19,434 --> 00:21:22,334
- You've got clean clothes for Daddy?
- Yeah.

216
00:21:28,876 --> 00:21:31,792
Mom got you clean boxers and an undershirt.

217
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,501
Thanks, darling.

218
00:21:35,292 --> 00:21:36,584
Take a shower.

219
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:39,334
I will. Go home.

220
00:21:41,792 --> 00:21:45,459
You didn't even eat, did you?

221
00:21:45,501 --> 00:21:51,542
All right, get out of here.
Can't you see Daddy's working?

222
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:02,376
See you.

223
00:22:04,459 --> 00:22:06,084
Goodbye, officers.

224
00:22:06,209 --> 00:22:07,501
- Bye.
- See ya.

225
00:22:07,542 --> 00:22:09,542
- Take care, sweetie.
- Oh, my.

226
00:22:19,209 --> 00:22:21,667
That scatterbrain.

227
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:32,001
Seong-bok?

228
00:22:32,042 --> 00:22:33,084
Yeah.

229
00:22:33,584 --> 00:22:34,917
It just hit me.

230
00:22:35,459 --> 00:22:36,709
What?

231
00:22:37,542 --> 00:22:38,834
That woman...

232
00:22:39,501 --> 00:22:40,584
What woman?

233
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:42,893
The one whose house burned down...

234
00:22:43,334 --> 00:22:45,584
I knew I'd seen her before.

235
00:22:45,626 --> 00:22:48,626
It's that naked woman from last night.

236
00:22:49,542 --> 00:22:50,185
What?

237
00:22:50,209 --> 00:22:55,126
The woman who was standing here last night.

238
00:23:01,751 --> 00:23:03,626
Crazy fools.

239
00:23:45,876 --> 00:23:49,501
They didn't burn to death.
They were stabbed.

240
00:23:49,542 --> 00:23:50,602
All three of them?

241
00:23:50,626 --> 00:23:51,792
Yeah.

242
00:23:53,251 --> 00:23:55,384
Freaked the hell out of me, too.

243
00:23:57,334 --> 00:24:02,334
Prime suspect is the
missus who hung herself.

244
00:24:06,317 --> 00:24:10,359
What the heck happened?

245
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:13,484
Beats me.

246
00:24:14,734 --> 00:24:15,734
Over here.

247
00:24:17,401 --> 00:24:18,377
In here.

248
00:24:18,401 --> 00:24:19,401
What?

249
00:24:19,526 --> 00:24:22,484
Give us a hand.

250
00:24:24,026 --> 00:24:25,151
A little more.

251
00:24:30,817 --> 00:24:31,859
Found it.

252
00:24:33,484 --> 00:24:36,351
Idiot! Don't touch it with your bare hands!

253
00:24:38,609 --> 00:24:40,026
What the...?

254
00:24:40,067 --> 00:24:42,567
Are you a moron?

255
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:44,984
That's evidence.

256
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:49,901
He should've wrapped it in cloth
or something, right?

257
00:24:50,609 --> 00:24:53,651
Gokseong Police Station

258
00:25:08,442 --> 00:25:11,817
So, she killed everyone?

259
00:25:12,317 --> 00:25:13,997
That's what they said.

260
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:18,317
I'll be damned.

261
00:25:18,692 --> 00:25:20,651
So, that's what happened.

262
00:25:20,692 --> 00:25:23,592
Why did you call me?
Things are crazy at work.

263
00:25:23,817 --> 00:25:25,817
Because of this case.

264
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:32,234
Remember what I told you before?

265
00:25:32,317 --> 00:25:33,442
What?

266
00:25:33,484 --> 00:25:36,817
How the Jap raped a woman?

267
00:25:37,151 --> 00:25:38,942
What about it?

268
00:25:50,776 --> 00:25:53,567
You filthy slut.

269
00:25:57,817 --> 00:25:59,192
That woman.

270
00:26:00,442 --> 00:26:01,734
It was her.

271
00:26:02,484 --> 00:26:04,293
What the hell are you talking about?

272
00:26:04,317 --> 00:26:06,776
That woman he raped-

273
00:26:06,817 --> 00:26:09,684
it's the same woman whose
house burned down.

274
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:18,734
She went crazy after that,

275
00:26:18,776 --> 00:26:21,901
and used to run around naked at night.

276
00:26:23,026 --> 00:26:25,942
My wife saw her at the public bathhouse.

277
00:26:26,442 --> 00:26:30,192
She was totally covered
in rashes and boils,

278
00:26:30,234 --> 00:26:34,984
Mumbling gibberish the whole time.

279
00:26:38,942 --> 00:26:40,734
Are you out of your mind?

280
00:26:41,776 --> 00:26:43,984
Byeong-gyu's got to stop this.

281
00:26:44,734 --> 00:26:47,276
Talking crap to his dimwitted buddies.

282
00:26:47,317 --> 00:26:51,651
You worthless bastard. It was your theory.

283
00:26:51,692 --> 00:26:54,234
I was just messing with you.

284
00:26:54,817 --> 00:26:58,567
Who in their right mind
would believe crap like that?

285
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:02,776
No, I think you're right.

286
00:27:03,401 --> 00:27:06,043
It can't be the mushrooms.
That doesn't make sense.

287
00:27:06,067 --> 00:27:07,942
Gimme a break.

288
00:27:12,817 --> 00:27:14,567
What are you looking at?

289
00:27:22,067 --> 00:27:23,276
Get outta here!

290
00:27:26,484 --> 00:27:27,526
What?

291
00:27:28,567 --> 00:27:31,467
Ignore her. She's been
doing that all morning.

292
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:33,901
What a nutjob.

293
00:27:35,567 --> 00:27:40,151
So, how about you check
with the local dermatologist.

294
00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:44,359
See if there's any medical records
on Heung-guk or that woman.

295
00:27:46,067 --> 00:27:47,587
Stop it, you tramp!

296
00:27:48,067 --> 00:27:50,026
I can't believe this.

297
00:27:50,067 --> 00:27:52,651
It's important, you idiot!

298
00:27:53,026 --> 00:27:57,942
The rash is the link here.

299
00:28:00,692 --> 00:28:02,442
Come on, hurry.

300
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:16,192
Stop it! You could hurt somebody!

301
00:28:16,401 --> 00:28:19,317
Community Health Center

302
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:23,817
Oh, my.

303
00:28:38,026 --> 00:28:41,776
You're really getting on my nerves!

304
00:28:47,067 --> 00:28:48,507
Where do you live?

305
00:28:50,484 --> 00:28:52,217
Are you from this village?

306
00:29:01,401 --> 00:29:02,526
Hey.

307
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:05,462
Don't come near me!

308
00:29:08,692 --> 00:29:09,901
Dammit!

309
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:18,859
The lady killed them all.

310
00:29:19,401 --> 00:29:20,651
What?

311
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:24,567
In there. In that room.

312
00:29:29,692 --> 00:29:31,492
What are you talking about?

313
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:36,692
The old woman got a
shaman to do some ritual,

314
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,942
but the lady refused.

315
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:43,426
That's why they all got killed.

316
00:29:46,567 --> 00:29:48,247
Are you a family member?

317
00:29:50,317 --> 00:29:51,484
No, I'm not.

318
00:29:52,192 --> 00:29:53,552
Then who are you?

319
00:29:54,817 --> 00:29:55,859
Come with me.

320
00:29:56,026 --> 00:29:57,276
Hey!

321
00:29:58,942 --> 00:30:00,151
What the...?

322
00:30:03,859 --> 00:30:05,539
You can't go in there.

323
00:30:06,109 --> 00:30:07,526
It's all right.

324
00:30:08,942 --> 00:30:09,942
Hey...

325
00:30:14,859 --> 00:30:15,942
Come on.

326
00:30:26,301 --> 00:30:28,259
She killed them here.

327
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:32,226
The old woman got it the worst of it.

328
00:30:32,717 --> 00:30:36,801
Her head was smashed
open like a watermelon.

329
00:30:39,009 --> 00:30:40,809
You saw with your own eyes?

330
00:30:42,342 --> 00:30:45,092
Of course I did.

331
00:30:45,676 --> 00:30:46,717
How?

332
00:30:49,634 --> 00:30:52,092
The old woman tells me

333
00:30:52,134 --> 00:30:53,842
the Jap is a ghost.

334
00:30:55,176 --> 00:30:59,217
He was gonna suck her blood dry.

335
00:31:04,051 --> 00:31:04,902
The Jap?

336
00:31:04,926 --> 00:31:06,259
Yeah.

337
00:31:06,301 --> 00:31:07,981
The Jap with the limp.

338
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:10,717
Oh, him!

339
00:31:12,176 --> 00:31:13,592
You've seen him?

340
00:31:14,092 --> 00:31:15,217
Yeah.

341
00:31:15,259 --> 00:31:16,467
How many times?

342
00:31:16,926 --> 00:31:18,967
Once or twice.

343
00:31:19,009 --> 00:31:20,217
Be careful.

344
00:31:20,259 --> 00:31:21,551
Why?

345
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:26,717
The old woman says, if you
keep seeing him around,

346
00:31:27,009 --> 00:31:30,009
it's because he's stalking you.

347
00:31:31,301 --> 00:31:33,217
To suck your blood dry.

348
00:31:41,301 --> 00:31:43,134
Wait here for a second.

349
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:45,051
Okay.

350
00:31:49,967 --> 00:31:51,610
Get your ass over here.

351
00:31:51,634 --> 00:31:52,842
What?

352
00:31:52,884 --> 00:31:54,467
Get over here now!

353
00:31:56,051 --> 00:31:58,235
But I just found the dermatologist.

354
00:31:58,259 --> 00:32:00,384
I found a witness.

355
00:32:00,884 --> 00:32:03,634
So, get over here as fast as you can.

356
00:32:14,176 --> 00:32:15,676
What the...?

357
00:32:17,717 --> 00:32:19,009
Where'd she go?

358
00:33:17,467 --> 00:33:21,115
What terrible sin did you commit,
to be yelling like that?

359
00:33:22,426 --> 00:33:24,106
Are you feeling sick?

360
00:33:25,676 --> 00:33:28,342
Keep having weird dreams.

361
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:33,027
Who's the medicine for?

362
00:33:33,051 --> 00:33:36,443
Hyo-jin's not feeling well.
She couldn't go to school.

363
00:33:42,592 --> 00:33:45,551
She's burning up.

364
00:33:48,009 --> 00:33:51,384
And where were you while she was so sick?

365
00:33:51,426 --> 00:33:52,777
I was getting her medicine.

366
00:33:52,801 --> 00:33:55,676
What's with you? Take her to the hospital.

367
00:34:09,717 --> 00:34:11,397
What on earth was that?

368
00:34:17,801 --> 00:34:19,676
Turn off the hose first.

369
00:34:19,717 --> 00:34:21,426
Moron...

370
00:34:23,342 --> 00:34:27,467
Just coming into work now, are you?

371
00:34:27,509 --> 00:34:31,426
Hyo-jin wasn't feeling well.

372
00:34:32,176 --> 00:34:34,801
So now you're blaming your daughter?

373
00:34:34,842 --> 00:34:36,152
I'm not making it up.

374
00:34:36,176 --> 00:34:37,909
Did you find your witness?

375
00:34:38,259 --> 00:34:39,259
No, sir.

376
00:34:39,301 --> 00:34:41,152
After turning the whole town upside down.

377
00:34:41,176 --> 00:34:43,652
You think this case is going
to be your big break?

378
00:34:43,676 --> 00:34:47,259
Seong-bok's been calling around.

379
00:34:48,592 --> 00:34:50,801
That's your excuse?

380
00:34:50,842 --> 00:34:54,884
Look at him. He can't even wash the car.

381
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:56,860
Driving me up the wall.

382
00:34:56,884 --> 00:34:59,967
Even the Chief heard about your witness.

383
00:35:00,592 --> 00:35:04,134
Whether you lied, or let her get away-

384
00:35:05,092 --> 00:35:06,676
you're screwed.

385
00:35:07,676 --> 00:35:08,967
Yes, sir.

386
00:35:11,551 --> 00:35:15,551
This is driving me up the wall.

387
00:35:15,592 --> 00:35:18,926
Don't pay any attention
to the crazy girl's talk.

388
00:35:21,926 --> 00:35:25,134
Not her. I'm talking about this.

389
00:35:28,051 --> 00:35:29,777
Family Tragedy Linked To Wild Mushrooms

390
00:35:29,801 --> 00:35:31,934
"Murdered by... wild mushrooms"?

391
00:35:32,926 --> 00:35:35,726
What did the dermatologist say? Mushrooms?

392
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:39,926
He wasn't sure,
so he referred Heung-guk to the hospital.

393
00:35:39,967 --> 00:35:43,426
Told you. It can't be the mushrooms.

394
00:35:44,551 --> 00:35:46,151
It's not impossible.

395
00:35:46,634 --> 00:35:48,009
Shut your hole.

396
00:35:52,592 --> 00:35:56,259
You know that story Byeong-gyu told you?

397
00:35:56,884 --> 00:35:58,426
There are so many.

398
00:35:58,467 --> 00:36:01,652
The one about the naked man
eating the deer carcass.

399
00:36:01,676 --> 00:36:03,356
What's gotten into you?

400
00:36:03,884 --> 00:36:06,176
At a crazy time like this?

401
00:36:06,217 --> 00:36:08,467
It's because things are so crazy.

402
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:12,801
You know the guy who saw it, right?

403
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:18,509
"Herbs & Tonics"

404
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:19,717
Over here.

405
00:36:22,967 --> 00:36:24,801
You may not believe it,

406
00:36:25,801 --> 00:36:28,634
but I saw it with my own eyes.

407
00:36:30,092 --> 00:36:31,551
Look at this.

408
00:36:31,676 --> 00:36:32,884
Can you see it?

409
00:36:34,217 --> 00:36:35,676
Sure.

410
00:36:36,092 --> 00:36:38,551
I got 22 stitches.

411
00:36:39,467 --> 00:36:42,801
From falling on your head
while you were drunk?

412
00:36:43,426 --> 00:36:45,676
What are you talking about?

413
00:36:45,717 --> 00:36:49,176
I'm too old to make shit up.

414
00:36:49,926 --> 00:36:51,426
You got proof?

415
00:36:51,467 --> 00:36:52,634
Proof?

416
00:36:52,676 --> 00:36:54,301
Hell yes, proof!

417
00:36:54,676 --> 00:36:57,940
I'm not the kind to talk
shit without backing it up.

418
00:37:01,176 --> 00:37:03,092
Come look at this.

419
00:37:03,509 --> 00:37:05,759
You ready?

420
00:37:06,759 --> 00:37:07,759
Look.

421
00:37:11,426 --> 00:37:12,842
You see?

422
00:37:12,884 --> 00:37:14,134
Empty, right?

423
00:37:14,717 --> 00:37:18,301
I stayed the hell away from
the mountains since that day.

424
00:37:19,051 --> 00:37:21,676
Even put the store up for sale.

425
00:37:21,717 --> 00:37:23,301
How is that proof?

426
00:37:24,967 --> 00:37:26,051
What?

427
00:37:27,092 --> 00:37:28,926
Damn you...

428
00:37:29,509 --> 00:37:31,217
That's not the point.

429
00:37:32,176 --> 00:37:34,717
The point is, when I opened my eyes,

430
00:37:35,551 --> 00:37:40,134
there he was-stark naked
except for a diaper.

431
00:37:40,176 --> 00:37:41,152
A diaper?

432
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,426
That's right.

433
00:37:42,467 --> 00:37:43,360
A grown man?

434
00:37:43,384 --> 00:37:44,360
I'm telling you.

435
00:37:44,384 --> 00:37:47,193
- Grown men can wear diapers.
- Get outta here.

436
00:37:47,217 --> 00:37:50,193
Bladder control problems
are surprisingly common in adults.

437
00:37:50,217 --> 00:37:53,259
But why go into the woods
to treat incontinence?

438
00:37:53,509 --> 00:37:57,717
- Incontinence...
- Am I talking to myself here?

439
00:37:59,259 --> 00:38:00,634
Anyway,

440
00:38:00,676 --> 00:38:03,467
he had his face buried in the carcass,

441
00:38:03,509 --> 00:38:06,301
his body covered in blood...

442
00:38:06,342 --> 00:38:08,509
his eyes all bloodshot.

443
00:38:08,551 --> 00:38:12,259
Then he looked up,

444
00:38:13,259 --> 00:38:15,384
and all of a sudden...

445
00:38:19,551 --> 00:38:22,676
I haven't slept since that day.

446
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:26,384
- He was chewing on the guts?
- That's right.

447
00:38:26,592 --> 00:38:30,217
- You saw him eating raw flesh?
- Yeah...

448
00:38:30,259 --> 00:38:33,092
Wait, look here.

449
00:38:34,051 --> 00:38:36,634
See where the skin's broken?

450
00:38:38,384 --> 00:38:41,384
Bastard even bit me.

451
00:38:41,592 --> 00:38:43,467
Where does the guy live?

452
00:38:43,634 --> 00:38:44,860
Why, you gonna go there?

453
00:38:44,884 --> 00:38:46,193
I think I should.

454
00:38:46,217 --> 00:38:48,217
Don't. You'll regret it.

455
00:38:49,926 --> 00:38:52,217
It's just a suspicion, but...

456
00:38:53,176 --> 00:38:56,717
You know how the villagers have been
dying out recently?

457
00:38:56,759 --> 00:38:58,959
He's got something to do with it.

458
00:39:00,551 --> 00:39:02,217
He's not human.

459
00:39:03,634 --> 00:39:05,634
Give me his address.

460
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,693
It's out in the middle of nowhere.

461
00:39:07,717 --> 00:39:10,134
You've gotta have a general idea.

462
00:39:10,176 --> 00:39:13,134
It's hard to explain in words.

463
00:39:13,176 --> 00:39:15,551
It's deep in the valley somewhere.

464
00:39:39,926 --> 00:39:41,606
How much further is it?

465
00:39:42,176 --> 00:39:43,696
Still a ways ahead.

466
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:15,559
Shit!

467
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:23,999
What's the matter?

468
00:40:25,142 --> 00:40:26,184
It's there.

469
00:40:27,059 --> 00:40:28,642
Over there.

470
00:40:28,684 --> 00:40:30,284
I don't see a house.

471
00:40:30,392 --> 00:40:31,642
Look.

472
00:40:32,517 --> 00:40:33,877
Right over there.

473
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:37,739
Whoa, isn't that a deer?

474
00:40:39,267 --> 00:40:41,334
So, you weren't making this up.

475
00:40:41,892 --> 00:40:45,017
What did I tell you, dammit?

476
00:40:47,392 --> 00:40:49,035
What in God's name...

477
00:40:49,059 --> 00:40:50,476
What's happening?

478
00:40:53,934 --> 00:40:55,226
Look.

479
00:40:55,267 --> 00:40:56,517
You know...

480
00:40:59,017 --> 00:41:00,559
What's going on?

481
00:41:04,101 --> 00:41:05,781
That should do it, right?

482
00:41:06,017 --> 00:41:09,017
What? You gotta show us the house.

483
00:41:09,059 --> 00:41:11,684
It's just over that hill.

484
00:41:11,726 --> 00:41:13,559
It's just the one house.

485
00:41:13,601 --> 00:41:15,041
You can't miss it.

486
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:19,017
You came all the way here.
You should see it through.

487
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,976
Don't touch me, I gotta go!

488
00:41:21,017 --> 00:41:24,267
Where do you think you're going?

489
00:41:24,309 --> 00:41:25,934
I said let go!

490
00:41:31,726 --> 00:41:32,934
Shit...

491
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:37,809
Hey!

492
00:41:38,142 --> 00:41:39,476
Mister.

493
00:41:39,517 --> 00:41:40,684
Mister?

494
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:43,868
Mister?

495
00:41:43,892 --> 00:41:45,267
You all right?

496
00:41:49,601 --> 00:41:51,392
You fucking bastards.

497
00:41:52,934 --> 00:41:54,476
We're sorry.

498
00:41:54,517 --> 00:41:56,351
Fuck off.

499
00:41:57,392 --> 00:42:02,934
I'm gonna get your asses sacked.
You just wait.

500
00:42:03,642 --> 00:42:05,434
We're real sorry, okay?

501
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:06,851
Fuck you.

502
00:42:07,642 --> 00:42:10,375
You deserve to get scorched by lightning.

503
00:42:34,851 --> 00:42:36,451
Where are you going?

504
00:42:37,309 --> 00:42:38,989
You got hit by lightning.

505
00:42:39,476 --> 00:42:41,017
Hey!

506
00:42:55,726 --> 00:42:57,160
What's the point of taking

507
00:42:57,184 --> 00:42:59,142
all those health tonics-

508
00:43:01,809 --> 00:43:04,267
if it's lightning that kills you?

509
00:43:08,017 --> 00:43:11,684
How can something like this happen?

510
00:43:15,601 --> 00:43:19,309
What are the chances?

511
00:43:21,934 --> 00:43:27,101
But they'll say, thanks
to all those tonics,

512
00:43:27,767 --> 00:43:29,392
he survived.

513
00:43:33,726 --> 00:43:35,726
Nurse! Nurse!

514
00:43:35,767 --> 00:43:37,601
It's Park Heung-guk in 302!

515
00:43:37,642 --> 00:43:40,309
You gotta come now. It's Park Heung-guk!

516
00:43:47,184 --> 00:43:48,726
It's an emergency!

517
00:44:02,767 --> 00:44:03,851
Doctor!

518
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:23,339
What's going on?

519
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:19,039
Can anybody make sense

520
00:45:21,026 --> 00:45:22,942
of what's happening here?

521
00:45:32,401 --> 00:45:35,201
Let's go back to the Jap's house tomorrow.

522
00:45:39,817 --> 00:45:42,817
There's definitely
something going on there.

523
00:46:20,734 --> 00:46:21,776
Hyo-jin?

524
00:46:23,484 --> 00:46:24,567
Hyo-jin.

525
00:46:26,401 --> 00:46:27,484
Baby!

526
00:46:27,692 --> 00:46:28,627
Daddy's right here.

527
00:46:28,651 --> 00:46:30,651
Daddy's right here, sweetie.

528
00:46:30,692 --> 00:46:32,984
Look at Daddy.

529
00:46:33,401 --> 00:46:34,651
Look at Daddy.

530
00:46:34,692 --> 00:46:35,859
Hyo-jin!

531
00:46:35,901 --> 00:46:37,651
Look at me.

532
00:46:38,109 --> 00:46:39,151
Hyo-jin!

533
00:46:39,651 --> 00:46:40,776
Look at me.

534
00:46:41,484 --> 00:46:42,692
Look at Daddy.

535
00:46:44,567 --> 00:46:45,502
Daddy's here.

536
00:46:45,526 --> 00:46:47,192
Dad...

537
00:46:51,984 --> 00:46:56,817
- I'm right here.
- Do something, Daddy!

538
00:46:57,942 --> 00:47:00,567
What, sweetie?

539
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:05,067
Someone keeps banging on the door,

540
00:47:05,109 --> 00:47:08,067
trying to get in.

541
00:47:08,984 --> 00:47:10,192
Who?

542
00:47:10,609 --> 00:47:15,109
A strange man. He's trying to get in.

543
00:47:20,609 --> 00:47:22,359
It's okay, it's okay...

544
00:47:44,359 --> 00:47:45,484
Hyo-jin.

545
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:51,734
Hyo-jin?

546
00:47:55,901 --> 00:47:57,067
What is this?

547
00:48:00,026 --> 00:48:01,386
You're all right?

548
00:48:03,651 --> 00:48:05,359
Morning, Dad.

549
00:48:14,859 --> 00:48:18,234
But she never eats fish...

550
00:48:18,276 --> 00:48:20,076
Something's wrong with her.

551
00:48:20,859 --> 00:48:24,484
I heard you and Hyo-jin last night.

552
00:48:25,817 --> 00:48:30,151
I asked the old lady next door
to recommend a good shaman.

553
00:48:30,609 --> 00:48:33,567
I'm gonna consult with
him, just so you know.

554
00:48:34,484 --> 00:48:35,609
Got that?

555
00:48:39,692 --> 00:48:41,817
Okay.

556
00:48:42,526 --> 00:48:43,776
Good.

557
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:07,276
Hey.

558
00:49:09,317 --> 00:49:10,442
Say hello.

559
00:49:10,484 --> 00:49:11,924
This is my nephew.

560
00:49:16,192 --> 00:49:17,293
What, a priest?

561
00:49:17,317 --> 00:49:21,026
Not yet, he's in training. A deacon.

562
00:49:22,401 --> 00:49:25,859
We'll need a translator to talk to the man.

563
00:49:29,817 --> 00:49:31,337
You speak Japanese?

564
00:49:31,817 --> 00:49:33,151
Just a little.

565
00:49:33,192 --> 00:49:35,585
He lived in Japan when he was young.

566
00:49:35,609 --> 00:49:37,210
What's that on your neck?

567
00:49:37,234 --> 00:49:38,317
Nothing.

568
00:49:38,901 --> 00:49:41,401
You've gotta be kidding me.

569
00:49:43,317 --> 00:49:44,960
What's your name, son?

570
00:49:44,984 --> 00:49:47,067
Yang E-sam. Two-three

571
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,543
Is that your real name?

572
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,692
Yes, sir.

573
00:49:51,151 --> 00:49:52,002
Let's go.

574
00:49:52,026 --> 00:49:53,234
Get in.

575
00:50:32,026 --> 00:50:35,067
Anybody home?

576
00:50:53,651 --> 00:50:54,692
What is it?

577
00:51:16,484 --> 00:51:18,401
Goddamn perv.

578
00:51:25,317 --> 00:51:27,384
Look at this. What does it say?

579
00:51:29,692 --> 00:51:32,276
Uncle, this is illegal.

580
00:51:32,817 --> 00:51:33,627
I know.

581
00:51:33,651 --> 00:51:36,484
Then why... We should stop.

582
00:51:36,567 --> 00:51:37,835
If you won't help, wait outside.

583
00:51:37,859 --> 00:51:38,543
But Uncle!

584
00:51:38,567 --> 00:51:40,247
Okay, you wait outside.

585
00:51:55,442 --> 00:51:57,817
What are you staring at?

586
00:52:00,526 --> 00:52:02,234
Go keep a lookout.

587
00:52:46,192 --> 00:52:47,734
What the fuck?

588
00:53:26,901 --> 00:53:29,901
- Son of a bitch!
- Get over here!

589
00:53:29,942 --> 00:53:31,859
Get him off me!

590
00:54:01,692 --> 00:54:04,636
What were you doing poking
around the doghouse?

591
00:54:26,526 --> 00:54:28,734
Block the door!

592
00:54:28,942 --> 00:54:30,942
Get over here!

593
00:54:32,984 --> 00:54:34,567
Shit!

594
00:54:34,692 --> 00:54:36,609
Seong-bok, you bastard!

595
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:40,859
Fucking bastard!

596
00:54:44,484 --> 00:54:45,526
Where is it?

597
00:54:46,151 --> 00:54:47,431
Where did it go?

598
00:54:48,067 --> 00:54:49,109
Over there.

599
00:54:54,567 --> 00:54:55,692
Seong-bok.

600
00:54:56,817 --> 00:54:58,497
I think it's the owner.

601
00:55:06,567 --> 00:55:07,692
Seong-bok?

602
00:56:13,651 --> 00:56:15,026
Excuse me.

603
00:56:29,776 --> 00:56:31,043
Are you all right?

604
00:56:31,067 --> 00:56:32,067
Yeah.

605
00:56:33,151 --> 00:56:34,877
What's the matter with you?

606
00:56:34,901 --> 00:56:36,181
Did you get bit?

607
00:56:36,484 --> 00:56:37,484
Huh?

608
00:56:40,692 --> 00:56:43,026
Say something, dammit.

609
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,526
He's the criminal.

610
00:56:46,901 --> 00:56:48,581
You're scaring me, man.

611
00:56:49,859 --> 00:56:51,059
Snap out of it.

612
00:56:51,984 --> 00:56:54,184
It wasn't just one or two people.

613
00:56:54,484 --> 00:56:57,293
He took pictures of them
when they were alive-

614
00:56:57,317 --> 00:57:01,734
and then went back for more
when they went crazy and died.

615
00:57:01,776 --> 00:57:04,526
What the hell are you going on about?

616
00:57:06,901 --> 00:57:08,293
He's the criminal.

617
00:57:08,317 --> 00:57:11,692
That's enough. I'll deal with you later.

618
00:57:11,734 --> 00:57:12,984
I'm sure of it.

619
00:57:14,192 --> 00:57:15,609
He...

620
00:57:17,692 --> 00:57:19,817
He took his victims' belongings

621
00:57:21,692 --> 00:57:23,567
and did something with them.

622
00:57:26,817 --> 00:57:28,526
What did you see?

623
00:57:32,901 --> 00:57:34,567
Tell me!

624
00:57:39,526 --> 00:57:42,359
Jeon Hyo-jin

625
00:57:51,109 --> 00:57:52,859
You're getting all wet!

626
00:57:52,901 --> 00:57:53,918
Where is Hyo-jin?

627
00:57:53,942 --> 00:57:55,462
In the living room.

628
00:58:02,859 --> 00:58:03,984
Hyo-jin.

629
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:08,901
You're home early.

630
00:58:08,942 --> 00:58:10,675
Did you lose your trainer?

631
00:58:11,401 --> 00:58:13,692
No, why?

632
00:58:23,234 --> 00:58:24,674
What's this, then?

633
00:58:26,401 --> 00:58:27,609
It's not mine.

634
00:58:28,026 --> 00:58:29,893
Isn't this your handwriting?

635
00:58:30,359 --> 00:58:32,039
I said, it's not mine.

636
00:58:36,526 --> 00:58:40,734
You know anything about
a Japanese man living in the village?

637
00:58:44,942 --> 00:58:47,502
You're dripping water all over the place.

638
00:58:47,526 --> 00:58:50,609
Answer me. Do you know him or not?

639
00:58:55,026 --> 00:58:56,734
Did you meet him?

640
00:59:00,234 --> 00:59:01,567
Answer me.

641
00:59:02,609 --> 00:59:04,484
You're scaring her.

642
00:59:04,526 --> 00:59:05,966
Get out for a sec.

643
00:59:07,276 --> 00:59:10,109
Come on, this is serious. It's you and me.

644
00:59:17,859 --> 00:59:21,026
Daddy is a policeman. I'll know if you lie.

645
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:24,859
Did you meet this man?

646
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:32,942
Tell me.

647
00:59:35,317 --> 00:59:36,418
Tell you what?

648
00:59:36,442 --> 00:59:37,859
Everything.

649
00:59:37,901 --> 00:59:40,276
Where you met, what you did.

650
00:59:41,484 --> 00:59:43,127
Why should I tell you?

651
00:59:43,151 --> 00:59:44,710
Because it's important.

652
00:59:44,734 --> 00:59:46,334
What's so important?

653
00:59:47,317 --> 00:59:48,597
Answer me, girl!

654
00:59:52,401 --> 00:59:54,268
I said, what's so important?

655
00:59:57,151 --> 01:00:00,984
What's so damn important?

656
01:00:01,651 --> 01:00:03,401
What the hell...

657
01:00:03,442 --> 01:00:05,651
is so damned important?

658
01:00:09,567 --> 01:00:12,034
You don't even know what's important.

659
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:15,151
Stop grilling me, goddamn it!

660
01:01:00,567 --> 01:01:02,859
Fuck!

661
01:01:53,567 --> 01:01:55,151
What are you doing?

662
01:01:57,526 --> 01:02:00,442
I thought you were sleeping.

663
01:02:00,484 --> 01:02:01,692
What the hell?

664
01:02:05,901 --> 01:02:09,677
Yanking up your daughter's skirt
in the middle of the night?

665
01:02:16,901 --> 01:02:18,317
Speak, will you?

666
01:02:21,151 --> 01:02:23,692
Tell me, asshole!

667
01:02:25,442 --> 01:02:28,276
Tell me, you fucking shithead!

668
01:02:28,651 --> 01:02:30,192
Fuck you!

669
01:02:35,192 --> 01:02:37,609
Stop staring, motherfucker!

670
01:02:37,651 --> 01:02:39,901
Don't call your daddy that!

671
01:02:42,734 --> 01:02:44,414
Don't you look at me!

672
01:02:44,567 --> 01:02:47,484
Stop it! Daddy said he was sorry.

673
01:02:47,567 --> 01:02:49,692
I'm gonna kill all of you.

674
01:02:50,817 --> 01:02:52,026
How could you?

675
01:03:08,526 --> 01:03:10,442
I met the shaman today.

676
01:03:12,067 --> 01:03:14,734
He thinks there's a spirit in the house.

677
01:03:14,817 --> 01:03:17,151
Something's possessed Hyo-jin.

678
01:03:18,651 --> 01:03:21,551
And if we don't act,
there'll be dead bodies.

679
01:03:22,234 --> 01:03:24,317
He's supposed to be the best.

680
01:03:37,401 --> 01:03:39,468
Why didn't you answer my calls?

681
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:43,884
Come with me, and don't give me any crap.

682
01:04:58,901 --> 01:05:01,793
Ask him where he stashed
the stuff from in there.

683
01:05:01,817 --> 01:05:05,484
The things in there... where are they now?

684
01:05:10,942 --> 01:05:12,234
What things?

685
01:05:13,442 --> 01:05:15,042
He asks what things.

686
01:05:15,234 --> 01:05:17,192
The stuff we saw before.

687
01:05:17,234 --> 01:05:21,192
Things we saw... before.

688
01:05:21,234 --> 01:05:22,526
The photographs?

689
01:05:23,317 --> 01:05:24,335
You mean the pictures?

690
01:05:24,359 --> 01:05:26,418
Yeah, the pictures. And the other stuff.

691
01:05:26,442 --> 01:05:27,442
Yes.

692
01:05:31,484 --> 01:05:32,859
I burned them.

693
01:05:32,901 --> 01:05:33,984
Sorry?

694
01:05:36,151 --> 01:05:37,651
I burned them.

695
01:05:40,276 --> 01:05:42,067
He burned them.

696
01:05:44,192 --> 01:05:45,276
Where?

697
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:48,026
Where?

698
01:05:49,859 --> 01:05:52,650
In the kitchen.

699
01:06:09,692 --> 01:06:11,192
Bastard!

700
01:06:13,609 --> 01:06:14,651
You!

701
01:06:16,984 --> 01:06:18,917
What did you come here to do?

702
01:06:21,526 --> 01:06:24,234
What did you come here to do?

703
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:28,942
Ask him again.

704
01:06:31,192 --> 01:06:33,817
What did you come here to do?

705
01:06:39,734 --> 01:06:40,859
To travel.

706
01:06:41,901 --> 01:06:43,421
To travel, he says.

707
01:06:44,067 --> 01:06:47,734
Tell him I'll throw him in jail
if he doesn't fess up.

708
01:06:50,692 --> 01:06:53,067
Tell us the truth.

709
01:07:01,067 --> 01:07:02,002
Even if I told you,

710
01:07:02,026 --> 01:07:03,706
you wouldn't believe me.

711
01:07:03,901 --> 01:07:07,401
He says you wouldn't believe him.

712
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:11,877
Look, you translate everything I say,

713
01:07:11,901 --> 01:07:13,701
- word for word.
- Yes, sir.

714
01:07:13,817 --> 01:07:15,257
You fucking prick!

715
01:07:15,317 --> 01:07:16,127
Oh...

716
01:07:16,151 --> 01:07:19,026
You loose-assed, dog-fucking
son of a whore!

717
01:07:19,067 --> 01:07:20,317
So, uh...

718
01:07:20,359 --> 01:07:23,418
What kind of tourist hangs pictures
of dead people on his wall?

719
01:07:23,442 --> 01:07:25,776
Travel... the dead...

720
01:07:25,817 --> 01:07:27,293
Why was this in your house?

721
01:07:27,317 --> 01:07:28,651
How did this...?

722
01:07:28,692 --> 01:07:30,859
Who the fuck are you?

723
01:07:30,901 --> 01:07:32,692
Who are you?

724
01:07:33,817 --> 01:07:36,550
I know what you're doing in this village.

725
01:07:36,651 --> 01:07:38,484
I saw that room.

726
01:07:38,526 --> 01:07:43,359
And I know what the fuck
you're doing to my daughter!

727
01:07:47,109 --> 01:07:48,401
I want you...

728
01:07:49,276 --> 01:07:53,484
to stop what you're doing,
and leave this village quietly.

729
01:07:54,109 --> 01:07:55,109
I mean it.

730
01:07:55,734 --> 01:07:57,067
Leave.

731
01:07:57,817 --> 01:07:59,192
Quietly.

732
01:07:59,234 --> 01:08:01,817
This is Gokseong. My turf.

733
01:08:02,651 --> 01:08:04,401
Don't mess around

734
01:08:04,442 --> 01:08:07,567
and get yourself killed. Just leave.

735
01:08:07,609 --> 01:08:10,776
If you don't leave, you'll die.

736
01:08:13,901 --> 01:08:18,442
If you heard me, say something.
Or at least nod your fucking head!

737
01:08:18,484 --> 01:08:20,317
Please answer.

738
01:08:26,984 --> 01:08:29,609
So, you're...

739
01:08:29,651 --> 01:08:32,026
Shut up, bitch!

740
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:35,067
You're blowing me off?

741
01:08:35,109 --> 01:08:37,309
Oh, I'm just not worth answering.

742
01:08:39,442 --> 01:08:40,859
Is that it?

743
01:08:43,401 --> 01:08:46,651
You're not even gonna listen, right?

744
01:08:47,234 --> 01:08:48,594
Ain't that right?

745
01:08:49,109 --> 01:08:51,317
I'm trying to speak to you,

746
01:08:51,901 --> 01:08:53,581
but you're not listening!

747
01:08:55,484 --> 01:08:56,651
What's this?

748
01:08:56,692 --> 01:08:58,372
What the fuck is this?

749
01:08:59,026 --> 01:09:01,067
What the hell is all this?

750
01:09:02,359 --> 01:09:03,526
What the...

751
01:09:04,734 --> 01:09:08,317
What the fuck are these
rituals you're doing?!

752
01:09:10,484 --> 01:09:13,084
What the fuck are you doing in my town!

753
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:17,942
Do you know whose daughter
you're messing with?

754
01:09:17,984 --> 01:09:19,317
Son of a bitch!

755
01:09:20,276 --> 01:09:21,442
Look out!

756
01:10:00,369 --> 01:10:01,577
Jong-gu?

757
01:10:27,186 --> 01:10:28,352
Now what?

758
01:10:32,769 --> 01:10:34,502
Starting to see the light?

759
01:10:37,852 --> 01:10:39,532
I'll give you three days.

760
01:10:40,227 --> 01:10:44,977
Get out, or you'll end up
like your goddamned dog.

761
01:10:46,269 --> 01:10:47,852
Translate.

762
01:10:49,852 --> 01:10:51,811
Translate what I said.

763
01:11:17,227 --> 01:11:19,294
How long has it been like this?

764
01:11:20,311 --> 01:11:22,144
Just a few days.

765
01:12:03,644 --> 01:12:04,936
So?

766
01:12:05,727 --> 01:12:07,269
The symptoms-

767
01:12:07,311 --> 01:12:09,444
they're the same as the others'.

768
01:12:10,311 --> 01:12:14,144
There's gotta be an explanation
for what she has.

769
01:12:14,936 --> 01:12:16,616
They say they don't know.

770
01:12:43,186 --> 01:12:44,078
What is it?

771
01:12:44,102 --> 01:12:45,269
Oh God!

772
01:12:52,311 --> 01:12:53,991
Who the fuck did this?

773
01:12:57,561 --> 01:12:58,894
What?!

774
01:12:58,977 --> 01:13:00,061
You okay?

775
01:13:00,102 --> 01:13:02,852
Get your husband.

776
01:13:03,436 --> 01:13:04,936
Who did this?

777
01:13:05,602 --> 01:13:07,561
Who the fuck did this?

778
01:13:07,776 --> 01:13:09,234
Jong-gu!

779
01:13:13,069 --> 01:13:14,319
Jong-gu!

780
01:13:14,402 --> 01:13:16,736
What's the matter!

781
01:13:24,944 --> 01:13:26,544
Does he drink a lot?

782
01:13:27,986 --> 01:13:29,853
It's nothing to worry about.

783
01:13:30,986 --> 01:13:33,653
I'll take the needles out in 20 minutes.

784
01:13:34,194 --> 01:13:37,611
Cut back on the drinking.

785
01:13:39,319 --> 01:13:40,902
Yeah.

786
01:13:44,611 --> 01:13:48,902
It's started. You better brace yourself.

787
01:13:51,444 --> 01:13:54,944
What I said the other
day-we'll do it tomorrow.

788
01:13:56,152 --> 01:13:57,777
Where is Hyo-jin?

789
01:13:57,819 --> 01:14:01,527
You can't back out now.
Get the money for the ritual.

790
01:14:01,569 --> 01:14:03,194
Where is she?

791
01:14:03,236 --> 01:14:05,170
At home. Where else would she be?

792
01:14:05,194 --> 01:14:07,337
I asked the old lady
next door to watch her.

793
01:14:07,361 --> 01:14:09,694
You left her alone with a stranger?

794
01:14:10,652 --> 01:14:12,385
Are you out of your minds?

795
01:14:12,611 --> 01:14:13,986
Don't move.

796
01:14:18,277 --> 01:14:20,944
Hyo-jin.

797
01:14:21,652 --> 01:14:25,111
Baby.

798
01:14:33,277 --> 01:14:35,819
- What's the matter?
- Oh my God!

799
01:14:37,694 --> 01:14:38,736
Hyo-jin!

800
01:14:39,277 --> 01:14:40,444
Hyo-jin!

801
01:14:40,736 --> 01:14:42,319
Hyo-jin!

802
01:14:42,486 --> 01:14:44,652
Drop that, baby.

803
01:14:46,236 --> 01:14:48,819
Don't cry. It's okay.

804
01:14:49,486 --> 01:14:50,694
It's okay.

805
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:51,944
It'll be okay.

806
01:14:56,111 --> 01:14:57,569
Quick! Call 911!

807
01:15:25,444 --> 01:15:27,736
This is all the work of that Jap.

808
01:15:29,986 --> 01:15:32,119
Ever since we went to his house,

809
01:15:32,652 --> 01:15:34,402
my body's been in pain.

810
01:15:35,319 --> 01:15:37,694
I'm burning up. I'm seeing things.

811
01:15:39,861 --> 01:15:42,652
A man's face comes out of the wall.

812
01:15:44,361 --> 01:15:46,069
I don't think he's alive.

813
01:15:50,069 --> 01:15:51,749
We've gotta do something,

814
01:15:53,152 --> 01:15:57,527
or that bastard will get us first.

815
01:17:00,361 --> 01:17:02,569
Shut the damn door!

816
01:17:57,111 --> 01:17:58,631
What's in that jar?

817
01:17:59,361 --> 01:18:01,027
Which one?

818
01:18:01,361 --> 01:18:03,361
The one with the red lid.

819
01:18:03,486 --> 01:18:05,736
It's just soy sauce.

820
01:18:07,736 --> 01:18:10,486
Bring it over.

821
01:18:12,819 --> 01:18:14,986
What, are you deaf?

822
01:18:22,986 --> 01:18:25,569
Out of the way, come on.

823
01:18:28,986 --> 01:18:30,111
Stand back.

824
01:18:42,569 --> 01:18:43,819
What is that?

825
01:18:44,486 --> 01:18:46,611
I'll be fucked...

826
01:18:49,861 --> 01:18:52,777
It's a real wicked spirit we've got here.

827
01:19:17,611 --> 01:19:20,902
You don't want to leave, do you?

828
01:19:36,486 --> 01:19:37,736
Let's go!

829
01:19:59,111 --> 01:20:00,152
Stop it!

830
01:20:33,444 --> 01:20:34,611
Hyo-jin!

831
01:20:42,069 --> 01:20:43,819
Come here, you!

832
01:21:07,284 --> 01:21:08,760
You met up with something recently

833
01:21:08,784 --> 01:21:10,909
you weren't supposed to?

834
01:21:16,846 --> 01:21:19,346
I don't follow you.

835
01:21:23,112 --> 01:21:25,612
Did you disturb someone?

836
01:21:29,154 --> 01:21:34,696
Of all the evil I've seen,
this is the strongest.

837
01:21:35,946 --> 01:21:37,862
You disturbed it.

838
01:21:38,279 --> 01:21:41,321
Oh, God! What do we do now?

839
01:21:42,237 --> 01:21:43,404
Who is it?

840
01:21:47,571 --> 01:21:49,404
Who did you disturb?

841
01:21:49,446 --> 01:21:51,154
Tell him.

842
01:21:58,321 --> 01:22:00,154
A Japanese man...

843
01:22:05,987 --> 01:22:07,612
I knew it.

844
01:22:09,071 --> 01:22:12,571
That's no man.

845
01:22:14,487 --> 01:22:16,487
That's a ghost.

846
01:22:38,696 --> 01:22:43,321
All the things happening
around here are his doing.

847
01:22:46,696 --> 01:22:50,362
If nothing is done, it's
not just your daughter,

848
01:22:51,029 --> 01:22:55,404
but everything that walks
on two feet will perish.

849
01:23:01,946 --> 01:23:03,362
Sir!

850
01:23:03,404 --> 01:23:06,696
This is Park Chun-bae. He owns this house.

851
01:23:09,196 --> 01:23:11,029
He killed his wife, too?

852
01:23:11,237 --> 01:23:12,487
It appears so.

853
01:23:12,529 --> 01:23:14,696
What's that bastard's name?

854
01:23:14,737 --> 01:23:16,612
Park Chun-bae.

855
01:23:18,987 --> 01:23:19,963
Then what?

856
01:23:19,987 --> 01:23:23,654
What do you mean, what?
Gotta get rid of it.

857
01:23:25,779 --> 01:23:28,779
Either banish it, or kill it.

858
01:23:40,321 --> 01:23:43,987
I'm casting a deadly hex tomorrow
at the hour of the dog.

859
01:23:47,779 --> 01:23:48,779
Yes, sir.

860
01:23:49,362 --> 01:23:50,802
You got the money?

861
01:23:51,362 --> 01:23:52,737
How much?

862
01:23:52,779 --> 01:23:54,912
About 10 grand, don't you think?

863
01:23:57,779 --> 01:23:59,446
I'll have it ready.

864
01:24:00,362 --> 01:24:01,779
Good.

865
01:24:08,237 --> 01:24:09,529
Listen.

866
01:24:10,196 --> 01:24:12,237
What I'm doing tomorrow-

867
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:15,376
it's no ordinary ritual.

868
01:24:15,904 --> 01:24:17,904
I'll be casting a death hex.

869
01:24:18,862 --> 01:24:20,946
It's incredibly dangerous.

870
01:24:21,529 --> 01:24:24,429
So you can't do anything
that would taint it.

871
01:24:25,779 --> 01:24:30,487
No intercourse. Watch
what you eat and drink.

872
01:24:32,696 --> 01:24:34,496
Or the spell will backfire.

873
01:24:35,446 --> 01:24:36,446
Yes, sir.

874
01:24:37,654 --> 01:24:40,487
Okay then. You can go.

875
01:24:49,404 --> 01:24:52,904
Can I ask you something?

876
01:24:54,362 --> 01:24:55,487
What?

877
01:24:57,612 --> 01:24:59,112
That Japanese guy.

878
01:25:00,404 --> 01:25:03,196
You said he's a ghost.

879
01:25:03,987 --> 01:25:05,154
So?

880
01:25:05,196 --> 01:25:09,696
I don't get how a living
person can be a ghost.

881
01:25:15,362 --> 01:25:17,112
It's not a living human.

882
01:25:24,237 --> 01:25:26,404
He died a long time ago.

883
01:25:28,571 --> 01:25:30,987
He must have been human once.

884
01:25:32,071 --> 01:25:33,654
But not anymore.

885
01:25:37,529 --> 01:25:38,654
So then,

886
01:25:39,696 --> 01:25:43,071
the ghost got inside him?

887
01:25:43,112 --> 01:25:45,237
Well, that's how it started.

888
01:25:50,654 --> 01:25:54,696
Not everything that moves,
breathes, and talks is alive.

889
01:25:56,154 --> 01:26:00,378
Countless people have perished
because they didn't understand that.

890
01:26:01,862 --> 01:26:03,542
If it's not stopped...

891
01:26:04,612 --> 01:26:09,821
that demon will destroy this village.

892
01:26:09,862 --> 01:26:10,946
Demon?

893
01:26:11,654 --> 01:26:13,529
An evil ghost!

894
01:26:13,904 --> 01:26:17,404
Even among other demons,
he's a master of evil.

895
01:26:24,321 --> 01:26:25,521
If that's true,

896
01:26:26,071 --> 01:26:29,612
why did it have to be...

897
01:26:29,654 --> 01:26:31,071
your daughter?

898
01:26:31,737 --> 01:26:34,470
What sin did that young girl ever commit?

899
01:26:35,196 --> 01:26:36,237
Yes.

900
01:26:37,946 --> 01:26:43,321
If you go fishing, do you
know what you'll catch?

901
01:26:44,279 --> 01:26:45,446
No.

902
01:26:47,321 --> 01:26:49,487
He's just fishing.

903
01:26:50,737 --> 01:26:54,154
Not even he knows what he'll catch.

904
01:26:55,112 --> 01:27:01,821
He just threw out the bait,
and your daughter took it.

905
01:27:04,987 --> 01:27:06,427
That's all it was.

906
01:27:15,737 --> 01:27:17,446
Park Chun-bae

907
01:27:36,571 --> 01:27:39,237
- This one?
- No.

908
01:27:41,196 --> 01:27:43,362
Money. Yes, money.

909
01:27:43,654 --> 01:27:46,112
21 dollars more.

910
01:27:46,154 --> 01:27:48,529
- No!
- That's okay.

911
01:27:49,404 --> 01:27:50,946
Oh, come on.

912
01:31:23,154 --> 01:31:24,862
Tell him to stop.

913
01:32:03,696 --> 01:32:05,071
Stop!

914
01:32:06,571 --> 01:32:07,862
Stop!

915
01:32:11,071 --> 01:32:12,862
I said stop!

916
01:32:51,321 --> 01:32:53,445
Jong-gu!

917
01:32:53,862 --> 01:32:54,946
Jong-gu!

918
01:33:02,987 --> 01:33:04,427
What's the matter?

919
01:33:50,737 --> 01:33:51,737
Look at me.

920
01:34:22,612 --> 01:34:23,612
Baby?

921
01:34:25,154 --> 01:34:26,279
Baby?

922
01:35:05,529 --> 01:35:06,737
Hyo-jin!

923
01:35:43,654 --> 01:35:45,404
Please make him stop...

924
01:35:46,779 --> 01:35:48,404
Please...

925
01:35:50,987 --> 01:35:53,196
Please make him stop.

926
01:36:18,154 --> 01:36:19,362
Dad!

927
01:36:23,821 --> 01:36:25,279
Dad...

928
01:36:25,779 --> 01:36:26,672
Hyo-jin.

929
01:36:26,696 --> 01:36:28,376
We shouldn't do this...

930
01:36:35,487 --> 01:36:37,237
Stop, you bastards!

931
01:36:39,112 --> 01:36:40,487
Stop!

932
01:36:40,946 --> 01:36:42,571
Fucking bastards!

933
01:36:44,029 --> 01:36:45,529
Stop right now.

934
01:36:47,612 --> 01:36:48,904
Stop!

935
01:36:49,529 --> 01:36:50,904
Stop.

936
01:36:51,612 --> 01:36:53,737
I said stop!

937
01:36:53,946 --> 01:36:55,112
Stop.

938
01:36:55,196 --> 01:36:57,946
I'm gonna smash your heads in!

939
01:36:58,946 --> 01:37:00,279
Stop, I said.

940
01:37:00,987 --> 01:37:02,196
Get out.

941
01:37:02,862 --> 01:37:04,362
Now!

942
01:38:25,904 --> 01:38:28,862
Everything started on that day?

943
01:38:38,321 --> 01:38:41,071
I'll try speaking to the Father.

944
01:38:44,862 --> 01:38:48,946
What you're telling me is true?

945
01:38:50,071 --> 01:38:51,154
Yes.

946
01:38:57,862 --> 01:39:01,321
And you said the shaman told you this.

947
01:39:02,071 --> 01:39:04,487
From their perspective,

948
01:39:04,987 --> 01:39:08,987
a ghost is the spirit of a dead man.

949
01:39:10,612 --> 01:39:12,904
But that man is alive.

950
01:39:14,571 --> 01:39:17,654
I've heard about this man, too.

951
01:39:18,904 --> 01:39:21,504
Rumor has it he's a renowned professor.

952
01:39:21,987 --> 01:39:24,887
And there are darker,
more disturbing rumors-

953
01:39:25,196 --> 01:39:27,196
Some say he's a Buddhist monk.

954
01:39:27,362 --> 01:39:32,237
But they're just rumors.
How can you believe them?

955
01:39:32,279 --> 01:39:36,321
No, Father. They're definitely not rumors.

956
01:39:37,612 --> 01:39:40,446
You sound terribly sure.

957
01:39:44,029 --> 01:39:46,654
Did you see it with your own eyes?

958
01:39:48,821 --> 01:39:52,862
How can you be sure without
seeing for yourself?

959
01:39:54,779 --> 01:40:00,987
Take her back to the hospital.
Trust the doctor.

960
01:40:02,237 --> 01:40:05,279
There's nothing the Church
can do for you now.

961
01:40:10,946 --> 01:40:13,029
Come with me to the Jap's.

962
01:40:13,821 --> 01:40:15,237
Sorry?

963
01:40:15,279 --> 01:40:17,154
I gotta see for myself

964
01:40:18,321 --> 01:40:20,404
if he's really a ghost or not.

965
01:40:23,696 --> 01:40:25,196
If he is,

966
01:40:27,029 --> 01:40:29,229
then I won't be able to kill him.

967
01:41:05,623 --> 01:41:07,039
Where is he?

968
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:08,265
Is everyone here?

969
01:41:08,289 --> 01:41:09,373
Yeah.

970
01:41:09,414 --> 01:41:11,539
Why'd you call us so early?

971
01:41:11,581 --> 01:41:14,589
Cheol-yeong couldn't come.
His sow is farrowing.

972
01:41:16,331 --> 01:41:18,011
What's with your face?

973
01:41:36,081 --> 01:41:40,039
This ain't a joke?

974
01:41:43,831 --> 01:41:45,511
You're serious, right?

975
01:41:46,498 --> 01:41:47,748
Yeah.

976
01:41:47,789 --> 01:41:50,456
Cross your heart, or your mom's a whore?

977
01:41:50,623 --> 01:41:52,248
You prick!

978
01:41:53,498 --> 01:41:55,248
This is no time for jokes.

979
01:41:55,289 --> 01:41:56,998
What a fucking loser.

980
01:42:07,623 --> 01:42:08,623
Go!

981
01:42:29,248 --> 01:42:30,706
- Nothing?
- No.

982
01:42:30,748 --> 01:42:33,415
Don't just stand around. Check the back.

983
01:43:20,248 --> 01:43:21,373
What's that?

984
01:43:23,039 --> 01:43:24,748
Fucking bastard...

985
01:43:25,831 --> 01:43:28,956
Byeong-gyu! Over here.

986
01:43:29,998 --> 01:43:32,998
Hurry up.

987
01:43:33,123 --> 01:43:34,057
Is that him?

988
01:43:34,081 --> 01:43:35,164
Over there.

989
01:43:35,206 --> 01:43:37,081
Where? Follow me.

990
01:43:37,456 --> 01:43:38,498
Where?

991
01:43:45,623 --> 01:43:46,706
What the...?

992
01:43:47,623 --> 01:43:48,873
Who's that?

993
01:43:51,081 --> 01:43:52,748
What is that thing?

994
01:43:56,373 --> 01:43:57,515
Don't come any closer.

995
01:43:57,539 --> 01:43:58,581
Back off.

996
01:44:16,498 --> 01:44:17,539
Back off.

997
01:44:22,498 --> 01:44:23,706
Stop it.

998
01:44:23,914 --> 01:44:26,414
That's enough, man!

999
01:44:27,998 --> 01:44:31,123
Sorry, man. You all right?

1000
01:44:38,873 --> 01:44:39,956
Stop it!

1001
01:44:40,873 --> 01:44:43,081
What are you doing to him?

1002
01:44:43,164 --> 01:44:44,390
He's not... right...

1003
01:44:44,414 --> 01:44:46,248
Put it down.

1004
01:44:46,289 --> 01:44:48,456
- Let go!
- We can talk this out.

1005
01:44:48,498 --> 01:44:49,498
E-sam!

1006
01:47:08,289 --> 01:47:09,998
Dad...

1007
01:47:10,789 --> 01:47:13,623
Look.

1008
01:47:15,331 --> 01:47:16,931
There's another one!

1009
01:47:31,248 --> 01:47:32,414
That's him.

1010
01:47:32,873 --> 01:47:33,956
That's him!

1011
01:47:34,623 --> 01:47:35,998
Get him!

1012
01:47:39,539 --> 01:47:40,706
Get him!

1013
01:47:40,914 --> 01:47:42,039
Where?

1014
01:47:43,789 --> 01:47:44,890
Son of a bitch!

1015
01:47:44,914 --> 01:47:46,456
There he is.

1016
01:47:47,581 --> 01:47:48,706
Over there.

1017
01:47:51,498 --> 01:47:52,698
Son of a bitch!

1018
01:48:03,373 --> 01:48:04,456
Where is he?

1019
01:48:04,581 --> 01:48:05,664
Over there.

1020
01:48:06,373 --> 01:48:07,498
Where?

1021
01:49:03,789 --> 01:49:04,829
What's wrong?

1022
01:49:06,581 --> 01:49:09,381
- Come over here.
- What? Why did you stop?

1023
01:49:11,039 --> 01:49:12,479
What's the matter?

1024
01:49:13,289 --> 01:49:14,581
Come over here!

1025
01:49:15,873 --> 01:49:16,956
Jong-gu.

1026
01:49:22,206 --> 01:49:23,326
Where'd he go?

1027
01:49:23,373 --> 01:49:25,053
Where is that bastard?

1028
01:49:27,164 --> 01:49:28,373
Hey, man!

1029
01:49:28,414 --> 01:49:30,664
Get down here.

1030
01:49:30,706 --> 01:49:31,724
Do you see him?

1031
01:49:31,748 --> 01:49:32,748
Hey!

1032
01:49:32,956 --> 01:49:34,373
Where did he go?

1033
01:49:36,498 --> 01:49:37,623
Jong-gu!

1034
01:49:41,831 --> 01:49:43,271
I gotta catch him.

1035
01:49:45,331 --> 01:49:47,011
Gotta catch that bastard.

1036
01:49:48,498 --> 01:49:50,018
Catch that bastard.

1037
01:49:53,581 --> 01:49:54,515
I can't believe this...

1038
01:49:54,539 --> 01:49:56,599
- Gotta save my baby.
- Come on.

1039
01:49:56,623 --> 01:49:57,307
Let's go down.

1040
01:49:57,331 --> 01:49:58,682
I gotta save my little girl.

1041
01:49:58,706 --> 01:50:01,057
- We'll get him.
- I've gotta find him, and save my baby.

1042
01:50:01,081 --> 01:50:03,081
- Don't worry, we will.
- Okay?

1043
01:50:04,956 --> 01:50:06,914
Get your act together, man.

1044
01:50:06,998 --> 01:50:10,623
We gotta save her.

1045
01:50:11,081 --> 01:50:12,581
I know, man.

1046
01:50:13,289 --> 01:50:14,539
I know.

1047
01:50:15,123 --> 01:50:18,081
I have to save my daughter...

1048
01:50:18,373 --> 01:50:19,956
Come on, man.

1049
01:50:24,331 --> 01:50:27,539
I have to catch that bastard.

1050
01:50:28,706 --> 01:50:30,498
Don't cry, man.

1051
01:50:31,789 --> 01:50:35,789
Dammit, Jong-gu!

1052
01:52:44,289 --> 01:52:45,969
- Wife
- Please, pick up.

1053
01:53:22,623 --> 01:53:27,123
Shit! Was that a person?

1054
01:56:05,873 --> 01:56:09,039
Wife

1055
01:56:18,289 --> 01:56:24,748
The rat fell into the trap.

1056
01:57:18,706 --> 01:57:20,306
You all right, baby?

1057
01:57:25,998 --> 01:57:27,289
You okay?

1058
01:57:27,498 --> 01:57:29,289
I'm okay.

1059
01:57:31,956 --> 01:57:33,248
Come here.

1060
01:57:45,331 --> 01:57:46,706
You're okay now?

1061
01:57:49,706 --> 01:57:50,998
You're okay now?

1062
01:58:10,956 --> 01:58:12,331
Drink up.

1063
01:58:13,039 --> 01:58:14,373
Good girl.

1064
01:58:44,873 --> 01:58:46,248
Leave it.

1065
01:58:46,956 --> 01:58:48,390
I want to tidy up a little.

1066
01:58:48,414 --> 01:58:52,164
Leave it. We've got the shaman
to thank for everything.

1067
01:58:52,873 --> 01:58:55,414
Get some rest. You must be exhausted.

1068
01:58:59,164 --> 01:59:00,789
Shaman

1069
01:59:08,789 --> 01:59:10,289
Damn fool.

1070
01:59:23,706 --> 01:59:28,498
<i>Suspect arrested in the
mushroom-tonic case...</i>

1071
01:59:34,831 --> 01:59:38,414
<i>Victims have developed
severe mental derangement...</i>

1072
01:59:44,664 --> 01:59:45,998
Mr. Yang E-sam?

1073
01:59:46,039 --> 01:59:47,123
Yes.

1074
01:59:52,873 --> 01:59:54,914
The landlady was a victim.

1075
01:59:57,051 --> 01:59:59,718
Your uncle must've taken the tonic, too.

1076
01:59:59,884 --> 02:00:02,084
It's turned the town upside down.

1077
02:00:03,801 --> 02:00:05,481
We've gotta bring him in.

1078
02:00:05,884 --> 02:00:09,259
You should get a lawyer.

1079
02:00:10,342 --> 02:00:11,717
After all,

1080
02:00:13,217 --> 02:00:14,884
he's a victim, too.

1081
02:00:44,384 --> 02:00:46,467
What the fuck?

1082
02:01:07,759 --> 02:01:09,467
What are you doing here?

1083
02:01:26,592 --> 02:01:27,801
Get out.

1084
02:01:49,551 --> 02:01:51,759
Missed calls - Shaman

1085
02:03:48,717 --> 02:03:50,176
What the hell?

1086
02:03:53,967 --> 02:03:55,217
What the...?

1087
02:04:54,301 --> 02:04:55,068
Hello.

1088
02:04:55,092 --> 02:04:56,551
It's me.

1089
02:04:57,092 --> 02:04:58,384
Where are you?

1090
02:04:58,509 --> 02:04:59,759
What about you?

1091
02:04:59,801 --> 02:05:01,481
Don't ask me anything.

1092
02:05:01,676 --> 02:05:04,926
You need to get to your daughter. Now.

1093
02:05:04,967 --> 02:05:06,926
Tell me what's going on?

1094
02:05:06,967 --> 02:05:08,884
I'm at your place.

1095
02:05:08,926 --> 02:05:13,551
Get back to your house, now.

1096
02:05:13,592 --> 02:05:17,051
First tell me what's going on.

1097
02:05:19,134 --> 02:05:20,509
I...

1098
02:05:21,801 --> 02:05:25,467
I misread the divination.

1099
02:05:26,801 --> 02:05:28,384
It's not him.

1100
02:05:30,051 --> 02:05:31,851
What are you talking about?

1101
02:05:33,051 --> 02:05:35,318
I cast the hex on the wrong ghost.

1102
02:05:36,176 --> 02:05:38,676
I saw a woman in front of your house.

1103
02:05:39,259 --> 02:05:42,676
I made a grave mistake.

1104
02:05:43,384 --> 02:05:45,759
A terrible, terrible mistake.

1105
02:05:49,342 --> 02:05:51,068
It's not the Japanese man.

1106
02:05:51,092 --> 02:05:53,092
That woman is the evil spirit.

1107
02:05:53,801 --> 02:05:55,509
It was all her doing.

1108
02:05:55,884 --> 02:05:57,717
So, go home now.

1109
02:05:57,759 --> 02:05:59,439
I'm on my way there, too.

1110
02:06:00,134 --> 02:06:01,426
Then...

1111
02:06:03,801 --> 02:06:05,068
Who's the Japanese man?

1112
02:06:05,092 --> 02:06:08,634
He was trying to kill that woman

1113
02:06:09,634 --> 02:06:12,717
in order to save people from her.

1114
02:06:13,134 --> 02:06:14,384
Understand?

1115
02:06:14,967 --> 02:06:16,759
That Japanese man-

1116
02:06:18,842 --> 02:06:20,522
he's a shaman, like me.

1117
02:06:28,217 --> 02:06:29,551
Was the woman...

1118
02:06:30,384 --> 02:06:31,504
wearing white?

1119
02:06:35,634 --> 02:06:36,967
Did you see her?

1120
02:06:42,009 --> 02:06:43,342
A young woman?

1121
02:06:45,009 --> 02:06:46,592
That's her.

1122
02:06:55,176 --> 02:06:57,509
Defend us in battle.

1123
02:06:58,509 --> 02:07:01,759
Be our safeguard against the wickedness

1124
02:07:03,259 --> 02:07:04,967
and snares of the devil.

1125
02:07:26,092 --> 02:07:27,217
Where is she?

1126
02:07:29,842 --> 02:07:31,509
Where's Hyo-jin?!

1127
02:08:26,551 --> 02:08:27,842
Hyo-jin!

1128
02:08:38,092 --> 02:08:39,176
What is it?

1129
02:08:43,051 --> 02:08:45,851
Where are you headed in the dark of night?

1130
02:08:56,759 --> 02:08:58,134
I'm asking you.

1131
02:08:59,592 --> 02:09:01,272
Where is my daughter?

1132
02:09:03,759 --> 02:09:05,134
Where is she?

1133
02:09:10,426 --> 02:09:12,106
Girl about this tall?

1134
02:09:12,759 --> 02:09:13,926
Yeah.

1135
02:09:19,967 --> 02:09:21,259
Hyo-jin?

1136
02:09:22,676 --> 02:09:23,717
That's right.

1137
02:09:24,426 --> 02:09:26,842
She's possessed by an evil spirit.

1138
02:09:27,926 --> 02:09:31,551
The old woman tells me the Jap is a ghost.

1139
02:09:32,967 --> 02:09:34,277
He's trying to suck her blood dry...

1140
02:09:34,301 --> 02:09:35,842
Shut the fuck up!

1141
02:09:37,009 --> 02:09:38,676
Answer me, bitch!

1142
02:09:39,676 --> 02:09:41,217
Where is Hyo-jin?

1143
02:09:42,842 --> 02:09:45,801
- Have you seen the Jap?
- Where's my daughter?

1144
02:09:46,967 --> 02:09:49,217
At your home, where else?

1145
02:09:49,259 --> 02:09:50,509
She's not home.

1146
02:09:50,551 --> 02:09:51,842
She is.

1147
02:09:53,176 --> 02:09:54,616
She just got back.

1148
02:09:59,592 --> 02:10:01,009
Don't go now-

1149
02:10:03,134 --> 02:10:04,634
or you'll all die.

1150
02:10:05,217 --> 02:10:08,117
If you go now, your whole
family will perish.

1151
02:10:15,884 --> 02:10:17,684
What are you talking about?

1152
02:10:40,384 --> 02:10:43,051
The Jap is waiting for you...

1153
02:10:43,759 --> 02:10:47,217
to annihilate your family.

1154
02:10:49,676 --> 02:10:51,301
He's dead.

1155
02:10:51,592 --> 02:10:52,759
He's not dead.

1156
02:10:55,217 --> 02:10:56,967
Death cannot touch him.

1157
02:11:00,926 --> 02:11:04,592
The demon will soon enter your home.

1158
02:11:07,092 --> 02:11:08,772
You've seen the demon?

1159
02:11:11,384 --> 02:11:14,759
At the house of the hanged woman.

1160
02:11:21,509 --> 02:11:22,709
It was a dream.

1161
02:11:23,342 --> 02:11:24,622
It was no dream.

1162
02:11:57,717 --> 02:11:59,592
I laid a trap for it.

1163
02:12:00,592 --> 02:12:02,525
Wait here, until he's caught.

1164
02:12:03,592 --> 02:12:05,325
That's all you need to do.

1165
02:12:07,884 --> 02:12:11,884
What are you?

1166
02:12:15,926 --> 02:12:17,634
A woman or a ghost?

1167
02:12:18,467 --> 02:12:19,884
Why do you ask?

1168
02:12:20,551 --> 02:12:21,967
I need to know...

1169
02:12:23,634 --> 02:12:25,567
If I can put my faith in you.

1170
02:12:25,926 --> 02:12:27,134
Just believe,

1171
02:12:27,967 --> 02:12:29,360
and your family will be saved.

1172
02:12:29,384 --> 02:12:31,051
What are you?

1173
02:12:47,551 --> 02:12:50,018
Someone trying to save your daughter.

1174
02:12:52,801 --> 02:12:54,051
A woman.

1175
02:12:56,717 --> 02:13:00,342
I called all her friends...

1176
02:13:05,676 --> 02:13:06,884
Hyo-jin?

1177
02:13:07,134 --> 02:13:08,384
Hyo-jin!

1178
02:13:11,134 --> 02:13:12,259
Baby.

1179
02:13:12,676 --> 02:13:13,926
Baby...

1180
02:13:28,967 --> 02:13:32,051
When will the demon come?

1181
02:13:33,926 --> 02:13:35,467
It's already there.

1182
02:13:46,217 --> 02:13:47,342
Hyo-jin.

1183
02:13:48,676 --> 02:13:51,176
It's already there?

1184
02:14:02,301 --> 02:14:03,981
Let me ask you one thing.

1185
02:14:06,384 --> 02:14:09,884
What is your true form?

1186
02:14:53,259 --> 02:14:55,526
What do you think is my true form?

1187
02:14:55,842 --> 02:14:57,092
The devil.

1188
02:14:58,426 --> 02:15:00,092
You're the devil.

1189
02:15:03,842 --> 02:15:05,522
Why can't you answer?

1190
02:15:05,759 --> 02:15:07,967
You've already said it.

1191
02:15:10,551 --> 02:15:12,384
I'm the devil.

1192
02:15:14,592 --> 02:15:16,801
Shaman

1193
02:15:26,426 --> 02:15:27,443
I'm almost there.

1194
02:15:27,467 --> 02:15:29,334
Where are you? Are you home?

1195
02:15:29,884 --> 02:15:33,342
I'm with the woman now.

1196
02:15:34,426 --> 02:15:37,967
You mustn't let her tempt you.

1197
02:15:38,134 --> 02:15:39,259
Never.

1198
02:15:39,301 --> 02:15:41,051
Whatever she tells you,

1199
02:15:41,176 --> 02:15:43,926
you must go to your daughter now.

1200
02:15:43,967 --> 02:15:45,647
Do you understand me?

1201
02:15:45,717 --> 02:15:46,717
Understand?

1202
02:15:48,842 --> 02:15:50,217
Do you?

1203
02:15:54,426 --> 02:15:56,026
Is that your shaman?

1204
02:16:00,717 --> 02:16:02,850
Don't believe what he tells you.

1205
02:16:03,426 --> 02:16:05,159
They're in on it together.

1206
02:16:05,759 --> 02:16:07,119
Isn't that right?

1207
02:16:08,634 --> 02:16:13,134
You're already certain I'm the devil.

1208
02:16:14,176 --> 02:16:15,976
That's why you came here...

1209
02:16:16,884 --> 02:16:18,564
carrying that sickle.

1210
02:16:28,176 --> 02:16:33,551
My words, whatever I say-

1211
02:16:33,592 --> 02:16:35,551
they won't change your mind.

1212
02:16:35,592 --> 02:16:36,717
No.

1213
02:16:37,717 --> 02:16:39,092
That's not true.

1214
02:16:40,009 --> 02:16:41,842
There's no doubt.

1215
02:16:42,509 --> 02:16:48,467
You came here
to confirm your suspicions about me.

1216
02:16:48,509 --> 02:16:49,789
That's not true!

1217
02:16:52,676 --> 02:16:53,676
If you say

1218
02:16:54,467 --> 02:16:58,217
you're not the devil,

1219
02:16:59,051 --> 02:17:01,592
and reveal your true form to me-

1220
02:17:04,092 --> 02:17:05,772
I'll leave you alone.

1221
02:17:08,426 --> 02:17:10,509
When the demon is snared,

1222
02:17:11,926 --> 02:17:14,842
the rooster will cry three times.

1223
02:17:18,384 --> 02:17:20,064
Wait until the third cry.

1224
02:17:25,842 --> 02:17:31,842
You'll leave me alone?

1225
02:17:33,926 --> 02:17:35,051
Yes.

1226
02:17:39,842 --> 02:17:41,384
Two more.

1227
02:17:46,759 --> 02:17:48,009
Do not waver.

1228
02:17:53,092 --> 02:17:54,884
You'll leave?

1229
02:17:55,551 --> 02:17:56,759
Yes.

1230
02:17:57,509 --> 02:17:59,189
I'll leave you alone.

1231
02:18:19,551 --> 02:18:22,342
Who said I'd let you leave?

1232
02:18:27,426 --> 02:18:31,676
Then let me ask you one thing.

1233
02:18:33,111 --> 02:18:34,236
What?

1234
02:18:34,278 --> 02:18:38,903
Why in God's name is he doing this?

1235
02:18:39,736 --> 02:18:43,611
Because her father has sinned.

1236
02:18:44,153 --> 02:18:45,153
What sin?

1237
02:18:48,028 --> 02:18:49,708
What sin did I commit?

1238
02:18:50,194 --> 02:18:54,236
Her father suspected another.

1239
02:18:54,903 --> 02:18:58,819
He tried to kill him,
and finally succeeded.

1240
02:18:59,653 --> 02:19:03,778
But my daughter...!

1241
02:19:05,361 --> 02:19:06,736
My daughter...

1242
02:19:07,319 --> 02:19:10,069
My daughter got sick first!

1243
02:19:10,694 --> 02:19:12,111
How can that...

1244
02:19:20,319 --> 02:19:21,420
How can that possibly...

1245
02:19:21,444 --> 02:19:24,944
One more, now.

1246
02:19:33,069 --> 02:19:34,589
How can that be...?

1247
02:19:55,944 --> 02:19:57,194
Don't do it.

1248
02:19:59,528 --> 02:20:01,128
What are you saying?

1249
02:20:02,653 --> 02:20:06,694
Whether you walk out of here or not
is completely up to you.

1250
02:20:15,569 --> 02:20:17,236
Touch me and see.

1251
02:20:22,153 --> 02:20:27,069
A ghost does not have flesh and bones,

1252
02:20:27,319 --> 02:20:34,319
and you see I have both.

1253
02:20:59,528 --> 02:21:01,319
Park Chun-bae

1254
02:21:03,111 --> 02:21:04,194
No.

1255
02:21:05,486 --> 02:21:06,861
That's not it.

1256
02:21:10,028 --> 02:21:11,194
It's you.

1257
02:21:11,486 --> 02:21:12,569
No.

1258
02:21:12,819 --> 02:21:14,528
This is all your doing.

1259
02:21:20,111 --> 02:21:21,087
Don't do it.

1260
02:21:21,111 --> 02:21:22,278
Hyo-jin...

1261
02:21:24,319 --> 02:21:25,528
Don't do it.

1262
02:21:25,736 --> 02:21:26,861
Hyo-jin...

1263
02:21:27,986 --> 02:21:31,278
No!

1264
02:21:41,028 --> 02:21:42,548
What are you doing?

1265
02:21:44,569 --> 02:21:45,694
Don't!

1266
02:21:46,153 --> 02:21:48,528
Why are you troubled?

1267
02:22:14,319 --> 02:22:15,403
Hyo-jin.

1268
02:22:28,069 --> 02:22:29,278
Honey...

1269
02:22:32,819 --> 02:22:34,028
Mother...

1270
02:24:30,361 --> 02:24:32,527
Look at me.

1271
02:24:33,111 --> 02:24:35,653
Look at me!

1272
02:24:36,403 --> 02:24:37,653
Please.

1273
02:24:37,694 --> 02:24:41,528
Look at me.

1274
02:24:43,361 --> 02:24:44,611
Please...

1275
02:24:45,403 --> 02:24:47,361
Please!

1276
02:25:07,486 --> 02:25:09,278
Hyo-jin!

1277
02:25:10,319 --> 02:25:12,944
Hyo-jin...

1278
02:25:20,736 --> 02:25:21,861
Hyo-jin.

1279
02:25:27,528 --> 02:25:28,944
Hyo-jin.

1280
02:25:31,819 --> 02:25:33,528
Hyo-jin...

1281
02:25:36,736 --> 02:25:39,444
Hyo-jin!

1282
02:25:55,194 --> 02:25:59,444
Why is there doubt in your heart?

1283
02:26:13,028 --> 02:26:16,236
See my hands, and my feet.

1284
02:26:32,736 --> 02:26:34,528
You can see it is I.

1285
02:26:43,111 --> 02:26:44,569
Myself.

1286
02:27:01,486 --> 02:27:03,111
Oh Lord...

1287
02:29:11,903 --> 02:29:13,361
Hyo-jin...

1288
02:29:52,653 --> 02:29:54,361
It's okay.

1289
02:29:59,569 --> 02:30:01,986
My baby.

1290
02:30:06,736 --> 02:30:10,444
You know Daddy's a policeman.

1291
02:30:14,819 --> 02:30:20,153
I'll take care of everything.

1292
02:30:27,278 --> 02:30:29,361
Daddy will.
