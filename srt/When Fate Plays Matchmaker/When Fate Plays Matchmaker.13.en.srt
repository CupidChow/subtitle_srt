Cheers.

Hard to believe
we're all sitting here again,

29
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,860
and my life has taken
such a different turn.

30
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:37,740
Indeed.

31
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,420
Miss Song,

32
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,700
when do you plan
to join our Unfeeling Sect?

33
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:41,980
Back at it again,

34
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:42,740
aren't you?

35
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:43,380
I...

36
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,540
Mr. Cheng, I've actually always wondered

37
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,380
why you're so opposed to marriage.

38
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,620
Have you had your heart broken before?

39
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,740
No.

40
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,820
I'm telling you,

41
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,260
he's very tight-lipped.

42
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,700
Don't force it if it's too sad.

43
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,700
I'm not forcing it.

44
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,540
- Indeed I've never been...
- All right. I get it.

45
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:12,860
I understand.

46
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,580
Understand what?

47
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,220
I...

48
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,740
You don't understand.

49
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,580
The Unfeeling Sect is home to me.

50
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,940
I grew up

51
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,060
with no parents.

52
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,100
If it weren't for my senior
taking such meticulous care of me,

53
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,060
I wouldn't have survived otherwise.

54
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,660
Cheng Yin, check this out.

55
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,180
Chicken drumstick!

56
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,260
Where did you get this?

57
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,300
Don't worry about that.

58
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,420
Hurry and eat.

59
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,060
Is it good?

60
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:49,940
Eat more

61
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,220
so you can grow taller and stronger,

62
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,140
and then you'll be able
to go down the mountain with me.

63
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:54,540
Mm.

64
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,140
Go ahead and eat it.

65
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:55,900
Senior.

66
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,260
I don't want it.

67
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:57,900
You have it.

68
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:06,380
I remember a time when Master was away.

69
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,380
My senior had to both take care of me

70
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,340
and go down the mountain to work.

71
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,340
If it hadn't been
for an unscrupulous matchmaker

72
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,020
who threatened and tempted him,

73
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,220
he wouldn't have married

74
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,300
into a wealthy family...

75
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,020
and fallen in love.

76
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,180
It was only when he married the girl
that he discovered

77
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,540
she was the daughter of an enemy.

78
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,300
My senior ended up losing his life

79
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,580
because of that marriage.

80
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,660
Get him!

81
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,660
He's over there.

82
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,860
Don't run!

83
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,860
Catch him!

84
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,540
He's over there.

85
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,060
Catch him.

86
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,700
Catch him.

87
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,740
Hurry and go catch him.

88
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,860
He's over there.

89
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,900
Go catch him now.

90
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,100
Master kept me locked up in the sect,
fearing I'd go down the mountain

91
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,580
to find that unscrupulous matchmaker.

92
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,220
In this world,

93
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,180
there are millions of people
like my senior

94
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,180
and just as many wicked matchmakers.

95
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,220
Cheng Yin,

96
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,580
I believe

97
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:43,140
that in this world, there will always
be both good and bad people.

98
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,980
Matchmakers, too, can be wicked

99
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:46,860
or kind-hearted.

100
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,940
Some genuinely want
to see others happy, but...

101
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,540
Can they really guarantee

102
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,140
that these people
will live happily ever after?

103
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,700
I've seen so many unhappy marriages
in the Unfeeling Sect,

104
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,220
and I've met people like me,

105
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,940
who became homeless orphans

106
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,700
because their parents separated.

107
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,820
If there were no love in this world,

108
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,980
wouldn't these things be avoided?

109
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,700
Mr. Cheng,

110
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,620
I guess you've never met someone
to make your heart race.

111
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,820
That kind of feeling

112
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,500
is just a momentary impulse.

113
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,820
Though the feeling may be momentary,

114
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,500
the heart

115
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,260
isn't like the liquor in this pot.

116
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,780
It's not something
you can pour out at will.

117
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,940
Just like your senior,

118
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,740
if given the chance again,

119
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,020
he'd make the same choice.

120
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,780
Mr. Cheng,

121
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,620
those you've lost are gone.

122
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,580
Now, honor their memory
by living life to the fullest.

123
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,500
Yes,

124
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,460
just like Miss Song said,

125
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,980
you should take risks,

126
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:23,980
love with all your heart,

127
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,580
and do your best
while leaving the rest to fate.

128
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:25,980
Exactly.

129
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:26,500
Let's have a toast.

130
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,180
Cheers.

131
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,860
Do my best

132
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,460
while leaving the rest to fate.

133
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,020
What's the matter?

134
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,260
What is it?

135
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,780
What are you looking at?

136
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,620
I'll gouge your eyes out
if you keep looking.

137
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:09,900
Turn away.

138
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,300
You...

139
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,500
You didn't make a move on me last night,

140
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,980
did you?

141
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,060
What nonsense are you spouting?

142
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,740
I was also about to ask

143
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,420
if you did anything

144
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,300
to me

145
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,540
last night.

146
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,380
How could I possibly
do something like that to you?

147
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:31,860
I...

148
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,860
I'm from the Unfeeling...

149
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,820
the Unfeeling Sect.

150
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,620
And there's no way

151
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,660
I'd do that to you.

152
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,140
But why is my matchmaking vision
failing?

153
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,780
Did something happen outside?

154
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:23,860
Tell me,

155
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,500
what exactly did you do to me
last night?

156
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,900
My matchmaking vision

157
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,140
