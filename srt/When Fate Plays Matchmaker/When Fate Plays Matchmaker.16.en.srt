[When Fate Plays Matchmaker]

22
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,660
[Episode 16]

23
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,900
That smells amazing.

24
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,420
You're having rabbit hotpot.

25
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,460
I want some, too.

26
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,140
It smells so good.

27
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,580
Next time,
I'll bring Sui along to try it as well.

28
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,300
What was that for?

29
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,700
I made this hotpot myself.

30
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,900
If you want some, go whip up your own.

31
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,620
Fine, you miser.

32
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,740
I'll just have some liquor then.

33
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,900
I bought the liquor myself, too.

34
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,660
If you want food or drinks,
go get them yourself.

35
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,620
What's wrong with him?

36
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,540
He's sulking like a neglected wife.

37
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,500
He...

38
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,020
Then,

39
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:02,500
you...

40
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,900
I'm eating it,
and if he's mad, so be it.

41
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:05,900
I'm eating it.

42
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,780
It smells so good.

43
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,220
Next time,
I'll bring Sui along to try it as well.

44
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,260
What was that for?

45
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,020
Such a shame.

46
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,260
It smells so good.

47
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,620
Wait a minute.

48
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,060
Could all of this

49
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,340
be a trap set by Cao Sui?

50
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,500
Does he want to harm Zhao Shuangshuang?

51
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,540
This won't do. I have to warn her.

52
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,700
But without any proof,

53
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,780
if I just go to her now,

54
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,380
she'll think I'm lying.

55
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,300
Sui.

56
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,020
She can't believe
that Mr. Cao is into her, can she?

57
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,260
He's clearly just toying
with her feelings.

58
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,300
Exactly.

59
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,060
Where are you, Sui?

60
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,220
She actually thinks
she could be Mr. Cao's wife?

61
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,380
The one inside...

62
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,260
Sui.

63
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,060
She's Mr. Cao's legitimate wife.

64
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,820
Where are you, Sui?

65
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,220
Who is she, Sui?

66
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,780
Shuangshuang,

67
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,660
this is my legitimate wife.

68
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,660
Kneel

69
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,300
and greet Mrs. Cao.

70
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,100
Sui,

71
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:49,020
you never mentioned
that you have a legitimate wife.

72
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,140
Shuangshuang,

73
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,660
I've taken you as my wife,

74
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,780
so you should be grateful.

75
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,060
From now on,
your duty is to serve us well.

76
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,220
What?

77
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,860
You want me to serve you?

78
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,220
When have I ever been treated

79
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,740
so unfairly in my life?

81
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,700
Cheng Yin.

82
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,540
Come out!

83
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:45,780
Cheng Yin!

84
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,580
Get up.

85
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,260
Come on,

86
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,340
Zhao Shuangshuang, you're a lady.

87
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,620
It's really inappropriate for you

88
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,180
to come to my room at this hour.

89
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,140
So it's appropriate for you

90
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,580
to use that darned talisman on me, huh?

91
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,700
What darned talisman?

92
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,420
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

93
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,340
Oh, you don't know, huh?

94
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,340
Then take your time
and think it through.

95
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:28,540
Mr. Liang.

96
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:29,860
You are awake.

97
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,780
Come here.

98
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,860
I'll help you reduce the swelling.

99
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,020
Mr. Liang,

100
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,180
where's Zhao Shuangshuang?

101
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,060
Mr. Cao called her away
early this morning,

102
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,860
saying they'd go check out a house
on the west side of the city.

103
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,540
He was acting all mysterious

104
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,260
and wouldn't even let Lian go with them.

105
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,420
A house?

106
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,260
And Lian wasn't allowed to go with them?

107
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:55,780
Oh, no.

108
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,900
Shuangshuang must have been tricked.

109
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,740
Cheng.

110
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,660
Get dressed.

111
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,580
Get dressed. Hey...

112
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:03,620
Careful.

113
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,140
Sui.

114
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,060
Are we there yet?

115
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:10,780
We are.

116
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,980
This place is so beautiful.

117
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,100
Do you like

118
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,500
the view of this guesthouse?

119
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,220
I'll give it to you as a gift then.

120
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,940
This is way too valuable.

121
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,420
I don't think I can accept it.

122
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,100
You are the most wonderful woman
in this world

123
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,740
and deserve nothing but the best.

124
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,820
So no need to feel uneasy.

125
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,380
If you wish, you can move in anytime.

126
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,380
Moving in?

127
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,380
I don't think that's appropriate.

128
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,340
Don't worry.

129
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,180
I just want you

130
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,460
to learn the proper etiquette
in this residence.

131
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,140
After all,
there are many rules in noble families.

132
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,940
I've even hired an experienced governess

133
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,540
to teach you.

134
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,300
Let's work towards our future together,

135
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:58,980
all right?

136
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,300
Sui,

137
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,540
you've really
thought of everything for me.

138
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,300
But once I'm gone,

139
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,180
no one will be around to manage
the matchmaking agency.

140
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,780
I'm recommending Hongdou and Lian
as official matchmakers,

141
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,220
so they can stay
at the matchmaking agency

142
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,540
and have a stable future.

143
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,460
If you miss them,

144
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,020
you can always go back and visit.

145
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,020
Zhao Shuangshuang,

146
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,740
you can't say yes to him.

147
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,580

00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,740
