22
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,580
[Episode 15]

23
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,780
Miss Zhao, do you remember saying

24
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,420
you'd be there for me
if I ever needed help?

25
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:32,620
I do.

26
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,980
What can I do for you, Mr. Cao?

27
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,260
I'd like to ask you
to help me find a good match.

28
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,060
May I ask

29
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,380
what kind of girl

30
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,820
you are interested in?

31
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,260
She has delicate willow-leaf brows
and charming almond eyes,

32
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,380
unpretentious and buoyant.

33
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,940
She is unaffected by power and wealth,
with a heart that is both just and kind.

34
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,980
Aspirations and courage
shine through her eyes,

35
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,020
and her heart is filled
with care for the people.

36
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,500
In the face of danger, she remains true
to loyalty and righteousness.

37
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,380
She often wears

38
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,620
a golden bracelet on her left wrist.

39
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,980
Mr. Cao, are you referring to...

40
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,780
Shuangshuang, I've had feelings for you.

41
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,140
I truly appreciate

42
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,740
how you helped me
through the toughest times

43
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,620
in my life.

44
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,260
Mother,

45
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,700
have some water.

46
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,140
Since Master is not home,

47
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,340
we have to do whatever First Madam says.

48
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,700
Even if they died,

49
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,780
it would just be

50
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,100
the death of two pests in her eyes.

51
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,500
Let's not get involved and leave.

52
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,300
Mr. Cao, it's me,

53
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,220
Zhao Shuangshuang.

54
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,220
Mr. Cao, I've already checked.

55
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,980
Master Cao will be back in ten days.

56
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,580
You two must hang in there.

57
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,660
I'll figure out a way
to bring you more food.

58
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,500
It was because of you
that I made it until my father returned,

59
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,780
though my mother didn't.

60
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,380
To be honest,

61
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,180
at that time,

62
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,740
I didn't know
when Master Cao would return.

63
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,020
I just picked a day that seemed
neither too distant nor too soon,

64
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,340
hoping it would give you both some hope.

65
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,380
Thank you, Shuangshuang.

66
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,460
You've become my hope.

67
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,660
From then on, even in my darkest hours,

68
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,900
you were the beacon within me.

69
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,420
I know we're not connected
by a romance line,

70
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,380
but I believe that wise man
guided me here

71
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,740
because I'm destined

72
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,500
to meet you.

73
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,220
I have never been so devoted
to any other woman.

74
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,740
Shuangshuang,

75
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,860
will you give me a chance?

76
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,900
So it turns out my fated match
is none other than Mr. Cao.

77
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,260
Mr. Cheng,

78
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,100
I guess you've never met someone
to make your heart race.

79
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,020
That kind of feeling

80
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,340
is just a momentary impulse.

81
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,980
Though the feeling may be momentary,

82
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,740
the heart
isn't like the liquor in this pot.

83
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,540
It's not something
you can pour out at will.

84
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,620
It'll be alright.

85
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,660
From now on,

86
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,300
I've got you covered.

87
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,260
Could it be

88
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,380
that I've really fallen
for Zhao Shuangshuang?

89
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,140
I have faith that the matchmaking vision
is always right.

90
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,500
My fated match

91
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,220
is Mr. Cao.

92
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,060
So, you are saying

93
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,380
that he came back
from the Yue Lao Temple,

94
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,940
slept for two whole days,

95
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,060
and ended up like this?

96
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:56,740
Yes.

97
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,540
You can't be serious.

98
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,460
Did you mention

99
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,740
that Miss Zhao came back with Mr. Cao?

100
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:06,860
Yes.

101
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,060
I see now.

102
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,860
Watch this.

103
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,100
Zhao Shuangshuang is here.

104
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,740
Who are you looking for,

105
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,540
Cheng?

106
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,100
She's not here.

107
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,580
Cheng,

108
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,260
once you start to long for someone,

109
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,820
you'll taste the bitterness of love.

110
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,340
Let me tell you,

111
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,860
young women today value directness.

112
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,220
You're a man,

113
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,220
so tell her if you like her.

114
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:44,900
I...

115
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,460
Who said I like her?

116
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,700
But what exactly do you mean

117
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,740
by "directness?"

118
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,300
The gaze is everything.

119
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,620
Give her a gaze
that's both intense and casual.

120
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,060
Let your eyes show
a mix of deep affection

121
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,260
and a bit of wildness.

122
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,460
Then, when she's distracted,

123
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,540
pull her into your arms

124
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,220
and whisper in your sexiest voice,

125
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,220
''I want you

126
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,500
to be mine."

127
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,580
If I knew how to pull that off,

128
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,500
do you think
I'd still be sharing a room with him?

129
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,140
Is it really true

130
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,220
that the young women these days

131
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,180
prefer directness?

132
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,420
Don't underestimate my simple tricks.

133
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,580
I'm sure

134
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,700
it will help you win her heart.

135
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,380
Once Zhao Shuangshuang sees it,

136
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,460
she'll be all smitten...

137
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,220
