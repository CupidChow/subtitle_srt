[Episode 12]

23
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,980
How's your injury?

24
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,420
It's all right.

25
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:27,980
I brought you

26
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,660
some ointment.

27
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,740
Thanks.

28
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,940
What should we do

29
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,740
if Mrs. Yuan comes
to the matchmaking agency

30
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,540
and tries to make a scene?

31
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,100
Don't worry.

32
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,140
Mr. Cao will take care of it for me.

33
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,660
"Don't worry.

34
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,660
Mr. Cao will take care of it for me."

35
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,060
Who is that Mr. Cao anyway?

36
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,820
Isn't he just a pretty face?

37
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,940
Who are you calling a pretty face?

38
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,660
He's my savior, you know.

39
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,980
All he did was say a few extra words
with the Song family.

40
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:01,980
I...

41
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,700
Mr. Liang and I sacrificed our looks,
dressed as women,

42
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,460
and threw ourselves into the act.

43
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:09,980
Besides,

44
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,020
I spent the entire night
creating that dream

45
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,300
for Mrs. Song.

46
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,580
The entire night.

47
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,380
So, according to your logic,

48
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,740
I should also be praised
for the story I made up for the dream.

49
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,940
Without those tragic scenes
in the dream,

50
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,140
how would Mrs. Song
have given in so easily?

51
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,620
Honestly.

52
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,380
That's exactly

53
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,260
why we shouldn't make it easy for him.

54
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,380
What's the deal between you two anyway?

55
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,660
Why are you always defending him?

56
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,220
What right do you have
to ask about that?

57
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,980
How is that any of your business?

58
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,020
Ouch!

59
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,620
Is this how you treat someone
who just saved you?

60
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,140
Come on now.

61
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,500
I'll apply the ointment for you.

62
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,500
No, thanks. I can handle it myself.

63
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,700
Men and women
should keep a proper distance.

64
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,860
And I...

65
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,900
hold myself to high standards
as a gentleman.

66
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,540
Turn around.

67
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,260
Turn around.

00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,020
Please be gentle.

71
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,660
That looks serious.

72
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,500
Are you in a lot of pain?

73
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,100
Thanks for everything today.

74
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,780
What did you say?

75
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,500
I said thank you.

76
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,780
You are welcome.

77
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,540
Don't try to act tough like that again.

78
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,140
You're too fragile for that

79
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,020
and I'll be the one taking care of you
when you're unwell.

80
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,060
Who acted tough?

You don't know how strong I was
back in the day.

84
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,620
This tiny injury means nothing to me.

85
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,260
Is that so?

86
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,100
Ouch.

87
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:03,460
Does it hurt?

88
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,500
Didn't you say it was all right?

I...

90
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,860
I didn't mean that seriously.

91
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,780
Forget it. Come here.

00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,500
I will be gentle.

93
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,940
I promise I'll be gentle
and extra careful.

Come here.

95
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:20,500
Be gentle.

96
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,820
I will.

97
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,700
Is that gentle enough?

98
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,420
That's fine.

99
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,740
But I still really want to know

100
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,380
your relationship with him.

101
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,860
What does it matter to you?

102
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,340
You're not jealous of him, are you?

103
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,100
I...

104
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,020
How could I possibly be jealous?

105
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:42,820
You are jealous.

106
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,260
I'm not.

107
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,580
His fake niceties smell fishy.

108
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,140
Watch out. He might not be
as friendly as he seems.

109
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,420
It's written all over your face
that you're jealous.

110
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,620
Look into my eyes.

111
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,820
All I'm saying

112
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,460
- is you watching out.
- All right.

113
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,580
Lian.

114
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,860
Why isn't Miss Zhao here today?

115
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,980
[Hongdou]
Mr. Cao heard she enjoys storytelling,

116
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,060
so he secured premium seats
for a performance.

117
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,100
He is so thoughtful.

118
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,900
It would be such a blessing

119
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,460
if Miss Zhao could marry him.

120
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,940
What are you talking about?

121
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,100
What's all this nonsense?

122
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,020
There's no way Zhao Shuangshuang
would like him.

123
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,220
Who said that?

124
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:35,100
Mr. Cao is not only well-mannered
and comes from a good family,

125
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,740
but his looks, physique,
and fashion sense

126
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,140
are also among the best in Lin'an.

127
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,300
If Miss Zhao isn't interested in him,

128
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,700
do you really think she'd be interested

129
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,700
in someone as disheveled as you?

130
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,500
I...

131
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,860
You know nothing about me.

132
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,420
I'm all for simplicity in appearance.

133
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,940
I'm the epitome of a thrifty,
down-to-earth, and family-oriented man.

134
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,140
Lian, don't bother with him.

135
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,060
Let's head out.

136
00:05:59,060 --> 00:05:59,740
Let's go.

137
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,500
You have no sense of taste.

138
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,300
This looks pretty good.

139
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,500
So the Song family

140
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,820
actually agreed to let Miss Song
venture into business.

141
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,620
Miss Zhao,
that's really impressive of you.

142
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,700
It's mainly because Mr. Cao
said a lot of good things about me.

143
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,660
So the credit goes to Mr. Cao, I see.

144
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,460
By the way,

145
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,500
how do I look in this outfit today?

Mr. Cao.

151
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,900
Who are you calling Mr. Cao?

152
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,820
It's me.

153

How come it's you?

154
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,380
What do you think?

00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,540
How do I look?

156
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,420
You certainly look the part.

157
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,260
You look decent in your outfit, too.

158
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,460
Of course.

159
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,140
But why are you
copying someone else's style?

160
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,060
Well,

161
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,060
since Miss Song's new store is opening,

162
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,420
I, as her friend,

163
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,260
had to make sure I looked presentable.

164
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:22,980
Moreover,

165
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,660
I can't let the matchmaking agency
lose face, can I?

166
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,340
Honestly, though,

167
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,580
you shouldn't dress like this again
in the future.

168
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:32,620
What's the problem?

169
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,140
I think this outfit suits me well.

170
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,380
Just look.

171
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,060
You know, there's something

172
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,660
in this world that cannot be imitated.

173
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,180
For example...

174
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,380
- Charisma.
- Charisma.

Congratulations, Miss Song.

This is a small gift for you,
a token of respect.

In just ten short days,

you've managed to run such a large shop.
