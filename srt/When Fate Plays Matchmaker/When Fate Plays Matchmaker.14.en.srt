He told me that if I prayed
at the Yue Lao Temple,

I might meet my destined match.

I need to explain to her

183
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,460
that my suggestion
wasn't out of affection for her,

184
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,180
but because I'm worried
about her reputation.

185
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:46,180
But where exactly is the Yue Lao Temple?

186
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,780
Such a shame.

187
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,620
It smells so good.
