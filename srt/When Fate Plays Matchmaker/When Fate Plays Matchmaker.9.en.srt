And she happens to love Tanghulu,

184
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,460
so you must have upset her somehow.

185
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,820
Am I right?

186
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,620
Who upset her?

187
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,860
You didn't?

188
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,380
All right.

189
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,940
Take the snacks I just made

190
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,020
and bring them to Shuangshuang.

191
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,180
Why? I'm not going.

192
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,300
You think you can fool me?

193
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:46,860
Come on,

194
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,420
stop dragging your feet

195
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:49,860
and hurry up!

196
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,780
Wait.

197
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,260
Quit pretending.

198
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,180
Mr. Liang.

199
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,660
I can't believe
I even have to handle this for you.

200
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,500
This family
really couldn't function without me.
