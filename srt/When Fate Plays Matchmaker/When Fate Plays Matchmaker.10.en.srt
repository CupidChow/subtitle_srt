When will I finally get to dress up
just for myself?

24
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,700
Miss Zhao,
all you need is one last deal.

25
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,980
Why do you insist on breaking off
Miss Song's engagement to the Yuans?

26
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,660
I made a mistake in matchmaking once,

27
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,100

how could you
depart this life before me?

31
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,980
Miss Zhao.

32
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,380
It's all because Miss Song
offered me such a generous sum.

33
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,900
Who could say no to money, right?

34
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,700

why have you taken
this wedding attire out again?

39
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,260
I was just thinking

40
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,820
that maybe I should marry
in Miss Song's place.

41
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,220
Miss Zhao, you can't do that.

42
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,300

00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,340
so she wished

00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,460
to get married early.

48
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,420

Even Lian
knows about her feelings for me now.

64
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,980
Why bring that up? Say something else.

65
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:55,940
Say something else.

66

just to find

68
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,860
and marry your true love.

If you end up
marrying into the Yuan family,

70
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,620
wouldn't that ruin your life?

71
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,660
This won't do.
Even if I can't marry her,

72
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,540
she shouldn't ruin her life

73
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,300
by marrying just anyone.

This isn't right.

75
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,620

Miss Zhao, Mr. Cao is here.

Forget it, looks like
I can't rely on Cheng Yin after all.

I've failed the task
due to my incompetence.

88
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,860
Please forgive me, Mr. Cao.

89
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,980
You're being too hard on yourself.
I understand.

90

Love can't be forced,

91
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,580

Mr. Cao,

93
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,060
you are such a kind person.

94
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,420
Would it be all right
if I ask for one more tiny favor?

95
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,060
Don't worry,

96
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,260
I'll take care of things
on the Song family's side.

97
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,700
This woman isn't persistent at all.

98
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,620
One moment she's asking for my help,

99
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,820
and the next she's off
seeking assistance elsewhere.

100
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,460
She didn't even try to ask me again.

101
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,100
What are you doing?

102
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,460
Mr. Liang asked me
to bring you some snacks.

103
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,380
Oh, by the way,

104
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,820
I've agreed to help

105
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,300
with what you asked.

106
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,700
The servant here
is a little thoughtless.

107
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,180
My apologies, Mr. Cao.

108
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,180
I'll talk to you about it later.

109
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:01,980
You go back first.

110
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,660
I already said I'd help you.

111
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,140
Go back.

112
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,700
Sorry about that, Mr. Cao.

113
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,180
No worries.
If the servant is difficult to manage,

114
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,660
we can always sack him
and find someone else.

115
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,500
I came today

116
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,220
to bring you some treats.

117
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,340
I'm not sure

118
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,380
if you still like these apricot cakes.

119
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,740
I do.

120
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,940
They're my favorites.

121
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,900
How about I bring you apricot cakes

122
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,540
from time to time?

123
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,620
This man is quite something.

124
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,940
Why is he trying to get close to her

125
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,980
when requesting the matchmaking service?

126
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,180
That's great.

127
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,980
Should you need
any assistance in the future,

128
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,980
I'll definitely be there to help.

129
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,740
I've been told
that you have a matchmaking vision.

130
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,580
Would you be willing
to take a look at my fate?

131
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,700
Perhaps the time hasn't come yet.

132
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,780
Your matchmaking thread hasn't appeared.

133
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,260
Then, I wonder,

134
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,740
where does yours lead to?

135
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,260
To be honest,

136
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,540
mine hasn't appeared either.

137
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,020
Looks like we're both in the same boat.

138
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,460
Asking her to read your fate?

139
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,300
I think you're just trying
to flirt with the girl.

140
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,820
What are you doing, Cheng Yin?

141
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,180
Give me your hand.

142
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,380
Your hand.

143
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,500
How could you use the cloth
for cleaning windows to wipe my hand?

144
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,660
You are so annoying.

145
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,620
Weren't we supposed

146
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,940
to help Miss Song together?

147
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,860
Why is there suddenly

148
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,020
an unknown person showing up?

149
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:23,980
Won't this just make things
more complicated?

150
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,340
Didn't you tell me this afternoon
that you weren't willing to help me?

151
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,020
But I just changed my mind.

152
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,100
Well, it's a bit late
for you to change your mind.

153
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,220
Mr. Cao has already agreed to help me

154
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,140

these delicious apricot cakes.

Have you never had apricot cakes before?

156
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,020
