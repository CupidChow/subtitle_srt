[Episode 4]

23
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,260
Why does he not have

24
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,900
any romance lines either?

25
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,660
Then,

26
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,780
won't he be alone in the future?

27
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,220
Not bad.
You have a good romantic destiny.

28
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,540
Good? How is that possible?

29
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,580
Don't try to get it out of me.

30
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,500
Trying to agitate me won't work.

31
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,580
Just work hard here

32
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,500
and when the time comes,
I'll let you know.

33
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,500
Agitate you?

34
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,300
Don't worry, Miss Zhao.

35
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,740
I'll give my all

36
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,100
to my work here.

37
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,340
I'll prioritize my career.

38
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,500
That's the spirit!

39
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,700
If your parents ask about it,

40
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,220
just tell them

41
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,540
that I'll be looking out for you!

42
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,220
What is it?

43
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,940
I don't have parents.

44
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,580
They abandoned me when I was young.

45
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,340
It was my sen...

46
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,860
older brother who brought me up.

47
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,100
Then tell him

48
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,260
what I just said.

49
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,780
He's dead.

50
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,140
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,300
Ah...

52
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,380
I didn't bring this up on purpose.

53
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,500
I didn't know...

54
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,380
It's okay!

55
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,820
I still have friends.

56
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,580
Li is my best friend.

57
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,340
Unfortunately,

58
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,460
he's left Lin'an with his wife as well.

59
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,020
You know, friends

60
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,580
come and go.

61
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,420
It's alright!

62
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,540
From now on,

63
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,700
this place will be your home!

64
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,420
As long as there's food on my table,

65
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,300
there'll be enough for you too!

66
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,660
Thank you, Miss Zhao.

67
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,860
It's getting colder.

68
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,300
I'll get Lian to change your quilts
to thicker ones tomorrow.

69
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,620
Why are you wearing such thin clothes?

70
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,300
I'll ask Lian to make some
thick clothes for you tomorrow!

71
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,220
You're so skinny.

72
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,780
Here, take a chicken drumstick!

73
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,060
Eat.

74
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,220
Eat more.

75
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,260
Chicken drumstick!

76
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,340
Where did you get this?

77
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,660
Don't worry about that.

78
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,460
Hurry and eat.

79
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,300
What is it?

80
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,300
What are you thinking about?

81
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,500
Don't be shy.

82
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,020
Once you've joined
this matchmaking agency,

83
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,660
you're one of us!

84
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,540
I'll take care of you!

85
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,420
It's fine!

86
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,540
As for your payment,

87
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,260
we'll do as we agreed.

88
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,940
That was close.

89
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,020
I almost spent my money on some guy.

90
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,020
That was close.

91
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,460
I almost felt bad.

92
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,820
She's quite a handful.

93
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,340
Cheng!

94
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,940
Mr. Liang, you're back.

95
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,460
Cheng...

96
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,020
Did you do all this?

97
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:42,900
Yes.

98
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,260
Here.

99
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,100
Mr. Liang, have some tea.

100
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,340
Here, this is the quilt
and clothes Lian did for you.

101
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,820
This...

102
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,580
You even made tea?

103
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,540
Mr. Liang,

104
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,900
Zhao Shuangshuang

105
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,620
earns so much with each order,

106
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,700
why is she still so frugal?

107
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,420
That's a long story.

108
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,420
I have to start from 20 years ago.

109
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,660
Tell me.

110
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,900
Back then,

111
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,540
I was a young man.

112
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,460
For sure.

113
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,660
I was even younger than you are now

114
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,220
and taller than you.

115
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,060
That's why they all call me

116
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,140
Liang Yidao.

117
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,780
Those days are over...

118
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,220
Mr. Liang, is it true?

119
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,580
Of course!

120
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,340
You don't believe me?

121
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,980
I'll tell you again.

122
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,820
Back then...

123
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,940
No!

124
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,340
That's not what I mean.

125
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,180
I was asking about Zhao Shuangshuang.

126
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,260
What about her?

127
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,100
Oh yes!

128
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:00,700
Shuangshuang...

129
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,300
She was doing well then too.

130
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,180
Just a few years ago,

131
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,740
there was a huge flood in Lin'an.

132
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,700
In the entire city,

133
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,740
Shuangshuang was the most generous
with her donations.

134
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,620
That was the money
she prepared for her wedding.

135
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,740
While she may

136
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,940
come off as fierce at times,

137
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,060
her true nature

138
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,260
is kindness itself.

139
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:28,980
Mr. Liang,

140
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,420
do you think

141
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,380
her vision is actually true?

142
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,900
I don't believe it.

143
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,820
You don't...

144
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,380
Of course it's true!

145
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,140
It was an old wandering deity

146
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,220
that blessed her with it
because she was sincere.

147
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,580
I was there.

148
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,100
Oh, yes.

149
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,460
At first I was the one to get it,

150
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,380
but I said I didn't want it.

151
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:50,860
So...

152
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,740
it was given to her.

153
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:52,420
That's it.

154
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,260
Shuangshuang

155
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,340
had a hard life.

156
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,500
She was an orphaned girl,

157
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,140
so she wished

158
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,180
to get married early.

159
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,300
Right?

160
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,260
If she meets someone she likes,

161
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,740
she'll pamper them

162
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,220
and forget all about herself.

163
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,660
I know her.

164
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,260
Here, take a chicken drumstick!

165
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,980
From now on, this place

166
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,100
will be your home!

167
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,420
As long as there's food on my table,

168
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,500
there'll be enough for you too!

169
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,380
Does she like me?

170
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,660
That's not good.

171
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,940
A lady boss and male assistant?

172
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,020
Although she's a heartless matchmaker,

173
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,620
she's not bad.

174
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,500
She can be helped.

175
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,100
Once I get this place closed down,

176
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,140
I can help her

177
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,900
get over all these frivolous feelings

178
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,540
and head for a bright future!

179
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,700
Oh no!

180
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,500
Something has happened!

181
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,060
My waist...

182
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,860
Why didn't any
of the weddings go through?

183
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,220
Miss Zhao,

184
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,380
is your condition acting up again?

185
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,220
It's nothing!

186
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,540
The most important thing
is the canceled marriages.

187
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,460
What's with the Gu family?

188
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,180
On the day of the meeting,
Mr. Sun left abruptly

189
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,700
and even said Miss Gu was ugly.

190
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,900
Miss Gu was so angry

191
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,540
that she decided against marrying him.

192
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,580
Miss Gu.

193
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,020
Dark-haired.

194
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,060
No pockmarks.

195
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,220
Small feet.

196
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,260
Well-proportioned.

197
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,460
Miss Gu's dark.

198
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,700
No hair.

199
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,700
Pockmarks.

200
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,460
Misaligned feet.

201
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,140
Miss Gu, my apologies

202
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,100
for arriving late.

203
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:16,860
No worries.

204
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,300
I have something urgent to attend to.

205
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,020
I'll go now.

206
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,380
