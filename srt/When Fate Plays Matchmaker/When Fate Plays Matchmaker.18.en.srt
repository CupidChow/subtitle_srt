[Episode 18]

23
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,020
This is infuriating.

24
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,420
That Mr. Guo

25
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,060
kept eyeing you
in such a lecherous way.

26
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,300
Couldn't Mr. Cao see it?

27
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,980
That man's clearly up to no good.

28
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,340
I don't want
to be an official matchmaker anymore.

29
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,500
I just want to stay by your side.

30
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,020
Miss Zhao, I'll leave
the marriage arrangements

31
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,180

32
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,700
Rest assured. You and Susu
are devoted to each other.

00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,180

What's wrong?

40

Are you still upset?

41
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,260
I'm fine.

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,220
do you remember
the small wooden box under my bed

at the matchmaking agency?

45
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,580
I do.

could you bring it back to me?

- Okay.
- Shuangshuang.

Are you upset?

54
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,660
I wouldn't dare now that I'm living
under someone else's roof.

55
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,620
How is this living
under someone else's roof?

56
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,340
This is our home.

57
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,820
I know you're upset today,

58
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,740
but I didn't mean

59
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,260
to scold you in front of others.

60
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,340
It's just that your actions
were indeed inappropriate.

61
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,660
Me? What did I do wrong?

62
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,580
I invited Mr. Guo here today

63
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,100
to discuss the matters
regarding the matchmaking agency.

64
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,300
How could you pour hot water on him

65
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,900
and resist his advice so vehemently?

66
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,620
Don't you think he's rather flirtatious?

67
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,580
Shuangshuang,

68
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,420
Mr. Guo is someone important to us.

69
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,060
Don't jump to conclusions.

70
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,780
Mind your words,
or you might find trouble ahead.

71
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,460
Just think about it,

72
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,660
if you offend him

73
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,860
in the heat of the moment,

74
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,940
what good will it do for us,

76
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,460
or Lian and the others?

77
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,460
Don't you want to ensure

78
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,140
a better future for me
and everyone else?

79
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,980
But I...

80
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,260
All right,

81
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:32,700

Well,

86
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,540
I overheard you talking about Susu.

87
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,820
Who's that?

88
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,820
I heard that Lin Susu

89
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,620
took her own life because she
didn't want to marry into the Guo family

90
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,700
as a concubine.

91
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,060
Given the Lin family's status,

92
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,780
how could they let their daughter
be a concubine?

93
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,620
I heard

94
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,500
she eloped with someone else

95
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,540
and was caught red-handed.

96
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,900
With her reputation ruined,

97
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,860
she's lucky to be taken in
as a concubine by the Guo family.

98
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,100
What a pity.

99
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,820
Indeed, what a pity...

100
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,940
Let's go.

101
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:46,980
She was an old friend,

102
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,700
but sadly,
she passed away at a young age.

103
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,140
Passed away at a young age?
How did that happen?

104
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:53,980
Shuangshuang,

105
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,500
you're asking me so many questions.

106
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,260
Don't tell me you're jealous?

107
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,460
Yes, but since she's your old friend,

108
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,380
it's not a problem.

109
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,820
All right, stop overthinking it.

110
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,180
Get some rest.

111
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,380
I still need to prepare a small gift
to make things right with Mr. Guo.

112
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,580
Is it possible that Susu's death

113
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,300
has something to do with him?

I...

121
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,300
I should stay away from love,

122
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,340

is simply out of the question.

I'm just asking for a little guidance.

132
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,980
A dream would be enough.

133

there's been no one
fighting with me for food,

Nothing really.

Don't bother
with that pointless chatter.

You think I don't know
there's something on your mind?

154
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,540
It's those people down the mountain.

155
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,380
Every time they want
to join the Unfeeling Sect,

156
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,460
they sound so determined,

157
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,460
but then,

158
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,740
as soon as they change their mind,
they move on to the next relationship.

159
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,660
And that matchmaking agency's owner

160
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,620
is so convinced
that she has a matchmaking vision,

161
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,340
yet she doesn't even have
a romance line.

162
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,980
In the end, she's easily deceived
by some sweet talk.

163
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,220
Why do these people

164
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,540
always do such foolish things?

165
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,220
In this world, everything

166
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,340
is a mix of truth and falsehood.

167
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,500
Why do people choose to be unfeeling?

168
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,060
It's because they have been hurt
by love.

169
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,980
When there is a cause in the heart,

170
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,860
there will be an effect.

171
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,540
That effect is born from love.

172
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,820
The louder one shouts
about being unfeeling,

173
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,940
the harder it is for them
to let go and see the truth.

174
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,580
Master, your words are too confusing.

175

you need to be a person capable of love.
