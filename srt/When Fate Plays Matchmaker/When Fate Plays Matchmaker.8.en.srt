My bad. I'm sorry.

24
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,100
I had no intention
of behaving improperly toward her,

25
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,020
but she was the one who started it.

26
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,980
Well, whatever.

27
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,420
The matchmaking agency doesn't have
any customers right now anyway,

28
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,260
so maybe there's no need

29
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,980

I don't even know you.

50

Perhaps you've mistaken me
for someone else?

51
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,580
It's bad enough you abandoned me,

52
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,020
but now you act
like you don't even know me.

53
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,980

54
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,660

00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,460

00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,260
take a good look at me.

60
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,540
I'm not the person you're looking for.

61
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,540

I...

64
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,220
There's no way
I could have a child with her.

65
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,780
You still won't admit it?

66

Are you really going to say
that you're not Cheng Yin,

but I'm not the heartless man
you're looking for.

73
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,860
That day, you told me

74
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,420
you wanted to follow the Unfeeling Sect

75
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,460
to help others escape
the misery of marriage.

76
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,020
You asked me to support you,

77
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,420
so I gave up my marriage for you.
