00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,060
Miss Li,

59
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,740
I've never heard that your uncle
is the Grand Chancellor.

60
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,780
My father has been bedridden
for many years,

61
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,980
and our family is impoverished,

62
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,340
so no relatives
are willing to associate with us.

63
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,780
After you saved me that day,

64
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,100
I had nowhere else to go

65
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,100
so I turned to my mother's relatives.

66
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,660
It was then I unexpectedly learned

67
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,540
that my long-lost uncle
was a high-ranking official.

Yes.

to any lengths to secure a good match.
