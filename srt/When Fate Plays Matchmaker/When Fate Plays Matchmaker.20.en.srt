[Episode 20]

23
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,340
Lian,

24
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,660
you haven't taken out what's inside
that small wooden box, right?

25
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,900
I forgot. I'll go get it now, Miss Zhao.

26
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,540
Go now.

27
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,220
Shuangshuang,

28
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,100
are you hiding something from me?

29
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,500
Whatever it may be,

30
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,780
I'll help however I can,

31
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,420
at any cost.

32
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,900
Please don't worry
about dragging me into it.

33
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,420
There's truly nothing to worry about.

34
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,860
Like I said,

35
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,300
I'll just handle a small issue
before I come back.

36
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,380
This ointment
was given to me by my master.

37
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,540
It's very effective
for treating injuries.

38
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,780
Take it and apply it properly.

39
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,180
I will.

40
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,340
Miss Zhao,

41
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,180
about the things in the wooden box,

42
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,540
were you referring to
Lin Susu and Cheng Zhi?

43
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,780

00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,400
[Cheng Zhi]

45
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,740
That unscrupulous matchmaker was you.

46
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,180
Sui,

47
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,900
regarding Mr. Guo's matter,

48
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,060
I know I was in the wrong.

49
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,220
I heard the governess
mention that you like fish,

50
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,860
so I learned how to make it.

51
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,620
Please try it.

52
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:46,660
All right.

53
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,100
It's a bit too salty.

54
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,780
I'll use less salt next time.

55
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,580
I heard Mr. Guo
plans to take a concubine,

56
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,700
and I've already checked
the lady's romance line.

57
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,420
Yes.

58
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,700
But she and Mr. Zhou
have decided to marry each other.

59
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,820
Why separate them?

60
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,860
Of course, I know they are bonded
by a romance line.

61
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,260
But poverty can make a marriage
full of struggles.

62
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,100
Miss Li has a bedridden father

63
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,620
and a younger brother
waiting to be married.

64
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,660
If they depend on Mr. Zhou
for everything,

65
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,980
their future could be bleak.

66
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,140
But they are young and driven.

67
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,380
They've overcome so many hardships
in their early years,

68
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,500
and if Mr. Li passes away later,

69
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,780
they'll still be able to face

70
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,820
whatever life throws at them together.

71
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,060
What's most important
is that they love each other,

72
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,780
and the romance line can't be wrong.

73
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,940
Shuangshuang,

74
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,180
how could you have such naive thoughts?

75
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,940
In this world,

76
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,300
love isn't always enough
to solve everything.

77
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,660
Just like how I couldn't protect

78
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,980
my mother when I was powerless.

79
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,500
They're poor now,

80
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,420
and if illness strikes in the future,

81
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,060
they'll have no choice
but to wait for death.

82
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,620
It looks like I'm breaking them apart,

83
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,660
but in reality, I'm saving them.

84
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:09,820
Shuangshuang,

85
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,740
no one understands
the harsh realities of the world,

86
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,500
or the pain of losing loved ones,
better than I do.

87
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,700
Shuangshuang,

88
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,500
I know it's hard for you
to accept this right now,

89
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,720
but those who want
to achieve great things

90
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,900
can't get caught up in their feelings.

91
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,740
They must look at the bigger picture.

92
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,660
All right.

93
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,780
Let's not talk about this anymore.

94
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,540
The thing is,

95
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,060
I have to make this marriage happen

96
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,020
to complete my 81st task.

97
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,020
Only then can we have

98
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,100
a long-lasting relationship.

99
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,740

100
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,580

don't you?

102
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,020
All right, I'll let you
have your way this time.

103

Sui,

104
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,100
I'd like to take you to see
an old acquaintance before the wedding,

105
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,060
but it's a bit far.

106
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,460
Can you make time for it?

107
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,420
You have friends so far away?

108
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,820
Yes, his name is Cheng Zhi.

109
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,100
He's living in Jing Mountain now,

110
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,860
and he wrote to ask me
to arrange a marriage for him.

111
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,140
Shuangshuang,

112
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,580
you've been talking a lot
at the table today.

113
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,340
You go on and eat.

114
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,620
I still have important matters
to take care of.

115
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:32,820
By the way,

116
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,740
Mr. Guo won't come here anymore.

117
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,100
Do you know where Lin Susu is?

118
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,860
I went to the Lin's residence for her,

119
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,020
only to find they had moved away.

120
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,380
Actually,

121
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,060
Lin Susu is already dead.

122
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,420
Dead?

123
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,140
How could that be?

124
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,380
The Lin family claimed
she died of illness,

125
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,260
but the neighbors say

126
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,260
Lin Susu was caught
eloping with someone.

127
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,540
Then with her reputation ruined,
she was forced to become a concubine.

128
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,060
She refused

129
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,700
and eventually took her own life.

130

[Cheng Zhi]

131
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,660
It looks like the person

132
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,460
who secretly engaged with my senior

133
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,580
is Lin Susu.

134
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,660
But why would the Lin family
go to such extremes

135
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,740
to destroy him?

136
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,540
I want to show you something.

137
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,020
The Lin family once gave me
a letter of annulment,

138
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,180
saying the divorce

139
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,900
was mandatory.

140
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,940
[Annulment letter]
But as far as I know,

141
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,260
Cheng Zhi isn't the son
of the Lin family's sworn enemy.

142
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,380
I suspect that your senior's death

143
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,700
might be caused
by a wrongful accusation.

144
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,100
But my senior
was always so kind-hearted.

145
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,100
Who could possibly want to harm him?

146
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,460
Do you know which family
Lin Susu was sent to as a concubine?

147
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,460
It's Guo Chuan, Mr. Guo.

148
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,300
So,

149
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,700
you suspect that Mr. Guo was the one
who caused my senior's death?

150
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,420
Guo Chuan is certainly to blame,

151
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,180
but Cao Sui is also involved.

152
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,300
Cao Sui?

153
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,660
I was at the guesthouse that day

154
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,860
and overheard them mention Lin Susu.

155
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,140
That's when I began to suspect
that your senior's death

156
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,140
might be related to them.

157
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,340
Is that why you wanted
to return to the guesthouse?

158
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,060
Yes, if I don't return now,

159
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,940
I'll never have the chance
to uncover the truth.

160
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,580
What if the only way
to uncover the truth

161
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,460
is by marrying Cao Sui?

162
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,660
If there's really no other choice,

163
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,380
then I will do it.

164
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,100
But I won't let you.

165
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,660
Shuangshuang,

166
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,740
I don't want you to marry
that horrible man, Cao Sui,

167
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,300
just to uncover the truth.

168
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,180
We can pursue the truth together.

169
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,260
Can you not go back?

170
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,740
I have to.

171
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,740
This matter has troubled you
for many years,

172
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,060
and me as well.

173
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,540
I couldn't get
to the bottom of it before,

174
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,820
but now that I have this opportunity,
I can't let it slip away.

175
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,100
But...

176
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,980
Don't worry. I'll just test the waters.

177
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,220
If anything feels off,

178
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,420
I'll have Lian come back to tell you.

179
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,340
Then you can come and rescue me, okay?

180
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:34,980
Lian,

181
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,020
go back to the matchmaking agency
and let everyone know

182
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,780
