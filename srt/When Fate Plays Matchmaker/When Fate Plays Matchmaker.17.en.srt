[Episode 17]

23
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,020
Have you finished
your marriage divination?

24
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,220
Has he presented the betrothal gifts?

25
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,980
Is the wedding date fixed?

26
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,140
He's asking you to move in
without handling any of those things.

27
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,820
He doesn't even care
about your reputation.

28
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:24,740
Also,

29
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,540
the other day at the Yue Lao Temple,

30
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,820
some men made advances
on Zhao Shuangshuang.

31
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:28,860
Were they sent by you?

32
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,300
I saw three scoundrels
in the bamboo forest...

33
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,260
Mr. Cheng, you seem to have
some misunderstanding about me.

34
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,220
If that's the case,

35
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,140
please allow me
to offer my apologies first.

36
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,540
Cheng Yin, stop making a scene.

37
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,820
Sui, let me talk to him for a moment.

38
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,540
Sure.

39
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,260
Cheng Yin, are you done yet?

40
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,220
What do you mean by that?

41
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,460
Why don't you trust me?

42
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,940
Do you even know the Cao family?

43
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,420
They're rushing to make you marry him

44
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,180
probably because they want to use you.

45
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,220
If his way of using me

46
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,900
is by spending time with me

47
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,420
and making sure everyone
at the matchmaking agency thrives,

48
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,940
I'd gladly let him use me.

49
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,260
Zhao Shuangshuang,
what crazy talk is this?

50
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,100
Cheng Yin,

51
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,140
we're both orphans,

52
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,860
both longing for a home.

53
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,540
Now that my dream is about to come true,

54
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,900
why are you trying to stop me?

55
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,140
Shuangshuang,

56
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:20,900
I like you.

57
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,460
I could start a family with you, too.

58
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,140
Cheng Yin, what nonsense
are you talking about?

59
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,860
You're from the Unfeeling Sect.

60
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,620
So what do you know?

61
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,380
I...

62
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,900
Whatever you say today,

63
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,620
you're coming with me.

64
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,380
Cheng Yin,

65
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,980
you used to go against me

66
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,740
to recruit disciples
for your Unfeeling Sect.

67
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,420
Now, you're plotting against Cao Sui

68
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,980
and lying to me, saying you like me.

69
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,140
What do you really want?

70
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,860
If you're trying
to make me give up my marriage

71
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,780
and go back
to the Unfeeling Sect with you,

72
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,900
then I'm sorry,
you shouldn't have come to me.

73
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,740
You can go back alone.

74
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,860
Sui, when can I move in?

75
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,820
Anytime you want.

76
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,260
How about tonight then?

77
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,180
Didn't you say the governess
would teach me etiquette?

78
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,700
Then, aside from Lian,

79
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,780
don't let anyone else
come and disturb me.

80
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,300
All right.

81
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,500
Mr. Liang, I'm going back
to the Unfeeling Sect.

82
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,820
When you have time,
check on the Cao family's stance.

83
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,780
Keep an eye on Cao Sui

84
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,700
and make sure Zhao Shuangshuang
doesn't suffer any unfair treatment.

85
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,620
Behave yourself
and don't fail Shuangshuang.

86
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,380

the consequences will be grave.

87
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,700

89
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,300
Don't worry. Ms. Wu isn't around.

90
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,580
That frightened me.

91
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,860
You must be exhausted
getting up so early every day

92
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,140
to study.

93
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,220
Tell me about it.

94
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,100
I'm so sleepy.

95
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,140
And what's with all this nonsense
in the book?

96
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,020
I can't remember a thing.

97
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,660
Let me take a look.

98
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,860
You should take a break now
while you can.

99
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,900
That governess is really harsh,

100
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,700
punishing you
for such a small mistake.

101
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,300
I won't stand it.
I'm going to tell Mr. Cao about this.

102
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,460
When have I ever given up?

103
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,980
Rest assured. In less than a month,

104
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,420
I'll make those people
see me differently.

105
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,340
I'll show that governess
what I'm capable of.

106
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,980
Yes,

108
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,780
Oh, by the way,

109
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,020
look what I brought you.

110
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,580
Tanghulu. Where did you get this from?

111
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,700
You know,

112
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,820
I've been stuck here lately,

113
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,100
not allowed to eat anything I want,

114
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,420
and I'm starving.

115
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,660
I returned to the matchmaking agency
this morning

116
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,500
and bought this for you.

117
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,580
The taste is still the same as before.

118
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,940
Cheng Yin once went

119
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,380
to Madam Su's store to buy this for me.

120
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,260
What has Cheng Yin been up to lately?

121
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,860
I haven't heard anything from him.

122
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,860
He left the day we moved
into the guesthouse.

123
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,620
He left?

124
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,540
Where did he go?

125
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,060
He went back to the Unfeeling Sect.

126
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,060
He went back.

127
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,740
Miss Zhao, there's a guest in the study.
Mr. Cao requests your presence.

128
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,460
Coming.

129
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,420
Sui promised before

130
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,700
to recommend you and Hongdou
as official matchmakers.

131
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,540
It might just be today.

132
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,540
Miss Zhao,
I don't want to be apart from you.

133
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,540
Be good.

134
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,420
I can't hold you back forever.

135
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,700
I have to secure
a good future for you both.

136
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,020
This is your opportunity. So seize it.

137
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,140

00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,580
my stuff...?

142

and will be delivered
to your residence soon.

145
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,020
That's good.

146
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,180
But,

147
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,540
let's be honest here.

148
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,860
What you've sent over in recent years

149
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,420
is nowhere near as good as Susu
from back then.

150
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,260
Susu?

151
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,020

Susu, my dear daughter,

00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:50,500
how could you
depart this life before me?

155
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,540
What took you so long, Shuangshuang?

156
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,780
Come. This is Mr. Guo.

157
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,980
We're counting on him for the positions
of official matchmakers.

158

Greetings, Mr. Guo.

159
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,100
I've asked the kitchen staff

160
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,540
to prepare some food and snacks for you.

161
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,380
I hope you won't find them lacking.

162
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,540
Shouldn't you

be pouring me a cup of tea, Miss?

164
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,020
You burned me!
Are you blind or something?

165
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,460
Mr. Guo, are you all right?

166
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,500
I'm so sorry.

167
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,180
Apologize to Mr. Guo now.

168
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,740
I'm sorry.

169
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:03,580
You have quite a temper
as a mere matchmaker, huh?

170
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:04,700
Miss Zhao,

171
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,100
let me remind you of something.

172
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,020
With your current status,

173
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,700
you're far from worthy

174
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,700
of becoming a concubine
in the Cao family.

175
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,980
Mr. Cao is a man
of great loyalty and honor,

176
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,620
and he wants to marry you.

177
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,740
I hope you won't let him down

178
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,860
or disgrace him in the future.

179
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,260
I...

180
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,060
Shuangshuang!

181
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,420
I'll remember

182
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,420
