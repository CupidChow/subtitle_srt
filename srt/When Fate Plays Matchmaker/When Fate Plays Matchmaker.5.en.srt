00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,980
Mr. Sun was nervous and drank

25
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:19,860
some liquor before going out.

26
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,060
He might have gotten drunk
and couldn't control himself.

27
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,660
That's why this happened.

that Mr. Tang was blind in one eye

34
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,260

Before going on the date, he fell

39

and injured the corner of his eye.

40
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,220
That's why Mrs. Qian thought

198
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,300
