[Episode 7]

23
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,340
I'm so hungry.

24
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,260
I'll go make something for you.

25
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,340
What's that smell?

26
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,700
Who brought fertilizer in here?

27
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,220
What fertilizer?

28
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,420
I made the dishes for you.

29
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,060
Come.

30
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,060
Try it.

31
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,140
Here I present blood tofu soup,

32
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,540

lamb offal stew,

34
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,740
and stinky tofu.

35
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,380
Take it all away. It stinks!

36
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,300
Miss Zhao, you asked me

37
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,620
to treat the agency like my home.

38
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,580
I was really happy

39
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,340
and prepared the things I like for you.

40
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,700
Since you want me to take them away,

41
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,980
I...

42
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,260
This is your favourite food?

43
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,380
Then don't take it away.

44
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,540
Put it down, I'll try it.

45
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,140
Okay!

46
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,260
You can even tolerate this?

47
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,660
This will be nice
if you eat it together.

48
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,420
Here.

49
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,100
Actually, my stomach hurts today.

50
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,420
I think all these flavors
are too strong.

51
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,260
I want to go and eat some noodles.

52
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,220
Noodles?

00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:47,820
Where are the noodles?

57
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,300
Is the main ingredient cilantro?

58
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,180
Miss Zhao, you don't like cilantro?

59
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,900
I can't eat anything without cilantro.

60
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,380
That's why I wanted you to try it.

61
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,140
You...

62
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:09,620

You can't eat this!

What are you doing now?

73
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,300
There's yam in it!

74
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,740
Yam?

75
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,660
Miss Zhao, if you eat yam,
you'll get rashes.

76
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,340
That's right!

77
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,740
How did you know I can't eat yam?

78
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,500
Mr. Liang told me.

79
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,780
Lian,

80
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:39,740
what are you doing?

81
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,620
If you're looking for food for her,

82
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,780
you should be careful!

83
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,540
I hid it away on purpose!

84
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,940
Why didn't you say such things when you

85
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,780
made me eat
all those stinky dishes?

86
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,980
Today,

87
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,060
I'm not really hungry.

88
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,580
I'm not eating anymore.

90
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,780
I'll go out and get you some food.

91
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,180
Why go out?

92
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,180
I have prepared everything.

93
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,060
We have an abundance.

00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,140
Let's try it together!

95
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:08,740
Feel free to eat.

96
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,580
I don't want to eat.

97
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,740
Let's go.

98
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,740
- I don't want to eat!
- Have a little.

99
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,540
Didn't you say you weren't going to eat?

100
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,580
Since you were so sincere,

101
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,180
I just ate a little.

102
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,940
A little?

103
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,260
You ate everything.

104
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,220
I didn't even eat anything.

105
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:47,860
You...

106
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,780
didn't prepare that much.

107
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,460
I didn't eat too much.

108
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,380
Lian, let's go back!

109
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,540
Yes.

110
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,460
I never expected
she could like me this much.

111
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,820
She ate all the food she hated.

112
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,620
What do I do now?

113
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,460
Do I

114
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,660
really have to sacrifice myself?

115
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:29,820
Lian,

116
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,260
are you sure it's here?

117
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,140
I'm sure,

118
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:33,740

119
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,420
I've followed him secretly a few times.

120
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,180
Cheng Yin speaks like a gentleman

121
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,540
but comes to a pleasure house.

122
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,580
Such a hypocrite!

123
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,540
I take back what I said before.

124
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:43,940
Let's not bother about him

125
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,380
and let him destroy himself.

126
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,220
Lian,

127
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,260
I think Cheng Yin might be daring,

128
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,700
but he's not a bad guy.

129
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,980
Is he trying to promote
the Unfeeling Sect inside?

130
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,340
No, I have to take a look.

131
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:57,860
Miss...

132
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,140
Don't come in. Wait here.

133
00:05:59,420 --> 00:05:59,780
Miss...

134
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,420
Wait!

135
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,180
Miss Zhao!

136
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,980
Sir, come and get me!

137
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,820
Lian is right.

138
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,540
Cheng Yin is a hypocrite,
coming to this pleasure house every day!

139
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,500
Well...

140
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,220
Where are you?

141
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,740
Here!

142
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,500
Come get me!

143
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,260
Here.

144
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,140
Here!

00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:18,980
Cheng Yin!

146
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,380
You philanderer!

147
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,300
What are you doing?

148
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,300
What could I do here?

149
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,900
I'm

150
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,980
having fun.

151
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,100
Sir.

152
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,820
Miss, take this.

153
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:52,980
Alright!

154
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:53,740
Thank you!

155
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,180
Why are you leaving?

156
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,580
Remember to come to the Unfeeling...

157
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:05,860
Cheng Yin!

158
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,020
You're really going all out
just to recruit people

159
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,660
into the Unfeeling Sect.

160
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:10,940
I want to!

161
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,020
What does it have to do with you?

162
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:13,820
You want to?

163
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,660
The girls here already
have a tough life.

164
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,740
You still try to cheat them
into joining your sect?

165
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,780
Do you have a conscience?

166
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,260
None of your business.

167
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,540
You...

168
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,380
What?

169
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,460
Of course

170
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,500
I'm showing you
how to make ladies happy.

00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,460
I don't need you to worry about that.

Miss Zhao,

173
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,580
are you satisfied with me?

174
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:03,940
Impossible.

175
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,620
I must have caught a cold.

176
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,900
