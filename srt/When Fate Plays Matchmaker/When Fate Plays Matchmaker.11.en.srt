[Episode 11]

23
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,100
Weren't we supposed

24
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,620
to help Miss Song together?

25
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,700
Why is there suddenly

26
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,740
an unknown person showing up?

27
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,100
Didn't you tell me this afternoon
that you weren't willing to help me?

28
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,820
But I just changed my mind.

29
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,860
Well, it's a bit late
for you to change your mind.

30
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,580
Mr. Cao

31
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,180
has already agreed to help me

32
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,300
and even gave me
these delicious apricot cakes.

33
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,060
Have you never had apricot cakes before?

34
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,340
Look at you,
all excited over something so trivial.

35
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,900
My senior always warned me

36
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,020
not to eat anything
from unknown sources.

37
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:50,900
What's this?

38
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,580
It's none of your business.

39
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,180
Mr. Cao,

40
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,940
why are you in my room?

41
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,740
Tanghulu.

42
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,300
Are those for me?

43
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,220
We shouldn't eat anything
from unknown sources.

44
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,380
What a waste.

45
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,700
Then, give it back to me.

46
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,500
You even got Tanghulu
from Madam Su's place.

47
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,260
That's really showing some effort.

48
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,460
So, since you've seen the effort I made
to get these candied hawthorns for you,

49
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,580
could you stop helping Miss Song
with the matchmaking?

50
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,260
It's not out of the question,

51
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,380
but you'll have to stay
in my matchmaking agency

52
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,180
and not cause any trouble.

53
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,900
Only then will I consider it.

54
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,340
I knew it.

55
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,300
You're just trying to keep me close.

56
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,180
Fine, no problem.

57
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,580
It's settled then,

58
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,980
we'll help Miss Song together.

59
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:44,620
All right,

60
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,060
thanks for it.

61
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,420
Forget about that Mr. Cao.

62
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,460
Things just wouldn't work without me.

63
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,020
No.

64
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,140
- I don't want to go.
- You have to go.

65
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,260
You've got to go.

66
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,900
Please, Mr. Liang, I'm begging you.

67
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,620
Come on,

00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,740

69
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,580
You look great.

70
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,540
Let's go now.

71
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,220
Do I really look great?

72
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,140
You really do.

73
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,780
Mrs. Yuan, the Jia family has served
in official posts for three generations,

74
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,220
and Miss Jia is a true beauty,
with delicate eyebrows,

75
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,860
her skin as smooth and clear as snow,

76
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,460
and her teeth
as white and neat as pearls.

77
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,100
Miss Zhao, since you put it this way,

78
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,980
we'll take a look.

79
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,420
We're here.

80
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,580
Greetings, Mrs. Yuan.

81
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,420
Mother, she's stunning.

82
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,420
I've heard

83
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,860
that the Yuan and Song families
had an engagement arranged.

84
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,460
I didn't want her

85
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,380
to come,

86
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,260
but my daughter here

87
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,260
just can't stop thinking about Mr. Yuan.

88
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,340
Mother,

89
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,300
why bring this up?

90
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,980
Look at you, getting all shy now.

91
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,140
That's still a long way off.

92
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,340
Who in Lin'an would want

93
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,140
to marry someone like Song Wan?

94
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:28,900
If you ask me,

95
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:32,620
a woman should stay home,

96
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,900
be filial to her in-laws,

97
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,300
and give birth of babies.

98
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,220
But look at her,

99
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,900
she's out every day
and even opposing the Yuan family.

100
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,420
She's really tarnishing our reputation.

101
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,460
So, according to your wishes,

102
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,180
regarding the matter
of taking concubines...

103
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,100
What you are trying to say is...

104
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,220
Well, it's normal for men
to have a few concubines.

105
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,820
I'm just having an honest conversation
with you, my dear in-law.

106
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,700
Since we're getting along so well,
Mrs. Jia,

107
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,020
I

108
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,420
will be honest.

109
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,460
My son has been keeping
a few mistresses,

110
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,020
but don't worry,

111
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,780
that doesn't count.

112
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,660
If Miss Jia marries in,
she will be the legitimate wife.

113
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,220
Mrs. Song,

114
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,500
how come you are here?

115
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,900
If I hadn't come,

116
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,340
you would have kept this from me.

117
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,780
Back when the Yuan family
was eager to ally with the Song family,

118
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,900
you made
all sorts of grandiose promises.

119
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,380
Now,

120
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,720
not only have you broken off
the engagement

121
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,060
and taken concubines
without my knowledge,

122
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,540
but you're also slandering my daughter.

123
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,180
If I hadn't heard it with my ears,

124
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,740
you would've ruined my daughter's life.

125
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,940
I was just speaking the plain truth.

126
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,740
Didn't you want to marry her

127
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,580
into the Yuan family for her future?

128
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,660
So why act so holier-than-thou now?

129
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,060
That doesn't mean
she should be mistreated by her in-laws.

130
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,740
If someone like you
is going to be her mother-in-law,

131
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,140
I'd rather she never marry.

132
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,700
The Song family

133
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,500
can provide for her.

134
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,190
It looks like the engagement

135
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,700
between the Yuan and Song families
is still valid.

136
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,500
My poor, naive daughter,

137
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,500
you'd better move on now.

138
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,300
How am I supposed

139
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,140
to show my face after this?

140
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,740
How am I supposed to live now?

141
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,940
Oh, my dear daughter.

142
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,660
Mrs. Jia.

143
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,140
This is such a shame.

144
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,060
The engagement
with Miss Jia is off, too.

145
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,100
What should I do now?

146
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,620
Why are you looking at me?

147
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,460
Miss Zhao,

148
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,620
you're responsible

149
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,140
for what happened today.

150
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,580
Why should I take responsibility?

151
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,780
If it weren't for you singing
the Jia family's praises,

152
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,060
would we have come?

153
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,260
And would we have fallen out
with the Song family?

154
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,220
I don't care,

155
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,780
you have to make it right
with a new marriage arrangement

156
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,020
and the other family's status

157
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,180
can't be inferior to the Song family's.

158
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,340
Mrs. Yuan,

159
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,100
you've been greedy
and trying to have it all.

160
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,700
That's what ruined the marriage.

161
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,380
What does this have to do with me?

162
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,580
So, you're saying this is my fault?

163
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,140
Is this how you work as a matchmaker?

164
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,980
Listen,

165
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,020
if you can't arrange
a suitable marriage for my family,

166
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,260
I'll tear down your matchmaking agency.

167
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,260
Yes, we'll tear it down.

168
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,820
I've always provided
the matchmaking service with integrity.

169
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,220
After seeing what your Yuan family
is really like today,

170
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,300
I won't let another girl

171
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,740
marry into your horrible family.

172
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,300
Tear down this matchmaking agency
if you want.

173
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,220

Are you all right, Cheng Yin?

Mother, let's get out of here now.

I'm all right.

Come with me.
