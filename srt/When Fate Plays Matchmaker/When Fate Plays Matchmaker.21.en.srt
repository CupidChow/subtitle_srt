[Episode 21]

23
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,020
Bad news.

24
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,300
What's wrong?
Did something happen to Shuangshuang?

25
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,660
Say something.

26
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,700
It's not Mrs. Zhao.

27
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,820
It's Miss Li.

28
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,580
I just heard

29
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,140
that she's already married to Mr. Guo.

30
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,660
Didn't Lian say before

31
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,180
that Miss Li was supposed
to marry Mr. Zhou?

32
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,460
Yes, I don't know why

33
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,020
she ended up marrying Guo Chuan.

34
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,860
Does Shuangshuang know about this?

35
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,140
I've already sent someone to inform her.

36
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,780
Bad news.

37
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,420
Bad news. Mr. Liang, Cheng Yin,

38
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,580
help Miss Zhao.

39
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,100
What happened to Shuangshuang? Tell me.

40
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,660
Make it clear.

41
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,500
Miss Zhao just rescued Miss Li

42
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,900
from Guo's Mansion,

43
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,500
and is now confronting Cao Sui.

44
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,860
Why do I have to worry
so much about you all recently?

45
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,860
Wait for me.

46
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,020
I'll rely on you for this matter.

47
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,340
Be careful with the steps.

48
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,300
Also, Mr. Guo,

49
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,900
we'd better not meet here next time.

50
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,020
Zhao Shuangshuang
has already found out about Lin Susu.

51
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,100
So what?

52
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,340
What can a mere matchmaker do to me?

53
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,300
By the way,

54
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,900
find that Li woman for me.

55
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,340
How dare she escape!
I'll make sure she regrets it.

56
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,100
My father

57
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,660
once had a serious illness relapse,

58
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,020
but thanks to Mr. Guo,
he narrowly escaped death.

59
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,580
I truly appreciated it.

60
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,900
But after marrying into the Guo family,

61
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,580
I discovered that it was all a trap.

62
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,100

[Li Jingshu]

64
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,940
but Guo Chuan refused.

65
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,140
He even abused me.

66
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,860
When I tried to escape,

67
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,060
no matter where I went,

Miss Li,

70
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,700
I'm at fault
for what has happened to you.

71
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,140
Miss Zhao,

72
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,340
you've been deceived by Cao Sui, too.

73
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,100
I overheard

74
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,500
that Cao Sui married you

75
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,100
just to control your agency

76
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,380
and help high-ranking officials
find concubines.

77
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,780
Farewell, sir.

78
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,860
Go and catch them.

79
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,100
How come you're here?

80
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,100
What? Am I not allowed to be here?

81
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,220
Is it that I'm not supposed
to see you and Guo Chuan

82
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,740
doing wicked deeds?

83
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,780
Or that I'm not meant to know

84
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,860
you were responsible for the deaths
of Cheng Zhi and Lin Susu?

85
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,300
Cao Sui,

86
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,620
I always thought
you were my destined partner,

87
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,740
but it turns out
you were just using me all along.

88
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:20,660
Shuangshuang,

89
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,260
it's not what you think.

90
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,540
I do love you.

91
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,860
Tell me,

92
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,980
did you and Guo Chuan scheme
to have Miss Li

93
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,660
marry into the Guo family?

94
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,380
Calm down.

95
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,220
The reason I'm doing this is...

96
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,220
Was it you behind what happened

97
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,300
to Lin Susu as well?

98
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:40,820
Tell me!

99
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,300
Can you guess
what that person went out to do?

100
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,540
He went to catch those folks

101
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,060
from the matchmaking agency.

102
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,420
Find that Li woman for me.

103
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,420
This person

104
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,300
looks kind of familiar.

105
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,020
So Cao Sui has been setting me up
from the very beginning.

106
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,180
Kill me.

107
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,060
Come on!

108
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,660
I'll give you the chance.

109
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,100
For every wound you inflict on me,

110
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,660
I'll make sure one of them pays.

111
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,980
And if I die,

112
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,620
these four will go down with me.

113
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,940
You're shameless!

114
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,580
Shuangshuang,

115
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,900
you're better suited
to accompany me in the guesthouse.

116
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:38,780
Shuangshuang,

117
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,980
I truly love you.

118
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,140
If you agree to share your life with me,

119
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,380
we'll have wealth and prestige
beyond measure.

120
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,740
Isn't that enough?

121
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,260
I can't bear this kind of life.

122
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,300
I only help those
who are meant to be together.

123
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,100
I don't care for wealth, prestige,

124
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,220
or empty titles.

125
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,180
Get real!

126
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,580
Being kind-hearted
won't guarantee success.

127
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,940
It won't pave my way to the top.

128
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,780
Nor will it bring
my mother back to life!

129
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,100
Is that why you killed Cheng Zhi
and Lin Susu?

130
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,060
It wasn't me who killed him,

131
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,860
but Lin Susu!

132
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,740
If she had agreed to marry Mr. Guo
as his concubine,

133
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,900
I wouldn't have had to make up stories
in front of the Lin family,

134
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,500
saying he was the son
of their sworn enemy.

135
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,020
Cao Sui,

136
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,700
I didn't expect you to be so cruel.

137
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,820
I truly regret it.

138
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,100
I should never have brought you food
in the first place.

139
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,380
From today on,

140
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,180
our engagement

141
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,820
is dissolved.

142
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,340
From now on,

143
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,860
we'll have nothing to do
with each other.

144
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,140
Let go of me!

145
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,820
What can you do once you leave here?

146
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,860
Do you really think
you're the top matchmaker in Lin'an?

147
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,300
You only succeeded
because of your matchmaking vision.

148
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,500
Now that it's been taken away,

149
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,060
what's left for you?

150
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,700
How do you know that?

151
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,220
I heard you and Lian talking that day.

152
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,180
I've plotted so much,

153
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,500
but I never considered using it

154
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,020
to threaten you.

155
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,180
Why?

156
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,220
Because I truly love you.

157
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,140
Yet now, you want to leave me.

158
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,260
Let go of me!

159
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,460
Don't forget.

160
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,780
They're still in my hands.

161
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,420
If you step out of this door today,

162
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,860
tomorrow will be their doomsday.

163
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,700
Cao Sui, you're despicable!

164
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,420
That's right.

165
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,980
From now on, if there's anything I want,

166
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,860
no one can stop me.

167
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,420
Our wedding will be in two days.

168
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,180
What you choose to do

169
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,460
is entirely up to you.

170
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,740
Miss Zhao,

171
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,460
have you decided to marry Cao Sui?

172
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,980
Why not escape now

173
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,260
while no one's around?

174
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,100
If I leave now,

175
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,900
Cheng Yin and the others
will be in danger.

176
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,220
I can't just walk away like this.

177
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,580
But Miss Zhao,

178
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,540
you mustn't place yourself
in such danger.

179
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,180
Cheng Yin has his trick of deception,

180
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,820
they might have already escaped.

181
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,500
But if you
did marry into the Cao family,

182
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,820
do you think they would release you
without consequences?

183
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,020
You always put others first,

184
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,340
but what about yourself?

185
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,220
I can't let Cheng Yin

for his senior's death.
