what is that?

When matchmakers talk about potential,

74

it means the person

Excelling at managing a family

just means

Huang Cuihua never asked him
to cut back on what he spent on poetry.

121

as long as we see anyone
from the Unfeeling Sect,

140
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,300

Are you alright?

148
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,540
I'm fine.

149
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,580
That's good.

150
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:14,860
Mr. Liang,

00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,340
I'm here.

154
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,540
Shuangshuang is fine.

155
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,740
Good.

156
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,940
I'll go now.

157
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,020
You're already injured.

158
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,260
Where are you going?

159
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,820
What if they come after you again?

160
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:28,900
You're not going anywhere!

161
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,620
Even if they come after me,

162
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,860
that's my concern.

163
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,420
I can't get you in trouble.

164
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,580
Miss Zhao.

165
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,740
Although Cheng Yin
has a lot of funny ideas,

166
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,820
at least

167
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,500
he is also a kind person
who owns up to what he did does.

168
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,700
No kind person
breaks up others' marriages!

169
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,660
Are we going to chase him out then?

170
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,140
Why does he not have
any romance lines either?

171
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,140
Then, won't he be alone in the future?

172
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,140
They abandoned me when I was young.

173
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,740
Last night,

174
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,340
where did he sleep?

175
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,020
I heard from Mr. Liang

176
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,540
that he slept at the abandoned temple
next to that burial site.

177
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,060
Forget it.

178
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,460
I know how to repay favors.

179
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,340
For now,

180
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,940
he can stay here and recover.

181
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,500
Miss Zhao,

182
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,980
since you let him stay,

183
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,100
why don't you try

184
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,380
to change the way he thinks?

185
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,940
If he doesn't cause more trouble,

186
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,340
wouldn't you

187
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,060
be able to put
the 81st couple together sooner?

188
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,460
That's true.

189
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,020
That's better than him

190
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,540
doing something more ridiculous.

191
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:48,380
Let's go.

192
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,780
Don't worry about Shuangshuang.

193
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,460
I...

194
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,380
She...

195
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,260
asked me to stay?

196
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,060
She didn't say that specifically,

197
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:02,900
but

198
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,020
she didn't ask me
to chase you out either.

199
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,060
You

200
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,380
just stay here

201
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,180
and recover.

202
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:13,900
Take a good rest.

203
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,540
She already knows
that we're on opposite sides,

204
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,060
yet she still treats me so well

205
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,620
and wants me to stay.

206
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,100
She's not just into me.

207
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,060
She's hopelessly obsessed.

208
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,220
Looks like

209
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,460
if I want to close this place down,

210
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,860
I have to help her come to her senses,

211
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,580
and get rid

212
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,540
of her feelings.

213
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,140
Now Zhao Shuangshuang

214
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,660
won't like me anymore.
