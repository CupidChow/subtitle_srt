It's not over yet,

24
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,020
and I need to bring it to a close.

25
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,340
For an ordinary person,
suing an official is long and painful.

26
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,380
But

27
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,860

I am Zhao Shuangshuang. I'm here to file
a lawsuit against Cao Sui and Guo Chuan.

54
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,220
Cao Sui broke up others' marriages

55
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,060
and tricked a young woman
into becoming Guo Chuan's concubine.

56
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,700
They can all testify.

57
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,060
- Yes.
- Yes.

58
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,500
Sir,

59
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,420
everything Miss Zhao says is true.

60
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,460
Cao Sui once forced my daughter
to marry Guo Chuan as a concubine.

61
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,380
My daughter
would rather die than comply

62
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,980
and she ended her life
by jumping in a well.

63
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,580
Sir, please uphold justice for me.

64
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,460
Yes, sir.

65
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,180
Guo Chuan also forced my niece
into marrying him

66
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,100
and even

67
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,220
had her husband killed later.

00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,580
please bring them to justice.

00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,580

Sir,

73
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,820
Cao Sui has admitted

74
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,060
that to win Guo Chuan's favor,

75
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,860
he broke up the marriage
between Lin Susu and Cheng Zhi,

76
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,500
forcing Lin Susu to marry Guo Chuan
as a concubine.

77
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,700
When Lin Susu refused,

78
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,500
Guo Chuan had people lie,

79
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,860
claiming Cheng Zhi was the son
of the Lin family's sworn enemy,

80
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,940
which incited
the Lin family to kill him.

81
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,900
Sir, I implore you to look into this.

82
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,100
Sir,

83
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,460
Cheng Zhi is my senior.

84
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,060
I can testify.

00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:34,980
Mr. Cao,

86
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,540
please explain what happened.

00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,100
may I have a word with her
before we proceed?

89
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,740
Shuangshuang,
please stop being mad at me.

90
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:49,660
I know

91
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,820
that you've been upset with me
because of the etiquette lessons.

92
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,580
But everything I did

93
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,660
was for our future.

94
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,740
Perhaps I neglected
how it made you feel,

95
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,500
which led to
all these misunderstandings.

96
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,500
It's my fault

97
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,700
and I hope you will forgive me.

98
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:12,100
Miss Zhao, are you willing
to forgive Cao Sui?

99
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,820
What if I forgive him?

100
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,900
Very well.

101
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,300
Since this case concerns
the inner chambers

102
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,860
and Cao Sui has sincerely apologized

103
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,940
and been forgiven by Miss Zhao,

104
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,180
I declare that Cao Sui is not guilty.

105
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,820
Sir, please wait.

106
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,860
I haven't finished yet.

107
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,420
What if I refuse?

108
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,260
I came to court today

109
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,260
not for relationship disputes,

110
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,500
but to sue Cao Sui

111
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:48,740
and Guo Chuan

112
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,500
for abusing their power
and leading to innocent deaths.

113
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,980
Cao Sui is trying to cloud the truth
with relationship problems

114
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,500
in an attempt to deceive you.

115
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,380
Sir, I hope you
can handle this case justly.

116
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,500
- Please handle this case justly.
- Please handle this case justly.

117
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,180
Impudent!

118
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,500
Did I act unjustly?

119
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,020
Mr. Cao,

120
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,980
is there anything else you want to say?

121
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,740
Sir, what they've said is not the truth.

122
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,590
I spent my youth studying elsewhere,

123
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,420
focusing only on achieving
academic success

124
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,940
and didn't know them.

125
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,940
I only recently became acquainted
with Mr. Guo.

126
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,380
To be honest,

127
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,020
Miss Zhao helped me before,

128
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,340
and I am grateful to her.

129
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,100
That's why I wish to marry her.

130
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,980
To fulfill my promise,

131
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,060
I asked Mr. Guo to help her

132
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,580
and the others at the matchmaking agency
to secure a livelihood.

133
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,140
However,
after being deceived by Cheng Yin,

134
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,020
a disciple of the Unfeeling Sect,

135
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,460
Miss Zhao repeatedly misunderstood me

136
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,460
and even tried to kill me.

137
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,660
I hope you will make
a fair judgment, sir.

138
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,220
Sir, everything I've said is true.

139
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,700
Lian, Hongdou, and Liang Yidao

140
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,420
can all testify for me.

141
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,300
- Yes.
- Yes.

142
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,700
Did I ask you to speak?

143
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:06,940
Besides,

144
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,580
these three are all your associates.

145
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,500
How can their testimony
be considered fair?

146
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,220
Apart from these witnesses,

147
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,060
do you have any physical evidence?

148
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,380
Seems you have none.

149
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,060
In that case,

150
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,300
do you know
that falsely accusing a court official

151
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,740
is a serious crime?

152
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:28,780
