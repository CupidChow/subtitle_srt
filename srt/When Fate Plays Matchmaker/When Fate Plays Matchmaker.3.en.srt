What if he tricks you

191
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,940
and, after you attain that goal,

192
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,860
he doesn't meet his end of the deal?

193
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,900
What would you do?

194
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,140
You're suspecting me?

195
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,740
Fine.

196
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,780
I'll prove it to you!

197
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,420
