No,

26
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:22,860
it's dangerous.

00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,740
even so, I still have to go.

Mr. Cao,

34
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,300
forgive me for speaking out of turn,

35
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,540
but a month ago,

36
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,980
Miss Zhao already checked
the romance lines

37
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,980
for Miss Li and Mr. Zhou.

38
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,700
They are truly fated for each other.

39
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,620
Mr. Liang.

40
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:27,980
Mr...

41
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,460
Mr. Guo is already over 50,

Why is he here?

46
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,340
I'm afraid that's not quite right.

47
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,380
Do you think I'm unaware of this?

48
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,580
Shuangshuang is still inexperienced,

49
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,660
so it's normal for her
to have overlooked some things.

50
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,140
Just follow my orders.

Mr. Liang,

70
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,020
please tell me the information

71
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:27,940
you've gathered first.

72
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,060
What information?

73
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,140
Sorry, I let my temper
get the best of me.

74
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,220
Let me tell you.

75
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,060
The cook at the Cao family
is an old acquaintance of mine.

76
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,340
He told me

77
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,380
that ever since Cao Sui's mother
passed away,

78
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,980
he's turned ruthless.

79
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,580
He started making connections
with powerful figures.

80
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:45,820
Also,

81
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,100
regarding Cao's eldest son's
horse accident,

82
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,500
it looks like he was responsible.

83
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,580
Everyone knows he was behind it,

84
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,780
but he covered his tracks so well

85
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,540
that the Cao family
couldn't do anything about it.

86
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:58,860
Moreover,

87
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,420
the Cao family planned for Cao Sui
to marry someone from the Gu family,

88
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,660
but no one in the Cao family
knows about his plans

89
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,180
to marry Shuangshuang at the moment.

90
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,260
That liar.

91
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,180
Then...

92
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,420
Shuangshuang.

93
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,740
Where is Shuangshuang?

94
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,540
She's still at the guesthouse.

95
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,780
I heard he hired a governess

96
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,380
who always punishes Shuangshuang,
leaving her hands bruised and swollen.

97
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,580
Where are you going?

98
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,340
I'm going to check on her.

99
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,820
Have you forgotten

100
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,820
that you can't get into that guesthouse?

101
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,380
I already told Lian
to bring Shuangshuang back.

102
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,700
Just wait here.

103
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,500
I have had enough
of worrying about you all.

104
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,700
Mr. Liang.

105
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,100
Look at all this tasty food.

106
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,060
Why are you munching like this?

107
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,820
Here are a few chicken drumsticks too.

108
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,540
Does the Cao family not let you eat?

109
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:28,820
No,

110
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,180
I've just been practicing
my etiquette recently.

111
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,420
So I'm a bit tired.

112
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,340
All right, you keep on eating.

113
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,580
I'll go cook you some more.

114
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,700
No need for that.

115
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,540
Just get me another bowl of rice.

116
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,260
Hurry up, I'm starving.

117
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,460
Okay.

118
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,420
I am hungry,

119
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,460
but I'm not a glutton.

120
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:01,980
Eat more.

121
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,220
Look at you. You've lost so much weight.

122
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,220
Who do we have here?

123
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,300
Mr. Liang.

124
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,540
Shuangshuang, you are back.

125
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,620
Mr. Liang.

126
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:14,900
Miss Zhao,

127
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,340
you're here.

128
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,180
You are back.

129
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,220
Miss Zhao, you are finally back.

130
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,540
I bet the food at home
tastes better, right?

131
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,660
Listen,

132
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,780
I just made this for you.

133
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,460
Finish your meal first,
then you can have this.

134
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,340
Got it?

135
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,140
I'll put it right in front of you,
so you can guard it.

136
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:27,620
Here.

137
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,340
Thank you, Mr. Liang.

138
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,180
Let me sneak in a bite.

139
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,140
Have a chicken drumstick.

140
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,340
It still tastes the same as before.

141
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,820
Seems your cooking skills have improved.

142
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,780
Of course.

143
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,340
Mr. Liang taught me himself.

144
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,540
You've got about 70 percent
of Mr. Liang's skill now,

145
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,700
but still some way to go.

146
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,620
Just the thought of Cao Sui

147
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,980
makes me angry.

148
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,140
They won't even
let our Shuangshuang eat.

149
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,140
I've never let you suffer
like this before,

150
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:04,580
you know.

151
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,940
Why don't you come back
and live with us?

152
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,220
We'll cook up something tasty
every day.

153
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,980
There are some things
I need to take care of,

154
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,220
but I'll be back soon.

155
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,340
Is there anything

156
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,700
more important
than taking care of yourself?

157
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,580
I know that's important.

158
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,140
So, what's been going on recently?

159
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,460
Any good news

160
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,260
or juicy gossip to share?

161
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,460
There's nothing exciting going on,

162
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,540
but there's definitely
some trouble brewing.

163
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,100
What is it?

164
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,820
Miss Zhao, Cao Sui
wants to betroth Miss Li

165
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,780
to Mr. Guo as his concubine.

166
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,180
Miss Li?

167
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,660
You mean Li Jingshu?

168
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,660
She's going to marry Mr. Guo,

169
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,860
that lecherous old man?

170
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,580
I remember

171
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,260
I've already checked whether Li Jingshu

172
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,060
and Mr. Zhou are a good match.

173
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,220
Their wedding day is approaching, right?

174
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,780
Yes, Cao Sui

175
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,900
came with a matchmaker

176
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,020
who handled
the Zhou-Li engagement cancellation.

177
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,460
He has never mentioned this to me.

178
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,620
I haven't heard anything about this
at the guesthouse either.

179
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,060
This won't do.
I have to go back and ask him.

180
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:06,700
Shuangshuang.

181
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,980
The Cao family
is being so harsh with you.

182
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,660
How could they be so cruel

183
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,380
and hurt you so badly?

184
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,020
Take a seat.

185
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,740
I'm fine.

186
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,700
This injury

187
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,540
is just from an accidental fall
I had earlier.

188
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,820
It wasn't an accident.

189
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,220
That governess was clearly making
things hard for you.

190
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,380
Kid, don't worry,
we're not afraid of anyone.

191
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,180
If he dares to hurt you again,

192
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,140
I...

193
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,180
I'll go confront him,
no matter the cost.

194
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,060
Don't worry, Mr. Liang.

195
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,940
This whole thing
has nothing to do with him.

196
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,100
How can it have nothing to do with him?

197
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,140
At the very least, you got hurt
right under his watch, didn't you?

198
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,100
All I know is that you never got hurt

199
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,620
at the matchmaking agency.

200
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,980
So be honest with me.

201
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,380
Has the Cao family
still not talked to you

202
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,180
about the wedding date?

203
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,820
We have our plans.

204
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,780
So you haven't talked about it.

205
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,580
Well, that's exactly the case.

206
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,620
Shuangshuang, the Cao Sui now

207
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,660
is not the same as the one
you knew before.

208
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,860
Right now, no one in the Cao family

209
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,260
knows about him wanting to marry you.

210
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,780
Isn't that suspicious?

211
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,020
The Cao family is tricking you.

212
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,780
Shuangshuang, you should come back.

213
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,180
I'll get to the bottom of it,

214
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,500
but not right now.

215
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,620
There are still things
I need to wrap up.

216
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,860
Zhao Shuangshuang,

217
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,940
why are you so stubborn?

218
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,540
Can't you see how much
everyone cares about you?

219
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,860
Yes, Miss Zhao.

220
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,740
If something's bothering you,
just let us know.

221
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,820
We're all here to help you.

222
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,020
I appreciate it, everyone,

223
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,860
but I really have
some personal matters to address.

224
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,500
Once I'm done,
I'll move back right away.

225
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,020
I have some other matters
to attend to at the guesthouse.

226
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,340
I'll take my leave now.

227
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,500
