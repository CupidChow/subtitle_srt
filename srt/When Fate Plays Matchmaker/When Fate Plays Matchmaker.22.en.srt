Cut the nonsense off. What "rest in peace"?

I mean,

101
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,140
it'll be a shame for someone
as beautiful as you

I just used
a simple trick of deception to escape.

108
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,020
How could they
stand a chance against me?

109
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,620

110
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,500
I've lost count of the times

111
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,180
So, you're worried about me, huh?

112
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,500
Stop flattering yourself.

113
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,740
I just feel a bit guilty.

114
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,500
Shuangshuang,

115
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,580

Isn't this

00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,380
the hairpin I lost before?

118
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,180
How come it's with you?

119
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,980
I ran into three thugs nearby
the other day.

120
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,020
They had this hairpin

121
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,900
and said they were acting
on someone's orders.

122
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,900
I suspected it was Cao Sui right away,

123
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,220
but I couldn't find any proof.

124
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,580
I was going to give it to you sooner,

125
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,260
but it seems fate

126
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,740
had us wait until now.

127
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,380
Sorry,

128
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,220
I was wrong to accuse you.

129
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,700
And out of anger,

130
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,460
I said
all those ridiculous things to you.

131
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,980
There's no need to apologize.

132
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,940
You didn't do anything wrong.

133
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,180
You met Cao Sui when he was younger,

134
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,780
and after your reunion,

135
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,500
he was so attentive to you.

136
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,660
Also, the 81st couple
was about to come together,

137
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,060
so your choice
is perfectly understandable.

138
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,260
If anything, I might be the one
who was mistaken.

139
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,900
I thought you had feelings for me,

140
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,820
but it turns out,

141
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,100
it was me who fell for you.

142
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,140
I'm sorry.

143
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,060
I'm sorry.

144
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:15,900
All right now.

145
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,100
Stop crying.

146
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,420
If you continue, your makeup
will be ruined.

150
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,060
what that means if you...

151
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,060
I know.
