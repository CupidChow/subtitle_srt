1
00:01:53,974 --> 00:01:56,216
You smell good.

2
00:02:10,517 --> 00:02:13,657
I wonder what your nipples look like?

3
00:02:43,504 --> 00:02:46,110
Such cute nipples.

4
00:04:59,256 --> 00:05:01,401
Ooh that's tight.

5
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:13,039
I love you,

6
00:05:13,064 --> 00:05:14,198
Kaito.

7
00:05:16,401 --> 00:05:17,634
Kaito.

8
00:05:17,925 --> 00:05:19,144
I fucking love you.

9
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:33,159
(Sex Drifters)

10
00:05:36,848 --> 00:05:40,003
Have you decided when you're coming out?

11
00:05:43,111 --> 00:05:44,464
Not yet.

12
00:05:49,524 --> 00:05:50,628
Kaito.

13
00:05:52,321 --> 00:05:57,034
Are you against us going public?

14
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,589
This was just for tonight, okay?

15
00:06:20,454 --> 00:06:22,737
You mean, you're with him?

16
00:06:30,934 --> 00:06:32,061
I see.

17
00:06:34,423 --> 00:06:37,136
I had no idea there was someone else.

18
00:06:45,222 --> 00:06:46,605
I had fun though.

19
00:06:47,204 --> 00:06:48,370
Thank you.

20
00:06:55,603 --> 00:06:57,394
So when should we meet again?

21
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,136
Wasn't it good?

22
00:07:02,926 --> 00:07:04,026
It was good.

23
00:07:04,995 --> 00:07:06,107
But...

24
00:07:06,423 --> 00:07:08,833
For me it was just...

25
00:07:10,637 --> 00:07:11,855
A one night stand?

26
00:07:13,276 --> 00:07:16,120
Well, I guess it's better to
end on high note.

27
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,691
Go take a shower.

28
00:07:20,751 --> 00:07:22,097
Then I'll take you to the station.

29
00:07:35,407 --> 00:07:36,698
Good morning.

30
00:07:37,503 --> 00:07:38,478
Good morning.

31
00:07:38,503 --> 00:07:40,230
What's wrong with you today?

32
00:07:41,578 --> 00:07:43,678
I didn't sleep much last night.

33
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,070
Perhaps...

34
00:07:46,886 --> 00:07:48,925
Having too much fun with your girlfriend?

35
00:07:49,292 --> 00:07:50,503
Quit fooling.

36
00:07:51,023 --> 00:07:53,288
No girlfriend in my life.

37
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,792
So you're going too hard at it on your own.

38
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,316
That's sexual harassment you know?

39
00:07:58,765 --> 00:07:59,827
Sorry sorry.

40
00:08:00,221 --> 00:08:01,565
But you have to lighten up.

41
00:08:01,956 --> 00:08:04,550
It's almost time for the
new client presentation, right?

42
00:08:05,204 --> 00:08:06,987
I'll start working on it from today.

43
00:08:07,602 --> 00:08:10,149
I'll help wherever I can, okay?

44
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:09,769
Now you lick me.

45
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,089
What's wrong? Start licking!

46
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:31,526
More.

47
00:09:31,891 --> 00:09:34,066
Use your tongue.

48
00:09:34,443 --> 00:09:36,577
Lick it properly.

49
00:09:46,981 --> 00:09:48,441
Now here.

50
00:10:37,691 --> 00:10:38,915
I'm gonna come.

51
00:10:39,483 --> 00:10:40,485
I'm gonna come!

52
00:10:41,095 --> 00:10:42,749
I'm coming!

53
00:10:56,093 --> 00:10:57,857
The guy from before.

54
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:01,154
Has he been here recently?

55
00:11:02,852 --> 00:11:05,092
He's only come the two times.

56
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:07,298
I heard he's a regular at another bar.

57
00:11:10,807 --> 00:11:12,126
Did you fuck him?

58
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,571
Anyway...

59
00:11:17,233 --> 00:11:18,283
Was it good?

60
00:11:18,308 --> 00:11:20,124
Quit prying already!

61
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:24,485
Oh come on you dirty little...

62
00:11:25,424 --> 00:11:26,852
Welcome!

63
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,552
Here's your bottle.

64
00:11:40,989 --> 00:11:43,305
Work's going well?

65
00:11:45,062 --> 00:11:46,165
Yes.

66
00:11:46,714 --> 00:11:48,158
Thank you for asking.

67
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,563
I require constant stimulation.

68
00:11:53,396 --> 00:11:55,298
Something you could
help me out with perhaps?

69
00:11:56,535 --> 00:11:58,063
Here you are.

70
00:13:08,243 --> 00:13:10,745
My people are telling me very good things

71
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:13,383
about your sales sight.

72
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,306
Thank you very much.

73
00:13:16,157 --> 00:13:17,755
I've heard if I branch out,

74
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,837
I could double my profits.

75
00:13:20,102 --> 00:13:21,915
And that is why...

76
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,048
I've asked you here today.

77
00:13:25,415 --> 00:13:27,612
I will do my best to produce results

78
00:13:27,637 --> 00:13:29,657
for the benefit of the company.

79
00:13:30,985 --> 00:13:34,782
I'm mainly thinking about
registering bottled products.

80
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:38,319
The person in charge of
that will arrive soon.

81
00:13:38,344 --> 00:13:41,236
Please decide the following steps together.

82
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,649
Understood.

83
00:13:44,113 --> 00:13:45,391
Come in.

84
00:13:45,921 --> 00:13:47,159
Pardon my intrusion.

85
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,149
It's a pleasure to meet you.

86
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:03,368
I look forward to working together.

87
00:14:15,276 --> 00:14:17,571
Do you have any questions?

88
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:25,094
Everything looks good to me.

89
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:36,900
Kaito.

90
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:39,024
Why do you like this guy?

91
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:41,309
This...

92
00:15:41,855 --> 00:15:43,178
This...

93
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,995
Lunch break is over.

94
00:16:35,484 --> 00:16:37,863
You look worn out recently.

95
00:16:40,088 --> 00:16:41,154
Yeah.

96
00:16:41,582 --> 00:16:44,274
So let's get a drink sometime.

97
00:16:47,069 --> 00:16:48,180
Sorry.

98
00:16:48,669 --> 00:16:50,751
But I appreciate the invite.

99
00:16:51,657 --> 00:16:54,032
No worries.

100
00:16:54,176 --> 00:16:55,469
You are busy after all.

101
00:16:55,929 --> 00:16:57,735
The invite alone helped.

102
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:07,290
You're going to be late.

103
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:16,656
Welcome!

104
00:17:24,565 --> 00:17:27,593
Fancy seeing you again.

105
00:17:31,891 --> 00:17:33,398
Hello again.

106
00:17:43,921 --> 00:17:44,976
Oh?

107
00:17:45,611 --> 00:17:48,227
Conversation not going well?

108
00:17:49,263 --> 00:17:50,430
It's not like that.

109
00:17:51,292 --> 00:17:53,227
We're just acquaintances.

110
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,477
We met somewhere recently.

111
00:17:58,571 --> 00:18:00,219
And just had a little talk.

112
00:18:00,596 --> 00:18:01,899
Isn't that right?

113
00:18:02,696 --> 00:18:03,704
Right.

114
00:18:06,056 --> 00:18:07,469
Oh really?

115
00:18:11,073 --> 00:18:12,587
Do you come here often?

116
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:16,633
Yeah, with Kaito.

117
00:18:20,241 --> 00:18:21,376
And you know what?

118
00:18:22,111 --> 00:18:23,399
You and him...

119
00:18:25,048 --> 00:18:26,336
What's with that look?

120
00:18:26,361 --> 00:18:27,704
It's a little unsettling.

121
00:18:28,206 --> 00:18:29,516
Too right.

122
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:34,787
I have no idea what you're talking about.

123
00:18:34,812 --> 00:18:36,079
You...

124
00:18:37,682 --> 00:18:39,016
And Kaito...

125
00:18:40,879 --> 00:18:42,173
Who?

126
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,766
Huh?

127
00:18:52,495 --> 00:18:53,954
Oh him?

128
00:18:54,975 --> 00:18:56,712
I've seen him about.

129
00:18:58,571 --> 00:18:59,985
Don't lie to me.

130
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,235
You're not just mere acquaintances.

131
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:06,349
He told me he was with you now.

132
00:19:06,374 --> 00:19:08,212
And dumped me.

133
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,459
What are you talking about?

134
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,868
Quit trying to hide it.

135
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,016
You're Kaito's new lover, right?

136
00:19:17,805 --> 00:19:21,399
Hey help me out here would you?

137
00:19:21,772 --> 00:19:22,986
Toshio.

138
00:19:23,731 --> 00:19:26,024
He's into older men.

139
00:19:26,883 --> 00:19:29,337
He's not interested in someone as
young as Kaito.

140
00:19:29,746 --> 00:19:30,790
Right?

141
00:19:31,786 --> 00:19:33,939
Exactly.

142
00:19:36,932 --> 00:19:38,142
Is that the truth?

143
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,391
Why would I lie?

144
00:19:41,337 --> 00:19:44,477
So why did Kaito say he was with you now?

145
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,680
You probably seduced him or something.

146
00:19:49,473 --> 00:19:53,180
Watch your mouth or I'll have to bar you.

147
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,352
Look at me.

148
00:19:59,372 --> 00:20:01,165
Do I look like I'm lying to you?

149
00:20:07,758 --> 00:20:09,126
I'm sorry.

150
00:20:12,239 --> 00:20:13,508
It's fine.

151
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:20,446
But I wonder why he wanted to
break up with you.

152
00:20:23,752 --> 00:20:25,626
He stopped liking you?

153
00:20:28,072 --> 00:20:29,415
Actually.

154
00:20:31,037 --> 00:20:34,235
His mother was prying about marriage.

155
00:20:36,337 --> 00:20:37,602
He hated that.

156
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,639
But more than that...

157
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,196
I told him I wanted to come out.

158
00:20:44,688 --> 00:20:45,947
And...

159
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,719
Introduce him to my mother.

160
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:55,149
I get it.

161
00:20:57,053 --> 00:20:59,477
I've been in a similar place before.

162
00:21:02,903 --> 00:21:05,141
What did you do?

163
00:21:06,302 --> 00:21:08,555
I didn't have the courage.

164
00:21:10,913 --> 00:21:12,180
The courage?

165
00:21:16,331 --> 00:21:18,362
With even just a little courage,

166
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:21,969
coming out is possible.

167
00:21:25,163 --> 00:21:27,868
I guess he didn't even have that.

168
00:21:28,828 --> 00:21:31,258
People are weak.

169
00:21:34,688 --> 00:21:37,383
I think I've got you figured out now.

170
00:21:39,232 --> 00:21:41,907
You're a good guy who works hard.

171
00:21:42,536 --> 00:21:45,126
No work talk here.

172
00:21:45,646 --> 00:21:46,673
Sorry.

173
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,313
It just slipped out.

174
00:21:51,387 --> 00:21:58,349
(I'm sending you a simple design
and a more lively one.)

175
00:21:59,771 --> 00:22:05,876
(How about a collage of
the various canned goods?)

176
00:22:08,158 --> 00:22:17,094
(That sounds good.
Please send over the final product list.)

177
00:22:21,349 --> 00:22:23,032
Today we drink.

178
00:22:25,217 --> 00:22:26,141
Here?

179
00:22:26,341 --> 00:22:27,344
Problem?

180
00:22:27,998 --> 00:22:31,430
It's nice and cool up here.

181
00:22:36,317 --> 00:22:37,719
Sure. Why not?

182
00:22:42,825 --> 00:22:44,508
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

183
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:57,008
The customer said his sales have increased.

184
00:22:57,211 --> 00:22:58,774
He seems really happy.

185
00:22:59,508 --> 00:23:04,627
Yeah, the sales were better than expected

186
00:23:04,652 --> 00:23:06,815
so we added an additional product.

187
00:23:07,129 --> 00:23:08,520
That's great.

188
00:23:17,444 --> 00:23:18,540
Hey.

189
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:20,602
What are you doing?

190
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:24,160
I want to be more than just colleagues.

191
00:23:30,057 --> 00:23:31,637
I knew it.

192
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:36,133
I felt it from before.

193
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,851
You're not into women, are you?

194
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,610
You don't have to hide it.

195
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:48,735
Don't look so down.

196
00:23:49,889 --> 00:23:53,469
Different people like different things.

197
00:23:54,196 --> 00:23:56,158
Some people like sweet things,

198
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,462
others like spicy.

199
00:23:59,433 --> 00:24:01,980
And some people like women...

200
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:11,019
If only I was born male,

201
00:24:12,965 --> 00:24:16,316
then not just as friends.

202
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:20,277
Perhaps we would have gone
on a fancy date together.

203
00:24:22,156 --> 00:24:23,418
Nao...

204
00:24:24,712 --> 00:24:28,269
But I'm glad I found out before quitting.

205
00:24:31,772 --> 00:24:32,848
What?

206
00:24:33,727 --> 00:24:36,430
What did you say just now?

207
00:24:38,586 --> 00:24:40,269
Since my mother passed,

208
00:24:41,054 --> 00:24:44,527
my father isn't doing too well.

209
00:24:45,866 --> 00:24:48,324
I should be there for him.

210
00:24:51,493 --> 00:24:53,433
You're moving back home?

211
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,504
Right.

212
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,887
I see.

213
00:25:03,605 --> 00:25:05,441
Don't look so blue.

214
00:25:05,902 --> 00:25:09,191
We're in the digital age now.

215
00:25:09,473 --> 00:25:11,584
You can hear my voice.

216
00:25:11,609 --> 00:25:13,676
Or see my cute face anytime.

217
00:25:14,504 --> 00:25:17,316
Anyway, that's enough of that conversation.

218
00:25:20,922 --> 00:25:22,840
Let's go get a drink.

219
00:25:26,598 --> 00:25:27,479
Sorry.

220
00:25:27,504 --> 00:25:30,738
I have some errands to run.

221
00:25:33,417 --> 00:25:36,363
You're not the only fish
in the sea you know?

222
00:25:54,996 --> 00:25:58,609
So cute and pink.

223
00:25:58,634 --> 00:26:00,558
Your asshole.

224
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:06,441
How's this? Feels good?

225
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:08,785
Let me loosen you up a bit more.

226
00:26:13,223 --> 00:26:14,996
I think you're ready.

227
00:26:15,757 --> 00:26:17,098
Here we go.

228
00:26:27,841 --> 00:26:31,082
I'm so grateful for your father.

229
00:26:32,496 --> 00:26:34,541
If he wasn't a friend,

230
00:26:34,566 --> 00:26:37,637
I never would have met you.

231
00:26:40,263 --> 00:26:44,027
When your mother came to me
asking for help,

232
00:26:44,551 --> 00:26:47,582
I was so moved.

233
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:49,519
So moving.

234
00:26:50,723 --> 00:26:56,596
Thinking about being able to
use this body as I please.

235
00:26:56,894 --> 00:26:59,949
I trembled all over.

236
00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:07,473
I decided to work here.

237
00:27:08,491 --> 00:27:11,301
To put my mother at ease.

238
00:27:12,855 --> 00:27:15,730
What a good decision.

239
00:27:17,316 --> 00:27:19,843
And for what I'm paying you,

240
00:27:20,285 --> 00:27:25,745
an amount you couldn't dream of
in another company.

241
00:28:06,138 --> 00:28:07,746
What's wrong with you?

242
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:10,441
We're only getting started.

243
00:28:12,551 --> 00:28:14,019
I can't...

244
00:28:16,291 --> 00:28:19,074
I was putting up with this for
my mother's sake but...

245
00:28:20,918 --> 00:28:22,754
What are you saying?

246
00:28:24,676 --> 00:28:26,879
I don't want to be your plaything anymore.

247
00:28:31,074 --> 00:28:32,894
Oh really?

248
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:38,746
And who do you think
paid off your family's debt?

249
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,512
Understand?

250
00:28:43,113 --> 00:28:46,934
Your father's hospital bills and
funeral expenses.

251
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:50,980
Not to mention your school tuition.

252
00:28:51,457 --> 00:28:53,910
I've always looked out for you.

253
00:28:55,293 --> 00:28:57,566
That was because you wanted me to
have options, right?

254
00:28:57,941 --> 00:28:59,605
Exactly.

255
00:28:59,979 --> 00:29:02,574
You handsome man.

256
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:07,793
I've loved you ever since
I first laid eyes on you.

257
00:29:11,355 --> 00:29:13,762
Thank you for all your help.

258
00:29:14,727 --> 00:29:16,339
I'll never forget everything you've done.

259
00:29:18,646 --> 00:29:20,832
But I can't do this anymore.

260
00:29:22,452 --> 00:29:24,418
Please let me be free.

261
00:29:27,502 --> 00:29:30,699
Please release me.

262
00:29:32,444 --> 00:29:34,932
Why are you saying such things?

263
00:29:35,355 --> 00:29:37,306
Be honest with me.

264
00:29:37,807 --> 00:29:41,488
I'll love you tenderly.

265
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:48,441
I wanted to put this inside of you.

266
00:29:49,446 --> 00:29:50,676
I'm sorry.

267
00:29:51,465 --> 00:29:52,715
I'm done.

268
00:29:53,941 --> 00:29:57,551
I've never liked you.

269
00:30:00,494 --> 00:30:01,660
Is that so?

270
00:30:02,143 --> 00:30:04,098
So what are you going to do
about the money?

271
00:30:05,215 --> 00:30:06,621
Pay it back?

272
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,067
Everything I've done for you!

273
00:30:10,092 --> 00:30:11,176
Stop!

274
00:30:11,527 --> 00:30:12,354
Stop!

275
00:30:12,379 --> 00:30:14,348
- What are you doing?
- Get away from him!

276
00:30:14,676 --> 00:30:16,004
Get away from him.

277
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,153
Go.

278
00:30:18,677 --> 00:30:20,043
Hurry up let's go!

279
00:30:21,814 --> 00:30:23,160
Mr. President.

280
00:30:23,944 --> 00:30:26,402
What you did just now was violence.

281
00:30:26,863 --> 00:30:28,574
I don't know all the details yet.

282
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,766
But I can't work for a company that
indulges in such matters!

283
00:30:31,791 --> 00:30:33,650
What are you talking about?

284
00:30:35,058 --> 00:30:35,980
Masashi.

285
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:37,400
Let's get out of here.

286
00:30:37,426 --> 00:30:38,470
We'll talk after.

287
00:30:38,495 --> 00:30:39,664
Wait! Wait! Wait!

288
00:30:39,689 --> 00:30:40,908
Get away!

289
00:30:42,052 --> 00:30:43,266
We're leaving.

290
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:53,480
So that was your relationship with
the company president?

291
00:30:57,561 --> 00:30:59,496
I lost my father at an early age.

292
00:31:00,501 --> 00:31:04,418
He's helped me a lot since then.

293
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:12,129
So he was keeping you with
money and company status.

294
00:31:15,654 --> 00:31:17,504
I just put up with it.

295
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:20,621
But enough was enough.

296
00:31:22,616 --> 00:31:24,433
I don't want to be controlled anymore.

297
00:31:25,257 --> 00:31:28,621
I want to walk my own path.

298
00:31:30,821 --> 00:31:32,516
I was able to decide this.

299
00:31:33,966 --> 00:31:35,094
Toshio.

300
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,094
Thanks to you.

301
00:31:41,048 --> 00:31:42,031
Huh?

302
00:31:43,586 --> 00:31:45,336
Whether it be breaking away from
the company president

303
00:31:45,951 --> 00:31:47,219
or coming out,

304
00:31:47,911 --> 00:31:49,037
courage...

305
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:51,130
as long as you have courage,

306
00:31:51,719 --> 00:31:52,843
you can do it.

307
00:31:53,227 --> 00:31:56,305
You convinced me of that the other day

308
00:31:56,796 --> 00:31:59,274
so I brought up my courage today.

309
00:32:05,312 --> 00:32:06,961
Is that so?

310
00:32:10,154 --> 00:32:11,391
In that case,

311
00:32:12,386 --> 00:32:14,766
it's my turn to bring up my courage.

312
00:32:16,774 --> 00:32:17,813
Actually...

313
00:32:20,031 --> 00:32:22,281
since I first met you...

314
00:32:28,553 --> 00:32:30,344
You mean?

315
00:32:33,094 --> 00:32:35,974
We first met just after Kaito left me

316
00:32:35,999 --> 00:32:38,383
so maybe it was down to my loneliness.

317
00:32:40,006 --> 00:32:42,344
But while working,

318
00:32:43,485 --> 00:32:45,396
all I could think of was you.

319
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:17,754
I won't do anything like he did

320
00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:19,380
so please relax.

321
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:25,216
Are you ready?

322
00:33:26,631 --> 00:33:28,341
Hurry up and put it in me.

323
00:34:05,688 --> 00:34:06,966
Here I come.

324
00:35:11,962 --> 00:35:13,544
Is this not working for you?

325
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,633
Sorry...

326
00:35:19,709 --> 00:35:21,091
I can't get it up.

327
00:35:31,209 --> 00:35:33,872
Is it me?

328
00:35:36,894 --> 00:35:38,599
It's not that.

329
00:35:48,074 --> 00:35:49,544
Even though it was short lived,

330
00:35:52,618 --> 00:35:54,325
thank you for everything.

331
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,333
We'll call it even

332
00:36:08,138 --> 00:36:10,060
so don't worry about the money.

333
00:36:11,781 --> 00:36:13,068
More than that,

334
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:15,935
let me love you just one more time.

335
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:20,091
I don't want to see you beg.

336
00:36:22,811 --> 00:36:24,060
Excuse me.

337
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:27,035
Ma... Masashi.

338
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,419
(Letter of Resignation)

339
00:36:30,567 --> 00:36:32,224
Here's to your freedom.

340
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:33,825
Cheers.

341
00:36:36,596 --> 00:36:37,849
Thank you.

342
00:36:46,669 --> 00:36:51,118
Is it really okay that I'm here?

343
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:56,435
Relax here until things calm down.

344
00:37:00,281 --> 00:37:03,935
Thank you for your looking out for me.

345
00:37:04,978 --> 00:37:06,591
Don't get so formal.

346
00:37:07,165 --> 00:37:08,646
Relax, relax.

347
00:37:10,665 --> 00:37:12,199
Here, try this.

348
00:37:27,649 --> 00:37:28,884
Nothing?

349
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:36,216
It feels good but...

350
00:37:39,728 --> 00:37:41,044
I see.

351
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:45,575
Let's just sleep then.

352
00:37:56,827 --> 00:37:59,208
Wow! Looks home made!

353
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:01,764
Quit spying on me.

354
00:38:01,789 --> 00:38:03,416
Don't worry about it.

355
00:38:03,779 --> 00:38:07,708
Although I wanted to make you lunch today.

356
00:38:07,908 --> 00:38:09,673
Why all of a sudden?

357
00:38:11,044 --> 00:38:12,466
I'm at ease.

358
00:38:12,884 --> 00:38:14,900
What are you talking about?

359
00:38:17,134 --> 00:38:20,325
But I guess you'll be leaving soon.

360
00:38:21,124 --> 00:38:22,490
Don't be like that.

361
00:38:22,966 --> 00:38:26,380
It's not like I'll never
come back here again.

362
00:38:27,136 --> 00:38:28,697
Also...

363
00:38:29,592 --> 00:38:30,853
Also?

364
00:38:31,552 --> 00:38:33,325
I'm going to have a scam marriage.

365
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:34,568
What?

366
00:38:35,083 --> 00:38:36,919
Not with me you're not.

367
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:41,146
You want to spend your life with
the person you love, right?

368
00:38:42,085 --> 00:38:44,521
Bring your all to my farewell party, okay?

369
00:38:45,568 --> 00:38:47,996
Until the following morning.

370
00:38:48,355 --> 00:38:49,464
Right!

371
00:38:55,912 --> 00:38:57,363
Thank you!

372
00:38:58,527 --> 00:39:00,681
- This is good!
- Really?

373
00:39:00,706 --> 00:39:03,224
Really good.

374
00:39:04,083 --> 00:39:05,135
What?

375
00:39:05,882 --> 00:39:07,597
You're going to work there?

376
00:39:09,569 --> 00:39:13,794
I can't stay here and
not contribute anything.

377
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:18,966
If it's about money,
you don't have to worry.

378
00:39:20,304 --> 00:39:24,513
But when I'm here alone I think about
those kind of things.

379
00:39:27,952 --> 00:39:29,263
Is that so?

380
00:39:31,122 --> 00:39:32,377
I understand...

381
00:39:32,402 --> 00:39:36,091
But you really don't have to worry about
daily life expenses.

382
00:39:41,047 --> 00:39:42,341
Thank you.

383
00:39:49,965 --> 00:39:51,216
Hey hey.

384
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:00,807
Is that you?

385
00:40:01,515 --> 00:40:03,396
He'll be helping here for a while.

386
00:40:04,216 --> 00:40:05,127
Is that so?

387
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,601
It's good to see you again.

388
00:40:06,855 --> 00:40:08,722
Don't be so stiff.

389
00:40:23,578 --> 00:40:24,904
Here you are.

390
00:40:25,394 --> 00:40:26,974
Thank you.

391
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,021
Ahh I'm out of tobacco.

392
00:40:38,271 --> 00:40:39,580
I'll run and grab some.

393
00:40:39,831 --> 00:40:41,286
Thank you darling.

394
00:40:41,996 --> 00:40:42,966
Thanks.

395
00:40:45,995 --> 00:40:47,409
Isn't he great?

396
00:40:47,434 --> 00:40:49,990
Master, the bill.

397
00:40:51,175 --> 00:40:52,552
Early for you.

398
00:40:54,488 --> 00:40:55,575
See you.

399
00:40:56,964 --> 00:40:58,075
Ah!

400
00:40:59,411 --> 00:41:01,505
Going so soon?

401
00:41:11,554 --> 00:41:13,104
You like that, right?

402
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,497
Over here.

403
00:41:25,113 --> 00:41:26,419
Excuse me.

404
00:41:26,831 --> 00:41:29,331
I'm sorry.

405
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:33,786
- I'm back.
- Thank you for that.

406
00:41:36,821 --> 00:41:38,836
I'll be in the bathroom.

407
00:41:59,748 --> 00:42:01,177
Not coming to bed yet?

408
00:42:03,443 --> 00:42:06,443
I have a project I need to finish tomorrow.

409
00:42:08,978 --> 00:42:11,474
It's tough being the sub-leader, huh?

410
00:42:12,676 --> 00:42:14,068
Don't over do it.

411
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:16,419
I'll be finished soon.

412
00:42:18,083 --> 00:42:19,264
I'll go on ahead then.

413
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:20,247
Yeah.

414
00:42:21,015 --> 00:42:22,818
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

415
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,357
Not picking up huh?

416
00:44:34,967 --> 00:44:36,599
Hey did you get fat again?

417
00:44:37,178 --> 00:44:39,802
- You'll die if you keep that up.
- A little more please.

418
00:44:47,255 --> 00:44:48,340
Welcome!

419
00:44:48,365 --> 00:44:49,661
Looking smart!

420
00:44:50,818 --> 00:44:52,302
This one, okay?

421
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,240
Make yourself comfortable.

422
00:45:21,815 --> 00:45:24,725
(I've been caught up in one of the
customer's birthday party.)

423
00:45:24,765 --> 00:45:27,276
(I'll be home late...)

424
00:45:27,313 --> 00:45:28,950
Late huh?

425
00:45:47,562 --> 00:45:50,005
(Can we meet?)

426
00:46:28,893 --> 00:46:30,724
That went on longer than I expected.

427
00:46:31,605 --> 00:46:32,958
It happens

428
00:46:33,546 --> 00:46:35,068
and thank you for your text.

429
00:46:36,021 --> 00:46:38,044
Tonight I have a meeting

430
00:46:38,069 --> 00:46:39,708
so no need to prepare dinner for me.

431
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:42,294
Sounds like me last night.

432
00:46:43,466 --> 00:46:44,685
Don't wait up.

433
00:46:44,982 --> 00:46:46,161
I'm off.

434
00:46:58,111 --> 00:47:00,302
I could do fine it with that guy.

435
00:47:23,557 --> 00:47:26,200
Shall we go somewhere we can talk?

436
00:47:42,682 --> 00:47:43,882
Hold me.

437
00:47:48,311 --> 00:47:50,403
After all those childish tricks.

438
00:47:54,434 --> 00:47:55,810
I'm sorry.

439
00:47:57,818 --> 00:48:03,122
Breaking up was easier than
facing my own mother.

440
00:48:06,486 --> 00:48:07,419
Oh?

441
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:09,958
I was too scared to come out.

442
00:48:12,759 --> 00:48:13,857
But...

443
00:48:14,296 --> 00:48:17,630
I then realized how important
you are to me.

444
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:23,271
We have a connection that's
more than just love.

445
00:48:27,184 --> 00:48:28,224
Kaito.

446
00:48:29,177 --> 00:48:33,804
For you was it merely lust?

447
00:48:33,829 --> 00:48:34,778
No.

448
00:48:36,598 --> 00:48:38,778
If it were such a weak feeling...

449
00:48:42,633 --> 00:48:44,958
I wouldn't have suffered so much.

450
00:48:50,154 --> 00:48:53,310
Let's make up for lost time.

451
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:36,486
Kaito.

452
00:50:10,461 --> 00:50:11,528
Welcome home.

453
00:50:19,194 --> 00:50:20,200
Sorry.

454
00:50:21,426 --> 00:50:22,935
Why are you apologizing?

455
00:50:27,049 --> 00:50:28,317
Actually...

456
00:50:31,527 --> 00:50:32,911
I was with Kaito.

457
00:50:42,214 --> 00:50:44,966
I should apologize too.

458
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:52,294
An old partner came to the bar.

459
00:50:55,411 --> 00:50:57,075
I was with him last night.

460
00:51:01,793 --> 00:51:03,521
At that time I realized,

461
00:51:05,011 --> 00:51:10,083
I feel safe when I'm with you, but...

462
00:51:19,198 --> 00:51:20,958
Don't look so glum.

463
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:29,786
Just like when you saved me from
the company president.

464
00:51:30,289 --> 00:51:32,177
Show me your cool face.

465
00:56:15,350 --> 00:56:16,778
Oh yeah.

466
00:56:18,023 --> 00:56:19,763
That feels good.

467
00:56:56,102 --> 00:56:57,482
I'm gonna come.

468
00:56:58,025 --> 00:56:59,210
Can I?

469
00:56:59,369 --> 00:57:00,607
I'm coming.

470
00:57:03,414 --> 00:57:04,514
I'm coming!

471
00:57:04,852 --> 00:57:05,864
I'm coming!!!

472
00:57:25,937 --> 00:57:26,833
Toshio?

473
00:57:28,062 --> 00:57:29,013
Yeah?

474
00:57:30,922 --> 00:57:32,396
On our next day off,

475
00:57:33,262 --> 00:57:35,130
introduce me to your mother?

476
00:57:38,839 --> 00:57:39,857
What?

477
00:57:42,074 --> 00:57:43,450
As partners.

478
00:57:46,364 --> 00:57:47,450
Kaito.
