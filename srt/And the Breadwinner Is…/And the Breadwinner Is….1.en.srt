00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,364
I am on my way home.

351
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,199
All right, next time.

352
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,868
- Next time.
- Okay.

353
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:20,080
[bright music continues]

354
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,875
What happened?

355
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,878
Our house looks like
the Community Health Center?

356
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,297
Bambi! You're back.

357
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,257
- Hello.
- Hello.

358
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,176
I'm Tricia, Leni's daughter.

359
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,303
You used to lend her money.

360
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,597
That's why I was able to become a doctor.

361
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,015
Drop by sometime for a visit.

362
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,725
Do I look sick to you?

363
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,144
You can't judge my appearance
just because you're a doctor.

364
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,438
You can't assume that
I'm sick just by looking at me.

365
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,733
- Just kidding!
- [chuckles]

366
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,568
- Congrats! You're a doctor.
- Thanks!

367
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,944
- Please come by anytime.
- Sure, I will.

368
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,197
- I want Botox on my face.
- Okay. Take care!

369
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:59,787
[bright music continues]

370
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,420
[Bambi] This looks just like our old gate.

371
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:11,632
No. This can't be our house.

372
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:14,343
[woman] Bambi! You're here, at last!

373
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,512
Finally, you're home.

374
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,973
Auntie, do you know where our house is?

375
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:23,560
My God! It's right in front of you!

376
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:24,561
This?

377
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,897
Did you have amnesia?

378
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,857
This is your house.

379
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:30,859
I'll go ahead.

380
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,194
Welcome back!

[Buneng] You're ruining the video!

384
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,337
[Paeng] Why don't you help me?

385
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,755
- [Mayet] Oh God.
- [man] The wifi is not working.

386
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,758
[Boy] Buneng, stop filming. Help me here.

387
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,594
You're ruining the video!
See what you did.

388
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,973
[Boy] I'm the only one who does anything…

389
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:05,602
- One more.
- The food isn't ready yet.

[overlapping chatter]

391
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,359
- Bambi?!
- We're still having issues with the water.

392
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,903
- [chattering stops]
- Bambi?

393
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,071
Is that you?

394
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,323
Bambi.

395
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:22,119
- Bambi! I missed you!
- Sis!

396
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,872
- We missed you!
- How are you?

397
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,790
- [Biboy] Bambi?
- [woman] Bambi?

398
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,208
- Where is she?
- [gasps]

399
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,126
Bambi?

400
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,592
What happened to the house I was building?

401
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:38,927
Uh…

402
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,096
Bambi…

403
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,140
[Biboy] Actually…

404
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,101
My child…

405
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,732
Momsy.

407
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,154
I missed you so much, Momsy.

408
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:59,573
You're here.

409
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,493
I missed you, my child.

410
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,288
Baby…

411
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:11,210
Would you like some water with ice?

412
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:18,342
[Buneng] Momsy, that's
your daughter Bambi, not Baby.

413
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,273
Hello, Mama Bambi!

414
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,359
Wrong! It's Papa Bambi!

415
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:36,568
You're wrong!

416
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,112
- No, you're wrong!
- You're wrong!

417
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,614
No need to argue.

418
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:44,952
I'm fine with either Mama or Papa.

419
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:48,038
As long as there's respect, okay?

420

[utensils clinking]

- Welcome back, MaPa Bambi!
- Welcome back, MaPa Bambi!

422
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,304
What happened to the house?

423
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:08,934
Bambi,

424
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:12,437
we had to use the money
for the kids' daily expenses,

425
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,981
but I'll pay you back.

426
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,024
What about the bakery?

427
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,569
We closed it because
there's no one to manage it.

428
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,529
Wow!

429
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,282
There are so many of you.
No one could take care of it?

430
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,618
Why is the food bland?

431
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,330
- How about Momsy?
- Papsy did not cook this.

432
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,083
Is she getting
the treatment that she needs?

433
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,587
Mom's Alzheimer's progressed rapidly.

434
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,341
[Momsy] Papsy can cook better than this.

435
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,135
Where is Papsy?

436
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,636
Momsy…

437
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,264
Papsy died a long time ago.

438
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,599
Where is the ice?

439
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,810
Mom, we have some here.

440
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,979
[Bambi] We often videocall
each other, don't we?

441
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:56,898
No one cared to tell me
what's been happening.

442
00:21:56,982 --> 00:22:00,277
Mama said you might stop
sending money if you knew.

443
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,361
[Mayet] Shhh!

444
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,988
- The ice!
- [Mayet] What are you saying?

445
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,072
[Mayet] Just eat your food.

446
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,825
Mayet, you said I'd get my own bedroom.

447
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,452
Was that a lie?

448
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,331
I'm sorry.

449
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,999
We used the money

450
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,083
- to start my skincare business.
- Where's the ice?

451
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,461
- But the business failed.
- Hey!

452
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,296
- And who is this?!
- Ice, please.

453
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,506
What are you doing here anyway?

454
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,509
Bambi, it's me, Paeng. I'm your cousin.

455
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,803
Before I left,

456
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:30,223
you asked if you could stay here
while you look for a job.

457
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,268
Now that I'm home, why are you still here?

458
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:35,896
I did find a job.

459
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,773
- I'm Momsy's caregiver.
- Ice!

460
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,859
- Where is the ice, Baby?
- [banging table]

461
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,487
Give me some ice, Baby!

462
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,614
Why didn't you tell me about

463
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,824
- [indistinct dual overlapping dialogue]
- what's been going on?

464
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,410
I came home for my birthday.

465
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:53,830
I wanted to spend it with you.
I wanted to surprise you.

466
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:58,168
Did you even remember my birthday?

467
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:01,004
I thought Momsy was the only one
with Alzheimer's in this house.

468
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,465
- [Momsy] Ice…
- Huh?

469
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,884
- What is it?! You're getting on my nerves!
- Ice.

470
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,469
The ice is right beside you.

471
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,513
Please give it to me.

472
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:12,474
Why didn't you tell me
that the ice was beside me?

473
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,768
Is that a secret,
just like everything else?

474

Here's my fare.

00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,073
Please pass it to the driver.

487

Pass it to the driver?

You're just as bad.

from the driver.

Why don't we tell him the truth, then?

705
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:23,561
We won't earn that much
even if we work hard.

706
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,189
[Mayet] Bambi, we should think it over.

707
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,940
Ten million pesos is peanuts to them.

708
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:31,152
But it could change everything for us.

709
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,237
Tell her the real story.

710
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,906
- Shut your trap!
- Psst.

711
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:37,658
- Just tell her the truth.
- What is it?

712
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,369
Biboy, tell me!

713
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,167
Sorry, Bambi.

714
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,212
I had to mortgage our house.

715
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:54,926
What have you done, Biboy?

716
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:57,720
- I'm really sorry.
- Have you lost your mind?

717
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,057
What if we can't pay for it?

718
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,684
What would happen to us?

719
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,269
We'd be lost and homeless!

720
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:08,356
- Where would we live?!
- [bangs table]

721
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,402
[Buneng] Umm…

722
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:16,114
May I speak?

723
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:19,909
Shut up, Buneng! This is serious!

724
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:22,078
Just hear me out.

725
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:25,206
Biboy tried his best to pay off the debt,

726
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,749
but things just didn't go his way.

727
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,210
[Biboy] I'm sorry.

728
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:33,005
I borrowed money from you
for my Dubai job application.

729
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,759
But the job agency duped me.

730
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,971
I got a loan from a lending firm

731
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:45,518
so I could start
a business and pay you back.

732
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,896
But I couldn't keep up
with the interest payments,

733
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,733
so I had to close shop.

734
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:57,029
I mortgaged our house to pay off the loan.

735
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,073
Oh my God…

736
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:03,870
We'll do whatever it takes to pay you back

737
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:06,706
and reclaim our house. We're really sorry.

738
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:10,960
We never meant to deceive you.
We thought we could fix it.

739
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:15,506
- I'm very sorry.
- Sorry. Please forgive us.

740
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,551
We may not be wealthy,
but we have our dignity.

741
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:23,014
Cancel the wake immediately.

742
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:24,640
I'll take it from here.

743
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:27,768
Return all the cash donations
from the funeral.

744
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,437
MaPa!

745
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:31,772
[Mayet] Why are you still up?

746
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:35,026
I heard MaPa Bambi's voice.

747
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,360
See, I told you she's alive.

748
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:40,198
We're happy to see you, MaPa Bambi!

749
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:50,291
[man] Biboy!

750
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,336
- Hey!
- Hey, where are you going?

751
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:55,254
Tope, I didn't know it was you.

752
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,548
- [grunts]
- [groans]

753
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,383
- Stand up!
- [Biboy groans]

754
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,135
Hey! What's happening?

755
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,720
What are you doing to my husband?

756
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:04,597
Love! Stay inside!

757
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,932
Why are you shouting?

758
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,391
- [man shouts]
- You better stop now!

759
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,851
- [groans]
- [Bambi] What are you doing to Biboy?

760
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,061
- Hey!
- Help your brother!

761
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:11,437
- Biboy!
- I'm going down.

762
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,521
- [Biboy groans]
- Bib--

763
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,649
- [Biboy grunts]
- You think you're tough, huh?

764
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,151
Keep an eye on Momsy.

765
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,110
Hey!

766
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,403
- [blow lands]
- [Mayet] Hey!

767
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,697
[Mayet] Hey! Stop hurting my husband!

768
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,199
- [shrieks, shouting]
- [indistinct dual dialogue]

769
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:25,243
- Hey!
- Stop it!

770
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:26,827
- [woman shouts]
- [overlapping screaming]

771
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:27,828
[grunting]

772
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:32,208
- [whistle blows]
- [grunting]

773
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:38,714
Bastards, show women some respect!

774
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:39,966
Give me 100 push-ups!

775
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,342
[laughter]

776
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:44,178
That's Uncle Benjamin, right?

777
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,972
- [man] Don't you want to do push-ups?
- Didn't he join the war?

778
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,807
You don't want to do push-ups, huh?!

779
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,225
Do you want me to shoot you?

780
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:52,645
[Tope] One. Two. Three. Four.

781
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:55,189
- I don't like that! Stand up!
- Five. Six. Seven!

782
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,984
- Stand up!
- What's your problem?

783
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,443
You won't do it?

784
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:03,030
- Wait a minute. Wait!
- Oh!

785
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,908
Biboy sold your house to me.
I own your house now.

786
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,202
So, I am giving you two weeks

787
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,620
- to move out!
- What?!

788
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:10,663
What?!

789
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,081
- This house is now yours?
- Yes!

790
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:13,624
- We're supposed to leave?
- Yes!

791
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,501
- Really? Is that true?!
- Sir!

792
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:17,003
- Get out!
- You want me to shoot you?

793
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,963
- Take it easy!
- Leave! Go away!

794
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:20,339
I'll shoot you!

795
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,508
I'll come back for you.
Especially you, Biboy!

796
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:24,552
- [Mayet] Go away!
- Don't ever come back!

797
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:25,761
I'll kill you!

798
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:26,887
- Come on!
- Go away!

799
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,056
- Love, are you okay?
- Bro.

800
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,142
- Are you hurt?
- You alright, bro?

801
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,977
- Oh my God!
- Biboy!

802
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,145
- Help us, Bambi!
- What happened?!

803
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,605
- Hey! Be careful!
- Why?!

804
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:39,150
- What happened?!
- I don't know! Don't shoot me.

805
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,151
Biboy?

806
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:41,986
Biboy!

807
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,239
I already told you multiple times,

808
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,283
Tope is not to be messed with.

809
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:48,784
Now look what happened to you!

810
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,161
Ouch! Be careful!

811
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,330
[Paeng] I gave Momsy
some medicine to calm her down.

812
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,498
She fell asleep next to the kids.

813
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:57,251
- [Mayet] Thank you.
- You look like Private Benjamin.

814
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,296
[Buneng] Really, you do. It's incredible.

815
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,756
I didn't realize
we were related to horses.

816
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:02,923
Luckily, I don't look--

817
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,134
- What are you saying, Buneng?
- Nothing.

818
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:06,802
[Biboy] You should not have done that.

819
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,471
We should've called the police instead.

820
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,973
Wow, I'm sorry for saving your ass.

821
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,767
Why are we calling the police over this?

822
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,561
There's a scam happening in our home.

823
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:16,645
That's intense.

824
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,441
Boy. Hey, Boy!

825
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,526
It's me. Your sister, Bambi.

826
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,404
I used to work as a drag queen in Taiwan.

827
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,281
I brought home lots of costumes.

828
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,283
I saw this and thought…

829
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:32,536
I would dress up as Private Benjamin.

830
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,954
You're a drag queen too?

831
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,624
Yes. Why? Do you know any drag queens?

832
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,669
- Who?
- [Boy clears throat] No, I don't.

833
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:43,631
Why are you dressed up
as Private Benjamin?

834
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,174
I'm supposed to be dead.

835
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,259
[Bambi] People aren't supposed
to recognize me.

836
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:50,346
So, I thought I'd put on a disguise.

837
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,266
So… You mean to say…

838
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,727
I was having doubts earlier.

839
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:00,314
But I saw what Tope did.

840
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,734
I won't let anything bad
happen to you, okay?

841
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,404
So, yes.

842
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:08,280
I'm doing this,

843
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,284
so that we could get millions
and buy our house back.

844
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,285
Are you sure about this--

845
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:14,620
Shhh.

846
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:18,749
[sobbing]

847
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:22,753
Bambi raised me.

848
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:27,800
I love you so much.

849
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:29,677
It hurts so bad.

850
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,554
It really hurts.

851
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:33,264
It really hurts.

852
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:37,143
- I'm in agony.
- What are you doing?!

853
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:38,060
What's going on with you?

854
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:41,230
Do you want ten million or not?

855
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,815
You're right.

856
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:46,569
- Come on. Help us!
- Bambi!

857
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:49,280
[Paeng] Bambi…

858
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:54,201
I love you so much! It hurts!

859
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,704
- He looks so cute. Look!
- [Paeng] I'm in so much pain!

860
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,915
Stop it, Buneng. You are such a big flirt.

861
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,792
Stop it.

862
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,085
- He's been staring at me.
- I said stop.

863
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,921
Look at him.

864
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,923
- [giggles]
- In fairness.

865
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,968
My God! [wailing]

866
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,094
Hold her.

867
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:14,096
Buneng, control yourself.

868
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,682
- You're overreacting!
- Huh?

869
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,059
I'll give him some peanuts.

870
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,394
[indistinct dialogue]

871
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,979
Hey! Watch it!

872
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:23,856
- Why did you push me?!
- [indistinct dual dialogue]

873
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:26,317
- Are you okay?
- No, it hurts.

874
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,153
Are these peanuts yours?

875
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:31,447
What? Yes, they're mine.

876
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,907
- Yours?
- Yes.

877
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,160
Can I taste it?

878
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:37,661
My peanuts?

879
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:39,622
[woma teasing]

880
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:41,373
Sure.

881
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:44,668
Wait.

882
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,421
I haven't seen you around here.

883
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:48,714
- Do you live here?
- What?

884
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:50,799
Huh?

885
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,885
Condolences. I have to go.

886
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:55,179
Wait a minute. Wait!

887
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:56,514
Ouch!

888
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:57,723
- What the--
- Sorry.

889
00:41:58,641 --> 00:41:59,600
Ugh.

890
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,562
[woman] You look beautiful.

891
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:04,897
I'll go over there.

892
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,525
- Oh!
- Why did you change your disguise?

893
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,360
It's all over the news.

894
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,946
Private Benjamin has been sent over
to the West Philippine Sea.

895
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:12,905
So…

896
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:14,865
[in a woman's voice] Oh my God!

897
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,660
I'm so sad!

898
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,204
Bambi was such a good person.

899
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:23,415
[sobbing]

900
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:26,544
You really nailed
our American cousin's personality.

901
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,546
I got more than just her personality.

902
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:30,965
I also got this.

903
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,425
[gasps]

904
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:34,552
- Like it?
- Yes!

905
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:35,928
[chuckles] That's cool.

906
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,555
[chuckles]

907
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:41,392
Does anyone else want to talk about Bambi?

908
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:42,351
Me!

909
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,103
Me!

910
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:46,105
I have some words to say for the dead.

911
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:48,607
[sobbing]

912
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:50,734
Yes, Father?

913
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:59,034
[sobbing]

914
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:01,620
I'm so sorry.

915
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,038
[sobbing]

916
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:05,332
Oh my God. [sobbing]

917
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,710
Hello, everyone.

918
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,546
My name is Girly.

919
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:14,133
I'm Bambi's cousin who lives abroad.

920
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,635
Allow me to start by saying,

921
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,804
Bambi,

922
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:22,266
I'm gonna miss you so much.

923
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:26,353
You know what?

924
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,440
When we were kids,

925
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:33,485
our neighbors adored Bambi

926
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:36,864
'cause she was the cutest among us kids.

927
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:38,449
- [chuckles]
- [woman] Cutest?!

928
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,454
And she was also the sweetest.

929
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:44,371
[woman] Sweetest?!

930
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,165
Doesn't seem like it.

931
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:47,333
And she's…

932
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,418
supercalifragilistic… expialidocious.

933
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:50,628
[woman teasing mockingly]

934
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:51,920
[in normal voice] Who's that dumbass?!

935
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,132
[in a woman's voice] I'm sorry.

936
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,635
You know what? I'm getting scared.

937
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,136
[woman laughing]

938
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:00,763
Father, I'm so scared.

939
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:04,975
Father, help us.
Send some guidance from above.

940
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,102
Father, bless this place.

941
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:08,812
[woman flinches]

942
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:10,064
- Some more, Father.
- [woman flinches]

943
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:12,274
- Father, some more.
- [woman flinches]

944
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:14,693
- Okay, that's alright, Father.
- [woman flinches]

945
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:17,363
I think the evil spirit
has been vanquished.

946
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:20,115
- Vanquished?!
- [screaming]

947
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,992
- [in Italian] Lord, stop this nonsense!
- Oh my God!

948
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,495
Are you a priest or a firefighter?

949
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:26,789
- [in Italian] This is crazy!
- What?

950
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,165
[shrieks]

951
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:29,958
Baby?

952
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,794
[in Italian] Yes, how's it going?

953
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:33,921
[tense music playing]

954
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:36,715
[whispers] Get these people out of here.

955
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,050
- [Paeng] Excuse me.
- [indistinct dual overlapping dialogue]

956
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:40,594
[Biboy] Father, why don't you
hold Mass outside?

957
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,388
[overlapping chatter]

958
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:46,266
- Out! Out! Out!
- [gate closes]

959
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,769
[imitating Bambi] Out! Out! Out!

960
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:51,355
[tense music continues, fades]

961
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:52,398
You're alive.

962
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:55,025
Same to you, Bambi.

963
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:57,945
How did you recognize me?
I'm wearing a disguise.

964
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:59,029
[scoffs]

965
00:44:59,113 --> 00:44:59,947
I know you.

966
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:03,826
Every pore, every blackhead,
every wrinkle.

967
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:05,119
It's true.

968
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,996
What kind of stunt is that?
Hiding behind funeral flowers?

969
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:12,251
I wanted to surprise you,
but instead, I got surprised.

970
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:15,254
I thought you were dead.

971
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:17,798
What does it matter
whether I'm alive or dead?

972
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:20,426
- [in Italian] We are family. Yes or no?
- [grins]

973
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:23,095
Family? Really?

974
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:25,764
You don't know anything about family.
You don't know what it means.

975
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:29,268
Don't fool me, Baby. Don't.

976
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:32,438
Fine, Bambi. Have it your way.

977
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,440
If you don't want me here,

978
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:36,650
I'll just go back to Italy.

979
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:37,901
- [in Italian] Goodbye.
- Go!

980
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,695
[dramatic sting]

981
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:41,321
- Momsy?
- Momsy!

982
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,865
- Momsy!
- Momsy!

983
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:46,285
[in Italian] My beautiful mother,
it's me, Baby!

984
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:47,202
- Baby?!
- Mom?

985
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:48,996
- [in Italian] Yes!
- Baby!

986
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:52,708
- [in Italian] Yes, Mama.
- Baby.

987
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:58,130
[in Italian] Your Baby is here.

988
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:01,133
You came back for us.

989
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:02,718
[in Italian] Yes.

990
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:04,470
Don't ever leave again, okay?

991
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:07,514
[in Italian] Yes, Mama.

992
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:08,599
Baby.

993
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,642
I won't leave. I'll stay here.

994
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,895
But tell me what's going on.

995
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:14,480
[in Italian] Right away!

996
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:18,650
- You're shameless.
- Ouch!

997
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:20,986
This is all your fault!

998
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:22,863
You still haven't changed?!

999
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:25,324
- My ear hurts.
- Her accent is gone.

1000
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:28,702
[in Italian] This is your fault! Stupid!

1001
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:30,871
But what can we do?

1002
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:34,124
Even though I'm against scamming people,

1003
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,919
for the sake of this family, I am in.

1004
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:41,423
- You're out!
- [gasps]

1005
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:42,799
You're not included!

1006
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:45,302
You just got here and now you're in?
You've got some nerve.

1007
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:46,762
It's not for you to decide.

1008
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:48,972
It's the family's decision.

1009
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:51,475
And to help you decide,

1010
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,227
I brought presents for everyone!

1011
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,853
- Yay!
- [cheering]

1012
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:58,815
This is from the beautiful
sun-kissed land of Italy!

1013
00:46:58,899 --> 00:46:59,942
- [elated gasps]
- [indistinct dual dialogue]

1014
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:00,901
Hey, wait…

1015
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,986
I also brought presents for everyone.

1016
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,948
- Of course, I did.
- [cheering]

1017
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:08,408
From the semi-tropical island in East Asia

1018
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,369
that gave us Meteor Garden.

1019
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:12,079
- What?
- Tai… Not two, not three,

1020
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:13,497
not four, not five…

1021
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,790
Taiwan!

1022
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:16,583
- Now get this box!
- [cheering]

1023
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,794
- Biboy, this is for you.
- That's a lot!

1024
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:20,087
Foot spray.

1025
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,172
[surprised gasps]

1026
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:24,132
Why is the cap missing?
And it's already half empty?

1027
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:27,553
[in Italian]
No! It's really popular in Italy.

1028
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,388
It's often out of stock.

1029
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:32,099
Wait a minute. It says "tester".

1030
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,267
No!

1031
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:34,560
Oh, this went viral!

1032
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:36,353
- Really?
- I saw this on ChikChok.

1033
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:37,563
Yes!

1034
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:39,356
The guy who used it
had nice-smelling feet.

1035
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:41,608
- Sounds good!
- But then his mouth stunk.

1036
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,110
He got athlete's foot in his mouth.

1037
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:44,570
- Do you still want to use this?
- [Baby] That's not true!

1038
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:45,612
- Throw that away.
- [Bambi] I'm not kidding.

1039
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,532
- [muttering]
- This one's for you.

1040
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:50,075
Oh!

1041
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:54,162
Authentic coffee beans from Taiwan!

1042
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:55,872
- [gasping]
- Oh, I love coffee.

1043
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:58,667
It's too authentic
that it's also addictive!

1044
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:01,003
I tried that.
I was hooked for three months.

1045
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:03,672
I almost died. It's like drugs.

1046
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:05,591
Boy!

1047
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:07,968
Boy, right?

1048
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:09,386
- Boy.
- Yes?

1049
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:11,221
I have something for you.

1050
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:14,766
This is a special bottle of shampoo.

1051
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,268
Thank you, Baby.

1052
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:18,270
[chuckling]

1053
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:21,064
Is this second-hand?
Is this shampoo for real?

1054
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:24,359
No. Don't shake it.

1055
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:26,153
- Is this shampoo?
- [in Italian] Yes.

1056
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:27,696
Also from Italy?

1057
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:28,655
- [chuckles]
- [shrieks]

1058
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,741
This also went viral on Pagebook.

1059
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:31,658
- Really?
- [Bambi] Yes!

1060
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,202
The last person who used it,
his hair fell off.

1061
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:35,912
But the hair on his ass grew longer.

1062
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:37,998
- This isn't for the head?
- No, you'll go bald.

1063
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,499
But the hair on your ass will grow.

1064
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,500
You want to braid your hair down there?

1065
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:44,129
That's really for your curly hair.

1066
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:45,505
I also have something for you. [chuckles]

1067
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,507
- [sighs]
- My goodness.

1068
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:50,260
My goodness, you'll like this.

1069
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:51,178
Read it.

1070
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:53,347
Re… Rejuvenating.

1071
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:56,099
- Wow, you can read now!
- You scared me!

1072
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:59,519
- You're so smart, Boy!
- He likes that.

1073
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:02,439
- Yes, your skin will become smooth.
- Yes!

1074
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:04,650
But your personality will become abrasive.

1075
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:07,110
So, you're using this product, right?

1076
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,655
- I got it from your bag.
- That's a lie.

1077
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:12,324
- Ah… Buneng.
- Buneng!

1078
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:13,533
What do you have for me?

1079
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,452
I got you something.

1080
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:17,120
- You need to use this.
- Of course.

1081
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:18,413
For the sake of the family

1082
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,582
- and the whole population.
- What is it?

1083
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:21,500
Deodorant.

1084
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,168
[chuckles]

1085
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:24,127
[in Italian] Please.

1086
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:26,505
- Buneng, don't!
- Why?

1087
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:27,673
The last girl who used this…

1088
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:28,882
was dumped by her boyfriend.

1089
00:49:28,965 --> 00:49:30,801
You want that to happen to you too?

1090
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:32,969
- No. Not again.
- Right? We don't want that.

1091
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,764
- Here. Oh my God.
- What's that, sis?

1092
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:36,973
[chuckles]

1093
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:39,267
- What's that?
- You're going to scream.

1094
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:40,435
Oh, what is it?!

1095
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:42,979
- [screams]
- Don't read it!

1096
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:44,773
- What's that?
- [Buneng] What is it?

1097
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:45,732
[indistinct dialogue]

1098
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:48,235
- [screams]
- [laughs]

1099
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:49,903
It's beautiful! What is it again?

1100
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:51,571
- Lotion.
- Oh, lotion.

1101
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:54,658
If you use this,
your skin will become white

1102
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:56,535
and your conscience will become clear.

1103
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:58,370
- I like it.
- But don't use all of it.

1104
00:49:58,453 --> 00:49:59,329
Leave some for your sister.

1105
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:01,623
She needs it for her own conscience.

1106
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:02,708
Baby, we'll share this.

1107
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:04,501
- You're rude!
- Ouch!

1108
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:05,961
You don't respect me.

1109
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:08,004
I'm still your older sister.

1110
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:10,257
Don't be sassy with me.

1111
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:13,802
Did you hit the back of my neck?

1112
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:15,053
No. I hit you on the head.

1113
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:17,222
This is the back of the neck.
This is the head.

1114
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:18,765
- Stupid.
- Ouch!

1115
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:25,021
Gosh, your saliva
smells like a used diaper.

1116
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:28,275
- Hey! Stop it!
- Who do you think you are?

1117
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:29,735
Stop it now!

1118
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:32,571
Stop it!

1119
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:35,240
- [Biboy] You're hitting my wife!
- Stop it!

1120
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:37,075
- That's Mayet!
- Wait, that's Mayet?!

1121
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,493
- You have no shame, Bambi!
- Sorry!

1122
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:41,079
- It's all your fault!
- You have no shame!

1123
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,289
Enough!

1124
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:47,753
Stop being so loud. You'll wake Momsy up.

1125
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:50,088
We like the presents you gave us.

1126
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:51,089
Yes, we do.

1127
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:54,468
We haven't all been together in years.

1128
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:59,222
Buneng and Boy grew up without you, Baby.

1129
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:00,599
They don't know you well.

1130
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,227
Yeah. When you left, you were Sister Baby.

1131
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,896
Now that you're back,
you're Sister Elderly.

1132
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:10,817
Buneng.

1133
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:13,737
Boy.

1134
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:17,073
I'm your older sister, Baby.

1135
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,034
Hello.

1136
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,161
I missed you both.

1137
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:22,370
[Buneng chuckles]

1138
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:27,125
- [soft music playing]
- [sniffles]

1139
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:32,964
Can I join in the hug too?

1140
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:36,676
- [soft music continues]
- [sniffles]

1141
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,094
Are you okay?

1142
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:43,517
All right.

1143
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:46,436
For the sake of my siblings and Momsy,

1144
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:49,272
you're in.

1145
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:53,026
[in Italian] Thank you!

1146
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:54,653
What's the plan?

1147
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:57,113
- We have to be watchful.
- [in Italian] Yes.

1148
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:58,573
The insurance company
might send an investigator

1149
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:00,367
to check our claim.

1150
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,202
- Do you understand?
- [in Italian] Yes, I understand.

1151
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:05,789
[overlapping chatter]

1152
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:07,874
- Kruk kruk ina merz.
- [overlapping chatter]

1153
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,459
[in Uzeklovakian] How are you?

1154
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:10,877
- Oh, there you go.
- Okay.

1155
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,003
- All of it.
- [woman] Who's that?

1156
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:14,714
- [woman] All of it.
- [Baby] That's our cousin,

1157
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,800
- Nice.
- a beauty title holder

1158
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:19,427
- Great biceps.
- from Uzeklovakia.

1159
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:20,428
You may come in.

1160
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:21,638
Don't stay too long.

1161
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:23,557
- [Buneng] Now check her too.
- You're good.

1162
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,766
[Buneng] Hey!

1163
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:26,518
- Ouch!
- You silly.

1164
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:28,270
This works in your favor, huh?

1165
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:30,230
Hey! Need I remind you.

1166
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,482
We're here to find out
if someone is investigating us.

1167
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:35,026
- We're not here to flirt.
- Oh, wow!

1168
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,528
- That's rich coming from you.
- Oh, really?!

1169
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:37,654
As if you're not flirting
with that American boy.

1170
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:38,989
- [in Uzeklovakian] Hey!
- [both gasp]

1171
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:40,198
Kruk kruk ina merz.

1172
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:44,870
- You're so beautiful!
- So gorgeous!

1173
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:48,081
Hey, stay there! This is a checkpoint!

1174
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:49,332
[Tonton] Checkpoint?

1175
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,376
Why is there a checkpoint?

1176
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:55,338
[Buneng] We got robbed last night,

1177
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:57,132
so now we have a checkpoint.

1178
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,508
[growls]

1179
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,552
We check everyone who goes through.

1180
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:01,887
And if you don't pass…

1181
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,346
[In Uzeklovakian] You're dead.

1182
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:07,559
Do you have a valid ID?

1183
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:08,602
- Valid ID?
- Umm…

1184
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:09,519
Hurry!

1185
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:10,478
Kruk kruk!

1186
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:11,479
[Buneng] Hurry!

1187
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,900
- Anton. [giggles]
- [groans]

1188
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:17,027
- [growls]
- Oh!

1189
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:19,529
Give me your proof of residence.

1190
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,698
Proof of residence? Wait.

1191
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:23,241
[Tonton] Here you go.

1192
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:24,367
I just live in the neighborhood nearby.

1193
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:26,036
- Really? You live nearby?
- Yes.

1194
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:27,996
- Wanna come over?
- Where? Sure.

1195
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:28,914
- [growls]
- [gasps]

1196
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:31,291
Oh. No, I can't.

1197
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:33,418
What is your relationship
with the deceased?

1198
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:34,628
- Relationship?
- Yes.

1199
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:36,630
[in Uzeklovakian] Relationship.

1200
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,632
Affair, connection,

1201
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:41,426
bond, correlation.

1202
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:43,136
Relationship!

1203
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:44,930
Kruk kruk ina merz.

1204
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,474
[in Uzeklovakian] I'm her friend.

1205
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:49,768
- Friend?
- Yes.

1206
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:51,937
- [in Uzeklovakian] He's gay.
- Really?

1207
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:52,979
[in Uzeklovakian] You're wrong!

1208
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:56,232
I know how to speak Uzeklovakian

1209
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:59,319
because my mother taught me.

1210
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:00,737
[scoffs]

1211
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:03,198
[in Uzeklovakian] How did you
become friends with Bambi?

1212
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:04,366
[in Uzeklovakian] In Taiwan.

1213
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:09,955
[in Uzeklovakian]
She never told me about you.

1214
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:14,876
[in Uzeklovakian] Maybe she forgot
because she's an old horse.

1215
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,127
[gasps]

1216
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:17,837
[in Uzeklovakian] You ugly bitch!

1217
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,255
Get away from here!

1218
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:21,341
We're grieving here
and you're calling Bambi an old horse?

1219
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:24,052
- You shouldn't be here!
- Sorry, relax!

1220
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:25,553
- Calm down.
- Kruk kruk ina merz!

1221
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:27,180
- Bambi!
- Leave!

1222
00:54:27,263 --> 00:54:28,098
Don't ever come back here.

1223
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:29,975
[in Uzeklovakian]
It's Bambi's burial tomorrow.

1224
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:31,351
That guy's a phony.

1225
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:32,686
[in Uzeklovakian] Exactly!

1226
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:34,354
What did you say?

1227
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:36,982
[in Uzeklovakian] Oh, what is this?

1228
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:41,069
[in Uzeklovakian]
The guy left his other ID.

1229
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:42,737
[in Uzeklovakian] Come again?

1230
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:43,780
You're fluent?

1231
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:44,864
Um…

1232
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:47,033
What I mean is…

1233
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,828
- that guy left this.
- [in deep voice] Really, bro?

1234
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:52,205
That's cool, bro. You're so tough.

1235
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:53,456
[Buneng] Oh my.

1236
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,918
Oh, no! He works
for the insurance company.

1237
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:59,462
[intriguing music playing]

1238
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:01,673
[crickets chirping]

1239
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:03,717
No comment.

1240
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:07,637
What do you mean by "no comment"?
I didn't ask you anything.

1241
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,431
No comment.

1242
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:11,641
I know you're dying to ask.

1243
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:14,436
Why did I leave? Why did I return?

1244
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:15,979
So I say, "No comment."

1245
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:17,355
Really?

1246
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:18,398
Too bad.

1247
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,859
I was going to offer you

1248
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:25,780
75% of my ten million as your share.

1249
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:28,116
But you said, "No comment."

1250
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:30,285
So, I guess you're not interested.
You don't care.

1251
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:31,619
- Yes.
- So, you won't get your share.

1252
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:33,038
No. Yes.

1253
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:37,042
If it concerns my family,
then I have a comment.

1254
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:39,377
And my answer is… yes.

1255
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:41,713
- That was quick.
- Yes.

1256
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:44,049
Good job. Aren't you loaded with money?

1257
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:46,634
- You're so posh now.
- [Baby grunts]

1258
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:49,679
Why are you so eager
to get your hands on my insurance money?

1259
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:52,015
- Are you hard up?
- [groans]

1260
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:53,933
What happened to you in Italy?

1261
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:56,853
[Baby groans, snoring]

1262
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:00,940
- [door opens]
- [Boy] Bambi…

1263
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:04,152
[Buneng] According to the news,
Miss Uzeklovakia has been kidnapped again.

1264
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:05,695
You can't imitate her anymore.

1265
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:07,489
You do Girly again.

1266
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:11,659
Did I understand correctly?

1267
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:13,661
You told Tonton that the corpse
needs to be buried tomorrow?

1268
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:16,623
[imitating Boy]
"Did I understand correctly…"

1269
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,875
You understood it perfectly.

1270
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:21,586
You're so good at gay lingo.
I'm proud of you.

1271
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:23,088
- Are you going to bed?
- Yes.

1272
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:25,340
Your cheek blush is intense.

1273
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:30,678
We need to do the burial
as soon as possible.

1274
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:34,432
That way, there'd be no reason
for him to bother us.

1275
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:37,685
I have an idea.

1276
00:56:38,394 --> 00:56:40,188
- I'll make Tonton fall in love with me.
- [Bambi] Shhh!

1277
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:41,231
- Buneng!
- Why'd you do that?!

1278
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:43,441
Stay out of it! Let the adults decide.

1279
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:45,276
Just go to sleep.

1280
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,737
Wanna drink your milk
and watch Peppa Pig too?

1281
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,405
I'm not a child. I'm a young woman, okay?

1282
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:51,908
My point is, I want to distract him,

1283
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:53,785
so he'll leave you alone.

1284
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:57,747
You keep calling me a child
and saying I shouldn't get involved.

1285
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:59,833
This is warm enough. Good night!

1286
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:03,169
Young woman? Your boobs look like pimples.

1287
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,004
- They'll get bigger soon.
- [indistinct dual dialogue]

1288
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:07,549
Who'll make them bigger?

1289
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:11,344
[crying]

1290
00:57:11,427 --> 00:57:15,140
[sobbing]

1291
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:18,309
Our poor Bambi!

1292
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:21,187
[crying continues]

1293
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:25,775
The family's acting suspiciously.

1294
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:29,446
They even rushed the burial
and did it after dark.

1295
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:34,993
Yes, boss.

1296
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:39,706
[crying continues]

1297
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:42,876
- There is only two weeks to go.
- Maybe you made a mistake.

1298
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:45,128
- No!
- So, that means--

1299
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:46,838
What are you concerned about?

1300
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:48,756
Now that you're buried,

1301
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:51,634
we're close to getting the ten million.

1302
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:53,887
- [cheering]
- [Buneng] Oh my God!

1303
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:56,139
I'll get a rhinoplasty.

1304
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:59,142
I'll buy a mansion for Mayet and the kids.

1305
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:02,562
Don't forget my hula hoop, a pretty one!

1306
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:04,272
How about you, Baby?

1307
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:06,858
I don't really have a plan. I mean…

1308
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,569
What is money? It's just a piece of paper.

1309
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:10,820
- Wow!
- You're rich.

1310
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:12,155
And you, Bambi?

1311
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:13,406
I'll buy a bra.

1312
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:15,575
Lots and lots of bras.

1313
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:18,077
And then, I won't let you have
any of my money.

1314
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,787
- What?!
- Huh?!

1315
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:21,289
See, look at your faces!

1316
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:23,208
I thought you said money is only paper.

1317
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:24,334
- [electricity buzzes]
- [Mayet] Oh gosh!

1318
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:27,670
- [woman] What happened?
- [Baby] No electricity!

1319
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,255
What will we do?

1320
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,798
How should I know?
I'm supposed to be dead.

1321
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:34,219
- It's hot in here!
- [Bambi stumbles]

1322
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:35,178
- Oh.
- Oh!

1323
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:38,223
[Baby] Do we have a flashlight?

1324
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:27,730
[pensive music playing]

1325
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,070
Papsy, I wish you were here.

1326
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:36,573
I don't know what to do.

1327
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:48,126
[Papsy chuckles]

1328
00:59:48,209 --> 00:59:51,421
[Momsy] Thanks to that article,

1329
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:53,881
our bakery has become popular.

1330
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:55,466
Congratulations, Papsy!

1331
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,677
- Congratulations, Papsy!
- Congratulations, Papsy!

1332
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,013
See, kids.

1333
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:04,434
All those late nights
baking bread were worth it.

1334
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:08,938
Yes, Papsy. I have good news, too.
I got a new job!

1335
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,773
[Bambi] So did I, Papsy.

1336
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:13,318
Now we can help pay the bills.

1337
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:14,402
- That's right!
- [both chuckle]

1338
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:19,282
Why not just work here?

1339
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:22,619
[Papsy] Help us
make the bakery successful.

1340
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:24,912
This is our livelihood.

1341
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:28,249
Remember, nothing is impossible

1342
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:32,086
if we always work together.

1343
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:33,463
That's right!

1344
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:34,756
[Momsy chuckles]

1345
01:00:40,678 --> 01:00:45,767
[pensive music continues]

1346
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:01,324
Why are there so many gowns?

1347
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:08,956
[Bambi gasps]

1348
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,583
You startled me.

1349
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:11,793
Why are you here, Boy?

1350
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:12,835
Are you looking for something?

1351
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:17,590
I saw you come in, so I followed you.

1352
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:20,426
Do you need something? It's dusty here.

1353
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,136
I could help you find
what you're looking for.

1354
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:25,056
Don't bother. I just wanted to be alone.

1355
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:28,601
I saw these gowns. They're fabulous.

1356
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,687
These are good enough
for a beauty contest.

1357
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:32,814
Who owns these?

1358
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:34,399
I don't know.

1359
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:37,944
Sometimes people
just dump their stuff here.

1360
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:40,154
It just piles up.

1361
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:42,281
If no one owns these gowns,
I'll take them.

1362
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:44,283
- I can give them to my gay friends
- No!

1363
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:48,037
No. Umm…

1364
01:01:49,747 --> 01:01:52,417
What I mean is…

1365
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,252
your friends might find
those gowns irritating to wear.

1366
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:55,920
Right?

1367
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:59,590
We don't know where they came from.

1368
01:02:00,591 --> 01:02:02,343
- Is that right?
- Yes.

1369
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:04,470
You have a point.

1370
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,806
But these look brand-new.

1371
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:08,224
These could have been
bought from the mall.

1372
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:10,518
My friends might get a rash after all.

1373
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:12,228
They're used to buying gowns
at thrift stores.

1374
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:14,021
- Yes.
- [Bambi chuckles]

1375
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:18,651
[soft music playing]

1376
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:20,778
Come here.

1377
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:22,572
Why?

1378
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:24,240
Come here.

1379
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:30,997
[soft music continues]

1380
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:36,753
Do you know that I'm so proud of you?

1381
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:39,338
Extremely proud.

1382
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:45,303
No matter what you decide in life,
I'll still be proud of you.

1383
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:51,934
I'll support whatever you do
that makes you happy.

1384
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:56,105
Because I love you.

1385
01:02:58,107 --> 01:02:59,025
[exhales]

1386
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:00,526
I love you.

1387
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:05,364
- [soft music continues]
- [sniffles]

1388
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:07,450
Enough of that!

1389
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:09,994
Call everyone.
I have something to tell them.

1390
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,830
Okay.

1391
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,752
[footsteps receding]

1392
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:19,879
We're going to…

1393
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,048
clean up…

1394
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:24,717
[Baby sighs]

1395
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:29,305
…and re-open Papsy's bakery!

1396
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:30,765
- Why?
- Why?

1397
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:33,559
Because it's closed,
so we're opening it, right?

1398
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:34,936
[scoffs]

1399
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:37,772
This is what Papsy did
to financially support us.

1400
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:39,857
If we all work together,

1401
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:42,819
we might be able
to keep this family afloat.

1402
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:46,405
Come on, even Jesus
rested every Sabbath Day.

1403
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:48,449
Maybe we can rest instead.

1404
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:49,450
We just buried you a few days ago.

1405
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:50,451
Is that so?

1406
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:52,703
If you don't help re-open the bakery,
you won't get any of the money.

1407
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:53,704
Yes, of course.

1408
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:55,081
- [Mayet] You should have told us that.
- Where's the cleaning tool?

1409
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:56,332
- [Biboy] Where are the cleaning supplies?
- [indistinct overlapping dialogue]

1410
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:58,000
[Mayet] Why are we
standing around talking?

1411
01:03:58,084 --> 01:03:59,585
[Baby] It's so dirty! It's filthy!

1412
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:00,503
- So dirty!
- Are you throwing a tantrum?

1413
01:04:00,586 --> 01:04:01,462
- I'm not complaining.
- You don't want your share?

1414
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:02,839
How can I not? There's so much dust.

1415
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:06,133
- [Bambi] See, the dust is rising.
- Move over there!

1416
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:07,677
[screams]

1417
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:08,970
- [Baby] What's that?
- [Buneng] What's this?

1418
01:04:09,053 --> 01:04:10,346
What's this?

1419
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:12,473
What is that?

1420
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:15,017
- It looks like the Virgin Mary.
- Is that a miraculous image?

1421
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:17,979
No, Mayet. That's me. Look at it.

1422
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:22,775
When Bambi and I were teenagers,
we used to horseplay a lot.

1423
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:25,319
We would often wrestle.

1424
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:28,865
She slammed me against the wall,
and my face left a mark.

1425
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:30,449
It's cute, isn't it?

1426
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:32,368
[Bambi] You're such a liar.

1427
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:33,369
That's me. Look at the features.

1428
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:35,913
The eyes. The nose. The lips. The cheeks.

1429
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:38,291
No way, Bambi.

1430
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:40,877
Your face is on the other side.

1431
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,212
- Where?
- Beside mine.

1432
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:44,338
- On the other side.
- Which side?

1433
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:46,090
[Baby] There.

1434
01:04:46,173 --> 01:04:49,385
- [Buneng] Oh, this one.
- Yeah!

1435
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:52,430
- It looks just like you!
- Actually!

1436
01:04:52,513 --> 01:04:55,182
It's a mirror image of you.

1437
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:57,310
- Turn to your side.
- There!

1438
01:04:57,393 --> 01:04:58,936
[Buneng] There.

1439
01:04:59,020 --> 01:04:59,937
Try to look like a pony.

1440
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:04,275
- There. That's it.
- [Baby] Back to basic.

1441
01:05:04,358 --> 01:05:05,860
Exactly like it.

1442
01:05:05,943 --> 01:05:09,488
- [Baby] That's it.
- It looks exactly like you.

1443
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:10,781
Back to work!

1444
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:11,782
Okay, okay.

1445
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:12,950
[Bambi] You've been having too much fun.

1446
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:14,076
[Mayet] It's Buneng's fault.

1447
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,536
- She showed it to us.
- They resemble each other.

1448
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:16,829
[indistinct dialogue]

1449
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:22,585
See.

1450
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:26,881
Such a big improvement.
It looks great, doesn't it?

1451
01:05:26,964 --> 01:05:29,050
This makes all our hard work worth it.

1452
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:30,676
- [sighs]
- Our hard work?

1453
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,304
[Bambi] Yes. Papsy is right.

1454
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:35,806
If we all work together,
we can accomplish anything.

1455
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:37,600
We're the only ones who did the work.

1456
01:05:37,683 --> 01:05:41,646
We can't open the bakery.
We still don't have electricity.

1457
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:43,439
- It's so hot.
- So hot in here.

1458
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:48,069
- Whoa! Power's back!
- Power's back!

1459
01:05:48,152 --> 01:05:50,237
- What did you do?
- I just snapped my fingers.

1460
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:52,198
- The lights are on.
- There he is!

1461
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:53,950
You're late. Work's been done.

1462
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:56,577
So, you avoided cleaning
by leaving the house?

1463
01:05:57,995 --> 01:05:59,872
I paid the electricity bill.

1464
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:01,624
- Really?
- For real?

1465
01:06:01,707 --> 01:06:03,209
- Is that true?
- You?

1466
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:05,336
- No way.
- Thank you, Boy.

1467
01:06:05,419 --> 01:06:06,921
You're so dependable.

1468
01:06:07,588 --> 01:06:08,881
You're just like me.

1469
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:11,008
Where have you been?
Where did you get the money?

1470
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:14,387
I won a contest in school.

1471
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:16,555
- Is that true?
- Why didn't you invite us?

1472
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:17,473
You did good.

1473
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:20,059
- Here's my share for the daily expenses.
- Wow.

1474
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:22,937
- What a huge prize.
- What contest did you join?

1475
01:06:24,063 --> 01:06:25,147
What?

1476
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:29,110
Good for you, Boy.
You don't give me any trouble.

1477
01:06:29,193 --> 01:06:32,196
You even help the family.
Not like the other Boy,

1478
01:06:32,279 --> 01:06:33,489
who brings nothing but stress.

1479
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:35,741
I don't have pockets to put these in.

1480
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:38,619
- Love, it was just a joke.
- Biboy, it was just a joke.

1481
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:40,371
- Love.
- Biboy.

1482
01:06:40,454 --> 01:06:42,873
- Bambi!
- What did I say?

1483
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:46,877
[soft music playing]

1484
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:49,964
[loud thud]

1485
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:54,260
[thuds]

1486
01:06:57,346 --> 01:06:58,472
[thuds]

1487
01:06:58,556 --> 01:06:59,390
Biboy.

1488
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:04,228
[thuds]

1489
01:07:04,311 --> 01:07:05,938
Mayet has been looking for you.

1490
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:08,232
Come on. Let's have some breakfast.

1491
01:07:10,651 --> 01:07:11,944
You haven't slept all night?

1492
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:19,326
That's enough. Time to rest.

1493
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:21,954
I admit that I wasted the money
for the house renovation.

1494
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:23,914
But I swear on my life,

1495
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:26,625
I never stole it for my own gain.

1496
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:29,378
I know you worked hard for that money.

1497
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:30,713
You swear on your life?

1498
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:32,882
Not even a dime to buy shampoo?

1499
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,552
You swear? Or buy deodorant?

1500
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:39,930
I knew it. You stink.

1501
01:07:44,977 --> 01:07:46,020
[Bambi] Hey.

1502
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:50,816
It's just a joke.
I didn't mean to offend you.

1503
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:53,152
[soft music playing]

1504
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:54,320
[pounds]

1505
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:55,738
- Biboy!
- [objects clattering]

1506
01:07:55,821 --> 01:07:58,616
I know I've made mistakes.

1507
01:07:58,699 --> 01:08:00,284
But when you say it,

1508
01:08:00,367 --> 01:08:02,453
my feelings get hurt because it's true.

1509
01:08:03,287 --> 01:08:07,124
- [somber music playing]
- [sobbing]

1510
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:09,585
I can't even make bread.

1511
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:11,962
I can't do it right.

1512
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:13,756
I'm so stupid. I'm such an idiot.

1513
01:08:15,049 --> 01:08:18,761
[sobbing continues]

1514
01:08:18,844 --> 01:08:20,137
[Bambi] Biboy.

1515
01:08:21,013 --> 01:08:23,766
You're doing it too fast. [sniffles]

1516
01:08:23,849 --> 01:08:26,977
Rushing won't solve everything.

1517
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:29,647
[sniffles]

1518
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,074
[Bambi] Look at me.

1519
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:45,621
If you want something to be done right,
you need to take your time.

1520
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:48,541
And do it with love.

1521
01:08:53,879 --> 01:08:57,967
[gentle music playing]

1522
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:07,351
See, Biboy. You're doing it.

1523
01:09:07,434 --> 01:09:08,727
Look at you.

1524
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:11,814
I can do it after all.

1525
01:09:11,897 --> 01:09:13,983
[chuckles] Yes, you can.
You're great at it.

1526
01:09:14,066 --> 01:09:16,110
You're the only one who can do it.

1527
01:09:16,193 --> 01:09:17,194
Huh?

1528
01:09:18,195 --> 01:09:19,321
Aren't you doing it, too?

1529
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:20,906
Me?

1530
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,908
Oh, I'm just acting.

1531
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:24,952
I can't even do it.

1532
01:09:25,619 --> 01:09:27,079
See, you're so great at it!

1533
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:30,166
- [laughter]
- [pleasant music playing]

1534
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:35,212
Heart bread.

1535
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:37,673
Triangle bread.

1536
01:09:37,756 --> 01:09:39,842
Dinosaur bread.

1537
01:09:39,925 --> 01:09:41,969
You made all these, Biboy?

1538
01:09:42,052 --> 01:09:44,096
- Good job!
- Wow!

1539
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:48,434
[Buneng] I have a suggestion.

1540
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:50,227
- What if we change--
- Shhh…

1541
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:53,439
We have to change the logo.

1542
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:55,649
[Biboy] That's right! We need a new logo!

1543
01:09:55,733 --> 01:09:57,651
- [Bambi chuckles] Wow!
- [Biboy] So cute.

1544
01:09:57,735 --> 01:10:00,779
Such a cute baby.

1545
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,698
[Bambi] Really cute baby.

1546
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:05,743
- Show us how a baby acts!
- [chuckles]

1547
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:08,120
[laughter]

1548
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:11,165
- [woman] So cute!
- Let's start so we can get this over with.

1549
01:10:11,248 --> 01:10:13,918
[silly sound]
Okay. Now show me your smile, baby.

1550
01:10:14,835 --> 01:10:17,796
What an adorable smile!

1551
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:21,008
Let's see a happy baby. Come on.

1552
01:10:21,091 --> 01:10:23,510
Show me a worry-free baby!

1553
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:25,012
[Bambi] Ah!

1554
01:10:25,095 --> 01:10:27,681
[Bambi] Look at that carefree baby!

1555
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:30,476
- [shrieking]
- [Bambi] What a talented baby.

1556
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:32,102
What about a baby…

1557
01:10:32,186 --> 01:10:34,939
who escaped family responsibilities?

1558
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:36,607
- How does that look?
- [camera clicks]

1559
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:41,028
This baby's a pro
at dodging responsibility!

1560
01:10:41,111 --> 01:10:42,613
What about the smile…

1561
01:10:42,696 --> 01:10:45,449
of someone who abandoned
their family, like it was nothing?

1562
01:10:45,532 --> 01:10:46,659
- How's that?
- [camera clicks]

1563
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:49,536
Wow, effortless!

1564
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:50,829
Such a good baby.

1565
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:52,456
Hold on, Bambi.

1566
01:10:52,539 --> 01:10:55,292
Is this a pictorial or an open forum?

1567
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,711
What are you so angry about?

1568
01:10:58,337 --> 01:10:59,463
That I left you?

1569
01:10:59,546 --> 01:11:01,590
And you had to shoulder that burden alone?

1570
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:04,468
Thank you. You want a medal?

1571
01:11:04,551 --> 01:11:05,636
Why?

1572
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:07,054
It's true, isn't it?

1573
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:10,140
You left us, so you could escape
from your obligations.

1574
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:14,520
You wanted an easy life, right?

1575
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:16,647
That's what you think, Bambi.

1576
01:11:18,315 --> 01:11:19,984
I struggled so hard.

1577
01:11:20,734 --> 01:11:23,779
My husband died and left me
a mountain of problems.

1578
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:25,572
I had to face it alone.

1579
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,909
I couldn't bear the shame
of returning home.

1580
01:11:28,993 --> 01:11:31,495
I didn't have enough money
to do that as well.

1581
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:34,915
I was on the verge of begging for scraps!

1582
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:36,041
[tray clatters]

1583
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,169
[Biboy] Baby.

1584
01:11:39,253 --> 01:11:40,713
- [Mayet] Baby.
- [Biboy] Baby.

1585
01:11:42,506 --> 01:11:45,217
[soft music playing]

1586
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:00,607
Buneng?

1587
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:02,484
- [Buneng] Why?
- Where is Baby?

1588
01:12:03,902 --> 01:12:06,947
There. She is still angry.

1589
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:13,120
Are you okay?

1590
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:17,249
Yes. I'm just tired.

1591
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:21,628
Maybe I should ask you. Are you okay?

1592
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:24,548
Your lips look pale.

1593
01:12:25,132 --> 01:12:28,302
Well, you always shush me
whenever I speak.

1594
01:12:28,385 --> 01:12:31,055
My lipstick smeared, so I had to adjust.

1595
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:33,223
What do you think?

1596
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:35,726
Are we ready
for the bakery's grand opening?

1597
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:38,562
Only one thing is missing.

1598
01:12:39,563 --> 01:12:41,231
Papsy's specialty.

1599
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:44,360
Our bakery became famous for it.

1600
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:45,319
Sis.

1601
01:12:45,402 --> 01:12:47,488
Is this the bread known as Kabog?

1602
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:50,741
Buneng and I didn't get to try it.
What does it taste like?

1603
01:12:50,824 --> 01:12:51,784
It's delicious.

1604
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:56,663
But only Momsy and Baby can make it.

1605
01:12:56,747 --> 01:12:58,582
Papsy taught them.

1606
01:12:58,665 --> 01:13:00,292
[Baby] You want to try this?

1607
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:04,671
It's fresh from the oven.
Careful. It's still hot.

1608
01:13:04,755 --> 01:13:06,548
- Is that Kabog?
- Yes. It is.

1609
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:07,966
Let's see.

1610
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:09,927
- We'll finally get to taste it.
- What do you think?

1611
01:13:10,594 --> 01:13:13,347
- Mmm… It's good!
- What do you think?

1612
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:15,015
- [Baby] Oh, thank you.
- [surprised gasp]

1613
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:16,725
[Buneng] It's tasty!

1614
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:19,436
[Baby] Too bad you weren't able
to taste the original,

1615
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,772
the ones Papsy used to make.

1616
01:13:21,855 --> 01:13:23,774
They were truly delicious.

1617
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,943
You know,

1618
01:13:26,026 --> 01:13:29,321
only one person can judge
whether I was able to capture

1619
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:30,614
the taste of the original.

1620
01:13:31,865 --> 01:13:32,908
Bi!

1621
01:13:33,617 --> 01:13:34,618
Bi!

1622
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:36,537
Come here.

1623
01:13:39,706 --> 01:13:40,666
Taste this.

1624
01:13:42,042 --> 01:13:44,211
Come on. Try it.

1625
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:54,763
[Papsy] What do you think?

1626
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:57,182
- [Baby] Papsy, it melts in the mouth!
- [Papsy] Really?

1627
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:59,184
[Baby] Yes, Papsy! It's delicious!

1628
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:00,310
This is the best tasting bread

1629
01:14:00,394 --> 01:14:01,645
- you've ever made.
- Is it good?

1630
01:14:01,728 --> 01:14:03,147
Amazing!

1631
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:08,193
It's tasty, Papsy.

1632
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:09,736
- It's delicious.
- It's tasty, Papsy.

1633
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:11,238
- [man] Good evening.
- Even the filling.

1634
01:14:11,321 --> 01:14:14,116
- A customer.
- Wait a minute!

1635
01:14:15,033 --> 01:14:16,785
Come here, Bamboo.

1636
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:17,995
- Why?
- Come here.

1637
01:14:18,662 --> 01:14:19,663
What's the matter?

1638
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:23,000
Be careful about the things you say.

1639
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:25,627
You don't know how Papsy would react

1640
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:27,754
if he were to find out that you're gay.

1641
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,593
Bamboo, my child.

1642
01:14:38,015 --> 01:14:38,891
It's so yummy!

1643
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:40,976
You said a word earlier…

1644
01:14:41,059 --> 01:14:41,894
"Kabog"?

1645
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,273
I've often heard that word from Dano,

1646
01:14:46,356 --> 01:14:49,485
the beautician across the street.

1647
01:14:49,568 --> 01:14:51,028
What does it mean?

1648
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:57,284
It's an expression.

1649
01:14:57,367 --> 01:15:00,704
It means excellent or joyous.

1650
01:15:00,787 --> 01:15:03,916
When it comes to food,
it means delightful.

1651
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:05,167
Oh.

1652
01:15:06,835 --> 01:15:08,378
That sounds nice.

1653
01:15:09,546 --> 01:15:12,132
I'll call the bread, Kabog.

1654
01:15:12,883 --> 01:15:14,092
Really, Papsy?

1655
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:16,011
Yes. Kabog!

1656
01:15:16,637 --> 01:15:17,721
It's catchy.

1657
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:19,848
Kabog!

1658
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:21,683
You don't mind that it's gay lingo, Papsy?

1659
01:15:25,312 --> 01:15:26,980
I don't see anything wrong with it.

1660
01:15:27,064 --> 01:15:29,274
Why? You don't like it?

1661
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:34,363
I do.

1662
01:15:38,116 --> 01:15:40,077
If my child likes it,

1663
01:15:41,161 --> 01:15:42,287
then I like it, too.

1664
01:15:49,461 --> 01:15:51,421
[giggling]

1665
01:15:52,005 --> 01:15:53,382
You're amazing!

1666
01:15:54,299 --> 01:15:55,842
- [Baby] Papsy!
- [Papsy] Yes?

1667
01:15:55,926 --> 01:15:57,886
Kabog sounds good.

1668
01:15:59,471 --> 01:16:02,307
Oh no. It doesn't taste good. I failed.

1669
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:03,684
I'm sorry.

1670
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:07,938
This tastes exactly
like the ones Papsy used to make.

1671
01:16:08,021 --> 01:16:09,022
Really?

1672
01:16:09,648 --> 01:16:11,525
Baby, teach me how to do it.

1673
01:16:11,608 --> 01:16:15,988
- Okay. It's really easy.
- We can now open the bakery!

1674
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:19,074
- Absolutely!
- Everybody's going to love Kabog!

1675
01:16:19,157 --> 01:16:21,285
- Kabog!
- Kabog!

1676
01:16:21,368 --> 01:16:23,787
[laughter]

1677
01:16:23,870 --> 01:16:25,622
Eat slowly. There's still more.

1678
01:16:25,706 --> 01:16:29,835
[bright music playing]

1679
01:16:32,045 --> 01:16:33,880
- [Mayet] Thank you!
- [Buneng] Try our new bread!

1680
01:16:33,964 --> 01:16:35,382
- Try this.
- [overlapping chatter]

1681
01:16:35,465 --> 01:16:37,509
- [woman] What?
- [man] Yeah.

1682
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:42,889
[overlapping chatter]

1683
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:43,849
[overlapping chatter]

1684
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:46,768
Announcement! Our Kabog bread is sold out.

1685
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:49,396
- [disapppointed gasps]
- Just come back tomorrow.

1686
01:16:49,479 --> 01:16:51,815
- We're very sorry.
- Just come back tomorrow.

1687
01:16:51,898 --> 01:16:54,735
We still have some samples left.

1688
01:16:54,818 --> 01:16:58,530
- [clamoring]
- You like it when it's free.

1689
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:01,533
It's only 5 p.m.
and we've sold out all our bread.

1690
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:03,827
It's a grand opening, indeed.

1691
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:06,538
[cheering]

1692
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:07,914
Let's rest for now.

1693
01:17:07,998 --> 01:17:09,875
We'll bake new bread later.

1694
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:12,377
No rest for us.
We'll have to clean up first.

1695
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:15,422
- Slow down, Biboy.
- [overlapping chatter]

1696
01:17:15,505 --> 01:17:17,591
It's okay, I can do this.

1697
01:17:17,674 --> 01:17:19,718
Buneng, come here.

1698
01:17:22,054 --> 01:17:24,931
- Where's your lipstick?
- Here.

1699
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:27,851
Smile.

1700
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:32,022
What are you doing?

1701
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:34,483
There you go.

1702
01:17:34,566 --> 01:17:36,943
You need some lip tint,
so you won't look anemic.

1703
01:17:38,403 --> 01:17:41,406
Stop acting demure.
You've always been a drama queen.

1704
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:43,033
Just like you.

1705
01:17:43,533 --> 01:17:47,245
Next time, when you have
something to say, just say it.

1706
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:50,415
Don't be shy. Don't be afraid.

1707
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:54,127
I'm sorry for talking over you
and not listening to your opinion.

1708
01:17:54,628 --> 01:17:56,213
You were still a little girl
when I went abroad to work.

1709
01:17:57,255 --> 01:17:59,424
I need to remember
that you're not a child anymore.

1710
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:04,346
You have your own voice now,

1711
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:06,390
and I need to listen to that.

1712
01:18:06,473 --> 01:18:07,891
So, from now on, I will listen to you.

1713
01:18:07,974 --> 01:18:09,226
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

1714
01:18:09,309 --> 01:18:13,605
I have a lot of ideas
for promoting our bakery on social media.

1715
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:15,482
- You wanna hear it?
- Stop right there.

1716
01:18:15,565 --> 01:18:16,483
Let the adults take care of the business.

1717
01:18:16,566 --> 01:18:18,026
But I thought you wanted me to…

1718
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:21,697
- Just kidding! Let's talk later.
- Okay! [chuckles]

1719
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:23,073
[man] Biboy!

1720
01:18:23,156 --> 01:18:24,074
- [woman 1] Wait!
- [woman 2] Oh, no!

1721
01:18:24,157 --> 01:18:26,576
- [indistinct dual overlapping dialogue]
- I heard my bakery is popular now.

1722
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:27,494
[woman] What's going on?

1723
01:18:27,577 --> 01:18:28,620
Your bakery?

1724
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:30,539
Yes. My bakery.

1725
01:18:30,622 --> 01:18:34,835
It's time to pay me back!

1726
01:18:34,918 --> 01:18:36,461
Boys, get them out of here!

1727
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:37,963
- [woman] No way!
- [man shouts] Let's do this!

1728
01:18:38,046 --> 01:18:39,381
- [woman] No way!
- Stop!

1729
01:18:40,841 --> 01:18:41,967
Don't you recognize me?

1730
01:18:42,634 --> 01:18:43,552
Who are you?

1731
01:18:43,635 --> 01:18:45,220
I am Gandarra,

1732
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:48,807
the defender of the universe.

1733
01:18:49,349 --> 01:18:53,770
Scram, or I'll unleash my superpowers!

1734
01:18:53,854 --> 01:18:55,480
[laughter]

1735
01:18:56,481 --> 01:18:59,109
I can turn you all into frogs.

1736
01:18:59,192 --> 01:19:02,529
You'll all go down with just one blow.

1737
01:19:02,612 --> 01:19:03,572
Do it!

1738
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:05,449
Step aside, Buneng.

1739
01:19:05,532 --> 01:19:06,450
Oops.

1740
01:19:08,827 --> 01:19:13,081
[grunts]

1741
01:19:21,465 --> 01:19:23,008
- Help! Neighbors, please help us!
- [overlapping shouting]

1742
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:25,677
[overlapping shouting]

1743
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:27,179
Die, all of you!

1744
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:29,723
- [grunting]
- [thumping]

1745
01:19:29,806 --> 01:19:30,807
- [woman] Hit them!
- [overlapping shouting]

1746
01:19:30,891 --> 01:19:33,894
Sock that bald guy!

1747
01:19:33,977 --> 01:19:36,271
Oh my God. It's you again.

1748
01:19:37,564 --> 01:19:40,233
- [glass shatters]
- [screams]

1749
01:19:40,317 --> 01:19:42,694
Are you okay?

1750
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:44,029
I'm okay.

1751
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:45,155
- [grunts]
- [thuds]

1752
01:19:45,238 --> 01:19:46,281
- [groans]
- Are you okay?

1753
01:19:46,364 --> 01:19:48,325
- Hey.
- [groans]

1754
01:19:48,408 --> 01:19:50,994
Hey, are you okay?

1755
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:55,165
Hey.

1756
01:19:55,248 --> 01:19:58,293
[weakly] You're so pretty.

1757
01:20:01,171 --> 01:20:02,088
Hey.

1758
01:20:02,964 --> 01:20:04,216
- Buneng.
- Yes?

1759
01:20:04,299 --> 01:20:05,509
You're our only hope.

1760
01:20:05,592 --> 01:20:07,677
Do what you have to do.

1761
01:20:07,761 --> 01:20:10,263
- Flirt with him, seduce him,
- Yes.

1762
01:20:10,347 --> 01:20:12,057
- make him fall for you.
- Yes.

1763
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:14,476
If you need to sleep with him, do it.

1764
01:20:14,559 --> 01:20:15,769
- Wait, no!
- No?

1765
01:20:15,852 --> 01:20:18,396
- Yes, I'm game.
- No, don't do it.

1766
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,898
- [groans]
- Oh, he's awake.

1767
01:20:23,693 --> 01:20:26,530
Hey. Hi.

1768
01:20:26,613 --> 01:20:28,156
- Hello.
- Good morning.

1769
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:29,115
Good morning.

1770
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:30,325
Are you okay?

1771
01:20:30,408 --> 01:20:32,077
My head hurts a bit.

1772
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:34,663
[sympathetic groan] Poor boy.

1773
01:20:34,746 --> 01:20:38,583
You poor thing.

1774
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:43,672
You shouldn't have gotten
yourself into trouble.

1775
01:20:43,755 --> 01:20:46,424
Tell me. Are you a spy?

1776
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:49,553
- Huh?
- Huh.

1777
01:20:49,636 --> 01:20:51,471
Tell me why you're here.

1778
01:20:52,389 --> 01:20:54,224
You find me pretty, right?

1779
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:57,060
You're not okay with that?

1780
01:20:57,143 --> 01:20:58,019
[scoffs]

1781
01:20:58,603 --> 01:21:00,647
[Buneng] So gutsy of you.

1782
01:21:02,023 --> 01:21:03,233
I'm Tonton.

1783
01:21:05,527 --> 01:21:06,611
I'm Bianca.

1784
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:08,154
Bianca?

1785
01:21:08,238 --> 01:21:10,448
[Boy] What a phony. Call her Buneng!

1786
01:21:11,616 --> 01:21:12,951
- Buneng?
- No.

1787
01:21:13,451 --> 01:21:14,744
It's pronounced Boo-neng.

1788
01:21:14,828 --> 01:21:16,246
- That's cute.
- [giggles]

1789
01:21:16,329 --> 01:21:17,330
- You've got a cute name.
- [giggles]

1790
01:21:17,414 --> 01:21:19,124
- Just like you.
- [giggling]

1791
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:21,543
- [pounding]
- Okay.

1792
01:21:21,626 --> 01:21:23,295
Um… [clears throat]

1793
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:26,464
I know why you're here.

1794
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:28,425
You're looking for a way

1795
01:21:28,508 --> 01:21:32,596
to avoid paying Bambi's insurance money.

1796
01:21:33,346 --> 01:21:34,389
Am I right?

1797
01:21:35,307 --> 01:21:39,519
That's right. The insurance company
sent me here to verify your claim.

1798
01:21:39,603 --> 01:21:43,356
But I see no problem at all,

1799
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:46,151
and I wanted to see you again.

1800
01:21:46,234 --> 01:21:47,611
Really? [chuckles]

1801
01:21:47,694 --> 01:21:49,446
You're so funny.

1802
01:21:49,529 --> 01:21:54,451
You should've just given me a call.

1803
01:21:55,201 --> 01:21:58,914
Your insurance money
will be released soon.

1804
01:21:58,997 --> 01:22:02,334
Did we hear that right?

1805
01:22:02,417 --> 01:22:03,376
Is it the truth?

1806
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:05,086
Is it fair to all concerned?

1807
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:06,796
Will it build goodwill
and better friendships?

1808
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:07,964
- Yes.
- [Mayet] Relax a bit.

1809
01:22:08,048 --> 01:22:10,133
[Biboy] Let me give you a foot massage.

1810
01:22:10,216 --> 01:22:12,135
[Buneng] Yes, relax a bit.

1811
01:22:12,218 --> 01:22:14,512
You don't have to do that.

1812
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:16,765
Because you are our guest of honor,

1813
01:22:16,848 --> 01:22:18,850
you deserve a super special treat.

1814
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:20,393
Yay!

1815
01:22:20,477 --> 01:22:21,728
Eat our special bread!

1816
01:22:21,811 --> 01:22:23,021
Are you from Pampanga?

1817
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:24,189
[indistinct dialogue]

1818
01:22:24,272 --> 01:22:26,191
I'm just on vacation here.
I'm from Manila.

1819
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:29,069
Buneng is studying in Manila.

1820
01:22:29,152 --> 01:22:30,320
- Yes.
- Um…

1821
01:22:30,403 --> 01:22:32,322
Where in Manila?

1822
01:22:32,405 --> 01:22:34,115
We don't have a house there.

1823
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:37,702
I just stay with Jovy, Bambi's friend.

1824
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:39,287
They have a boarding house
called Homme Sweet Homme.

1825
01:22:39,371 --> 01:22:42,749
Come visit me there. It's near Manila Zoo.

1826
01:22:42,832 --> 01:22:46,419
Buneng, that's enough.

1827
01:22:47,921 --> 01:22:51,758
[indistinct chatter]

1828
01:22:51,841 --> 01:22:53,969
Madam, good morning.

1829
01:22:54,052 --> 01:22:55,470
Is this Homme Sweet Homme?

1830
01:22:55,553 --> 01:22:56,888
Isn't it obvious?

1831
01:22:57,681 --> 01:22:58,640
[Tonton chuckles]

1832
01:22:58,723 --> 01:22:59,766
Yes, it is.

1833
01:22:59,849 --> 01:23:02,936
I was just wondering. Is there
someone named Jovy living here?

1834
01:23:03,019 --> 01:23:05,438
A friend of Bambi Salvador's?

1835
01:23:05,522 --> 01:23:08,108
Jovy! Someone is looking for you.

1836
01:23:10,986 --> 01:23:12,696
Yes, what's the matter?

1837
01:23:13,363 --> 01:23:15,240
What can I do for you, handsome?

1838
01:23:15,323 --> 01:23:18,910
I'm here to investigate
the death of Bambi Salvador.

1839
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:20,328
- Huh?
- Huh?

1840
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:21,746
She was mowed down by a bus.

1841
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:24,874
On her birthday. She was dead on arrival.

1842
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:27,502
- Bambi's birthday?
- Yes.

1843
01:23:27,585 --> 01:23:29,087
That's impossible.

1844
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:30,880
[Jovy] She was here with us.

1845
01:23:30,964 --> 01:23:33,133
In fact, she even stayed a few days

1846
01:23:33,216 --> 01:23:35,301
before going home to Pampanga.

1847
01:23:36,553 --> 01:23:38,388
You mean to tell me…

1848
01:23:39,139 --> 01:23:40,724
that Bambi Salvador is still alive.

1849
01:23:40,807 --> 01:23:41,891
- Yes.
- Yes.

1850
01:23:50,191 --> 01:23:51,317
[spits]

1851
01:23:51,401 --> 01:23:53,945
Bambi, are you okay?

1852
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:54,946
Yes.

1853
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:57,240
I have a headache.

1854
01:23:57,323 --> 01:24:01,077
And I'm worried about
what Buneng said to Tonton.

1855
01:24:02,579 --> 01:24:04,414
Biboy, did you see my scarf?

1856
01:24:04,914 --> 01:24:05,874
No.

1857
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:08,710
Where is my scarf?

1858
01:24:20,388 --> 01:24:21,431
There it is.

1859
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:41,493
Baby is mired in debt?

1860
01:24:41,576 --> 01:24:43,369
[Baby] Yes, don't worry.

1861
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:45,830
I will be there…

1862
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:47,624
tomorrow night with the items.

1863
01:24:54,547 --> 01:24:59,135
[suspenseful music playing]

1864
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:04,474
Dear God, what kind
of trouble is my sister in?

1865
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:10,438
[suspenseful music continues]

1866
01:25:13,233 --> 01:25:15,276
- Baby, what are you up to?
- [Baby gasps]

1867
01:25:16,402 --> 01:25:17,403
[gasps]

1868
01:25:17,487 --> 01:25:19,739
I sold some Kabog bread.

1869
01:25:21,741 --> 01:25:23,118
You're selling bread here?

1870
01:25:23,201 --> 01:25:25,286
Yes. Why?

1871
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:27,205
What about you? What are you doing here?

1872
01:25:28,915 --> 01:25:32,669
I thought you were carrying
something else in your bag.

1873
01:25:32,752 --> 01:25:33,837
Ah.

1874
01:25:34,379 --> 01:25:37,799
- You thought I was selling drugs?
- No, I didn't mean that.

1875
01:25:37,882 --> 01:25:40,343
You really don't trust me, do you?

1876
01:25:40,426 --> 01:25:46,224
I've known that as soon as I got back.

1877
01:25:46,724 --> 01:25:49,644
You're always finding fault with me.

1878
01:25:49,727 --> 01:25:53,148
Bambi, I'm not your foe.

1879
01:25:53,773 --> 01:25:55,233
I'm your sister.

1880
01:25:55,316 --> 01:25:58,486
Wow, that's rich coming from you.

1881
01:25:58,570 --> 01:26:01,072
You left us, remember?

1882
01:26:01,739 --> 01:26:03,158
Haven't we moved on from that?

1883
01:26:03,241 --> 01:26:07,662
No, because I still can't believe
how easily you left us behind.

1884
01:26:08,454 --> 01:26:09,539
[sighs]

1885
01:26:11,624 --> 01:26:13,042
I felt so exhausted.

1886
01:26:13,751 --> 01:26:18,381
I wanted all of us to succeed
and have a good life.

1887
01:26:18,464 --> 01:26:21,634
I didn't want us to be miserable together.

1888
01:26:21,718 --> 01:26:24,137
I couldn't see any other way out.

1889
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:29,475
I promised myself I'd return
to help you all if I made it.

1890
01:26:30,518 --> 01:26:32,145
But I failed.

1891
01:26:32,770 --> 01:26:35,231
I was too ashamed to face you all.

1892
01:26:35,315 --> 01:26:36,149
- Bambi?
- Bambi?

1893
01:26:36,232 --> 01:26:37,233
[gasps]

1894
01:26:38,067 --> 01:26:40,486
What are you doing here?

1895
01:26:44,908 --> 01:26:45,909
Are you Bambi Salvador?

1896
01:26:51,164 --> 01:26:53,499
[Tonton] You could have easily
claimed the insurance money

1897
01:26:54,083 --> 01:26:56,377
if Bambi Salvador Jr.
were in fact deceased,

1898
01:26:57,295 --> 01:26:58,379
but that's not true.

1899
01:26:59,714 --> 01:27:01,591
You were just scamming our company.

1900
01:27:03,426 --> 01:27:05,595
Why would you leave the house
without a disguise?

1901
01:27:05,678 --> 01:27:08,306
[Buneng] You said you believed us.

1902
01:27:08,389 --> 01:27:10,391
Were you just manipulating us?

1903
01:27:10,475 --> 01:27:11,851
I was the manipulative one?

1904
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:13,478
Or was it you?

1905
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:17,106
But thanks anyway, Buneng.

1906
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:19,776
If it weren't for you,
I wouldn't have met Sir Jovy.

1907
01:27:19,859 --> 01:27:23,196
My pronouns are she/her.

1908
01:27:23,279 --> 01:27:24,572
But please, go on.

1909
01:27:24,656 --> 01:27:28,368
Like I said, because of Jovy,

1910
01:27:28,451 --> 01:27:30,370
I found out that on May 1,

1911
01:27:30,453 --> 01:27:32,247
your sibling was able to visit them.

1912
01:27:33,122 --> 01:27:35,416
My point is, Bambi is alive.

1913
01:27:36,668 --> 01:27:40,213
It turns out I didn't even
need to investigate further.

1914
01:27:41,798 --> 01:27:44,550
The evidence came to me.

1915
01:27:44,634 --> 01:27:46,636
Tonton, are you threatening us?

1916
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:49,681
No, Buneng. I'm just doing my job.

1917
01:27:54,769 --> 01:27:55,812
[Biboy] We're screwed!

1918
01:28:03,569 --> 01:28:04,487
[Buneng] Wait!

1919
01:28:05,363 --> 01:28:06,406
Tonton.

1920
01:28:08,074 --> 01:28:10,201
I thought I knew you.

1921
01:28:10,910 --> 01:28:12,829
Was it all just a lie?

1922
01:28:12,912 --> 01:28:15,206
Buneng, believe it or not, I like you.

1923
01:28:15,873 --> 01:28:18,626
But I have to protect my uncle's business.

1924
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:21,296
He raised me ever since
I became an orphan.

1925
01:28:22,463 --> 01:28:26,259
Your family owns Super Sure Life?

1926
01:28:27,593 --> 01:28:28,720
Yes.

1927
01:28:33,182 --> 01:28:34,600
Sue me instead.

1928
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:38,313
Just leave my family alone, please.

1929
01:28:38,396 --> 01:28:40,231
So, it's true.

1930
01:28:41,441 --> 01:28:42,734
You are all scammers.

1931
01:28:44,402 --> 01:28:45,403
Scammers?

1932
01:28:45,987 --> 01:28:46,904
Really?

1933
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:51,492
You sound disgusted.

1934
01:28:52,285 --> 01:28:55,538
My brothers and sisters…
They are good people.

1935
01:28:55,621 --> 01:28:58,583
They sacrificed so much for us.

1936
01:28:59,417 --> 01:29:01,753
They wanted us to have a better life.

1937
01:29:02,879 --> 01:29:04,922
We were just unlucky.

1938
01:29:06,049 --> 01:29:09,886
Our house is being
taken away by a syndicate.

1939
01:29:09,969 --> 01:29:12,388
That's why we resorted to scamming.

1940
01:29:13,264 --> 01:29:16,893
We don't know what we'll do
if we lose the house.

1941
01:29:16,976 --> 01:29:18,811
We didn't know what would happen to us.

1942
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:20,355
This might break us apart.

1943
01:29:20,438 --> 01:29:23,649
Our family would be ruined.
All we have is each other.

1944
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:25,568
We can't lose each other.

1945
01:29:28,363 --> 01:29:32,033
Please, I beg you. Just sue me instead.

1946
01:29:32,116 --> 01:29:34,202
Spare my family.

1947
01:29:36,329 --> 01:29:37,747
Buneng, wait.

1948
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:39,374
- Let go of me.
- Buneng, wait a minute.

1949
01:29:39,457 --> 01:29:41,084
- Let go!
- Come on, Buneng. Where are you going?

1950
01:29:41,167 --> 01:29:43,711
Let me go!
The cars are all waiting for us.

1951
01:29:43,795 --> 01:29:44,879
[vehicles honking]

1952
01:29:44,962 --> 01:29:45,880
What's wrong with you?

1953
01:29:46,464 --> 01:29:48,007
We're done. You may pass!

1954
01:29:48,091 --> 01:29:51,511
- [vehicles honking]
- [drivers shouting complaints]

1955
01:29:51,594 --> 01:29:53,513
- [Buneng sobs] Sorry…
- Buneng.

1956
01:29:53,596 --> 01:29:55,723
What happened?

1957
01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:56,724
- [man] What?
- [woman] What happened?

1958
01:29:56,808 --> 01:29:58,267
- I don't know.
- What happened?

1959
01:29:58,351 --> 01:29:59,602
What did Tonton say?

1960
01:30:00,103 --> 01:30:01,354
Are they going to sue us?

1961
01:30:02,021 --> 01:30:04,232
- What happened? Why are you crying?
- [sobbing]

1962
01:30:04,315 --> 01:30:06,984
Will you please tell us, Buneng?

1963
01:30:10,029 --> 01:30:11,531
I tried to plead with him,

1964
01:30:11,614 --> 01:30:14,909
but his family owns
the life insurance company.

1965
01:30:14,992 --> 01:30:16,536
There's no way out.

1966
01:30:16,619 --> 01:30:17,870
They'll sue us.

1967
01:30:17,954 --> 01:30:19,622
We'll go to jail.

1968
01:30:19,705 --> 01:30:21,499
We'll all go to jail.

1969
01:30:21,582 --> 01:30:23,459
[sobbing continues]

1970
01:30:24,085 --> 01:30:25,670
Why did you have to leave the house?

1971
01:30:25,753 --> 01:30:26,671
[sobbing continues]

1972
01:30:26,754 --> 01:30:28,840
- Our plans are now ruined.
- Hey!

1973
01:30:28,923 --> 01:30:30,842
Don't blame her.

1974
01:30:30,925 --> 01:30:32,468
She left the house because of me.

1975
01:30:32,552 --> 01:30:35,680
- So, that's all right with you?
- Stop it.

1976
01:30:36,222 --> 01:30:38,599
We didn't get the money
and now we're going to jail too?

1977
01:30:39,767 --> 01:30:42,353
Even with the money,
there's no escaping justice.

1978
01:30:42,436 --> 01:30:44,564
There's a price for our sins.

1979
01:30:45,606 --> 01:30:48,359
From the start,
we knew that this was wrong.

1980
01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:52,488
Your greed has consumed you.

1981
01:30:53,656 --> 01:30:55,032
Wait, Bambi.

1982
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:57,160
Wait!

1983
01:30:57,243 --> 01:30:59,662
You're being too harsh with Biboy.

1984
01:30:59,745 --> 01:31:01,247
Yes, he's made a lot of mistakes,

1985
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:03,374
but you always belittle my husband.

1986
01:31:03,457 --> 01:31:05,877
- That's enough.
- Let me talk to her.

1987
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:07,211
- She talks a lot.
- What?!

1988
01:31:08,713 --> 01:31:09,964
I can't take it anymore.

1989
01:31:11,215 --> 01:31:14,594
Do you know why we sold this house
without your permission?

1990
01:31:15,511 --> 01:31:18,639
Biboy wanted to prove himself to you.

1991
01:31:19,473 --> 01:31:20,725
But it didn't work.

1992
01:31:21,434 --> 01:31:22,560
We were unlucky.

1993
01:31:23,436 --> 01:31:24,937
Is that our fault?

1994
01:31:25,563 --> 01:31:26,647
No, it isn't.

1995
01:31:27,398 --> 01:31:29,108
But you have to own up to the truth.

1996
01:31:29,192 --> 01:31:32,320
Even then, you never believed in Biboy.

1997
01:31:32,403 --> 01:31:34,280
You never trusted him.

1998
01:31:34,989 --> 01:31:36,365
I didn't trust him?

1999
01:31:37,491 --> 01:31:38,409
Really?

2000
01:31:39,827 --> 01:31:43,456
When you wanted to open a rice business,
who helped finance it?

2001
01:31:45,124 --> 01:31:47,210
Would I have helped
if I didn't believe in you?

2002
01:31:49,754 --> 01:31:52,965
When you opened a beauty parlor,
who gave you the money to start?

2003
01:31:53,049 --> 01:31:55,051
When it failed,
did you hear anything from me?

2004
01:31:55,134 --> 01:31:57,094
Did I ask you to pay me back?

2005
01:31:58,137 --> 01:32:02,225
And you say you've been
bottling up your emotions?

2006
01:32:02,308 --> 01:32:03,476
Wow!

2007
01:32:03,559 --> 01:32:06,103
And now you're holding a grudge?

2008
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:08,356
But on the phone, you sound so nice,

2009
01:32:08,439 --> 01:32:11,567
always asking me to buy things for you.

2010
01:32:11,651 --> 01:32:13,819
- You have some nerve.
- Really?

2011
01:32:13,903 --> 01:32:17,281
Yes, you have some nerve.
What are you so mad about?

2012
01:32:17,365 --> 01:32:19,617
That I wasn't able to help
with your other business plans?

2013
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:20,785
Well, sorry.

2014
01:32:21,661 --> 01:32:23,246
You're not the reason why I work.

2015
01:32:23,329 --> 01:32:24,247
Are you hearing yourself?

2016
01:32:24,330 --> 01:32:25,706
My family has needs too.

2017
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:27,917
- Can you hear yourself?
- Yes, I do!

2018
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,002
You say you're not asking for money.

2019
01:32:30,086 --> 01:32:32,255
But you keep score on everything!

2020
01:32:32,338 --> 01:32:34,882
You heard her, right?

2021
01:32:34,966 --> 01:32:38,177
- Mayet, stop it.
- It's the truth!

2022
01:32:38,261 --> 01:32:41,347
We feel small every time you give

2023
01:32:41,430 --> 01:32:43,140
because you always
use it against us later.

2024
01:32:43,724 --> 01:32:48,271
But that's what you always say
whenever you're confronted.

2025
01:32:48,354 --> 01:32:50,147
Well, if you don't want to be criticized,

2026
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:53,776
then learn to stand on your own,
instead of relying on me all the time!

2027
01:32:54,318 --> 01:32:57,238
You're one to talk.

2028
01:32:57,321 --> 01:32:59,407
What have you done for us?

2029
01:32:59,490 --> 01:33:02,702
You've done nothing but hula hoop.

2030
01:33:02,785 --> 01:33:05,913
Our family is starving.

2031
01:33:05,997 --> 01:33:09,292
What do you do? All you do is hula hoop!

2032
01:33:09,375 --> 01:33:11,335
- [Biboy] Really?
- Yes!

2033
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:13,546
- You wanna talk about contribution?
- Let's talk about it!

2034
01:33:13,629 --> 01:33:15,214
- You want to talk about it?
- Let's do it.

2035
01:33:15,298 --> 01:33:18,718
- [indistinct dual dialogue]
- Where were you when we were struggling?

2036
01:33:18,801 --> 01:33:20,094
Where was I?

2037
01:33:20,177 --> 01:33:22,013
Fine! Okay!

2038
01:33:22,096 --> 01:33:24,098
I have no contribution.

2039
01:33:24,181 --> 01:33:28,394
But I've never been a freeloader,

2040
01:33:28,477 --> 01:33:30,771
- like some people.
- Hey!

2041
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:35,901
You have no right
to call him a freeloader.

2042
01:33:36,527 --> 01:33:40,031
They're no strangers. They're my family.

2043
01:33:42,616 --> 01:33:46,162
Baby, don't act like
you're concerned for me.

2044
01:33:46,787 --> 01:33:48,372
When did you ever care?

2045
01:33:49,415 --> 01:33:51,792
Why? Don't you see?

2046
01:33:51,876 --> 01:33:53,794
They're disrespecting you.

2047
01:33:53,878 --> 01:33:55,379
You've sacrificed so much.

2048
01:33:55,463 --> 01:33:56,839
You've given them everything you have.

2049
01:33:56,922 --> 01:33:58,507
But it's still not enough.

2050
01:33:58,591 --> 01:34:00,509
It's still your fault.

2051
01:34:00,593 --> 01:34:02,845
If I were in your position…

2052
01:34:02,928 --> 01:34:04,722
and my own brother scammed me…

2053
01:34:04,805 --> 01:34:07,558
I would send this idiot to jail!

2054
01:34:09,226 --> 01:34:13,314
Your problem is you're too nice!

2055
01:34:15,816 --> 01:34:17,109
[Bambi] So, I'm the problem?

2056
01:34:17,193 --> 01:34:19,278
Bambi, please…

2057
01:34:19,362 --> 01:34:21,322
- I'm the problem?
- Ask yourself.

2058
01:34:21,405 --> 01:34:23,157
- So, I'm in the wrong?
- Ask yourself.

2059
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:25,826
So, it was a mistake, huh?

2060
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:28,537
When I decided to support this family…

2061
01:34:28,621 --> 01:34:31,248
so we would survive,
was that the wrong decision?

2062
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:34,752
I'm sorry, Baby. I'm not like you.

2063
01:34:36,796 --> 01:34:39,215
I'm not like you,
who took the easy way out

2064
01:34:39,298 --> 01:34:42,551
by running away.

2065
01:34:44,303 --> 01:34:46,597
Isn't that what you did?

2066
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:48,015
Where did you go?

2067
01:34:48,516 --> 01:34:50,601
- We just lost you.
- Is it truly bad to abandon your family?

2068
01:34:50,684 --> 01:34:51,936
[Buneng] Boy.

2069
01:34:52,686 --> 01:34:55,022
Especially when you
must provide for everything?

2070
01:34:55,106 --> 01:34:57,942
If I were Baby, I would've left too.

2071
01:34:58,025 --> 01:34:58,901
Boy, that's enough.

2072
01:34:58,984 --> 01:35:01,529
I knew I could count on you when I left.

2073
01:35:01,612 --> 01:35:04,156
I know how much this family means to you.

2074
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:07,201
I knew that if I wasn't here,
you'd be the one I could count on.

2075
01:35:07,827 --> 01:35:09,078
That's rude!

2076
01:35:09,578 --> 01:35:12,081
- I don't want to be like you!
- What?!

2077
01:35:12,164 --> 01:35:14,041
Boy, what are you doing?!

2078
01:35:14,959 --> 01:35:17,420
I don't want you to pass
the responsibility on to me.

2079
01:35:17,503 --> 01:35:18,421
Why?

2080
01:35:18,504 --> 01:35:19,797
Because I'm gay?

2081
01:35:22,091 --> 01:35:23,801
So, I have to be the breadwinner?

2082
01:35:25,094 --> 01:35:28,848
I'm afraid that my life
is going to be like yours.

2083
01:35:28,931 --> 01:35:30,224
[Bambi] What about my life?

2084
01:35:30,933 --> 01:35:32,101
Bambi,

2085
01:35:33,978 --> 01:35:36,105
have you ever experienced being in love?

2086
01:35:36,188 --> 01:35:37,273
[sniffles]

2087
01:35:38,858 --> 01:35:41,735
Have you even experienced
being loved by someone?

2088
01:35:42,528 --> 01:35:45,281
What kind of question is that?

2089
01:35:46,824 --> 01:35:50,202
You've left nothing for yourself.

2090
01:35:52,121 --> 01:35:55,082
I don't want a miserable life like yours.

2091
01:35:55,166 --> 01:35:56,459
- My life isn't miserable.
- I'm not gonna carry

2092
01:35:56,542 --> 01:35:58,252
- My life isn't miserable.
- the weight of this family.

2093
01:35:58,335 --> 01:36:00,504
I don't want to be miserable like you!

2094
01:36:00,588 --> 01:36:02,465
I'm not miserable!

2095
01:36:02,548 --> 01:36:04,758
- My life isn't miserable. I am happy.
- Stop it!

2096
01:36:04,842 --> 01:36:07,636
- Stop it.
- How dare you!

2097
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:08,846
[crying]

2098
01:36:08,929 --> 01:36:11,307
How dare you tell me
that my life is miserable

2099
01:36:11,390 --> 01:36:13,017
when you're also gay like me?

2100
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:15,394
- My life is not miserable.
- [Baby] That's enough!

2101
01:36:16,228 --> 01:36:17,813
I am happy.

2102
01:36:17,897 --> 01:36:21,400
I'm happy that I'm able
to provide for this family.

2103
01:36:22,026 --> 01:36:24,361
I'm happy when my mother
is in good health.

2104
01:36:24,445 --> 01:36:26,280
I'm happy when my family is happy.

2105
01:36:26,363 --> 01:36:29,033
I was happy.

2106
01:36:32,119 --> 01:36:34,288
[sobbing]

2107
01:36:34,371 --> 01:36:38,250
But you're right.
You shouldn't be like me.

2108
01:36:38,751 --> 01:36:41,003
You're right.
You don't need to be like me.

2109
01:36:41,086 --> 01:36:42,880
You're so right.

2110
01:36:42,963 --> 01:36:43,923
[exhales]

2111
01:36:44,548 --> 01:36:46,258
[Buneng crying]

2112
01:36:46,342 --> 01:36:50,429
Don't be like me because you
wouldn't be able to handle it.

2113
01:36:51,597 --> 01:36:53,474
You'll be drained.

2114
01:36:56,310 --> 01:36:57,937
You might even die from it.

2115
01:36:59,647 --> 01:37:03,150
You don't know how hard it is
to take care of everything.

2116
01:37:05,236 --> 01:37:06,904
It's exhausting.

2117
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:10,199
It's tiring.

2118
01:37:12,451 --> 01:37:14,328
You can never rest.

2119
01:37:15,496 --> 01:37:17,998
You can't even take a break to relax.

2120
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:25,714
You can never stop and just rest.

2121
01:37:30,678 --> 01:37:33,013
Rest? What does that even mean?

2122
01:37:33,097 --> 01:37:34,139
What is it?

2123
01:37:34,223 --> 01:37:40,229
Is that when you don't think
of anyone else, just yourself?

2124
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:48,445
Is that when you stop

2125
01:37:48,529 --> 01:37:54,118
and just lie down in silence
because you're just overwhelmed?

2126
01:37:54,201 --> 01:37:55,536
Is that what it means to rest?

2127
01:37:57,830 --> 01:38:02,543
What does it mean to rest?
I don't even remember what it's like.

2128
01:38:03,210 --> 01:38:05,629
I haven't done it in such a long time.

2129
01:38:07,548 --> 01:38:10,301
I can't just tell my family,

2130
01:38:10,968 --> 01:38:14,096
"Wait a minute. Don't go hungry yet.

2131
01:38:14,179 --> 01:38:18,142
Don't eat. Just let me rest
because I'm so tired."

2132
01:38:18,225 --> 01:38:19,768
I can't say that.

2133
01:38:19,852 --> 01:38:22,021
I can't tell my siblings

2134
01:38:22,104 --> 01:38:26,191
to stop their schooling

2135
01:38:26,275 --> 01:38:29,612
because I'm dead tired
and I need to take some rest.

2136
01:38:29,695 --> 01:38:31,947
I can't say that.

2137
01:38:32,531 --> 01:38:38,454
I can't tell you
not to get sick or buy medicine

2138
01:38:38,537 --> 01:38:43,626
because I'm feeling ill
and I need to take a break.

2139
01:38:43,709 --> 01:38:46,962
I can't tell you that.
I can't take a break.

2140
01:38:47,630 --> 01:38:50,841
I can never stop. I have to keep going.

2141
01:38:51,717 --> 01:38:53,510
I am not allowed to rest.

2142
01:38:55,512 --> 01:38:59,016
I can't stop because
I don't have anyone to help me.

2143
01:39:02,561 --> 01:39:04,813
If I stop, who will take over?

2144
01:39:07,524 --> 01:39:09,526
If I rest, who will carry on?

2145
01:39:11,612 --> 01:39:13,364
No one will do it, right?

2146
01:39:14,031 --> 01:39:15,866
I don't have a backup.

2147
01:39:16,742 --> 01:39:19,411
Because I became your backup, Baby!

2148
01:39:19,495 --> 01:39:23,165
- You made me your backup.
- Stop it.

2149
01:39:23,248 --> 01:39:26,001
- You made me your backup.
- Please stop.

2150
01:39:26,085 --> 01:39:30,130
And worse than that, you abandoned me.

2151
01:39:30,214 --> 01:39:32,091
- Please stop.
- [crying]

2152
01:39:32,966 --> 01:39:34,843
I was alone.

2153
01:39:35,511 --> 01:39:37,763
[Buneng] Please stop fighting.

2154
01:39:37,846 --> 01:39:40,265
Why am I alone?

2155
01:39:40,349 --> 01:39:43,936
Who made the rule that there
should only be one breadwinner?

2156
01:39:44,019 --> 01:39:49,066
Why can't we all contribute
to supporting the family?

2157
01:39:49,608 --> 01:39:52,236
[sobbing]

2158
01:39:52,319 --> 01:39:54,697
Why am I alone?

2159
01:39:54,780 --> 01:39:56,699
It's so tiring.

2160
01:39:56,782 --> 01:39:59,201
[sobbing]

2161
01:39:59,284 --> 01:40:00,661
What were you saying earlier?

2162
01:40:00,744 --> 01:40:03,914
You were asking me
if I experienced being in love?

2163
01:40:03,997 --> 01:40:05,290
Or be loved?

2164
01:40:08,669 --> 01:40:09,962
Never!

2165
01:40:11,547 --> 01:40:14,758
Because I don't have the time for it.

2166
01:40:14,842 --> 01:40:19,847
I don't have the time
to fall in love and flirt.

2167
01:40:20,556 --> 01:40:23,559
I don't have time for that
because you take up all my time.

2168
01:40:23,642 --> 01:40:29,064
You drain me of every emotion.
There's nothing left.

2169
01:40:30,149 --> 01:40:32,901
I don't even care about
having a boyfriend anymore.

2170
01:40:34,111 --> 01:40:35,904
All that matters is my family.

2171
01:40:36,447 --> 01:40:41,910
A family that loves me
and would never betray me.

2172
01:40:41,994 --> 01:40:44,913
A family that would never hurt me.

2173
01:40:45,539 --> 01:40:47,666
A family that loves me so much,

2174
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:53,130
that when I go home, they will embrace me.

2175
01:40:53,213 --> 01:40:55,299
But when I returned home,

2176
01:40:57,926 --> 01:40:59,887
what was waiting for me?

2177
01:41:01,430 --> 01:41:02,556
This?

2178
01:41:05,267 --> 01:41:08,562
This rotting house.

2179
01:41:08,645 --> 01:41:10,689
This house that is falling apart.

2180
01:41:10,773 --> 01:41:11,857

2181
01:41:12,608 --> 01:41:16,069
- Stop it, please!
- [objects clattering]

2182
01:41:16,153 --> 01:41:19,072
- Stop it, please!
- Stop it!

2183
01:41:19,156 --> 01:41:23,410
When I left,
this still looked like a house.

2184
01:41:23,494 --> 01:41:26,997
But when I returned,
it looked like a cemetery.

2185
01:41:27,080 --> 01:41:29,416
Bambi, please. That's enough.

2186
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:36,006
You turned this into
a cemetery of my dreams.

2187
01:41:36,089 --> 01:41:37,966
You killed my dreams.

2188
01:41:38,050 --> 01:41:41,637
I did everything I could.

2189
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:45,307
I gave everything you asked for.

2190
01:41:45,390 --> 01:41:49,144
- [Buneng] Sorry.
- Everything you wanted, I gave it all.

2191
01:41:49,228 --> 01:41:53,899
I worked night and day
to give you everything you wanted.

2192
01:41:53,982 --> 01:41:55,651
But what did you do?

2193
01:41:56,568 --> 01:41:58,403
What do you think of me?

2194
01:42:00,197 --> 01:42:02,241
You think I'm a bank?

2195
01:42:05,077 --> 01:42:08,580
I'm not a bank.

2196
01:42:09,164 --> 01:42:10,791
I'm just a savings jar.

2197
01:42:10,874 --> 01:42:15,254
You can take advantage of me only once.

2198
01:42:15,337 --> 01:42:17,631
If you break me
and take everything I have,

2199
01:42:17,714 --> 01:42:19,007
I'll be worthless.

2200
01:42:19,091 --> 01:42:20,968
That's me right now.

2201
01:42:21,552 --> 01:42:22,803
Shattered.

2202
01:42:23,470 --> 01:42:25,305
I'm broken into pieces.

2203
01:42:26,056 --> 01:42:29,101
I have nothing left. What good am I for?

2204
01:42:29,184 --> 01:42:30,894
- I'm worthless now.
- That's not true.

2205
01:42:30,978 --> 01:42:34,314
You're disrespecting me
now that I'm worthless.

2206
01:42:34,398 --> 01:42:37,651
You're being rude because I'm broke now.

2207
01:42:37,734 --> 01:42:39,444
This is too much.

Bambi, we're sorry.

2212
01:42:46,368 --> 01:42:48,328
Stop it.

2213
01:42:48,412 --> 01:42:53,250
I don't even know my place
in this family anymore.

2214
01:42:56,378 --> 01:43:00,465
Do I still matter
if I'm not a breadwinner?

2215
01:43:03,343 --> 01:43:05,304
I thought I was a breadwinner.

2216
01:43:09,391 --> 01:43:11,810
But why do I feel like a loser?

2217
01:43:15,731 --> 01:43:20,152
- My God, why am I such a loser?
- I'm also sorry…

01:43:20,235 --> 01:43:21,653
Momsy is missing.

2219
01:43:21,737 --> 01:43:23,822
She must have wandered off again.

2220
01:43:23,906 --> 01:43:25,365
When did you last see her?

2221
01:43:26,033 --> 01:43:27,451
I fell asleep.

2222
01:43:28,702 --> 01:43:30,245

01:44:16,291 --> 01:44:18,126
Momsy, I didn't know you were here.

2226
01:44:19,252 --> 01:44:22,506
Finally, someone is here to pick you up.

2227
01:44:23,215 --> 01:44:27,010
Ma'am, she keeps coming here,

2228
01:44:27,094 --> 01:44:28,595
to wait for someone.

2229
01:44:29,972 --> 01:44:31,598
Who is she waiting for?

2230
01:44:31,682 --> 01:44:33,642
I'm waiting for my child.

2231
01:44:34,393 --> 01:44:36,186
Bambi.

2232
01:44:36,269 --> 01:44:38,146
She's on her way home.

2233
01:44:38,730 --> 01:44:42,484
What time is the bus arriving from Manila?

2234
01:44:42,567 --> 01:44:47,030
My Bambi is on that bus.
She's coming home.

[Bambi sobs]

2236
01:44:58,125 --> 01:44:59,334
Really?

Yes.

2238
01:45:01,753 --> 01:45:03,588
You remember her?

2239
01:45:05,007 --> 01:45:09,344
Of course! A mother doesn't forget.

01:45:09,428 --> 01:45:10,804
Never!

I can never forget her.

2244
01:45:21,690 --> 01:45:26,028
She is the kindest among my children.

2246
01:45:28,447 --> 01:45:30,699
You think about her too?

Yes. She's always on my mind.
Why are you crying?

2248
01:45:35,954 --> 01:45:37,748
Do you love her too?

Are they?

Remember when

You liked that, didn't you?

01:46:41,937 --> 01:46:44,064
[sobbing]

2261
01:46:47,150 --> 01:46:48,610
My child.

2262
01:46:49,277 --> 01:46:50,612
Momsy.

2263
01:46:51,863 --> 01:46:54,825
I've wanted to hug you for so long.

2264
01:46:57,327 --> 01:47:01,706
I've been waiting to hug you ever since.

2265
01:47:04,417 --> 01:47:09,422
I thought I would never
get to embrace you again.

2266
01:47:10,173 --> 01:47:12,467
[sobbing continues]

2267
01:47:12,551 --> 01:47:14,386
[Momsy] My child.

2268
01:47:19,432 --> 01:47:23,019
I miss you so much, Momsy.

2269
01:47:23,770 --> 01:47:28,233
I miss you too.
Please don't ever leave again.

2270
01:47:30,569 --> 01:47:34,781
Don't leave me. Don't go.

2271
01:47:34,865 --> 01:47:37,325
I am afraid.

2272
01:47:39,995 --> 01:47:42,789
I am so afraid.

2273
01:47:44,666 --> 01:47:47,544
I'm afraid I'll have to leave you again.

2274
01:47:50,547 --> 01:47:51,882
Why?

2275
01:47:55,302 --> 01:47:59,014
I'm sick. [sobbing]

2276
01:48:01,016 --> 01:48:06,146
[Bambi] I'm afraid to leave you.

2277
01:48:06,229 --> 01:48:08,315
[sobbing]

2278
01:48:08,398 --> 01:48:11,610
I don't want to go.

2279
01:48:11,693 --> 01:48:13,820
[whimpering] You're not going anywhere.

2280
01:48:13,904 --> 01:48:17,324
I have cancer, Momsy.

2281
01:48:17,407 --> 01:48:18,742
[sobbing]

2282
01:48:21,411 --> 01:48:23,872
I want to stay with you,

2283
01:48:24,915 --> 01:48:28,293
but I am terminally ill.

2284
01:48:32,756 --> 01:48:34,382
- I'm scared.
- Bambi.

2285
01:48:37,260 --> 01:48:42,557
[sobbing]

2286
01:49:00,242 --> 01:49:03,036
[doctor]
Glioblastoma is a high-grade brain tumor.

2287
01:49:03,119 --> 01:49:05,497
Early symptoms are simple headaches.

2288
01:49:05,580 --> 01:49:08,166
Patients might also lose
their sense of balance.

2289
01:49:08,833 --> 01:49:12,003
That's why Bambi trips
and feels dizzy at times.

2290
01:49:12,087 --> 01:49:15,215
Looking at Bambi's condition,
I think she'll be lucky if she lasts…

2291
01:49:15,298 --> 01:49:16,174
for six months.

2292
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:18,301
That's just my own opinion.

2293
01:49:18,843 --> 01:49:23,098
Doc, in my opinion, you're too harsh.

2294
01:49:23,765 --> 01:49:24,849
I'm sorry.

2295
01:49:27,811 --> 01:49:28,645
[Baby sighs deeply]

2296
01:49:28,728 --> 01:49:30,939
[all sobbing]

2297
01:49:31,022 --> 01:49:33,483
- [Buneng] Bambi!
- [Mayet] Bambi!

2298
01:49:33,566 --> 01:49:37,821
[sobbing continues]

2299
01:49:39,114 --> 01:49:40,615
Don't cry.

2300
01:49:41,324 --> 01:49:43,827
We have to be strong for Bambi.

2301
01:49:43,910 --> 01:49:46,579
- [Baby] Stop crying.
- [Buneng] Okay.

2302
01:49:48,999 --> 01:49:50,083
[Baby] She's waking up.

2303
01:49:50,166 --> 01:49:53,003
Stop crying. We have to look happy.

2304
01:49:53,086 --> 01:49:54,796
[man crying]

2305
01:50:07,058 --> 01:50:08,518
- [Baby] Ready?
- [woman whimpers]

2306
01:50:08,601 --> 01:50:10,979
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

2307
01:50:11,062 --> 01:50:13,523
Does it look good?

2308
01:50:13,606 --> 01:50:15,358
Did you bring me to a fraternity?

2309
01:50:15,442 --> 01:50:16,985
[laughter]

2310
01:50:17,068 --> 01:50:18,778
Where are we?

2311
01:50:18,862 --> 01:50:21,573
This is our old room.

2312
01:50:21,656 --> 01:50:23,366
We just fixed it for you.

2313
01:50:23,450 --> 01:50:27,495
Remember the video we showed you
when you were in Taiwan?

2314
01:50:27,579 --> 01:50:29,080
This is what it looked like.

2315
01:50:29,164 --> 01:50:31,791
This is the room you've always
dreamed of for yourself.

2316
01:50:31,875 --> 01:50:34,502
But wait! There's more!

2317
01:50:34,586 --> 01:50:38,048
One, two, three!

2318
01:50:38,131 --> 01:50:40,508
[cheering]

2319
01:50:40,592 --> 01:50:41,843
[woman] So beautiful, right?

2320
01:50:41,926 --> 01:50:43,053
[Baby] It's beautiful!

2321
01:50:43,136 --> 01:50:44,846
[Bambi] It's so beautiful.

2322
01:50:44,929 --> 01:50:47,307
But it looks like it'll
use up a lot of electricity.

2323
01:50:47,390 --> 01:50:48,850
We'll take care of that.

2324
01:50:49,893 --> 01:50:53,688
I'm not used to being alone.
I'd prefer if we all stayed here.

2325
01:50:53,772 --> 01:50:56,232
No, this room is all yours.

2326
01:50:56,316 --> 01:51:00,403
For all the things you've done for us,
this is all we can give you.

2327
01:51:00,487 --> 01:51:01,488
Thank you for everything.

2328
01:51:01,571 --> 01:51:02,405
[Buneng] Thank you, sis.

2329
01:51:02,489 --> 01:51:05,408
- I agree. Thank you.
- Thank you.

2330
01:51:05,492 --> 01:51:07,494
Sorry and goodbye.

2331
01:51:08,119 --> 01:51:09,662
- Not yet.
- What do you mean goodbye?

2332
01:51:09,746 --> 01:51:11,081
Goodbye to bad vibes.

2333
01:51:11,164 --> 01:51:13,583
- And bad memories.
- Ah.

2334
01:51:13,666 --> 01:51:15,668
Could we start all over again?

2335
01:51:17,545 --> 01:51:18,588
[cheering]

2336
01:51:18,671 --> 01:51:21,216
- Kiss and make up.
- [smooches]

2337
01:51:23,635 --> 01:51:24,886
This makes me happy.

2338
01:51:24,969 --> 01:51:27,597
I wish I could have more days
to celebrate with you.

2339
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:30,308
We will have many more days like this.

2340
01:51:30,392 --> 01:51:33,561
We don't need
a special occasion to celebrate.

2341
01:51:33,645 --> 01:51:35,980
- We can celebrate every day.
- [Biboy] That's right!

2342
01:51:36,064 --> 01:51:38,691
- [Baby] Right.
- [Buneng] Every day.

[Baby] <i>For all the occasions</i>

Ma'am Bambi. Happy birthday.

2348
01:52:02,841 --> 01:52:06,511
I'm Elias, the brother of Mikha.

2349
01:52:06,594 --> 01:52:08,012
You worked with my sister in Taiwan.

2350
01:52:08,096 --> 01:52:11,099
Thank you so much
for all the help you gave my sister.

2351
01:52:11,182 --> 01:52:13,643
Because of you, I was able
to finish my studies.

2352
01:52:14,519 --> 01:52:17,480
You're welcome. Don't mention it.

2353
01:52:17,564 --> 01:52:21,359
I'm glad you're helping so many people.

2354
01:52:22,068 --> 01:52:23,611
You have a big heart.

2355
01:52:23,695 --> 01:52:25,196

[blows]

2361
01:52:40,003 --> 01:52:41,921
You shouldn't have sent me to the hospital

2362

if you were just going to kill me anyway.

2363

01:52:47,260 --> 01:52:48,511
Yes.

<i>Even Christmas,</i>

01:52:58,521 --> 01:53:00,607
- Beautiful!
- Merry Christmas!

2369
01:53:00,690 --> 01:53:02,734
[Biboy] Come on. The food might get cold.

[indistinct dialogue]

2371
01:53:07,447 --> 01:53:09,407
[Baby] Next week,

2372
01:53:09,491 --> 01:53:14,537
- we'll celebrate Valentine's.
- I'm excited!

2373
01:53:14,621 --> 01:53:16,122
I know who my date will be.

2374
01:53:16,206 --> 01:53:18,500
- Really?
- Are you sure he wants to date you?

2375
01:53:18,583 --> 01:53:20,251
You're just bitter and jealous.

2376
01:53:20,335 --> 01:53:21,794
Baby, how about you?

2377
01:53:21,878 --> 01:53:23,087
Who's going to be your date?

2378
01:53:23,838 --> 01:53:25,590
Forget Valentine's.

2379
01:53:25,673 --> 01:53:27,509
- Let's celebrate New Year's instead.
- Yes, that's right.

2380
01:53:27,592 --> 01:53:29,385
- [Biboy] That would be fun.
- Yes.

2381
01:53:29,469 --> 01:53:34,015
MaPa, how do people get to heaven?

2382
01:53:38,102 --> 01:53:42,315
Well, a special airplane picks them up.

2383
01:53:44,526 --> 01:53:47,111
A pink airplane.

2384
01:53:50,490 --> 01:53:52,784
Covered in glitter.

01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:56,663

01:54:03,878 --> 01:54:06,381

Please don't go, MaPa.
