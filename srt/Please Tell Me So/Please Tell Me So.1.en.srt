1
00:00:26,313 --> 00:00:31,328
(Please Tell Me So)

2
00:00:49,281 --> 00:00:51,914
(He's my ideal type.)

3
00:00:57,171 --> 00:01:00,218
(I like men with glasses on whenever they read books
He tied a bow with his hoodie string, Cute)

4
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:06,458
(I like men enjoying their sweets)

5
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:09,110
(The man with a scar and its history)

6
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,653
(Soft)

7
00:01:10,678 --> 00:01:13,515
(The man who looks good with a cap)

8
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,956
(The man gulping his coffee)

9
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,890
This is on the house.

10
00:01:55,851 --> 00:01:58,234
I didn't really mean to drink coffee today.

11
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,554
Then I'll make another drink for you.

12
00:02:03,476 --> 00:02:04,664
I was just kidding.

13
00:02:05,064 --> 00:02:06,273
Thank you.

14
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,585
Here's what you ordered.

15
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,851
Thank you, please visit us again.

16
00:02:40,908 --> 00:02:42,093
Would you want me to light it for you?

17
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,914
Ah, alright.

18
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,369
My high school senior...

19
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,617
My high school senior used
to light cigarettes like that.

20
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,524
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

21
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:14,168
I was smoking secretly
during cleaning time.

22
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:16,029
It was not the same way, but.

23
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:19,365
He held two cigarettes on his mouth

24
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,505
and like this.

25
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:28,082
So I thought he was doing it in a really...

26
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,041
unique way.

27
00:03:32,442 --> 00:03:33,782
Are you recalling…

28
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:36,024
your old love story…

29
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,041
because of me?

30
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:39,860
No.

31
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,564
Not at all.

32
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,775
I should've lit up with a lighter.

33
00:03:46,697 --> 00:03:47,775
No...

34
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,306
Is your place this way?

35
00:04:37,974 --> 00:04:38,759
Yes.

36
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,978
Ah, okay.

37
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,540
Need a ride?

38
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,611
Yes?

39
00:05:51,213 --> 00:05:54,979
(Why aren't you updating your ideal types?)

40
00:06:04,338 --> 00:06:06,424
(I'm with him now.)

41
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,650
Me?

42
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:08,951
Sorry?

43
00:06:08,976 --> 00:06:10,009
I asked if it's me.

44
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:11,814
What is?

45
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,668
(Why aren't you updating your ideal types?)
(I'm with him now)

46
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,049
So you knew all along?

47
00:06:21,437 --> 00:06:22,485
Mostly.

48
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,994
But why, why didn't you tell me?

49
00:06:26,736 --> 00:06:28,587
I could ask you the same thing.

50
00:06:30,314 --> 00:06:33,181
Why didn't you tell me that you like me?

51
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,157
How could I possibly tell you?

52
00:06:36,986 --> 00:06:38,361
What about me?

53
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,283
I wanted to tell you

54
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,780
but you were talking
about your first love.

55
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,198
He's not my first love.

56
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,133
I think he was.

57
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,236
No!

58
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,126
My first love…

59
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,486
My first love is...

60
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,306
you...
