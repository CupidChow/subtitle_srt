1
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:27,338
You think Mr. Seong
will be okay, right?

2
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:29,133
What if they killed him already?

3
00:00:29,216 --> 00:00:32,473
If they were going to kill him
they wouldn't have brought him out there.

4
00:00:32,556 --> 00:00:36,356
You're certain they took Mr. Seong
to that island where they play the games?

5
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:39,445
Well, I can't say that for sure,
but that's what my gut's telling me.

6
00:00:39,529 --> 00:00:43,119
From what I remember,
the island was somewhere around this area.

7
00:00:43,203 --> 00:00:45,123
"If we fail to capture
the Front Man alive,

8
00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:47,044
we sneak onto the island however we can."

9
00:00:47,127 --> 00:00:50,091
We're still doing that, right?
Plan B, just like Mr. Seong wanted?

10
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:53,014
Once they start up the games again,
his life may be in danger.

11
00:00:53,097 --> 00:00:54,851
We need to find him before it's too late.

12
00:00:54,934 --> 00:00:56,897
Just wait till I get my hands
on these fuckers.

13
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,360
I'm gonna tase their asses
till they shit smoke.

14
00:01:00,529 --> 00:01:02,115
- Hey!
- Huh?

15
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:03,869
Everyone on board? Let's go.

16
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:32,009
SQUID GAME 2

17
00:01:34,722 --> 00:01:38,730
EPISODE 3
001

18
00:02:43,986 --> 00:02:45,405
Player 456.

19
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:49,622
I sense you're holding on
to a great many things.

20
00:02:49,705 --> 00:02:51,960
You feel frozen, unable to leave or stay.

21
00:02:53,588 --> 00:02:55,300
There's no use trying to fight it.

22
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,761
Your fate is decided.

23
00:02:58,306 --> 00:03:01,980
I see the wandering souls trapped with you
unable to rest in death.

24
00:03:02,648 --> 00:03:06,656
You didn't come here of your own volition.
Those vengeful souls dragged you here.

25
00:03:08,242 --> 00:03:10,873
You have bad karma,
but I can help with that.

26
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:14,922
As soon as we get out of here
I can cleanse you with a gut ritual.

27
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:37,133
I would like to extend
a heartfelt welcome to you all.

28
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,012
Over the next six days,

29
00:03:39,096 --> 00:03:42,227
you will participate
in six different games.

30
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,694
Those who win all six games
will receive a handsome cash prize.

31
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,241
Excuse me.

32
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:58,342
If we're just playing games here,
then why you'd basically kidnap us?

33
00:03:58,426 --> 00:03:59,929
How can we trust you now?

34
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:04,271
My apologies.
Please understand it was a necessary step

35
00:04:04,354 --> 00:04:07,235
taken to maintain
the strict confidentiality of these games.

36
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,740
Is that right?
Then what's the deal with the masks?

37
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:12,621
That's a secret too, I'm guessing?

38
00:04:13,498 --> 00:04:16,712
Yeah. Why are you wearing those?

39
00:04:16,796 --> 00:04:19,969
Where the hell are we?
Is this some kind of illegal casino, huh?

40
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:22,766
If this were one of those,
you'd see the dealers' faces!

41
00:04:25,981 --> 00:04:28,903
To ensure the fairness
and confidentiality of the games,

42
00:04:28,987 --> 00:04:32,243
it is our policy not to disclose
the faces and identities of our staff

43
00:04:32,327 --> 00:04:33,538
to participants.

44
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:34,957
We ask for your understanding.

45
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,462
Did you people strip me
when you shoved me into this?

46
00:04:37,546 --> 00:04:38,882
And where the hell are my shoes?

47
00:04:39,884 --> 00:04:42,389
God damn it,
that pair was fucking limited edition.

48
00:04:43,432 --> 00:04:45,812
They don't even make those anymore.
What the hell?

49
00:04:45,896 --> 00:04:47,607
How you gonna fix it if they got ruined?

50
00:04:47,691 --> 00:04:51,198
Look at this. The size is all wrong
and I hate the colors you're using.

51
00:04:53,285 --> 00:04:55,790
Can I have the outfit
you guys are wearing instead?

52
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:57,669
The pink's cute as hell.

53
00:04:59,172 --> 00:05:02,011
My apologies,
but I'm afraid that's not possible.

54
00:05:02,095 --> 00:05:05,393
To ensure the games run smoothly,
you must wear your uniforms.

55
00:05:05,476 --> 00:05:06,771
Uh, what about my phone?

56
00:05:08,315 --> 00:05:10,612
You took my phone and my wallet.
What the hell's going on?

57
00:05:10,695 --> 00:05:11,781
When'll we get those?

58
00:05:11,864 --> 00:05:14,870
Your belongings are safe
and being stored securely.

59
00:05:14,954 --> 00:05:17,542
We will return them to you
once the games have ended.

60
00:05:17,626 --> 00:05:19,379
Can I please get my phone
returned at least?

61
00:05:19,463 --> 00:05:21,383
I need to see how my crypto is doing.

62
00:05:21,467 --> 00:05:23,763
Are you guys gonna compensate me
if can't trade my coins?

63
00:05:23,846 --> 00:05:26,602
We will return your phone
once the games have ended.

64
00:05:26,685 --> 00:05:29,149
I need to know if the market's going down.

65
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,988
Do you know how much money I've invested?

66
00:05:32,071 --> 00:05:34,868
Player 333, Lee Myung-gi.

67
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:41,590
Age 30, former owner
of the YouTube channel, MG Coin.

68
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,803
Promoted Dalmatian, a new cryptocurrency,

69
00:05:43,887 --> 00:05:47,561
leading his subscribers to lose
a combined 15.2 billion won.

70
00:05:47,644 --> 00:05:49,481
He then shut down his channel
and disappeared.

71
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:52,320
Currently wanted for fraud

72
00:05:52,404 --> 00:05:55,243
and violating multiple communication
and investment laws.

73
00:05:55,326 --> 00:05:57,706
Total debt: 1.8 billion won.

74
00:05:57,789 --> 00:06:00,795
196, Kang Mi-na. Total debt: 45 million.

75
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:04,094
120, Cho Hyun-ju. Total debt: 330 million.

76
00:06:04,595 --> 00:06:07,475
230, Choi Su-bong, 1.19 billion.

77
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:10,815
198, Jang Do-yeong, 1.4 billion.

78
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:13,320
- 226, Kim Yeong-sam, 1.9 billion.
- What is this shit?

79
00:06:13,404 --> 00:06:16,452
444, Kim Nam-du, 2.02 billion.

80
00:06:16,535 --> 00:06:19,291
343, Sim Jae-seok, 2.89 billion.

81
00:06:19,374 --> 00:06:21,336
006, Park Mi-hwa, 3.1 billion.

82
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,050
283, Lee Eun-ju, 4.02 billion.

83
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,637
100, Im Jeong-dae,

84
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,766
total debt: ten billion.

85
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:30,146
<i>One more round!</i>

86
00:06:30,772 --> 00:06:33,235
Ten billion?
Which one is he? Where…

87
00:06:34,321 --> 00:06:36,032
What are you looking at?

88
00:06:36,116 --> 00:06:38,454
Think it's easy to get loans that large?

89
00:06:38,537 --> 00:06:41,084
They don't give out ten billion
to just anyone!

90
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:43,714
You have to work in the big leagues
for that!

91
00:06:46,261 --> 00:06:48,307
Every player standing in this room

92
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,603
is living on the brink of financial ruin.

93
00:06:50,687 --> 00:06:54,569
You're on the edge of a cliff saddled with
debts you cannot hope to pay off.

94
00:06:54,653 --> 00:06:58,703
When we first approached each of you,
you understandably did not trust us.

95
00:06:59,287 --> 00:07:01,583
But as you know, we played a game,

96
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:04,882
and true to our word,
we gave you money when you won.

97
00:07:04,965 --> 00:07:06,844
Because of that we earned your trust.

98
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:10,017
You called and volunteered
to participate in this game

99
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,520
of your own free will.

100
00:07:11,603 --> 00:07:13,065
So this is it.

101
00:07:13,148 --> 00:07:15,695
I'll give you one last chance to decide.

102
00:07:15,778 --> 00:07:18,409
Will you go back
to living like useless trash,

103
00:07:18,492 --> 00:07:20,162
running from your creditors,

104
00:07:20,246 --> 00:07:24,295
or will you take action and seize
the opportunity we're offering you?

105
00:07:29,222 --> 00:07:31,309
We're getting closer.

106
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,069
It seems like
it's one of those islands ahead of us.

107
00:07:40,411 --> 00:07:42,415
Captain, why don't we pick up the pace.

108
00:07:42,498 --> 00:07:44,210
Aye, aye. Your wish is my command.

109
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,194
If you look above you,

110
00:07:57,278 --> 00:08:00,910
you will see the piggy bank where
your prize money is going to be stored.

111
00:08:01,495 --> 00:08:03,749
As I said, you will play six games.

112
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,920
After the conclusion of each game,

113
00:08:06,004 --> 00:08:07,966
more prize money
will be added to the piggy bank.

114
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:15,523
What's the total prize money at the end?

115
00:08:15,606 --> 00:08:19,489
The total prize money is 45.6 billion won.

116
00:08:19,572 --> 00:08:22,203
45.6 billion won?

117
00:08:22,286 --> 00:08:23,789
And does just one person get it all?

118
00:08:23,873 --> 00:08:26,753
More details
on how the prize money gets divided

119
00:08:26,837 --> 00:08:28,966
will be shared
after the first game has ended.

120
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,972
For these games, we will also
be giving you a special option

121
00:08:32,056 --> 00:08:33,851
that we've never offered before.

122
00:08:33,934 --> 00:08:34,978
And what option's that?

123
00:08:35,855 --> 00:08:38,569
After each game,
you will be given a chance to vote

124
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:40,698
on whether you'd like to
end the games there

125
00:08:40,781 --> 00:08:42,451
or if you want to keep playing.

126
00:08:42,535 --> 00:08:46,418
If the majority of you wish to stop,
the games will be terminated.

127
00:08:46,501 --> 00:08:50,300
You can then take the prize money
that has accumulated and leave.

128
00:08:51,929 --> 00:08:52,847
Hold on.

129
00:08:53,849 --> 00:08:55,603
After game one, if we vote to go,

130
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:58,650
then the prize money
gets divided among us?

131
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,949
That is correct.

132
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,150
Out of my way! Move it!
Excuse me, let me through.

133
00:09:19,233 --> 00:09:20,987
Stupid idiot!

134
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,030
Ma?

135
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,201
Mom, what are you doing here?

136
00:09:24,285 --> 00:09:25,997
- That's what I was gonna ask you!
- Quiet.

137
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,875
What on earth
do you think you're doing here?

138
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:30,255
- Quiet! You're embarrassing me.
- I'm embarrassing you?

139
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:32,677
You should be embarrassed about
getting into this mess!

140
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,223
That's enough, quiet.
Why don't we just talk later.

141
00:09:35,307 --> 00:09:36,810
No, we're gonna do this right now.

142
00:09:36,893 --> 00:09:38,730
Let's go.
You're leaving, right this second.

143
00:09:38,814 --> 00:09:40,609
Get out of here. Go, hurry up.

144
00:09:40,693 --> 00:09:43,740
What are you doing here?
It's not safe for you, just look around!

145
00:09:43,824 --> 00:09:45,035
What's gotten into you, woman?

146
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,122
Oh, you wanna know why I'm here, huh?

147
00:09:47,623 --> 00:09:49,878
To pay off my ungrateful son's debt!

148
00:09:49,961 --> 00:09:51,673
Why else would I be here, use your head!

149
00:09:51,756 --> 00:09:53,260
I swear to god, I raised an idiot.

150
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:56,140
You're crazy!
How could you drag an old lady into this?

151
00:09:56,224 --> 00:09:57,894
What if she were to fall or something?

152
00:09:57,977 --> 00:09:59,731
Aren't you guys liable for that? Huh?

153
00:09:59,814 --> 00:10:02,946
Yong-sik, Yong-sik.
Listen, I'll stay and do this.

154
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:05,033
You should just go home, okay, hon?

155
00:10:05,117 --> 00:10:08,164
Mom! I came all this way,
I can't just leave now.

156
00:10:08,248 --> 00:10:10,419
Remember what you just swore to me, huh?

157
00:10:10,962 --> 00:10:13,216
You said you'd never gamble again,
didn't you?

158
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,222
It's not like that.
There's no gambling here.

159
00:10:16,306 --> 00:10:17,433
Just games, like they said.

160
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:20,105
I'll stay here and try one game.
After that I'll go.

161
00:10:20,188 --> 00:10:22,443
Dumbbell. Gaming, gambling,
it's all the same thing!

162
00:10:22,526 --> 00:10:24,489
- Quiet. Stop it, seriously!
- Stupid kid.

163
00:10:29,165 --> 00:10:33,674
If you wish to participate in the games,
then please sign the player consent form.

164
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:38,266
If you do not wish to participate,
then please let us know at this time.

165
00:10:38,934 --> 00:10:41,439
We will provide further opportunities
to leave the games,

166
00:10:41,523 --> 00:10:43,234
- should you change your mind.
- To be clear,

167
00:10:43,318 --> 00:10:46,407
you'll still pay us if we just do one?
That's the deal, right?

168
00:10:49,497 --> 00:10:51,668
Come on, Mom,
why would you wanna stay here?

169
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,046
Just go home, I can handle this.

170
00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:55,551
Hey, listen, if you're not leaving
then I'll stay here too.

171
00:10:55,634 --> 00:10:58,348
- I'm not going anywhere without you.
- Can we hurry it up a little?

172
00:11:10,372 --> 00:11:13,712
MG Coin? The Amazing Myung-gi? That you?

173
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:17,261
And you are?

174
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:20,016
You don't know me, but I sure know you, G.

175
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,102
MG Coin.

176
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,607
I was subscribed to your channel.

177
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:26,112
I lost hundreds of millions
because of your shit advice.

178
00:11:26,195 --> 00:11:27,489
So did I.

179
00:11:28,074 --> 00:11:29,744
I think you've got the wrong guy.

180
00:11:30,829 --> 00:11:33,209
I used to watch your videos every day,
you know?

181
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:36,006
Now my dreams
are full of your ugly fucking face.

182
00:11:37,676 --> 00:11:40,474
- Yo, your name's Nam-su?
- Gyu. Nam-gyu.

183
00:11:40,557 --> 00:11:42,436
- Promoter at Club Pentagon.
- Oh, right, yeah.

184
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:46,110
Anyways, thanks to you, Nam-gyu and I
really bonded with each other.

185
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,949
Through our shared trauma.

186
00:11:51,496 --> 00:11:53,333
Didn't those fuckers
who made that shit-coin

187
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:56,088
go to the Philippines
with all the cash they took?

188
00:11:57,048 --> 00:11:58,259
What are you doing here?

189
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:00,305
Did they ditch you too?

190
00:12:00,388 --> 00:12:02,309
So what exactly do you want?

191
00:12:02,935 --> 00:12:05,858
What do you think? Our money.

192
00:12:05,941 --> 00:12:08,947
Did I force either of you
to invest in Dalmatian?

193
00:12:09,031 --> 00:12:11,870
You fucking said everyone should sink
every last penny into it.

194
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:13,915
That it was going to the moon.

195
00:12:15,043 --> 00:12:17,631
That if you didn't buy it,
you'd be a fucking idiot!

196
00:12:18,967 --> 00:12:21,055
"Whenever you're investing,
in the end it's up to you

197
00:12:21,138 --> 00:12:23,643
to make the final call
based on your own judgment."

198
00:12:24,395 --> 00:12:27,108
Do you forget about that part
at the end of the videos?

199
00:12:27,192 --> 00:12:29,071
I thought you watched them every day.

200
00:12:30,574 --> 00:12:32,619
Whoa, chill, bro.
Time out, time out, time out!

201
00:12:32,703 --> 00:12:35,166
- Take it easy.
- Let go, hey…

202
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,003
- Think about the album.
- Let go of me!

203
00:12:38,172 --> 00:12:39,132
Too many people.

204
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:41,011
You don't wanna end up on the news.

205
00:12:45,854 --> 00:12:48,526
You better get rich here.

206
00:12:49,403 --> 00:12:51,532
'Cause I want my money once this is done.

207
00:12:52,826 --> 00:12:54,079
Let's go, dude.

208
00:13:15,705 --> 00:13:16,707

209
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,628

212
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,222

00:13:24,306 --> 00:13:26,644
4. IF THE GAMES ARE TERMINATED,
PLAYERS WILL DIVIDE THE PRIZE EQUALLY

215
00:13:28,815 --> 00:13:31,487
If you do not wish
to participate in the games,

216
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,491
then please let us know at this time.

217
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:48,771
SEONG GI-HUN

218
00:13:48,855 --> 00:13:50,400
I knew it. What'd I tell ya?

219
00:13:50,483 --> 00:13:52,946
And you said you were done
looking for this place.

220
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,328
Sorry, Captain. It was an emergency,

221
00:13:56,412 --> 00:13:58,457
and you were the one person
I was sure I could call.

222
00:14:00,127 --> 00:14:03,593
Suddenly you show up unannounced
with these Men In Black-looking guys.

223
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,305
What the hell's all this fuss about?

224
00:14:05,388 --> 00:14:08,185
And you know,
as the captain of this here vessel,

225
00:14:09,271 --> 00:14:11,400
I've got the right to know
what's going on.

226
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:13,863
We got a lead
on the island's exact whereabouts.

227
00:14:15,742 --> 00:14:16,786
Yeah, what lead?

228
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:18,957
I found someone
who played the games and survived.

229
00:14:21,003 --> 00:14:22,130
- No shit.
- Yeah.

230
00:14:22,923 --> 00:14:25,052
And now it looks like
they've dragged him back there.

231
00:14:26,347 --> 00:14:29,102
We have a way to track his location.

232
00:14:29,186 --> 00:14:30,396
Detective Hwang!

233
00:14:30,981 --> 00:14:34,029
Uh, according to my phone,
it looks like it's that island over there.

234
00:14:34,112 --> 00:14:35,490
You familiar with it?

235
00:14:35,573 --> 00:14:38,788
Oh, yeah, so folks lived there
back in the day, I'm pretty sure,

236
00:14:38,872 --> 00:14:42,253
but these days nobody really
goes out there except to fish on shore.

237
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,679
I mean, sounds like
it ticks all the boxes, doesn't it?

238
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:49,059
If it's the one,
then there should be roads on it.

239
00:14:49,142 --> 00:14:51,146
Plus helipads,
and other kinds of structures.

240
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,691
I'll check for those with the drone.

241
00:14:52,774 --> 00:14:55,321
You take a team on shore
and follow the signal on your phone.

242
00:14:55,405 --> 00:14:58,285
Okay. Hey you guys!
Get ready to disembark!

I'm a huge fan. I go to all your concerts.

254
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,347
Would it be okay
if you and I took a picture?

255
00:15:29,431 --> 00:15:31,936
- Take a picture with me too!
- Me too. I want a picture.

256
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:33,230
Hold on, wait.

257
00:15:33,314 --> 00:15:35,318
Thanos can't take
a million pictures today.

258
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,614
How about all in one?
Is that cool with you?

So you wanna be in it? Come on.

266
00:15:57,195 --> 00:15:59,574
Only one person
takes a picture at a time.

267
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:01,620
Really? Can't you make an exception?

268
00:16:01,704 --> 00:16:04,417
We can't take pictures
since you guys took our phones. Please?

269
00:16:05,002 --> 00:16:05,920

270
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,930

you guys can give me your phones.

271

272
00:16:14,354 --> 00:16:16,191

- Yong-sik, is that a man or a woman?

276
00:16:39,153 --> 00:16:40,782
People can do that now.

277
00:16:40,865 --> 00:16:42,243
Someone's originally a man,

278
00:16:42,326 --> 00:16:44,664
but they transition into a woman
after a while.

279
00:16:45,165 --> 00:16:47,629
- I don't get why a man would want that.
- Shh. Quiet.

280
00:16:47,712 --> 00:16:51,136
- One or the other, that's how things are.
- You can't say that, Mom. Quiet.

281
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:52,764
Honestly.

Gi-hun! Gi-hun, Gi-hun!

286
00:17:30,631 --> 00:17:31,466
Jung-bae.

287
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,055
Hey! Holy shit! You're alive!

288
00:17:34,138 --> 00:17:35,766
What are you doing here?

289
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:38,605
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

290
00:17:38,689 --> 00:17:41,778
You've been MIA for three years,
and I heard your mom passed away.

291
00:17:41,862 --> 00:17:43,657
Why'd I hear about it from my wife,
not you?

292
00:17:43,741 --> 00:17:45,578
I thought you and I were friends, asshole.

293
00:17:45,661 --> 00:17:47,665
Is this 'cause
I wouldn't lend you money back then?

294
00:17:47,749 --> 00:17:49,126
Is that the reason you ghosted me?

295
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,339
Hey, keep moving, you're blocking the way.

296
00:17:52,508 --> 00:17:54,262
It's got nothing to do with that.

297
00:17:55,472 --> 00:17:56,683
It's a long story.

298
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,691
Since you're here, I'm guessing
things are still pretty rough for you.

299
00:18:00,775 --> 00:18:04,282
But even so, you should've told me
when your mother died.

300
00:18:04,365 --> 00:18:06,035
You know how much I liked her.

301
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,997
What are you doing in here?

302
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,127
What about your wife?

303
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,005
We got divorced.

304
00:18:12,757 --> 00:18:13,759
Divorced?

305
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:17,600
- And your kid?
- Her mom has custody.

306
00:18:17,684 --> 00:18:20,815
Why? I thought
the two of you were doing okay.

307
00:18:23,821 --> 00:18:26,910
- Were you messing around?
- Like I could swing that.

308
00:18:26,994 --> 00:18:28,455
I don't wanna talk about it now.

309
00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:30,751
Once we get outta here,
we'll catch up over some drinks.

310
00:18:32,505 --> 00:18:34,050
Listen, Jung-bae.

311
00:18:34,133 --> 00:18:36,054
Stay behind me once it starts.

312
00:18:36,137 --> 00:18:37,891
No matter what happens, understand?

313
00:18:37,974 --> 00:18:40,396
What's going on with you, Gi-hun?
You're being such a drama--

314
00:18:40,479 --> 00:18:41,815
Look, trust me on this!

315
00:18:43,109 --> 00:18:44,988
You just need to promise
to stay close to me.

316
00:18:47,368 --> 00:18:50,165
Okay, dude. Sure.

317
00:18:50,249 --> 00:18:51,084
What, like this?

318
00:18:51,167 --> 00:18:53,296
Like we're in a conga line, huh?

319
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,509
Seriously, though,
this is some weird shit.

320
00:19:21,686 --> 00:19:22,647
It's over here.

321
00:19:30,162 --> 00:19:32,708
- Sweep in from the coast, try to stay low.
- Got it.

322
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:38,679
Whoa!

323
00:19:51,955 --> 00:19:54,210
- Fuck me.
- <i>Attention, players.</i>

00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:57,132

Nah, that's all right.

332
00:20:15,502 --> 00:20:18,675

to get to know each other.

333

341
00:20:51,073 --> 00:20:52,701
Hold on. What's that?

342
00:21:09,193 --> 00:21:11,739
Jesus, why the hell
can't there be a trail!

343
00:21:14,662 --> 00:21:17,584
Oh! There, look! We found him! Look!

344
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:45,056
<i>Welcome to the first game.</i>

345
00:21:45,139 --> 00:21:47,310
<i>You will be playing</i>
<i>Red Light, Green Light.</i>

346
00:21:47,394 --> 00:21:49,607
Wait, we're playing
Red Light, Green Light? Is that all?

347
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,821
I was right. No gambling.
It's just a game, see?

348
00:21:52,905 --> 00:21:54,408
I played this one when I was a kid.

349
00:21:56,788 --> 00:21:59,752
Is that all they want us to play?
Red light, Green Light?

350
00:21:59,835 --> 00:22:00,921
Hey, you.

351
00:22:01,672 --> 00:22:02,925
- What?
- Ah, shit.

352
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,969
Hey!

353
00:22:04,052 --> 00:22:06,181
- Hold on.
- Hey. What… What are you doing?

354
00:22:06,265 --> 00:22:07,851
Damn it!

355
00:22:08,352 --> 00:22:09,647
Hey, that's my shit!

356
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,692
- Not so fast. Stay there.
- What's going on?

357
00:22:11,776 --> 00:22:13,446
Don't move.

358
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,241
What's the matter, dude?

359
00:22:18,038 --> 00:22:19,040
Oh!

360
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:21,629
Hey, man, is that your tooth?

361
00:22:21,712 --> 00:22:23,842
Where is it?

362
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,762
Fuck!

363
00:22:32,025 --> 00:22:33,027
Shit.

364
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,134
<i>I'm fucked.</i>

365
00:22:45,719 --> 00:22:47,639
- Where'd you get this?
- Um, get what?

366
00:22:47,723 --> 00:22:49,309
The fucking chip! Where did you get it?

367
00:22:49,393 --> 00:22:51,814
Wait, earlier. I, um… Back at the dock,

368
00:22:52,482 --> 00:22:54,946
there was this guy who gave me
his container of leftover bait.

369
00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:56,323
Was that in there?

370
00:22:56,407 --> 00:22:57,284
Shit.

371
00:22:58,286 --> 00:23:00,415
Detective Hwang, you there?
Those fuckers are onto us.

372
00:23:00,498 --> 00:23:03,463
<i>They found the tracker and</i>
<i>stuck it on someone else to throw us off.</i>

373
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:08,598
We are ready to start the game, sir.

374
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:16,029
Start video transmission.

375
00:23:17,616 --> 00:23:19,495
<i>Players who cross the finish line</i>

376

377
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:24,797
<i>- will win this game.</i>
- Everyone!

378
00:23:25,507 --> 00:23:27,719
Everybody, you need to pay attention!

379
00:23:27,803 --> 00:23:29,723
Hey, listen up!

380
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,650
I'm gonna tell you something
and you gotta listen close!

381
00:23:35,234 --> 00:23:37,489
This isn't just a game,
it's more than that.

382
00:23:37,572 --> 00:23:39,743
If you move after "red light,"

383
00:23:40,411 --> 00:23:41,622
you're going to be shot!

384
00:23:45,171 --> 00:23:47,467
- What?
- What's this guy's deal?

385
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:51,726
Excuse me, sir.
What exactly are you saying?

386
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:55,400
That we're all gonna die
playing Red Light, Green Light? Really?

387
00:23:55,483 --> 00:23:57,487
- Come on, let's do it.
- Yes, that's right!

388
00:23:57,571 --> 00:24:01,286
If they catch you moving,
you're going to be killed!

389
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,416
They're gonna shoot you.
There's guns in the walls!

390
00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:05,086
That guy's gotta be drunk or something.

391
00:24:05,169 --> 00:24:07,465
- Pay close attention!
- He says they'll shoot us.

392
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:09,302
You know, this is just like my dad.

393
00:24:09,386 --> 00:24:10,680
Whenever he comes home drunk,

394
00:24:10,764 --> 00:24:12,684
he always starts shouting
the same bullshit.

395
00:24:12,768 --> 00:24:15,022
- Says they bugged him.
- That sensor catches you,

396
00:24:15,106 --> 00:24:16,400
- you will die!
- Crazy shit.

397
00:24:16,483 --> 00:24:18,780
You see that big doll thing there?
Look at it!

398
00:24:18,863 --> 00:24:20,575
Its eyes are like motion-tracking sensors!

399
00:24:20,658 --> 00:24:23,456
- Motion-tracking eyes.
- If it sees you move, you die!

400
00:24:23,539 --> 00:24:25,877
If it sees us, then we get to see Dad.

401
00:24:25,961 --> 00:24:28,006
What is this bullshit?
What's your angle?

402
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:30,136
I think he's just trying
to freak people out.

403
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:32,808
Then he wouldn't have to share the money.
He could win all of it.

404
00:24:32,891 --> 00:24:35,480
Hey, you bastard, you're not fooling us!

405
00:24:35,563 --> 00:24:37,985
You gotta believe me,
I swear I'm not lying!

406
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:10,633
<i>No matter what, do not panic!</i>
<i>You can't afford to!</i>

407
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,096
Remember everything I told you!

408
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:15,685
Stay as still as you can!
Don't try and run away!

409
00:25:15,768 --> 00:25:17,939
<i>With that, let the game begin.</i>

410
00:25:22,448 --> 00:25:23,617
<i>Green light.</i>

411
00:25:25,663 --> 00:25:26,665
<i>Red light!</i>

412
00:25:29,504 --> 00:25:30,631
Now freeze!

413
00:25:40,818 --> 00:25:44,075
Good job! That's it,
keep nice and calm, just like that.

414
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:48,041
You got it? Move steady as you go,
and then stop before "red light."

415
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:49,795
- What you doing?
- If you do that,

416
00:25:49,878 --> 00:25:52,508
- we'll make it out alive!
- Is this asshole a friend of yours?

417
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:53,886
No, never met him.

418
00:25:55,848 --> 00:25:56,809
<i>Green light.</i>

419
00:25:59,898 --> 00:26:01,860
<i>- Red light!</i>
- Freeze!

420
00:26:03,656 --> 00:26:05,827
All right, good,
just try to relax!

421
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:07,330
Stay where you are!

422
00:26:07,998 --> 00:26:10,210
You need to cut it out,
you're scaring everyone.

423
00:26:10,294 --> 00:26:12,674
Speak with your mouth covered.
It could be seen.

424
00:26:15,095 --> 00:26:16,097
<i>Green light.</i>

425
00:26:17,767 --> 00:26:19,395
- Wait, aren't you--
- <i>Red light!</i>

426
00:26:19,479 --> 00:26:20,481
Freeze!

427
00:26:26,702 --> 00:26:28,205
<i>Green light.</i>

Freeze!

430
00:26:34,008 --> 00:26:36,054
- Are you insane?
- I said cover your mouth!

431
00:26:38,851 --> 00:26:40,438
- <i>Green light.</i>
- Follow me!

432
00:26:42,817 --> 00:26:44,738
- <i>Red light!</i>
- Freeze!

433
00:26:52,128 --> 00:26:53,505
<i>Green light.</i>

434
00:26:55,969 --> 00:26:57,973
- <i>Red light!</i>
- <i>Hold still!</i>

435
00:27:02,273 --> 00:27:03,442
<i>Green light.</i>

436
00:27:05,989 --> 00:27:08,243
<i>- Red light!</i>
- Freeze!

437
00:27:08,953 --> 00:27:10,498
Nobody move a muscle!

438
00:27:11,124 --> 00:27:12,961
What's going on, is he high?

439
00:27:13,044 --> 00:27:15,257
Nope. That dude's not high.

440
00:27:15,341 --> 00:27:16,677
And you would know?

441
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,555
You wanna try?

442
00:27:23,691 --> 00:27:24,776
What's that?

443
00:27:26,697 --> 00:27:30,037
It knows you're a flower.
You got a bee crawling on you.

444
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,331
A bee?

445
00:27:34,796 --> 00:27:38,303
Oh, shit.
I just moved, didn't I?

446
00:27:44,023 --> 00:27:46,444
<i>Listen to me! Nobody move!</i>

447
00:27:47,154 --> 00:27:49,576
<i>Don't turn your head, don't do anything!</i>

448
00:27:49,659 --> 00:27:51,872
<i>Player 196, eliminated.</i>

449
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:58,176
Jung-bae, no matter what happens,
don't move, do you hear me?

450
00:28:02,393 --> 00:28:04,564
Stay where you are! Don't move!

451
00:28:15,043 --> 00:28:17,548
No! Stop moving!

452
00:28:18,717 --> 00:28:20,262
You gotta stay still! Do not run!

453
00:28:22,266 --> 00:28:23,226
Stay still.

454
00:28:24,145 --> 00:28:27,318
If you run, you will die!

455
00:28:28,612 --> 00:28:32,829
I told you, you're gonna die
if you don't stay still!

456
00:28:38,715 --> 00:28:42,515
Don't move! Don't react!
Stay exactly where you are!

457
00:28:42,598 --> 00:28:43,892
Please don't run!

458
00:28:56,543 --> 00:28:58,380
You have to freeze right where you are!

459
00:29:02,221 --> 00:29:04,308
Freeze!

460
00:29:17,585 --> 00:29:19,756
<i>I will repeat the rules again.</i>

461
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,764
<i>You are allowed to move forward</i>
<i>when it says, "Green light."</i>

462
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:26,394
<i>When it says "Red Light," you must stop.</i>

463
00:29:26,477 --> 00:29:31,320
<i>If your movement is detected afterwards,</i>
<i>you will be eliminated.</i>

464
00:29:54,867 --> 00:29:56,078
<i>Green light.</i>

465
00:29:58,792 --> 00:29:59,961
<i>Red light!</i>

<i>Green light.</i>

469
00:30:40,166 --> 00:30:41,168
<i>Red light.</i>

470
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:47,514
If you don't cross the line in time,
they'll still kill you!

471
00:30:47,598 --> 00:30:49,059
Look at the doll's eyes!

472
00:30:49,143 --> 00:30:51,481
They're cameras
that scan the field for motion!

473
00:30:51,564 --> 00:30:54,320
But it's not able to detect you
if you're behind something!

474
00:30:56,574 --> 00:30:59,455
So if you're short, line up behind someone
who's taller than you!

475
00:30:59,538 --> 00:31:01,960
Single file,
like you're forming a conga line!

476
00:31:03,087 --> 00:31:05,717
Time's running out!
Go at the next green light!

477
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:10,018

- That's not fair.

521
00:35:13,086 --> 00:35:14,965
She just fell right onto me!

522
00:35:15,884 --> 00:35:16,927
Wait, don't shoot.

523
00:35:18,096 --> 00:35:19,641
Please don't shoot.

00:35:21,436 --> 00:35:23,774
<i>Player 444, eliminated.</i>

00:35:24,735 --> 00:35:27,114

527
00:35:30,413 --> 00:35:31,415
<i>Green light.</i>

528
00:35:32,792 --> 00:35:33,836
<i>Red light!</i>

529
00:35:34,629 --> 00:35:36,341
Help me, please.

530
00:35:45,234 --> 00:35:46,862
- <i>Green light.</i>
- Hey, hey! Wait.

531
00:35:46,946 --> 00:35:48,908
- Where are you going?
- <i>Red light!</i>

532
00:35:52,457 --> 00:35:54,419
I don't wanna die in here.

533
00:35:54,502 --> 00:35:56,047
I'll help. Now listen.

534
00:35:56,131 --> 00:35:57,968
When it calls green light,
get on your feet.

535
00:35:59,554 --> 00:36:00,765
<i>Green light.</i>

536
00:36:02,811 --> 00:36:03,896
<i>Red light!</i>

537
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:22,308

00:36:42,181 --> 00:36:43,183
Are you okay?

540
00:36:44,143 --> 00:36:45,229
Thank you so much.

541
00:36:46,439 --> 00:36:48,443
Thank you so much--

542
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:07,815
Hey, Number 011.

543
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:10,571
Was that you?

544
00:37:12,408 --> 00:37:13,911
He lost, so I took him out.

545
00:37:14,412 --> 00:37:15,957
Jesus.

546
00:37:17,752 --> 00:37:19,965
<i>Player 444, eliminated.</i>

547
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,255
<i>Soldiers who have completed your task,</i>

548
00:38:01,339 --> 00:38:02,884
<i>please line up in front of your rooms.</i>

549
00:38:32,985 --> 00:38:35,616
Hey, we can't just
sit here and do nothing.

550
00:38:35,699 --> 00:38:38,329
We should search a couple of
the surrounding islands. Let's go.

551
00:38:38,413 --> 00:38:41,502
If they wanted to lure us out here,
I doubt the real one is close by.

552
00:38:41,586 --> 00:38:44,216
Storm front's coming in.
They issued a warning.

553
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,345
I think it's better if we call it a day.

554
00:38:46,429 --> 00:38:47,431
Shit.

555
00:38:48,182 --> 00:38:49,685
This search is going to take a while.

556
00:38:49,769 --> 00:38:52,190
Let's head in
so we can think of a new plan of attack.

557
00:38:52,984 --> 00:38:55,363
How'd they know
he had a tracker in his implant?

558
00:38:56,157 --> 00:38:58,829
Did one of you guys go get drunk
and blab about it last night?

559
00:39:04,548 --> 00:39:06,845
Come on, boys.
It's gonna get pretty cold soon.

560
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:08,348
Let's pack up the gear and move out.

561
00:39:33,189 --> 00:39:34,400
You okay, bro?

562
00:39:36,446 --> 00:39:38,157
- Don't worry.
- But…

563
00:39:38,867 --> 00:39:40,203
- You just--
- I'm okay.

564
00:39:40,913 --> 00:39:44,587
Hey, Gi-hun.
What was that crazy-ass doll thing?

565
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,257
Were the guns inside its eyes?

566
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,847
The doll wasn't the one shooting at us.

567
00:39:51,267 --> 00:39:53,396
They have a team of guards
up in the walls.

568
00:39:55,734 --> 00:39:57,362
How could you know that, though?

569
00:39:58,239 --> 00:39:59,575
Have you been here before?

570
00:40:18,738 --> 00:40:21,828
You have successfully
made it through the first game.

571
00:40:21,911 --> 00:40:23,748
Congratulations to you all.

572
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:28,717
Now, if I may have your attention,
I will announce the results so far.

573
00:40:33,017 --> 00:40:36,607
Out of 456 players,
91 have been eliminated.

574
00:40:36,691 --> 00:40:40,574
Which means
365 players have completed the first game.

575
00:40:43,037 --> 00:40:48,548
Once again, congratulations to all of you
for making it through the first game.

576
00:40:48,631 --> 00:40:51,220
Sir, listen to me! Let us go, please!

577
00:40:52,389 --> 00:40:54,101
Please! Don't kill us!

578
00:40:54,184 --> 00:40:57,148
I know… I know my son owes money.

579
00:40:57,232 --> 00:40:58,902
I swear, I'll pay it back.

580
00:40:58,985 --> 00:41:02,325
I will. I'll do whatever it takes.
I'll pay everything.

581
00:41:02,409 --> 00:41:04,830
Just please, please forgive me and my son.

582
00:41:04,914 --> 00:41:08,170
Come here. Help.
Get on your knees and beg. There. Go.

583
00:41:08,755 --> 00:41:11,302
I apologize for everything, forgive me.
Give me another chance.

584
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:12,846
- Yes.
- I'll get the money.

585
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:15,727
Players,
there seems to be a misunderstanding.

586
00:41:15,811 --> 00:41:17,773
I'll do anything. Let us live.

587
00:41:17,856 --> 00:41:20,821
Just hold on, you don't need
to kill us. You don't need to kill me.

588
00:41:20,904 --> 00:41:22,282
I'll work to pay everything back.

589
00:41:24,954 --> 00:41:28,002
We are not trying to hurt you
or collect your debts.

590
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:30,590
We are simply providing you
with an opportunity.

591
00:41:30,674 --> 00:41:32,427
Consent form clause three!

592
00:41:35,684 --> 00:41:38,063
"If the majority of players
agree to stop playing,

593
00:41:38,147 --> 00:41:39,733
the games will be terminated."

594
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,320
Isn't that correct?

595
00:41:42,739 --> 00:41:43,950
That is correct.

596
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:46,622
Then we'll do that.
We'll put it to a vote.

597
00:41:48,668 --> 00:41:50,004
If that's what you'd like.

598
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:55,557
During these games, we will always respect
your right to freedom of choice.

599
00:41:59,314 --> 00:42:00,734
But before we vote,

600
00:42:00,817 --> 00:42:04,282
we will reveal how much prize money
has accumulated after the first game.

601
00:42:46,951 --> 00:42:50,834
A total of 91 players
were eliminated during the first game.

602
00:42:50,917 --> 00:42:55,217
Therefore, 9.1 billion won
has accumulated so far.

603
00:42:55,301 --> 00:42:57,681
If you decide to stop playing
and quit the games now,

604
00:42:57,764 --> 00:43:02,899
the remaining 365 players will split
the 9.1 billion amongst themselves.

605
00:43:02,983 --> 00:43:05,196
Meaning, you each leave
with an equal share.

606
00:43:06,031 --> 00:43:07,909
Okay. How much per share?

607
00:43:07,993 --> 00:43:12,627
Each player would get 24,931,500 won.

608
00:43:12,711 --> 00:43:15,090
Are you serious?
Man, come on, we like almost died.

609
00:43:15,174 --> 00:43:16,593
24 million, that's all?

610
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:18,598
Are you fucking kidding me?

611
00:43:18,681 --> 00:43:21,186
- 20 mil?
- You're cheating us.

612
00:43:21,938 --> 00:43:23,608
What happened to 45 billion?

613
00:43:23,691 --> 00:43:25,820
As per the rules of the games,

614
00:43:25,904 --> 00:43:29,578
100 million won is added to the piggy bank
for each player eliminated.

615
00:43:30,288 --> 00:43:33,878
If you decide to play the next game,
and more players are eliminated,

616
00:43:33,962 --> 00:43:37,051
then the total prize money
will increase again accordingly.

617
00:43:37,135 --> 00:43:41,059
So, say we make it to the end of all this,
then how much do we get?

618
00:43:41,143 --> 00:43:42,896
As previously mentioned,

619
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:48,950
the total amount of prize money
for all 456 players is 45.6 billion won.

620
00:43:49,534 --> 00:43:53,041
That 45.6 billion
will be divided amongst the players

621
00:43:53,125 --> 00:43:56,340
who make it through all six games
without being eliminated.

622
00:43:56,423 --> 00:44:01,391
Okay. So that would mean that if you're
the only one at the end, you'd get it all?

623
00:44:02,519 --> 00:44:03,729
That is correct.

624
00:44:07,236 --> 00:44:09,491
So we'll still be able to call for a vote

625
00:44:09,574 --> 00:44:12,079
if we make it all the way through
the next game too?

626
00:44:12,163 --> 00:44:14,376
As outlined in the consent form,

627
00:44:14,459 --> 00:44:17,799
once each of the games has concluded,
you may call for a vote.

628
00:44:17,883 --> 00:44:19,260
If the majority agrees,

629
00:44:19,344 --> 00:44:21,849
you may take the accumulated prize money
and leave.

630
00:44:23,268 --> 00:44:27,235
Ensuring our players are participating
in the games of their own volition

631
00:44:27,318 --> 00:44:29,614
is always our highest priority.

632
00:44:33,288 --> 00:44:36,211
With that, the voting may now begin.

633
00:44:38,257 --> 00:44:41,638
If you wish to continue playing,
press the blue button with the "O."

634
00:44:42,223 --> 00:44:45,521
If you wish to stop playing,
press the red button with the "X."

635
00:44:48,778 --> 00:44:51,951
You will vote in order of player number,
from highest to lowest.

636
00:44:53,495 --> 00:44:55,625
Player 456.

637
00:45:12,492 --> 00:45:14,830
This is all useless.
There's no point.

638
00:45:15,957 --> 00:45:18,796
Just as you didn't get to choose
when you entered this world,

639
00:45:19,965 --> 00:45:22,386
you don't get to pick
when you're going to leave it.

640
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:25,601
The time and place
of each one of your deaths

641
00:45:25,685 --> 00:45:27,689
was decided
from the instant you were born.

642
00:45:27,772 --> 00:45:28,899
There's no changing it now.

643
00:45:31,363 --> 00:45:35,371
No matter how hard you try to fight it,
you'll never be able to escape your fate.

644
00:45:40,882 --> 00:45:43,637
Once you've voted,
attach the patch you're given

645
00:45:43,721 --> 00:45:45,265
to the right side of your chest,

646
00:45:45,349 --> 00:45:48,522
and stand in the area
marked with the corresponding symbol.

647
00:45:51,737 --> 00:45:53,407
Player 454.

648
00:46:06,808 --> 00:46:08,395
Player 453.

649
00:46:47,264 --> 00:46:48,475
Player 390.

650
00:46:53,986 --> 00:46:55,405
Player 388.

651
00:47:02,879 --> 00:47:04,256
Player 380.

652
00:47:07,137 --> 00:47:08,682
Player 333.

653
00:47:21,416 --> 00:47:23,253
Player 332.

654
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:35,611
Player 246.

655
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:44,003
Player 230.

656
00:47:53,271 --> 00:47:54,691
Hold on, everyone!

657
00:47:54,774 --> 00:47:56,235
Wait a minute!

658
00:47:57,446 --> 00:47:58,866
Don't do this to yourselves.

659
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:02,540
Just think for a second.
Can't you see what's going on?

660
00:48:02,623 --> 00:48:05,045
These aren't regular games we're playing.

661
00:48:05,128 --> 00:48:07,383
If we don't stop this,
they'll kill us all!

662
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,224
Just focus on getting out of this place.

663
00:48:11,307 --> 00:48:13,353
And to do that, we need to win the vote.

664
00:48:13,436 --> 00:48:15,440
We can stop this here and now.

665
00:48:15,524 --> 00:48:17,528
And who do you think you are?

666
00:48:17,611 --> 00:48:20,617
Why're you trying to egg people on?
What're you getting at?

667
00:48:20,701 --> 00:48:23,623
The game had just started, and you
scared us shouting about getting shot!

668
00:48:23,707 --> 00:48:24,959
He's right!

669
00:48:25,794 --> 00:48:28,550
You kept going on and on
about how we were all gonna die

670
00:48:28,633 --> 00:48:30,888
and I got so nervous
that I was almost killed out there!

671
00:48:30,971 --> 00:48:33,518
By the way, how did you know
they were gonna shoot at us?

672
00:48:33,602 --> 00:48:34,854
You work for these guys?

673
00:48:35,564 --> 00:48:37,818
You're a plant
put here to try and trick us.

674
00:48:37,902 --> 00:48:40,031
They hired you to come and confuse us all!

675
00:48:40,699 --> 00:48:42,327
Who is this man?

676
00:48:42,411 --> 00:48:45,125
You're the ones who put him in here
to manipulate us!

677
00:48:45,208 --> 00:48:47,296
Hey, old man, you better watch yourself.

678
00:48:47,838 --> 00:48:49,216
He's the reason you're not dead.

679
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:52,013
If he hadn't told us what to do,
then none of us would be alive.

680
00:48:52,097 --> 00:48:53,558
And you there!

681
00:48:53,642 --> 00:48:56,982
I saw how freaked out you were.
You were so scared your legs were shaking.

682
00:48:57,065 --> 00:48:59,320
You should be thanking him,
not calling him a fraud.

683
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:02,200
Hey, fucker, why do you care?
You also a plant?

684
00:49:02,284 --> 00:49:03,787
You kiss your mama with that mouth?

685
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:05,833
I kiss your mama. What you gonna do, huh?

686
00:49:05,916 --> 00:49:07,795
This is ridiculous.
You both need to stop this.

687
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:10,008
Please, that's enough. Everyone, everyone!

688
00:49:10,091 --> 00:49:13,723
Think about what we've been through today.
We can't let this go on.

689
00:49:13,807 --> 00:49:15,519
It's only thanks to this gentleman

690
00:49:15,602 --> 00:49:18,232
that any of us
are still breathing after all that.

691
00:49:18,316 --> 00:49:21,030
Listen, I know how much money means
to you all.

692
00:49:21,113 --> 00:49:23,368
Your lives are worth a whole lot more.

693
00:49:23,451 --> 00:49:25,413
Let's finish the vote and get out of here!

694
00:49:25,497 --> 00:49:28,127
- Let's get out of here!
- Let's all leave together!

695
00:49:28,211 --> 00:49:31,384
No! We're staying right here!
Bring it on!

696
00:49:35,893 --> 00:49:39,984
I've played these games before!

697
00:49:42,406 --> 00:49:44,744
I said I've played these games before.

698
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,795
I knew about the first game
because I'd already done it.

699
00:49:49,879 --> 00:49:51,841
'Cause I'd played the exact same one.

700
00:49:52,676 --> 00:49:55,473
I was here three years ago,
and I played them all.

701
00:49:56,684 --> 00:49:58,980
And every single person
who was there with me…

702
00:50:01,068 --> 00:50:02,696
They were all killed, every one!

703
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:04,450
- Died?
- What does he mean?

704
00:50:04,533 --> 00:50:07,205
- They all really died?
- This guy's full of shit.

705
00:50:07,289 --> 00:50:11,046
Wait a minute. If everyone
else died, then how did you survive?

706
00:50:12,257 --> 00:50:13,259
Unless…

707
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:16,348
You're saying you were the only winner?

708
00:50:19,814 --> 00:50:20,857
It's true.

709
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:25,867
I was the only one who made it.

710
00:50:30,376 --> 00:50:32,255
If you keep playing until the end,

711
00:50:33,424 --> 00:50:36,013
I guarantee every person in this room…

712
00:50:37,808 --> 00:50:40,062
will eventually end up like those players.

713
00:50:41,565 --> 00:50:42,693
We will all be killed.

714
00:50:46,158 --> 00:50:47,577
What a load of bullshit.

715
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:52,379
If you're the only one who made it,
you won 45.6 billion won.

716
00:50:53,297 --> 00:50:55,635
Why the hell would you come crawling back?

717
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,096
Yeah, he's gotta be lying!

718
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:58,975
- Bullshit!
- No way you won that money!

719
00:50:59,059 --> 00:51:01,731
- Crazy bastard!
- If you won already, so did I!

720
00:51:01,814 --> 00:51:04,862
If you really did win this thing before,
that's good for us.

721
00:51:06,114 --> 00:51:08,202
You can give us some tips on how to win.

722
00:51:09,872 --> 00:51:11,500
And get to the end like you did.

723
00:51:12,293 --> 00:51:13,588
That's right!

724
00:51:14,297 --> 00:51:15,466
He's won this.

725
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:18,264
There's nothing to worry about.
We all can win!

726
00:51:18,347 --> 00:51:20,769
Okay, come on! Let's make money!

727
00:51:20,852 --> 00:51:23,023
- Let's get it!
- Let's make money!

728
00:51:33,043 --> 00:51:36,258
I need you all to listen to me.
We have to leave this place.

729
00:51:36,341 --> 00:51:38,095
If we keep playing games,

730
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:40,016
then more and more people
are going to die.

731
00:51:41,477 --> 00:51:43,230
And the next one they kill could be you.

732
00:51:44,065 --> 00:51:47,030
We have to end this right now
so we can get out of here alive.

733
00:51:48,658 --> 00:51:49,660
Everyone--

734
00:51:51,497 --> 00:51:54,127
Starting now,
we will not permit any action

735
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:56,674
that interferes with the voting process.

736
00:51:59,429 --> 00:52:02,227
With that, we will now resume voting.

737
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:03,730
Player 228.

738
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:37,213
Player 100.

739
00:53:00,384 --> 00:53:01,804
Player 007.

740
00:53:11,866 --> 00:53:13,828
Yong-sik, don't you dare!

741
00:53:14,746 --> 00:53:16,542
Don't do anything stupid, okay?

742
00:53:24,057 --> 00:53:26,269
Yes, that's it.
That's it, I knew you would.

743
00:53:28,858 --> 00:53:30,277
Player 006.

744
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:55,411
Shit!

745
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:58,876
Player 004.

746
00:54:14,532 --> 00:54:16,829
- What're you thinking?
- Idiot!

747
00:54:20,628 --> 00:54:22,632
And finally, Player 001.

748
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,807
Now everybody say "O!"

749
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:30,564
- O!
- X!
