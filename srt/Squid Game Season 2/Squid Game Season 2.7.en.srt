What? Oh, this?

77
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,714
Well, I was looking for something
because I couldn't sleep,

78
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,549
and I just stumbled across it.

79
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,471
Did you do something?

80
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,183
No, I was just looking.

81
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:53,811

can fly in the sky.

Go get some sleep now, okay?

Choi, is that you?

95
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,690
It's me, Captain Park.

96
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,695
[Woo-seok] Captain,
I thought you were asleep.

97
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,948
What are you doing out here?
It's pouring down.

98
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,784
I couldn't sleep.
I was tossing and turning,

99
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,577
then I heard some noise.

100
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,162
I heard it too.

101
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,873
I think I heard someone scream
and some thuds after that.

102
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,417
That's why I came out to take a look.

103
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:04,215
I think it was the waves hitting the deck.
Look at the mess.

104
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,468
Oh, you're right.

105
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:12,765
It's dangerous out here in the rain.
Go back inside and get some sleep.

106
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,685
The boat's rocking so much.
I can't really sleep.

107
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:20,439
Still, you've got to wake up early.
Try to get some sleep.

108
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,484
Or you'll be exhausted tomorrow.

109
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:42,461
[Jeong-dae] 41, 42, 43, 44, 45,

110
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,547
46,

111
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,549
47.

112
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:51,888
Three dead.

113
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:53,764
Are you sure?

114
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,099
I counted three times.

115
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,350
[Player 203] What about them?

116
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:03,858
[Player 047] 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48.

117

Two people died on our side.

118
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:11,866
[woman] Two out of five.
That means they lost three people.

119
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:16,662
[Se-mi] Then we have a better shot
at winning the vote tomorrow.

120

[whispering] Hey, it's 48 against 47.

121
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,379
As long as we don't change our minds,
we'll win by one vote!

122

[players whispering] Yes!

123
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,217

- Listen. You cannot change your minds.

128
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:48,277
We have to win the second vote
and get out of here tomorrow. All right?

129
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,197
[man 3] Don't worry.
We're determined to get out.

130
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,325
[man 4] That's right.
We really have to get out now.

131
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,952
[man 5] Yes, let's do this.

132
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,622
[Jung-bae] All right.
Let's go to sleep now, shall we?

[Masked Officer] And Number 011?

140
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:43,708
That bitch is behaving.
Won't be a problem anymore.

141
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,377

Keep watching her carefully.

Those bastards are acting suspicious.

155

It looks like they're up to something.

156
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:58,657
[Jung-bae scoffs]

157
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,202
Whatever those idiots do,
once we win the vote tomorrow,

158
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,745
it'll all be over.

159
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,163
[Dae-ho] You think we'll be okay?

160
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:08,376
They say things were really crazy
in the bathroom earlier.

161
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,380
[Gi-hun] Once the lights go out,

162
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,050
people on the other side will attack us.

163
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,260
Really?

164
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:23,432
Because if they kill us, they'll be able
to win the vote and increase the prize.

165
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,185
So what do we do?

166
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,646
Let's attack them first.

167
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:36,779
They're probably thinking
we'll just wait for the second vote.

168
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:39,240
We can use it to our advantage.

169
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,159
We'll attack them first
once the lights go out.

170
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,162
That's right.
It'd be better to attack them first.

171
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,581
We have more women
and elderly on our side.

172
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,042
If we get attacked,
we'll be at a disadvantage.

173
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:54,422
Attacking them first
would give us a better chance of winning.

174
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,674
- I agree.
- [Gi-hun] We can't do that.

175
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,178
[In-ho] But we have to get out of here.

176
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,306
You said it yourself.

177
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,309
Staying calm won't get us anywhere now.

178
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,688
That doesn't mean
we should kill each other.

179
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,191
That's exactly what they want us to do.

180
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,485
"They"?

181
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,283
Those who created this game.

182
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,744
Those who watch us play.

183
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,541
If we're going to fight someone,
it should be them.

184
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,881
Where are they?

185
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,262
[Gi-hun] Up there.

186
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,347
[eerie music]

187
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:52,563
On the upper levels
are the rooms they control the games from.

188
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,941
The man in the black mask is their leader.

189
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:00,696
Once we capture him, we'll be able to win.

190
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,909
[Jung-bae sighs]

191
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,327
How are you going to fight them?

192
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,372
They have guns.

193
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:20,007
[woman on PA] <i>All armed soldiers,</i>
<i>please move to your designated locations.</i>

194
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:24,887
<i>The special game will begin momentarily.</i>

195
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,474
We'll fight them with guns too.

196
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,268
But we don't have any.

197
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,313
We'll take their guns.

198
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,529
From those masked men?

199
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,534
[In-ho] That's too dangerous.

200
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:51,163
Even if we manage to take a few guns,
we'll still be outnumbered.

201
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,623
[Gi-hun] What then?

202
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:57,962
Are you going to kill each other all night
and hope you survive?

203
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,675
Is that what you want, Young-il?

204
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,139
Do we…

205
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,725
stand a chance?

206
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,061
We do if we catch them off guard.

207
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,772
Out of everyone,

208
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:20,317
they're the ones
who would least expect us to attack first.

209
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,319
This is

210
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:28,617
our last chance
to end these games once and for all.

211
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,747
How are you going to take their guns?

212
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:40,963
Once the fight begins tonight,

213
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,967
we'll have our chance.

214
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,394
[woman on PA] <i>Lights out in five minutes.</i>

215
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:58,522
- [lullaby playing on speakers]
- [timer ticking]

216
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,907
[breath trembling]

217
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,828
[Nam-gyu] Thanos, that fucking asshole.

218
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:16,999
That son of a bitch
treated me like a fucking idiot.

219
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,012
[sniffles]

220
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,897
[foreboding music]

221
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,361
[snickering]

222
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,370
[Jun-hee] Myung-gi.

223
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,917
When the lights go out, hide.

224
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,380
No matter what happens, don't do anything.

225
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:08,509
Okay.

226
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,680
And wipe that blood off.

227
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,400
[woman on PA] <i>Lights out in ten seconds.</i>

228
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,235
<i>Ten,</i>

229
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,277
<i>nine,</i>

230
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,278
<i>eight,</i>

231
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,321
<i>seven,</i>

232
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,364

<i>two,</i>

237
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,285
<i>one.</i>

238
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,347
[dark music]

239
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,724
[Gi-hun] <i>Once the lights go out,</i>

240
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,853
<i>get under the bottom beds quietly.</i>

241
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:07,359
<i>You must not get caught</i>
<i>by those planning to attack us.</i>

242
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,625
[players roar]

243
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,210
- [woman 1 screams]
- [Nam-gyu] Shut up!

244
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,004
[woman 1 yelps]

245
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,005
Die!

246
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,134
- [glass smashing]
- [music intensifies]

247
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,473
[stabbing]

248
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,976
[players screaming]

249
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,396
[man 1 yelling]

250
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,523
- [stabbing]
- [man 1 screaming]

251
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,613
- [glass shattering]
- [players screaming]

252
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:54,448
[Min-su gasps]

253
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,247
- [glass smashing]
- [players screaming and shouting]

254
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,127
[man 2 yelps]

255
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,256
[man 3 screams]

256
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,384
[man 4 grunts]

257
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:18,889
[woman 2 groans]

258
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:24,228
[Gi-hun] We have to hide
until the fight ends.

259
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,731
Don't get caught up in the fight.

260
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:32,820
But that would put people on our side
at quite a disadvantage.

261
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:38,158
Without us in the fight,
they'll be outnumbered.

262
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,076
[Gi-hun] I know.

263
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,288
But if we fight with them

264
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:48,836
and some of us end up dead or injured,
it will ruin our entire plan.

265
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:54,341
We can't beat those bastards
with a lower headcount.

266
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,968
Are you suggesting that

267
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,805
we make a small sacrifice
for the greater good?

268
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,353
If we miss this opportunity,

269
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,940
the sacrifice will be even greater.

270
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,070
Even if it takes a sacrifice…

271
00:19:16,154 --> 00:19:19,283
we must put an end to this game now.

272
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:26,832
In that case,

273
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,210
I'm with you.

274
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,839
[eerie music]

275
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,724
[both grunting and groaning]

276
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,894
[Gi-hun] <i>The fight won't last long.</i>

277
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:50,647
<i>Because if all of us end up hurt or dead,</i>

278
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,734
<i>there can't be a next game,</i>
<i>and they wouldn't want that.</i>

Se-mi.

283
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,554
You fucking bitch.

[glass shatters]

285
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:26,975
Huh?

286
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,729
- [Se-mi] Fuck!
- [Nam-gyu groans]

287
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,274
You goddamn bastard!

288
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,820
- [Nam-gyu] You fucking bitch!
- [Se-mi screams]

289
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,617
[Nam-gyu] You think you're better than me?

290
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,868
[Se-mi screams]

291
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,746

[Gi-hun] <i>Once the lights come on,</i>

297
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:16,858
<i>the soldiers will come</i>
<i>to settle the situation.</i>

298
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,111
[masked soldier 1] Hands up. Get back.

299
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:21,113
<i>They'll try to break up the fight first.</i>

300
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,280
Drop your weapon. Hands up.

301
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,075
<i>They won't pay attention to the dead.</i>

302
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:30,789
<i>- They will scan our trackers…</i>
- Check the IDs of the dead.

303
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,833
<i>…to identify us.</i>

304
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,423
[scanner beeps]

[Masked Officer] Have everyone retreat
and close the gate.

- [Gi-hun] No!
- [dark music]

Move! Do you not see this?

322
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,126
They are not human.

323
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,795
They're like goddamn vermin
blinded by money!

[players exclaiming in fear]

325
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,884
This is not what we took these guns for.

326
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:52,556
If we do this, we'll be no different
from those masked men.

Don't be scared.

Gather round, please!

331
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,909
[Jung-bae] It's okay to come out.

332
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,328
We're not trying to hurt you!

333
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:19,666
[Hyun-ju] Get the guns and ammo
from the dead.

We will now

head up to the masked men's headquarters.

344
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,644
We'll capture the ones who captured us,

345
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,063
put an end to this game,

346
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,565
and make them pay.

00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:06,690
But this may be

353
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:11,069
our last chance
to make it out of this place alive.

354
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:13,947
Fight with us

355
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,574
so we can go home together.

356
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,077
All together.

357
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,375
I'll fight with you.

358
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,085
Come on.

359
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,005
[Player 072] I'll join you too.

360
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,006
[Gi-hun] Come join us.

361
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:09,210
Please check your guns and ammo.

362
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:12,213
Let's take one radio each.

363
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,214
[radio beeps]

364
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,425
We'll use channel 7, the lucky number.

365
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,391
Thank you for earlier.

366
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:30,899
You can buy me soju when we get out.

367
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:42,577
Attention.

368
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:46,748
This is the MP5, a submachine gun.

369
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:50,919
First, if you press this lever
in the middle and pull the magazine,

370
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,837
it comes off like this.

371
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:56,591
If the selector switch is down,
it's set to full auto mode.

372
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:58,259
Up is single-fire mode.

373
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:03,306
We don't have many magazines,
so set it to single-fire mode.

374
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,767
Lastly, insert the magazine,

375
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,436
pull the handle, and then release it.

376
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,439
That's how you load it. Are we clear?

377
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,941
[all] Yes.

378
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,655
How do you know so much about guns?

379
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:24,661
I was a sergeant first class
in the ROK Special Forces.

380
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,371
Ah.

381
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,166
[gun cocks]

382
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,209
Take it off.

383
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,514
Take that off too.

384
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,647
[Jung-bae] Good God.

385
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,359
Do your parents know
what you're doing here?

386
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,701
Take us to your captain.

387
00:29:05,743 --> 00:29:07,036
- [gunshot]
- [glass shatters]

388
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:09,998
[Gi-hun grunts]

389
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,906
[whimpers]

390
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:45,116
[breath trembling]

391
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,829
[lullaby playing on speakers]

392
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:55,710
[woman on PA] <i>All players,</i>
<i>it is bedtime now.</i>

393
00:29:55,793 --> 00:29:59,631
<i>Please return to your quarters</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

394
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:04,177
<i>Otherwise,</i>
<i>you will be eliminated from the game.</i>

395
00:30:04,802 --> 00:30:06,387
<i>Let me repeat.</i>

396
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,641
<i>All players, it is bedtime…</i>

397
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:13,144
I think I'll be hearing this voice
in my dreams. Don't you?

398
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:16,439
[woman on PA] <i>Please return</i>
<i>to your quarters immediately. Otherwise…</i>

399
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:19,984
[Gi-hun] Get down!

400
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,780
[rapid gunfire]

401
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,576
[gunfire continues]

402
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,455
[Gi-hun] One o'clock!

403
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,708
[Hyun-ju] Cover me!

404
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,168
[Jung-bae] Cover!

405
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,264
[masked soldier groans]

406
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,069
[groans]

407
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:09,993
[Gi-hun] Hold fire!

408
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:11,369
[Hyun-ju] Hold fire!

409
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:12,829
Hold fire!

410
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,708
[breath trembling]

411
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,753
Is everyone okay?

412
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,505
- [all] Yes.
- [Player 145] Yes, I'm okay!

413
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,841
All right, then. Let's go up!

414
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:35,059
[gunshot]

415
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,354
[gunshot]

416
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:43,943
[radio beeps]

417
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,863
[Masked Officer] Do not let them get close
to the management area.

418
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,159
[ominous music]

419
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,223
[Gi-hun grunts]

420
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,683
How much farther?

421
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:20,980
Is this the right way?

422
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:26,653
The entrance to the management area
is around that corner.

423
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,530
The control room is right above it.

424
00:32:30,948 --> 00:32:31,783
Move it, then.

425
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:32,992
Wait.

426
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:35,870
What are you doing?

427
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:37,830
I need my mask to pass security.

428
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,093
[eerie music]

429
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,053
[gunshot]

430
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,472
[rapid gunfire]

431
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:56,849
[Dae-ho gasps]

432
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:14,575
[masked soldier yelps]

433
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:19,747
[masked soldier groans]

434
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,421
I'll go look for the management area!

435
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,631
Will you be able to find it?
Should I come?

436
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:32,885
I'll go with Jung-bae.
I need you to buy us some time!

437
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,722
Jung-bae, let's go.

438
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,185
[Jung-bae] Wait up!

439
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,271
[intense music]

440
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:53,865
[Dae-ho groaning]

[gun clicking]

[Dae-ho whimpering]

443
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,001
[Player 047] Here!

444
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,631
Don't waste your ammo like that!
You'll run out soon!

445
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,157
[scanner trilling]

446
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,742
[automated voice] <i>Identity confirmed.</i>

[dark music]

448
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,971
[Jung-bae] Why did you have to bring me
instead of Young-il?

449
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,766
Because you're my friend.

450
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:05,019
You only say that when you're in a jam.

451
00:35:05,102 --> 00:35:05,937
[radio beeps]

452
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,231
We're in the management area.

453
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,566
<i>We'll make our way up.</i>

454
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,521
[Gi-hun] They have magazines
in their pockets.

455
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,787
Which way should we go?

456
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,667
The way they came.

457
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:22,179
[Masked Officer]
Guard the stairs to the control room!

458
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:23,514

[ominous music]

462
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:18,694
This isn't getting us anywhere!
Let's follow them to the upper level!

463
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,950
We might get surrounded
if we move together without a plan!

464
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:28,829
Let's wait until
they find the control room!

465
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:35,962
[groans]

466
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,829
Everyone! Check your magazines!

467
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,707
I'm down to half.

468
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:14,834
I've got less than half.

469
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,377
Same!

470
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,004
[Player 015] I've got two-thirds left.

471
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,213
I'm almost out!

472
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:21,424

- [radio beeps]
- Go ahead!

477
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,895
I think we're right below
the control room!

478
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:38,024
But we need backup and more ammo.

479
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,443
We're running out of ammo too!

480
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:44,071
[Gi-hun] There should be spare magazines
in the soldiers' pockets in our quarters.

481
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,614
Go get them!

482
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:46,699
- Got it!
- [radio beeps]

483
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:50,536
Did you hear that? They need backup!

484
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:54,540
Three of us will go,
and the rest will stay!

485
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:57,168
Join us once you get the magazines!

486
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,377
Who wants to go with me?

487
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:59,462
I'll go!

488
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:00,379
Me too!

489
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:01,380
Let's go!

490
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:08,304
I'll go get the magazines!

491
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:11,682
I'll come back as soon as I can,
so just hold on until then!

492
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:12,975
[Dae-ho] Hyun-ju!

493
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,019
I'll go!

494
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:20,858
[Dae-ho whimpering]

495
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:24,361
I… I'm out of ammo.

496
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:25,905
Do you know the way?

497
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,281
[shakily] Yes.

498
00:39:27,364 --> 00:39:30,743
We destroyed the cameras on the way.
Follow them.

499
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:31,660
Okay.

500
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:36,248
Take this. You might run into
the masked men on the way.

501
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:37,792
Thank you.

502
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,752
I'll cover you. Go!

503
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,462

<i>Where are those magazines?</i>

509
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,546
Yes, brother. I'm on my way to get them.

510
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,548
All right, Dae-ho! We're counting on you!

511
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:29,802
Yes, you can count on me, brother!
I'll be there soon!

514
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:38,394
Jung-bae, cover me.

515
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:39,645
What are you going to do?

516
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:40,688
Get their magazines.

517
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,314
No, that's too dangerous.

518
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:46,277
I'm almost out of ammo.
If they notice, they'll close in on us.

519
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,738
We need more magazines
to hold out until Dae-ho gets here.

520
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,216
[Jung-bae] Gi-hun, hurry up!

521
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,141
[Jung-bae] Hurry up and get back here!

522
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:12,238
[mumbling] Magazines…

523
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,531
Magazines…

524
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:18,244
Magazines in pockets.

526
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,171
I'm not sure.

00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,638
[Yong-sik] Dae-ho, what happened?

529
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:40,266
