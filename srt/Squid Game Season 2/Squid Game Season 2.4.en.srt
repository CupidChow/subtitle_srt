SQUID GAME 2

00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:07,150
EPISODE 4
SIX LEGS

5
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:27,629
[Jung-bae] Oh!

6
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,882
Just like my mom used to make.

7
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,885
What's in yours?

8
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:37,972
Aren't you going to eat?

9
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,768
Look, you've got to eat.

10
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,896
You know what they say.
"Eat up, even on your deathbed."

11
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:48,358
Just do your thinking while you eat,
or afterwards. Here.

12
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,152
Come on.

13
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,404
Forget it then.

14
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,408
This might be for the best.

15
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:01,579
I don't know about you,

16
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:04,332
but that 20 million
wouldn't even cover my interest.

17
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,793
If we play just one more game--

18
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:07,794
Jung-bae.

19
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:14,342
Last time I was here,
someone said the exact same thing.

20
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:17,762
And in the end,

21
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,765
that person died here.

22
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,019
[In-ho] Help us then, sir.

23
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,857
You said you've played these games.

24
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,153
I pressed the O button because of you.

25
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,826
Honestly, I was scared.
I wanted to quit and leave.

26
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:45,248
But you made me think
maybe I could play just one more game.

27
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,875
- [man 1] Me too.
- [man 2] Same here.

28
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,501
- [man 3] Yes.
- [man 4] Me too.

29
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,546
[sighs softly]

30
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:53,840
[In-ho] Sir.

31
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:56,885
You know which game's next, don't you?

32
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,432
That's right.

33
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,102
You're a previous winner,
so you should know.

34
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,271
What are we playing next?

35
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,442
The second game

36
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,445
was <i>Dalgona.</i>

37
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:21,534
<i>Dalgona?</i> The sugar candy
with a shape you can carve out?

38
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,077
That's right.

39
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,623
We had to choose one of four shapes
and carve it out.

40
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:30,793
Four shapes? Which was the easiest one?

41
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:31,961
Triangle.

42
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,714
Which was the hardest one?

43
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:36,716
Umbrella.

44
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:37,634
Umbrella?

45
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:39,385
[scoffs]

46
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,763
Some people chose umbrella?

47
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,139
[intriguing music]

48
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:49,062
Those unlucky bastards
must have bitten the dust.

49
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,988
So that means
we should all just pick triangle.

50
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,532
Everyone could probably pass the round.

51
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,159
[Jeong-dae] Hush now!

52
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:08,539
If all 365 of us survive,
the prize money won't go up at all.

53
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:11,250
Then we'll have risked
our lives again for nothing.

54
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,294
- [man 5] That's true.
- [woman 1] He's right.

55
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:18,174
[whispering] Listen. We should probably
keep this information to ourselves.

56
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:20,301
- What do you say?
- [woman 2] Let's do that.

57
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,970
[Gi-hun] We can't do that.

58
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,847
I'm telling you this
to save everyone's lives.

59
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,267
If it's confirmed
that the next game is <i>Dalgona,</i>

60
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,728
I'm going to tell everyone what I know.

61
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:34,899
[Jeong-dae scoffs]

62
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,111
[Yeong-sam] <i>Dalgona,</i> triangle.

63
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,989
[players grumbling]

64
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,995
So which shape did you pick?

65
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,163
[intriguing music]

66
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,211
[Yong-sik] Mom, I just found out
something important.

67
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,552
Shit. Mom!

68
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,101
[Player 149] You can have it.

69
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,647
[whispering] You should eat it
for your baby.

70
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,483
Eggs are good for pregnant women.

71
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:28,286
I've helped more than a dozen women
in my neighborhood deliver their babies.

72
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:34,042
I can tell just by looking
at your body shape and the way you walk.

73
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,795
It looks like
your due date is getting closer.

74
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,132
If you compress your belly to hide it,

75
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:44,385
it'll be bad for both you and your baby.
It could be dangerous.

76
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,721
That's why you were in pain earlier.

77
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,347
It's not what you think.

78
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,099
[sighs]

79
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:54,187
How did you end up in a place like this
in your condition?

80
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,104
[footsteps approach]

81
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,148
- [Yong-sik] What are you doing?
- You startled me!

82
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:59,025
- Come. No time for socializing.
- What…

83
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,277
All right, just wait.

84
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,237
You should finish your food,

85
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,656
and if something feels off,
come find me right away.

86
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,785
- [Yong-sik] Come on!
- I'll be over there, okay?

87
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,953
[Player 149] Why? What is it?

88
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:15,249
[sighs]

89
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,966
[In-ho] May I ask you something?

90
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,643
Why did you come back to this place?

91
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,396
You said you won and made it out.

92
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,149
Then you must have received 45.6 billion.

93
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,693
Did you spend it all?

94
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,404
Did you bet on horses again?

95
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,406
That money doesn't belong to me.

96
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:53,121
It's blood money
for the people who died here.

97
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,208
The same goes for the money up there.

98
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,754
You don't have to think of it that way.

99
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:05,007
It's not like you killed those people,

100
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,927
and saving that money
won't bring them back to life.

101
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:13,599
If you had pressed the X,
everyone here would've made it out alive.

102
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,521
That's right.
I was the last to press the O button.

103
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:24,861
But there were 182 more people
who wanted to stay.

104
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:28,823
And there were also 182 people
who wanted to leave.

105
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,950
Let's say

106
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:37,206
I pressed X and we all left.
Would everyone have been happy?

107
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,042
Do you think if they ran into me later,

108
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:45,423
they'd thank me for saving their lives
and tell me they're happy now?

109
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:53,639
[Jung-bae] All right.
There's no point in placing blame now.

110
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,684
You know the saying,
a widow understands a widower best.

111
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,478
Let's just focus on tomorrow's game, okay?

112
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,564
He has won all these games before.

113
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,901
If we stick together,
we'll have nothing to worry about.

114
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,152
[man] He's right, sirs.

115
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,698
[exhales]

116
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,074
We have to stick together.

117
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,702
I'll be with you all the way.

118
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:15,828
Who are you?

119
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,330
My good sir.

120
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,125
I'm Dae-ho. Kang Dae-ho.

121
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,128
- Oh, Mr. Dae-ho.
- Yes.

122
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,046
Have we met?

123
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,298
[chuckles awkwardly]

124
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,843
Earlier during the game,
Mr. 456 here was like,

125
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:34,847
"Freeze!" And I became his fan.

126
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,808
I'd like to get to know you, sirs.
Please give me the chance!

127
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,020
"Freeze!" That was so cool.

128
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,355
[Jung-bae] Hang on.

129
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:43,564
[Dae-ho] Yes, sir?

130
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,815
You were in the Marines?

131
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,108
- Yes, why?
- [march music]

132
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,193
Class number?

133
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:49,779
[chuckles]

134
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:51,447
[Jung-bae snorts]

135
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,074
You're laughing?

136
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,163
[Dae-ho] Victory at all costs!

137
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,998
I was in Class 1140, sir!

138
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:02,416
At ease!

139
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:03,960
"Dae-ho."

140
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,963
I knew there was something about you.

141
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,674
- Sir!
- Class 746 here. Let's make a good team.

142
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:10,716
I won't let you down!

143
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,676
[laughs heartily]

144
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,469
Sir!

145
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:16,055
[Jung-bae] You're full of spirit.
[chuckles]

146
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,014
[Dae-ho] Yes, sir!

147
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,225
Yes!

148
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,854
[Nam-gyu] Enjoying your food?

149
00:09:24,563 --> 00:09:26,274
I couldn't eat.

150
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:30,027
After seeing everyone get shot dead,
you still have a damn appetite?

151
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:33,322
That crypto ruined my life too.

152
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,826
- That's why I'm here, to make money.
- [footsteps approaching]

153
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:40,288
That's right.
You'd better make a lot of money.

154
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,498
Because of that damn coin,

155
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:47,837
I lost over 500 million won, the money
I earned from busting my ass rapping.

156
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,171
[Nam-gyu] I lost 300 million.

157
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:53,801
You'd better win the games
and make a load of money to pay us back.

158
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,846
I get it. Can you go away now?
I'm trying to eat--

159
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,725
You little shit,
eating like a fucking pig.

160
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:02,310
Give it back.

161
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,227
No.

162
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,689
[Thanos] You want to eat this so badly?

163
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,483
Then Thanos will feed you.

164
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,527
[Myung-gi yelps]

165
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,239
- Good, isn't it?
- [tense music]

166
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,408
[Thanos and Nam-gyu laugh]

167
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,577
- [Myung-gi] Motherfucker.
- [Nam-gyu] Son of a bitch.

168
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,746
- [Myung-gi] You asshole.
- [Thanos] Knock it off.

169
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:22,872
[Nam-gyu] Fucking asshole.

170
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,291
[players murmur, exclaim]

171
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,084
[Thanos] Son of a bitch.

172
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,920
I lost all that money
because of you, fucker.

173
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:33,215
- [Thanos] You piece of shit.
- [Nam-gyu] Let me get in there.

174
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,092
- You son of a bitch.
- [Thanos] Hey.

175
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,260
Step aside.

176
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:40,514
Be grateful and fucking eat
what you're given!

177
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:44,018
It's good to be young.
They still have the energy to do that.

178
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:47,563
He might get really hurt.
Someone should stop them.

179
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:48,647
I know.

180
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,441
[players exclaim]

181
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,193
- Me?
- [Thanos grunts]

182
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,030
[players gasp]

183
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,699
Boys, what are you doing
in the middle of mealtime?

184
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,035
No fights during mealtime.

185
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,579
There are elders present.
Mind your manners.

186
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:05,456
And two against one?

187
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,376
Aren't you embarrassed?

188
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,796
You're lecturing me
when you ended up in this shithole too?

189
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,925
Dude, stop running your mouth

190
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,427
and take care of your own damn kids.

191
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,889
What did you just say?

192
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,726
I said save the lecture
for your own damn kids.

193
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:27,728
[Nam-gyu] Son of a bitch.

194
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,730
- [ominous music]
- [Nam-gyu groans]

195
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,232
[Thanos grunts]

196
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,527
[Thanos groans]

197
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,196
[Thanos gasping] Wait.

198
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,657
- [bones cracking]
- [Thanos groans]

199
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,288
I'm sorry.

200
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,750
Please…

201
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:54,922
Let me go.

202
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,343
[Thanos coughs]

203
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:05,558
- [woman 1] Great! You're the man!
- [man] Nice!

204
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,603
[woman 2] That was cool!

205
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:17,820
What is he?

206
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,239
Is he an ex-Marine too?

207
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,080
[mysterious music]

208
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:32,042
[woman on PA]
<i>The day's work has been completed.</i>

209
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:36,130
<i>All soldiers,</i>
<i>please return to your quarters.</i>

210
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,605
[chilling music]

211
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:54,648
Na-yeon!

212
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,650
[siren wailing]

213
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:58,819
[paramedic] Are you with her?

214
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,279
<i>Yes, I'm her father.</i>

215
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,490
<i>Please take her</i>
<i>to Seohyeon University Hospital.</i>

216
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:23,928
Dissolve my karmic ties and grievances…

217
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,204
[Yong-sik whispering] Mom, are you asleep?

218
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,002
[Yong-sik sighs]

219
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,594
Honey, I'm sorry.

220
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:11,392
I'm sorry.

221
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:15,771
[In-ho] Excuse me.

222
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,234
If you're still up,
can we have a little talk?

223
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,112
Sure.

224
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:34,415
I think I was out of line before.
I'd like to apologize. I'm sorry.

225
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,834
No, that's okay.

226
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,547
I laid all the blame on you.

227
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,092
I was out of line.

228
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,436
My wife is very sick.

229
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,442
She has acute cirrhosis.
She needs a liver transplant.

230
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,613
But when she was going through the tests,

231
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,699
we found out she was pregnant.

232
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,076
[somber music]

233
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,203
The doctor suggested a termination,

234
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,956
but she won't listen.

235
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,043
Says she'll give birth
even if it kills her.

236
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:23,172
You see, my wife is stubborn.

237
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,759
I've never been able
to change her mind about anything.

238
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:33,974
We were struggling to find a donor,
and her condition was getting worse.

239
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,728
I borrowed as much money as I could,

240
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,397
but it still wasn't enough.

241
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:46,278
I was desperate.
Then one of my oldest vendors

242
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,865
heard about my situation
and offered to help.

243
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,368
So I borrowed money from them.

244
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,665
But people saw it as a bribe,

245
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,168
and I got fired from my job.

246
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:06,131
I had devoted my entire youth to it.

247
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:13,138
These games were my last hope.

248
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:18,727
I get it.

249
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:23,399
I know what
you were trying to say, Mr. 456.

250
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,528
What that money represents.

251
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,491
But I…

252
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,914
I really need that money,

253
00:16:38,997 --> 00:16:40,958
even if it's blood money.

254
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,127
I need that money…

255
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:59,852
to save my wife and our child.

256
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,240
[eerie music]

257
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:21,874
Close up.

258
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,626
Why? Nothing usable?

259
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,263
[masked soldier] What the hell?

260
00:17:38,056 --> 00:17:39,933
This is it? Where's the rest?

261
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,019
The organs were not viable.

262
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,354
Dead too long.
Only the eyes were salvageable.

263
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,858
I told you to bring live ones.

264
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:50,694
[masked soldier] What are you
talking about? I missed on purpose.

265
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,281
[doctor] Someone shot them again
to make sure they died.

266
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,703
That guy too.

267
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,500
He was shot in the leg,
but someone shot him again in the head.

268
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:06,752
[masked soldier sighs]

269
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:10,088
Who's doing this?

270
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,481
[scanner trilling]

271
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,566

00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,615
[Masked Officer] How did it go?

275
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:42,704
[man on radio] <i>Most players were shot</i>
<i>in the head or chest and died on the spot.</i>

276
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,749
<i>Someone shot those who were still alive</i>
<i>a second time to confirm the kill.</i>

277
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,751
<i>We only got a few usable products.</i>

278
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,589
Who did that?

279
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,426
Number 011, I think.

280
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,555
[radio beeps]

281
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:06,270
- [lid pops]
- [liquid pouring]

00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,949
[door opens]

283
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:26,290
[masked manager] Number 011.

284
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,878
Officer wants to see you.

285
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,801

00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,584
[No-eul] You wanted to see me, sir?

291
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,212
Mask off.

292
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:06,640
I told you not to interfere
if you're not going to help.

293
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:15,732
I hear you shot them a second time
to make sure they died.

294
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,944
I was just doing my job.

295
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,991
How long…

296
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,369
have we known each other?

297
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,705
I don't quite remember.

298
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,456
[Masked Officer] If I remember correctly…

299
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,756
it's been about seven years.

300
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,466
[puffs]

301
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,721
When I first went to see you,

302
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:51,435
you were staring at the ceiling
like a corpse in that cheap hospital room.

303
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:55,522
I couldn't believe you had taken out
the entire pursuit unit

304
00:21:56,356 --> 00:22:00,235
and made your way
to the demarcation line by yourself.

305
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:08,660
I felt bad for you.

306
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,417
I wanted to give you a second chance.

307
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,295
I've always been grateful to you.

308
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,672
Then do what I tell you.

309
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,549
I do not wish to.

310
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:27,304
Are you afraid the captain might find out?

311
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,475
You don't have to worry about that.

312
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:35,103
We made a mistake last time
and had a player do the operations

313
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,605
in exchange for game info.

314
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,733
This time, we hired a doctor from outside.

315
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:42,360
So he will never find out,
and even if he does--

316
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,361
It's not about that.

317
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,946
[yelling] Then what is it about?

318
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:47,699
[Masked Officer sighs]

[exhales]

320
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:09,471
When we first met, you said you wanted
to find the child you left behind.

321
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:10,806
[chilling music]

322
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,308
You said you'd do anything.

323
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,147
Did you have a change of heart?

324
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,112
When you first came to me,

325
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,531
you said my job here would be

326
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:33,495
helping those who feel hopeless
by putting them out of their misery.

327
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:39,459
I trusted you.
That's what I came here to do.

328
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,672
You're the one who has changed.

329
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,218
Those people are going to die anyway.

330
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,472
We're just using their organs
to save others.

331
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,808
What's wrong with that?

332
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:59,354
If there are no further orders,
I'd like to be excused.

You handed in your resignation
without a word to me?

338
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,856
Then you went MIA.
Where the hell have you been?

339
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:46,443
Do you know how much I had to beg
to change it to a leave of absence?

340
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,945
Chief, are you finished?

341
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:49,946
What?

342
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,156
Please help me.

344
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:55,368
Look, what else
could I possibly do for you?

345
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,454
You want me to look
for that island with you?

346
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:58,872
Yes.

347
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,082
[sighs] For God's sake.

348
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,335
We must start the search immediately.

349
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:06,922
Otherwise, Mr. Seong Gi-hun
and everyone else there will be in danger.

350
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,759
Haven't we already
finished discussing this?

351
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,720
Sir, things have changed since then.

352
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:17,766
If we don't stop them now,
we may not get another chance.

353
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,643
- [chief of police] Chief Kim.
- Yes, sir.

354
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:22,896
What's gotten into him this time?
You said he was doing better.

355
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:27,359
Jun-ho, go back to therapy.
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

356
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,485
[yelling] Sir!

357
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,279
Are you really going to let
those people die?

358
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,574
[yelling] You've been talking
about this shit for years now!

359
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,826
If it's true, bring me evidence!

360
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:40,622
The police work with evidence!

361
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:47,963
Process his resignation.

362
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,589
He's beyond help now.

363
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,132
But, sir…

364
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,220
Damn it. Hey!

365
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:59,391
I told you this was a bad idea.
You'll never be able to come back now.

366
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:04,145
Sir! I'll make sure
he goes back to therapy! Please wait!

367
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:07,565
[Woo-seok] See? What did I tell you?
Police are never helpful.

368
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:12,112
We'll do it ourselves. If we split into
two teams, we might have a chance.

369
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:16,324
Yeah. Captain Park
got another boat for us,

370
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,995
and we also got more men.
We divided them into two search teams.

371
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,162
Okay, good.

372
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:24,582
If the games have begun,
we only have five days at most.

373
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:25,834
We've got to move fast.

374
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,085
Got it.

375
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:30,046
We're all set to go
once the weather clears up.

376
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,506
I'll see you soon.

377
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,769
Have a drink and relax.
We can't set sail today anyway.

378
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:46,688
[sighs]

379
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,653
[Woo-seok] Captain, are you sure
we can go tomorrow?

380
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:56,573
Tomorrow's weather forecast
isn't looking good either.

381
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,116
Look.

382
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:00,827
I've been sailing for 30 years.

383
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:05,498
You think those guys who sit
in front of their computers all day

384
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,083
know the seas better than me?

385
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,795
I'll blame you
if we can't set sail tomorrow, then.

386
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,840
What's the rush?

387
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:16,217
We've been trying to find that island
for two years.

388
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,552
How will you find it now?

389
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:22,724
Well, this is a secret,
so I can't really tell you in detail.

390
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:27,437
But one of our friends
has been taken to that island.

391
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:31,483
The one who was there before?

392
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:32,942
What?

393
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:38,156
Wait, you know about Mr. Seong?

394
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,368
Hwang gave me a rough idea.

395
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:45,330
All right, then. I can just tell you.

396
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:51,044
His name is Seong Gi-hun.
He's a previous winner of the game.

397
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:53,338
He wanted to get back at those bastards,

398
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:57,050
so he put a GPS tracker in here
and let them take him to the island.

399
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:59,886
But I don't know how the intel leaked.

400
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:03,431
So everything Hwang told me was true?

401
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,724
Yeah!

402
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:08,436
I just helped him look for the island

403
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,605
because I rescued the guy from the water.

404
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,901
But, come on,
I couldn't believe what he was saying.

405
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,486
About the games, the money, and--

406
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:20,323
Captain, I didn't believe it
at first either.

407
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:26,538
But they really do exist.
Those masked men. I saw them.

408
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:29,499
They zapped me with a stun gun at a club.

409
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,252
Masked men with stun guns?

410
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:33,169
Yeah!

411
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:37,674
So that's why you brought all those men.

412
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,593
[Captain] Damn.

413
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:45,306
They look so intimidating.
Like a bunch of sharks.

414
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,852
[Woo-seok] We're dealing
with some brutal bastards here.

415
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:51,146
My boss was looking for them, and…

416
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,398
[sighs]

417
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:58,403
Anyway, you're now
in the same boat as us, okay?

418
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:00,613
We live or die together.

419
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:06,035
Nobody is going to die.
I've been sailing that boat for ten years.

420
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,955
Never seen any trouble.

421
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:10,999
No one's even tripped once.

422
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:12,542
[chuckles]

423
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,670

Yes.

This is supposed to be the easiest one?

What the heck is that?
This guy is going to get us all killed!

434

- Hey!
- I…

435
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:11,142
What are you going to do,
take responsibility for this?

436
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:14,270
You said you won! You said you've done it!

437
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,855
- No, I…
- What are you going to do?

438
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,357
How will you take responsibility?

Jun-hee.

445
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,355
So you really had no clue?

446
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,567
I thought you were just ignoring me.

447
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:05,154
Well, you've always been self-absorbed.

448
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:06,990
Why are you here?

449
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,199
Have you forgotten?

450
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,912
You told me to buy that coin too.

Oh, you haven't forgotten about this.

[Jun-hee] I'm going to make money.

458
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:40,023
I'm going to make money,
pay off my debt, and get a place for us.

459
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:45,403
This baby has no father,
so its mom needs to make money.

460
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,322
That's why you're here? To make money?

461
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,950
How the hell will you survive here
in your condition?

462
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,620
I'm not going to ask for your help,
so drop the act.

It'd be embarrassing for brave Marines

it should be worth risking our lives for.
