You are under arrest

Are… Are you Mr. Seong Gi-hun?

00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:59,470
I've been helping Mr. Kim
look for the man with the <i>ddakji</i>.

28
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,180
My name is Choi Woo-seok.

29
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:05,351
We've been sending you pictures
from the subway stations every day!

30

Don't you remember?

31
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:13,026
We've never met in person,

32
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,737
but I've heard a lot about you
from my boss.

33
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:20,325
He said you were a great man
who came to settle your debt voluntarily.

34
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,493
He said he'd never seen anyone like you…

35
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,413
That bastard.

36
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,042
Did you kill him, Mr. Seong?

37
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,839
You goddamn son of a bitch!

38
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,218
[sobbing] That bastard…

39
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:44,265
That bastard killed the boss.

40
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:51,773
I played two rocks by mistake.

41
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:57,570
He had paper and scissors.
All he had to do was pick paper.

42

- But he didn't.

Hey!

51
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:52,959
Wake up!

52
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,673
Open the window.

53
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,309
What are you doing here?

54
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,312
I work here.

55
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,523
I have to be here early tomorrow.

56
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:18,526
Doesn't mean you can sleep out here
in your car.

57
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,862
I'll get in trouble
if my superiors find out.

58
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,906
I think I've seen you here before.

59
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,701
I'm sorry. I'll move my car tomorrow.

60
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:28,911
There won't be a next time.

61
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,998
Otherwise, I'll have to report you.

62
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:33,750
[woman] Okay.

63
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,211
[security guard sighs]

64
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,729
[Gi-hun] Detective Hwang Jun-ho.

65
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,609
Now I remember.

66
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,112
You came to see me
at my house once before.

67
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,656
We've met twice.

68
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,868
Once in front of your house, and again…

69
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,579
on that island.

70
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:15,374
Do you remember?
The night of the ruckus in the dorm.

71
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,294
The masked men went in to stop it.

72
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,590
Were you one of them?

73
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:25,134
I snuck in there in disguise
to find my brother.

74
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,220
How can I believe you?

75
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:31,140
One of the masked men asked you
about someone named Hwang In-ho.

76
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,060
[masked man] <i>Player 456.</i>

77
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,687
Is there a man named Hwang In-ho here?

78
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,526
We do not know each other's names.

79
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:43,653
[Jun-ho] <i>That was me.</i>

80
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,947
Hwang In-ho is my brother.

81
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,953
Who's the man you killed?

82
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:56,207
He's a recruiter
who finds players for the game.

83
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,710
But I didn't kill him.

84
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:05,550
He simply lost the game.

85
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:10,221
Are you still a part of that game?

86
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,474
I'm trying to put an end to it.

87
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,559
How?

88
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,310
I'm going to find that guy first.

89
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,273
The overseer of the game,
the one who worked for Oh Il-nam.

90
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,651
Do you know who he is?

91
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:25,611
[dark music]

92
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,697
The masked men call him Captain.

93
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,948
Did you see his face?

94
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:35,830
No, I didn't see his face.
He was wearing a black mask.

95
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,665
[exhales]

96
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,002
How do you plan on finding him?

97
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,881
[Gi-hun] This is the invitation he sent.

98
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:52,263
If you find him, what next?

99
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:54,807
Kill him?

100
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,477
Killing him
will not put an end to the game.

101
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,190
Before Oh Il-nam died, he said

102
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,818
he created the game for his clients.

103
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,403
[Jun-ho] That's right.

104
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,364
There are people they call the VIPs.

105
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,241
I saw one of them.

106
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,119
Let me go.

107
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,705
I'll help you find them.

108
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,375
Mr. Seong. You can't trust cops.

109
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:25,671
I've never seen cops
helping people like us.

110
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:33,888
I'm sorry about your brother.
But you should forget about it.

111
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,556
Can you forget?

112
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:39,727
- The people who died on that island?
- [sinister music]

113
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,731
I saw things that you didn't.

114
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,150
I can help you…

115
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,987
with what you're trying to do.

116
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,831
[Woo-seok] Please reconsider, Mr. Seong.

117
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,876
I once got scammed and lost all my money.

118
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,379
I was furious,
so I roughed him up a little.

119
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,172
It wasn't even that bad,

120
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:11,717
but the cops only arrested me
and told me to settle with him.

121
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,219
But with what money?

122
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,680
- That asshole took everything.
- [door unlocking]

123
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:19,684
You know what's crazy?
I went to prison, and he got away with it.

124
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,811
Since then, I've never trusted cops…

125
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,400
[Woo-seok] The money…

126
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:28,526
Mr. Seong.

127
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:31,821
- So it's true that you won the game?
- [sinister music]

128
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,249
[Gi-hun] It's blood money
for all those people who died there.

129
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,130
I'm going to use it
to fight those bastards.

130
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:55,094
If you help me,
I'll give you as much as you want.

131
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,805
I'm not doing this for money.

132
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,391
Me neither.

133
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:04,061
That bastard killed my boss
right in front of me.

134
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:07,481
He was like a brother to me.
He even officiated my wedding.

135
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,319
I'm going to find the fat cats,
tie them up,

136
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,779
make them play Rock, Paper, Scissors
and shoot them dead.

137
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,866
They have armed forces on that island.

138
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:20,077
We can't fight them with a few pistols.

139
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:24,290
[tense music]

140
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,542
These are what I've collected so far.

141

[gasps]

142
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,715
[Woo-seok] Are they real?
Where did you get all these?

143
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:38,220
Man, Mr. Seong. So you've got a plan!

144
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,973
I want you to gather people
we can join forces with.

145
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,892
Sure, don't worry.

146
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,644
I know some men
who are good at that stuff.

147
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,564
These are K2s, aren't they?

148
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:51,400
I haven't seen one
since I was in the military.

149
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,029
[Jun-ho] I'm guessing
they're black market.

150
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,531
Do they even work?

151
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,038
[tense music intensifies]

[light switch clicks]

153
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,172
[Woo-seok] Huh?

154
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:15,049
[Woo-seok screams]

155
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:24,600
[Woo-seok] Huh?

156
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,354
Come and practice whenever you can.

157
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:30,564
Also,

158
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,860
I suggest that you quit your current job.

[woman 1] God, it's hot. Turn up the AC!

161
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,007
[man 1] Man, why is the AC here so weak?
Damn it.

162

[man 2 sighs]

163
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,887
- [man 1] Can somebody ask to get it fixed?
- [man 2] The weather is insane.

164
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,474
- I want to go home.
- [man 1] What are you doing after work?

165
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,392
- Want to grab a beer?
- [woman 2] Sounds good.

166
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:51,729
- [man 2] I'm in.
- [man 1] A new place opened nearby.

167
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,815
- [woman 3] I'm exhausted.
- [man 3] That was rough.

Bunny, does it hurt here?

172
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,445
[man 4] It's too hot for this, man.

173
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:46,825
I can't breathe in this fucking pig head.
Is it just me?

00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,337
[man 5] Na-yeon!

177
00:13:58,837 --> 00:13:59,922
[man 4 making silly sounds]

178
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:00,965
[man 5] Na-yeon.

179
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,175
- Na-yeon.
- [Na-yeon continues crying]

180
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:07,179
Na-yeon.
I told you not to go into random places.

181
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,224
[bawling] Daddy!

182
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:14,645
Don't cry. I'm sorry, guys.

183
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,648
You're okay. Daddy is here.

184
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,069
[man 4 sighs]

185
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,323
When did she get out of the hospital?

186
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,576
Who is she?

187
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,497
You know the artists
who draw people's portraits in the park?

188
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,042
That guy is one of them,
and she's his daughter.

189
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,211
Is she sick?

190
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,881
Well, I hear she has blood cancer.

191
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,426
[man 4] Apparently, she needs
a bone marrow transplant,

192
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,553
[sighs] but it's not easy to get one.

193
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:49,430
[woman 4 sighs]

194
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,184
SANG-WOO'S FISH STORE

195
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:57,479
- [customer] Take care.
- [Sang-woo's mother] Thank you. Bye.

196
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,155
Cheol!

197
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,615
[Cheol] Grandma.

198
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,826
[soft music]

199
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,580
- Have you had dinner?
- [Cheol] Yes.

200
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,582
I had a burger with my friends.

201
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:21,211
That's not enough.
I steamed some sweet potatoes.

202
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,422
[Cheol] Sweet potatoes? But I'm full.

203
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,215
[Sang-woo's mother]
Drink some <i>sikhye </i>then.

204
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:32,389
[broker] The woman next to Sae-byeok
is her mom.

205
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:37,519
She was recently released from
a prison camp in North Hamgyong Province.

206
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,397
How is she doing?

207
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,233
There was a tuberculosis outbreak
in her prison,

208
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,527
but she never received proper treatment.

209
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,238
She won't be able to move for a while.

210
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:51,200
Please just get her here
as soon as possible.

211
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:55,829
I've got the best experts ready
in China and North Korea.

212
00:15:56,872 --> 00:16:00,334
As soon as she recovers,
we'll get her moving.

213
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:03,504
I can give you more money
if that's what you need.

214
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,172
[broker] No.

215
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,299
You've already given me enough money.

216
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,719
[sighs]

217
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,265
After last time, I owe it to Sae-byeok.

218
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:19,687
I'm going to make this happen.

219
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:24,983
[paper rustling]

220
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:30,656
What's this?

221
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:31,657
SANG-WOO'S FISH STORE

222
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,493
[Gi-hun] That's where
Sae-byeok's little brother is.

223
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:37,287
If you can't get in touch with me,

224
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,916
please contact this number.

225
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,002
[broker] All right, I will.

226
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:01,812
[door opens]

227
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:06,024
Oh, for God's sake. You again?

228
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:12,740
Why do you keep bothering me like this?
I told you to find another broker.

229
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:17,035
Everyone else says she's dead.

230
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,996
Then she must be dead.

231
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:22,166
Do you think I can magically
bring people back to life?

232
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,461
You said she might be alive.

233
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:27,713
No, what I meant was

234
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:31,967
no one has actually witnessed her death
or found her body.

235
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,136
I wasn't saying that she's alive.

236
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,847
No one has seen her alive either.

237
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,187
Please look for her one last time.

238
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,856
Why is everyone offering me money?

239
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:49,651
I knew being kind has its rewards.

240
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,904
[woman] Please give it another try.

241
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:54,198
If this isn't enough,
I'll bring you more money.

242
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:01,038
If this was about money,
I would've asked for it a long time ago.

243
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:05,709
No-eul, you know
how hard I've tried to find her.

244
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,379
I felt bad for you
because I'm a father myself.

245
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,465
- I really did my best.
- I hear you.

246
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:14,760
Please, one last time.

247
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,472
Let me be honest with you.

248
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,058
How do you expect a one-year-old

249
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:24,144
to survive in North Korea
without her parents?

250
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:27,481
Besides, her mother shot her superior

251
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:30,192
and defected to South Korea
like a traitor…

252
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:39,201
I'm not saying it was your fault, No-eul.

253
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,371
That's just what happened.

254
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:50,838
I know it's harsh to tell a mother
to forget about her child,

255
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,132
but you really should.

256
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,177
There's nothing else you can do.

257
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,930
[melancholy music]

258
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,409

259
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:32,629
[knocking on window]

260
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,428
I'm sorry. I'll move my car right away.

261
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,305
[man] Ms. Kang No-eul.

262
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,433
[eerie music]

263
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:19,509
[Jun-ho] Hi, Mother.

264
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,471
[Jun-ho's mother] <i>Where are you?</i>
<i>Are you there yet?</i>

265
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,973
I'm walking up there now.

266
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:29,895
<i>Jun-ho. Take a look</i>
<i>and see if your brother has visited.</i>

267
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:36,026
<i>If he's alive, he would've left flowers</i>
<i>on the anniversary of his wife's death.</i>

268
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,111
[melancholy music]

269
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,466
[Jun-ho's mother] Did he come by?

270
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,677
- [Jun-ho] No.
- [Jun-ho's mother sighs]

271
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,473
I suppose your brother

272
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:11,770
doesn't want us in his life anymore.

273
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:17,109
We haven't heard from him in years now.

274
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,945
It's probably because

275
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,615
he still resents me deep down.

276
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:29,454
We were also struggling back then,
and he knows that.

277
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,290
[Jun-ho's mother] I just don't want him
to think

278
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:36,837
that I favored you over him
because he's my stepson.

279
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,424
That's what I'm afraid of.

280
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,300
Please stop thinking that.

281
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,512
He knows that's not true.

282
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,682
Your brother…

283
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:53,020
He saved your life
by giving you one of his kidneys.

284
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:59,026
But when his wife got sick,

285
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,571
I couldn't do anything for her.

286
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,200
- [Jun-ho sighs]
- [sobbing] If I could have…

287
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:16,126
I would've sold my organs to help her.

288
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,920
If that were the issue,
he'd resent me instead.

289
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,133
If he hadn't given me his kidney,

290
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:26,219
he could've sold it
and gotten her the treatment she needed.

291
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,765
If I had just died--

292
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,058
Don't say such a thing.

293
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,809
[Jun-ho] Neither should you!

294
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,228
Stop saying these things!

295
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:39,775
Fate gave her that disease,

296
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,695
and it was In-ho's own decision
to take bribes.

297
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:48,200
You and I are not responsible
for what happened to him!

298
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:53,205
He simply paid for what he had done.

299
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,503
[carnival music playing over loudspeakers]

300
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,375
[No-eul] I'm sorry.

RESIGNATION LETTER

302
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,794
It's for personal reasons.

303
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:43,880
[manager] Still, you can't quit
so suddenly.

304
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,800
It'll be hard to find a replacement.

305
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,135
I'm sorry.

306
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,637
[man] No-eul,
how did you work in this thing?

307
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,599
Damn, it's even worse
than the stupid pig head.

308
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:58,311
Sir, this must be why No-eul is quitting.

309
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,897
Kids might be happy
seeing us in these things,

310
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,650
but it totally sucks
for the adults wearing them.

311
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,901
Isn't that right, No-eul?

312
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:09,573
We're having dinner together tonight.
You should come and say goodbye.

313
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,783
That's right.
You should join us for dinner.

314
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:15,453
And have a drink.
Everyone will be sad if you don't.

315
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:16,913
Thank you for everything.

316
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:27,174
[sighs] Man, she's cold.
Right up until her last day.

317
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:31,094
I've worked with her for over two years,

318
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,513
but we've never even had
a real conversation.

319
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:37,726
I know. I don't know how she worked
this job with that kind of personality.

320
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,443
[siren wailing]

321
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:08,381
- Here. What happened?
- I found her unconscious.

322
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:09,716
[Na-yeon's father] Na-yeon.

323
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,386
Na-yeon!

324
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:17,641
Are you with her?

325
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:18,767
Yes, I'm her father.

326
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,936
Please take her to
Seohyeon University Hospital.

327
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:40,956

PARK NA-YEON

335
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:08,418
[doctor] There's a new medication
that's just come out.

336
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:14,132
It's for patients like Na-yeon
with recurrent cancer or a poor prognosis.

337
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:17,844
But it's not covered
by insurance at this point.

338
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:21,222
- Doctor, I'll get the money somehow.
- [melancholy music]

339
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:24,768
Please help Na-yeon.

340
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:29,272
[doctor] Make an appointment for tomorrow.
I'll explain the details then.

341
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,190

00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:50,437
And these guys
were in the ROK Special Forces.

348
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,314
Oh, and this guy is just a former cop.

349
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,191
As you can see,

350
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,861
they're tough men
who'd go through hell or high water

351
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:59,696
as long as the pay is right.

352
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:02,157
Right. This is the leader of the team.

353
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,160
He's a seasoned veteran
who has seen a lot of combat overseas.

354
00:29:05,743 --> 00:29:06,911
Please call me Kim.

355
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,788
You must be careful tomorrow.

356
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:12,250
If they notice you,
it could ruin everything.

357
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,502
[in English] Don't worry.

358
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,046
[in Korean] Only you and I
will go into the club.

359
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,549
These guys will be on standby nearby.

360
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:21,468
[Jun-ho] Will they even let you in?

361
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:24,179
Come on, I've already got
the perfect clubbing outfit.

362
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,222
I clean up well.

363
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,474
I'll go in with you.

364
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:28,683
[Gi-hun] No.

365
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:32,562
Your face was exposed on the island.
They might recognize you.

366
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:38,693
Don't make a move
until I give you the signal.

367
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:39,777
Understood.

368
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:46,159
And if something happens to me tomorrow--

369
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:48,411
[Woo-seok] Nothing is going to happen.

370
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,456
You've got your tracker.

371
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:55,710
Wherever you're taken,
we'll be right behind you.

372
00:29:55,793 --> 00:29:57,670
- So you can relax. <i>Don't worry!</i>
- [rifle cocks]

373

375
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,567
[ringing continues]

376
00:30:25,823 --> 00:30:26,950
[Ga-yeong in English] <i>Hello.</i>

<i>Hello.</i>

379
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:34,290
<i>Who is calling, hello?</i>

380
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:38,753
[in Korean] <i>Dad?</i>

381
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:43,258
<i>Dad, is that you?</i>

382
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,842
[breath trembling]

383
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:49,472
[Gi-hun's ex-wife] <i>Ga-yeong, who's that?</i>

384
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,058
[Ga-yeong] <i>I don't know.</i>
<i>No one's saying anything.</i>

385
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,852
[Gi-hun's ex-wife]
<i>It must be a prank call.</i>

386
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,480
<i>Hang up and come eat</i>
<i>before your soup gets cold.</i>

387
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,816
[Ga-yeong] <i>All right.</i>

388
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,609
[line disconnects]

389
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,581
[dial tone ringing]

390
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:21,588
[man on phone] <i>If you wish to participate,</i>

00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,798
June 25, 1994.

392
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:26,009
Kang No-eul.

393
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:30,179
[man on phone] <i>Confirmed.</i>

394
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:33,933

[paper rustles]

398
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,584
[club music booming]

399
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,465
[woman] Hey!

400
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:11,971
[Woo-seok] Wow, look at all these people.
What is going on today?

401
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,139
OCTOBER 31 MIDNIGHT
CLUB HDH

402
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:16,517
Wait, is it today?
Hall… What's it called again?

403
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,728
October 31, Halloween.

404
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,229
Yes, Halloween.

405
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:24,108
I'm getting a bad feeling.
This may be some kind of ruse.

406
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,818
That guy they call the Front Man.

407
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,365
You said he wears a gray hood
and a black mask, right?

408
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,282
Yes.

409
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:37,246
Oh, that must be why he chose today.
To cover his face.

410
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,375
That bastard is trying to be clever. Damn.

411
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,632
- Let's go.
- [Woo-seok] Okay.

412
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:55,098
[Woo-seok] Hold on!
Let me put something over my face.

413
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,184
I'll take this. How much?

414
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,937
[electronic music blaring]

415
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,538
[Woo-seok] We just got in!
Can you hear me? We're underground.

416
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:19,831
[Jun-ho] <i>Yes, I can hear you.</i>

417
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,124
[Woo-seok] And the tracker?

418
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:22,500
[tracker beeping]

419
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,377
[Jun-ho] Working fine. What's your status?

420
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,462
[Woo-seok] <i>It's totally crazy down here!</i>

421
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:30,007
Everyone is wearing masks,
and I can't tell who's who!

422
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:33,010
Anyway, I'll let you know
if something happens.

423
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,053
[Jun-ho] <i>All right.</i>

424
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:55,324
[ominous music]

425
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,464
[hurried breathing]

426
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:12,925
The masked men are here.
They're going inside.

427
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:17,472
[Woo-seok] The masked men?
Hey, everyone here is wearing a mask!

428
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,723
[car honks]

429
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,641
The men in pink jumpsuits from the island!

430
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:22,852
[Woo-seok] Really?

431
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,147
[music drowns out]

432
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:32,987
[music blaring]

433
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,408
What? Do I know you?

434
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,452
[man] What the fuck?

435
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:46,375
[bouncer] Hey, no cutting.
Go to the back of the line.

436
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,293
Police. Move.

437
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,547
See your fellow officers waiting in line?

438
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:55,593
It's Halloween.
Go put on your uniform first.

439
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:56,844
[bouncer yelps]

440
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,680
Does this look like a toy?

441
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,853
[Woo-seok] I don't see any pink jumpsuits!

442
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,411
[Woo-seok] What?

443
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:28,543
I just spotted one!
He's taking Mr. Seong somewhere!

444
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:29,877
I'll follow them!

445
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,296
- [Jun-ho] <i>There were two of them.</i>
- What? What did you say?

446
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,423
- [Jun-ho] <i>There were two of them!</i>
- What?

447
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:37,593
- [stun gun buzzing]
- [Woo-seok groaning]

448
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:43,307
Mr. Choi, where are you?

449
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,184
Mr. Choi!

450
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,001
Mr. Choi!

451
00:36:16,173 --> 00:36:18,134
They left the club. Get ready!

452
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:21,304
- [tense music]
- Guys, it's time to roll.

453
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:22,346
Get ready.

454
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:26,017
[guns cocking]

455
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,127
[tracker beeping]

456
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:56,339
He just got into a white limo.
All teams, tail them.

457
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,883
[Jun-ho] <i>We have to catch him.</i>
<i>Keep that in mind.</i>

458
00:36:58,966 --> 00:36:59,842
Go.

459
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:11,979
[Front Man] <i>Player 456.</i>

460
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,607
<i>Do you remember?</i>

461
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:17,443
<i>We once spoke in this car.</i>

462
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,530
Was it this car?

463
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:26,285
It's nicer than I remember.

464
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,788
[Front Man] <i>I sincerely hoped</i>
<i>you'd have a good life.</i>

465
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:32,500
<i>I hoped you'd forget everything</i>
<i>that happened and be happy.</i>

466
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,753
I didn't know you cared so much about me.

467
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,675
I'm almost moved to tears.

468
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,302
[Front Man] <i>You should have gotten</i>
<i>on that plane.</i>

469
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:46,555
<i>That's the best choice</i>
<i>you could have made.</i>

470
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,724
I have never forgotten…

471
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,770
what you said to me then.

472
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:58,025
That's why I wanted
to see you again so badly.

473
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:01,862
[Front Man] <i>Now that we're here,</i>
<i>say what you want to say.</i>

474
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,156
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

475
00:38:09,286 --> 00:38:11,038
Stop the game.

476
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:18,963
[Front Man] <i>The game?</i>

477
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:20,673
[Gi-hun] The game you've been playing.

478
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:24,301
The game
that's still going on to this day.

479
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,303
[Front Man] <i>All we did was create it.</i>

480
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:29,015
<i>All of you participated by choice.</i>

481
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,891
Don't give me that shit.

482
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:34,854
You manipulate people
who feel like they're at a dead end.

483
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,441
You drive them to their deaths
and enjoy it.

484
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:42,486
You think if you just call it
their own choice,

485
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:47,908
your filthy game will become
some sort of charity event?

486
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:51,412
[Front Man] <i>They were all</i>
<i>just losers of the game.</i>

487
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,081
<i>Trash eliminated from the competition.</i>

488
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:59,170
<i>A ton of new trash is being poured</i>
<i>into the world as we speak.</i>

489
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,756
<i>You still don't see it, do you?</i>

490
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:06,052
<i>The game will not end</i>
<i>unless the world changes.</i>

491
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:08,012
[Jun-ho] <i>Do you have the limo in sight?</i>

492
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,513
[Kim] Yes, we see it.

493
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:12,850
It's on Seogang Bridge,
headed toward Yeouido. What now?

494
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:15,978
Don't do anything yet.
It has to be somewhere less crowded.

495
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:16,937
[Kim] <i>Understood.</i>

496
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:26,447
[Gi-hun] "That's just how the world is,
so just shut up and accept it"?

497
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:31,077
That's a story created by people like you.

498
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,748
You think people are just
horses in a race,

499
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:38,709
and you own the horses.

500
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:43,255
[Front Man] <i>Your way with words</i>
<i>has improved.</i>

501
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:48,385
<i>So? Is your plan to convince</i>
<i>the owners of the horses?</i>

502
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:50,846
<i>To stop the race?</i>

503
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,724
[Kim] We're on it now.

504
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,893
But the limo's movements seem suspicious.

505
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:57,103
[Jun-ho] <i>How so?</i>

506
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:59,313
[Kim] <i>It's circling the Yeouido area.</i>

507
00:39:59,396 --> 00:40:02,525
[Jun-ho] <i>They might have caught on</i>
<i>already. Stop the limo now!</i>

508
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,985
[Kim] <i>Roger. Initiating the plan.</i>

509
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,533
- [gunshot]
- [tires screeching]

510
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,535
[car honks]

511
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:13,452
[thug 1] Shit!

512
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:15,788
[thug 2] What the hell?

513
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:17,039
What's going on?

514
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,666
[mercenary] One of the tires blew out.

515
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,709
Shit. Team Two will follow them.

516
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:23,337
<i>- </i>[thug 3] <i>Okay. Back the car up now!</i>
<i>- </i>[thug 4] <i>Back up.</i>

517
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:25,923
[gunshot]

518
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,510
There's a sniper. Get down!

519
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:34,723
[Kim] Both teams are under attack.
We have to abort the operation.

520
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:38,519
[Front Man] <i>Or were you going</i>
<i>to kidnap me?</i>

521
00:40:39,436 --> 00:40:41,105
- [tense music]
- [Jun-ho] I'll follow them.

522
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:45,192
[device beeping]

523
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:50,114
[Jun-ho huffing]

524
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,240
[Jun-ho] They got me.

525
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:52,616
<i>I'm losing them.</i>

526
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:54,827
Stop the car.

527
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:03,961
[Front Man] <i>Do you think</i>
<i>you can stop the game with a pistol?</i>

528
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,899
Put me in the game.

529
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:26,984
[Front Man] <i>You want to be in the game?</i>

530
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,821
Put me back in the game.

531
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:34,617
[Front Man] <i>Weren't you telling me</i>
<i>to stop the game just a second ago?</i>

532
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,744
[Gi-hun] If I'm back in the game,

533
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,831
those fat cats you serve

534
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,876
will find it fun for sure.

535
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,046
So,

536
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,090
<i>take me to the games.</i>

537
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:56,597
[Gi-hun] What are you hesitating for?

538
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,475
Are you scared?

539
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:03,604
That you might lose to me
like Oh Il-nam did?

540
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:08,859
Oh Il-nam didn't want to admit it
until the moment he died.

541
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,863
He knew someone had come
to help that homeless man,

542
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,782
but he refused to look out the window.

543
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:16,450
But

544
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:22,831
when he stopped breathing,
I'm sure he knew

545
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,585
that he had lost.

546
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,922
[Front Man] <i>Have you seen </i>The Matrix?

547
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:33,717
<i>They could've lived in peace</i>
<i>if they took the blue pill.</i>

548
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:38,055
<i>But they still chose the red pill</i>
<i>to play the heroes.</i>

549
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:42,601
<i>Do you also think you're a hero</i>

550
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,603
<i>who can change the world?</i>

551
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:54,780
I'll show you

552
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:58,158
that the world…

553
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:02,997
doesn't always go

554
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,166
the way you want it to.

555
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,755
[Front Man] <i>If that's what you want,</i>
<i>have it your way.</i>

556
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,258
- [eerie music]
- [gas hissing]

557
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:19,138
[coughs quietly]

558
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,510
[Front Man] Player 456.

559
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:02,097
Welcome back to the game.

560
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,474
[suspenseful music]

561
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:04,683
[tracker beeping]

562
00:44:05,642 --> 00:44:08,520
We will now initiate plan B.

563
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:37,818
[mysterious music]

564
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:21,898
