[Jung-bae] You sure
you did this a lot as a kid?

00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:41,505
Now forward. Ready, go!

173
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,427
[In-ho] Hang on. Let me do this.

174
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,347
[In-ho] What the hell is the problem?

175
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,433
[Gi-hun] Stay calm, okay?

176
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,731
Don't rush it. No!

177
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,358
- [Dae-ho] Damn it!
- [woman on PA] <i>Fail.</i>

178
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:02,860
[In-ho sighs]

179
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:07,740
- [Gi-hun] We still have time--
- [In-ho] What the hell is wrong with me?!

180
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:11,285
[yells]

181
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:14,997
You goddamn idiot! You're an idiot!

182
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,665
[In-ho yells hysterically]

183
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,792
No one is blaming you!

184
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,420
[Gi-hun] All right.
Take a deep breath, okay?

185
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:25,633
Try to remember the times
when you had fun playing this.

186
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:26,925
Now, deep breaths.

187
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,011
[In-ho breathing heavily]

188
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,431
[Gi-hun] Deep breaths. Calm down.

189
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,267
It's okay.

190
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:39,021
Take your time, okay? Stay calm.

191
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:40,731
All right.

192
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,361
[Gi-hun exhales]

193
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,907
- [motivational music resumes]
- [all cheer]

194
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,663
[Gi-hun] Let's go! Ready, go!

195
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,291
[Jung-bae] How are you holding up?

196
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,254
[Jung-bae] Are you okay?

197
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,553
Okay, move.

198
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:19,186
One, two, three, four…

199
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,611
[Jung-bae] You did it!

200
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,196
[Gi-hun cheers loudly]

201
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,658
<i>- </i>[woman on PA] <i>Pass.</i>
- [In-ho] Let's go!

202
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:33,826
Ready, go!

203
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,953
One, two! Quickly!

204
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,706
We're almost there!

205
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:46,213
- [all cheer]
- [timer beeps]

206
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,215
[In-ho] We did it! Well done!

207
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,886
- [music stops]
- [rapid gunfire]

208
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,558
[woman on PA] <i>The following players</i>

212
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,906
Fuck, way too many people made it.

213
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,411
Hey.

214
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,290
How many do you think are left?

215
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,583
Sorry?

216
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:27,838
How many roaches
do you think we have left in here?

217
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,387
About 200.

218
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,722
How do you know?

219
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,015
What are you, an AI bot?

220
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,225
Go count them.

221
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:41,894
Now?

222
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,563
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

223
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:49,318
Why do you want to count them?
Are you stupid?

224
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,905
The masked men will come and tell us soon.

225
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,364
Shut up, bitch.

226
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,324
[in English] Stop it.

227
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,787
- [in Korean] What's your name again?
- It's Min-su.

228
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,079
How old are you?

229
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:02,790
I'm 27.

230
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,000
So you were born in 1997.

231
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,711
Why do you treat him like he's your boss?

232
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,004
He's the same age as you.

233
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,007
- Nam-su, isn't that right?
- It's Nam-gyu.

234
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,052
- Yes, Nam-gyu. Isn't that right?
- Yes.

235
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,179
You're the same age.
Treat him like a friend.

236
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:20,057
We'll work better as a team that way.
Okay?

237
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:21,975
How old are you?

238
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,310
Born in 1998.

239
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,229
You?

240
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:26,188
Born in 1996.

241
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,066
It's settled.

242
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,654
Gyeong-su is the youngest,
you're the same age, and you're older.

243
00:18:35,113 --> 00:18:37,866
Hey, call her <i>noona</i> since she's older.

244
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,284
[chuckles]

245
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,329
- [Thanos] Do it.
- [Nam-gyu laughs]

246
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:44,748
<i>Unnie.</i>

247
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,836
Can I ask you something?

248
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,421
Yes.

249
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:56,343
How did you know it'd be easier
to flip the <i>ddakji</i> with the other side?

250
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:05,477
I used to play <i>Ddakji</i>
with my friends when I was a kid.

251
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,773
And that was my secret trick.

252
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:11,984
I see.

253
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:15,821
Listen, can I ask you something too?

254
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:16,738
Yes.

255
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:22,327
When you were playing <i>Jegi,</i>
how come you didn't want us to look?

256
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,829
Oh.

257
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,583
Well, I…

258
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,378
Are you shy?

259
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,463
It's not that.

260
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,800
I'm just not completely done.

261
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,303
What do you mean?

262
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:42,598
Mom, stop asking questions.
You're being nosy.

263
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,725
- [Yong-sik clears throat]
- [Hyun-ju] It's all right.

264
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,853
I still have some procedures left.

265
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:53,025
I just didn't want people to stare at me.

266
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,484
What procedures?

267
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,487
[gasps]

268
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:01,575
Oh, so that's how
you got yourself those too?

269
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,492
[chuckles]

270
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,828
Of course. I knew they were too big--

271
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,246
Mom, please!

272
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,081
[Yong-sik] I'm so sorry.

273
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,921
What? We have more survivors?

274
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,840
It's that nutjob's team.

275
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:22,220
Goddammit. There's going to be a big drop
in the prize money they add.

276
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,515
- That young lady made it.
- Who?

277
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,643
The tiny young lady.

278
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,645
They don't seem so happy to see us.

279
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,400
That sweet old lady.

280
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:37,653
I miss my mom.

281
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,955

I thought you'd be a total freak,
but you actually have a decent face.

289
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,917
[masked soldier 1]
North Korean girls are pretty.

290
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,169
What the hell is this?
You're breaking the rules.

291
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,046
[masked soldier 2] Rules, my ass.

292
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,674
You should've steered clear
if you weren't going to help.

293
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,384
I'm going to report this.

294
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,389
To whom? The officer?

295
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,892
How long do you think he'll protect you?

296
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,270
He's already cut you loose. [laughs]

297
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,359
Do you want me
to explain it to you in detail?

298
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,279

Shall I ruin your face?

305
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:31,600
Or shall I cut your fingers off
so you can't pull the trigger anymore?

306
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:37,355
Last warning.

307
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,317
If you get in our way again,

308
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:44,571
I will cut off all your fingers
and throw them in the incinerator.

309
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,115
And play with you a little too.

I'm sorry about earlier, everyone.

315
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:11,890
[Dae-ho] No, it's okay.

316
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:12,849
[Gi-hun] Don't be.

317
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:17,020
If it weren't for you,
I wouldn't have made the last kick.

318
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,567
Player 222, are you feeling all right?

319
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:24,111
Yes.

320
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:28,740
Thank you all
for including me on your team.

321
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:33,161
She smashed that <i>ddakji</i>
and flipped it on her first try.

322
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:37,332
That was impressive.
She did great, even while carrying a baby.

323
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:40,168
We were lucky she joined our team.

324
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,879
[Dae-ho] What about
your Flying Stone play?

325
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:47,926
You hit it with one shot.
With an underhand pitch at that. Bam!

326
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,094
[Dae-ho laughs]

327
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:51,179
You were like Kim Byung-hyun.

328
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,430
[Jung-bae and Dae-ho laugh]

329
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,975
And you? Was <i>Gong-gi</i>
the only game you ever played?

330
00:23:56,351 --> 00:24:00,063
I could barely see your hand.
It was like a martial arts movie. [laughs]

331
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,731
I'm the only son for two generations.

332
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:04,818
My mom only let me play at home
with my sisters. [chuckles]

333
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:08,029
And yet they let their precious son
join the Marines?

334
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:14,077
My father's idea,
he wanted me to be more of a man.

335
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,496
He fought in the Vietnam War, you see.

336
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,414
[Jung-bae] Wow.

337
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:19,583
- He sounds like a great man.
- Yeah.

338
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,293
Was he a Marine too?

339
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:24,671
Yeah, well…
Would you excuse me for a moment?

340
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:30,343
Listen. Perhaps we should learn
each other's names.

341
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:34,556
I still don't know your names, gentlemen.
Or yours, Miss.

342
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,018
I'll start. I'm Kang Dae-ho.

343
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,812
"Dae" means "big," "ho" means "tiger."

344
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,899
Wow. "Big tiger." Cool name. [chuckles]

345
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,442
My name is Park Jung-bae.

346
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,861
"Righteous" and "twice."

347
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:50,906
My parents wanted me
to be twice as righteous.

348
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,033
My name is Kim Jun-hee.

349
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,036
I don't know what it means though.

350
00:24:56,995 --> 00:25:00,707
Jun-hee, when you get out of here,
go see a doctor right away.

351
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:04,336
You've been under a lot of stress.
You need to get yourself checked out.

352
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,670
Okay.

353
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,505
I'm Oh Young-il.

354
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,715
- [Jung-bae] "Young-il"?
- Yes.

355
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,510
"Young-il" sounds like "zero one,"
and that's my number.

356
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,138
Easy to remember.

357
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,724
Oh, that's true! Your name is your number.

358
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:18,892
[Dae-ho and Jung-bae laugh]

359
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:21,853
Oh, Gi-hun. What's your last name?

360
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,648
My name is Seong Gi-hun.

361
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:25,899
- [In-ho] I see.
- Seong Gi-hun.

362
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:28,235
[In-ho] "Seong" literally means
"last name."

363
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,527
[In-ho laughs]

364
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,035
[alarm buzzing]

365
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:47,337
[masked manager]
Congratulations to all of you

366
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,589
for making it through the second game.

367
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:54,719
Here are the results of the second game.

368
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,973
- [remote beeps]
- [ceiling rumbles]

369
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,184
- [digital trilling]
- [chiptune music]

370
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,243
[chiptune music intensifies]

371
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:30,255
[masked manager] In the second game,
110 players were eliminated.

372
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,883
The prize money accumulated
up to this point is 20.1 billion won.

373
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,344
Since there are 255 players remaining,

374
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:41,474
each person's share is 78,823,530 won.

375
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:42,934
[man 1] Wait, what?

376
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:46,271
It's still under 100 million?
It's not even 80 million.

377
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:51,151
[woman] Only 110 people died? Is that all?

378
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,737
Did you count them right?

379
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:57,824
[man 2] That's all?
But you shot all those people!

380
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:00,702
- [Yeong-sam] It was more than that!
- [Jeong-dae] Count them again!

381
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,913
Fuck. I almost died twice,
and that's all I get?

382
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,293
I'd get more money than that
if I let somebody beat me up!

383
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:12,047
[masked manager] I completely understand
your disappointment.

384
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:17,427
However, we always keep the door open
for you to pursue new opportunities.

385
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:23,808
You will now take a vote to decide
whether to continue the games or not.

386
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:39,449
Whether to continue the games
for a bigger prize or to stop here

387
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:42,410
is entirely your choice.

388
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,913
Please feel free

389
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:49,417
to exercise your right to choose
in a democratic manner.

390
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,589
- Yong-sik.
- Yeah?

391
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:56,383
If we go home today,

392
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:00,387
let's have kimchi stew.
I'll make it with some aged kimchi.

393
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,264
- With a lot of pork, right?
- [Geum-ja chuckles]

394
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,808
I suddenly feel hungry.

395
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:08,144
Listen, I think it's more than
a coincidence that we met here.

396
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:14,025
If we get out, I'd like to invite you
to our house for a meal.

397
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,693
We'll grill some pork belly.

398
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:19,531
Would that be okay?

399
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:21,699
Absolutely!

400
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:26,830
We live in a small place, but there is
enough space for four people to eat.

401
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:30,208
There's space for you to lie down.
You can sleep over. [chuckles]

402
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,880
<i>Unnie,</i> are you coming?

403
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,479
By the way, where do you all live?

404
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,398
We live in Bongcheon-dong.

405
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,484
Really? I live in Sillim-dong.

406
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,779
[gasps] Goodness,
we're practically neighbors!

407
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,990
What about you, Hyun-ju?
Do you live in Seoul?

408
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,117
I live in Gwangmyeong.

409
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,704
My! That's only a 30-minute bus ride away.

410
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:09,956
I'm surprised we all live
so close together.

411
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:13,418
We must have a special connection.
This is amazing. [chuckles]

412
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,017
Don't worry.

413
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,144
I want to stop here too.

414
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:35,440
I should go and be with my wife
at the hospital.

415
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:41,613
I'm telling you. We'll get out this time.

416
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,282
Damn it.

417
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:47,827
A Marine should think strategically
and know when to retreat.

418
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:49,829
Isn't that right, brother?

419
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,916
Yeah, you're right.

420
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:57,128
Marines aren't invincible.
We should get out.

421
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,589
[Gi-hun] We have to end the games here.

422
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:03,635
I will help you guys out when we get out.

423
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:07,805
Please trust me and support this vote.

424
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:11,809
Guys, all huddle up again.

425
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:19,734
- In one, two, three. Victory at all costs!
- [all] Victory at all costs!

426
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:20,652
[Dae-ho] Hmph!

427
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:23,613
[Jung-bae groans in pain]

428
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:27,283
[masked manager] This time,
the vote will begin with Player 001.

429
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,869
Player 001, please cast your vote.

430
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:42,048
[beeps]

431
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:43,716
[tense music]

432
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,516
[masked manager] Player 006.

433
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:02,443
[beeps]

434
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:03,903
Player 007.

435
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:07,865
Excuse me.

436
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:08,783
Yong-sik.

437
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:12,203
Don't get any foolish ideas.

438
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,331
If we put our money together,

439
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,251
it'd be over 150 million.

440
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,378
We'll pay off your debt with it

441
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:25,758
and use the rest to open
a produce store or something. Okay?

442
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:26,968
[Yong-sik] Mm-hm.

443
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,282
[beeps]

444
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:50,867
[gasps]

445
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:57,498
[breath trembles]

446
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:13,931
[beeps]

447
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,559
[beeps]

448
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:25,068
[beeps]

449
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:28,237
[Seon-nyeo mumbling indistinctly]

450
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,865
[man] Hurry up!
Are you doing a goddamn ritual?

451
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,328
Shut your mouth!

452
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:43,419
[breathing deeply]

453
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,468
[Seon-nyeo whispering indistinctly]

454
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:51,594
[beeps]

455
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:56,849
[beeps]

456
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,272
Don't betray us.

457
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:04,691
What?

458
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:07,568
- This.
- [masked manager] Player 048.

459
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:11,280
We all agreed
to play one more game, right?

460
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,241
Yeah.

461
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,536
[beeps]

462
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:20,665
[beeps]

463
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,626
[beeps]

464
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,174
[beeps]

465
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,680
[beeps]

466
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:47,525
[beeps]

467
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,782
[dark music]

468
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,161
[breath trembles]

469
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,497
- [beeps]
- [masked manager] Player 125.

470
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,312
[beeps]

471
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,691
Player 126.

472
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,696
[Gi-hun] Excuse me.

473
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,655
Everyone!

474
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,282
[In-ho] Are you all out of your minds?

475
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:43,080
You still want to keep going
after watching all those people die?

476
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,375
Who's to say you won't die
in the next game?

477
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:51,422
We have to stop.

478
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,633
We'll all die if we keep going!

479
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:57,345
Come to your senses,
and leave with that money.

480
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:01,682
You've got to survive first,
or there won't be a next step.

481
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:06,437
What do you think we can do
with a mere 70 million?

482
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:11,776
I don't know how much you owe,
but for most people here,

483
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:16,239
that doesn't even cover 10% of their debt.

484
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,573
Am I right?

485
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:22,245
There's no next step for us!
That money won't change anything!

486
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:24,747
- [Player 043] Yes, he's right!
- [man 1] That's right!

487
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:27,959
[Player 043] With that amount of money,
I won't last long.

488
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,545
It was 25 million after the first game,

489
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,422
and now it's 78 million!

490
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:37,218
After one game,
the amount more than tripled!

491
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,638
If we play one more game,

492
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:45,476
the prize will be at least 240 million!

493
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,479
[Young-mi] But I can't do this anymore.

494
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,190
[sobbing] Please.

495
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:55,111
Please let me out of here.

496
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,488
I really…

497
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:01,951
I really want to go home.

498
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,121
I don't want to die.

499
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,331
[Young-mi crying]

500
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,835
[man 2] Young lady.

501
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:16,007
You're young, so you'd probably have
another chance.

502
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,885
[sobbing] But I don't.

503
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,720
Please.

504
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:24,015
[man 2] My family and I have no future.

505
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:28,769
My business failed,
and now I owe over 500 million.

506
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:32,398
I've got to make
at least half of that here

507
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,651
if I want a real shot at a fresh start.

508
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:36,861
[In-ho] What if you die?

509
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:40,865
If you die here, your family
won't even get your body.

510
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:44,911
Then it'd be the end
for you and your family!

511
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:49,290
- Don't you see?
- [Yeong-sam] Don't get fucking scared!

512
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,920
<i>Ddakji,</i> Red Light, Green Light,
Spinning Top!

513
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:57,048
It's not like the games
are that difficult.

514
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:58,841
Look.

515
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:04,096
There are still 255 players.
Way more than half of us survived!

516
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:08,309
We've made it this far,
so let's do this one more time!

517
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:12,063
[Jeong-dae] You make such a good point,
young man.

518
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,022
That's right!

519
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:18,235
We've all played the games well
and survived until now!

520
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,364
Now, let's play one more game!

521
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:27,078
Just one more, and that's it.
Let's play just one more game!

522
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,955
- [ominous music]
- Yeah, let's play one more!

523
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,247
[Jeong-dae] One more game!

524
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:35,252
[players] One more game!

525
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,339
[beeps]

526
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:28,139
[masked manager] The results are
139 for O and 116 for X.

527
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:33,561
Based on the majority vote,
we'll proceed to the third game tomorrow.

528
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,771
Thank you.

529
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,815
[players chatter indistinctly]

530
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:43,279
[sighs]

531
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:26,197
Thank you.

532
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,325
Thank you.

533
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,132
<i>Noona.</i>

534
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:50,387
Aren't you scared?

535
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,305
Scared of what?

536
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:54,475
Playing more games.

537
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:58,187
I am scared.

538
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:02,858
Then why do you want to continue?

539
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:06,278
Hmm.

540
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,740
Because if I go out now,

541
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,827
I'll have to face even scarier things.

542
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:18,499
[chuckles]

543
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,043
Don't call me <i>noona.</i>

544
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,462
I'm younger than you,
but don't tell those jerks.

545
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:34,807
Mom, are you angry?

546
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,892
Don't call me "Mom," you damn fool.

547
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:42,731
Mom, I'm sorry,
but I can't go home with just that.

548
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:50,781
What do you mean?

549
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,536
I have a little more debt.

550
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:00,708
How much?

551
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,294
About 100 million.

552
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:08,841
[sniffles] I borrowed it from loan sharks
and the gambling den.

553
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,760
If I don't pay them back by next month,

554
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,138
I'll be in huge trouble.

555
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:20,477
They said they'd take and sell
my eyes, liver, and kidneys.

556
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:22,688
I know they'll actually do it.

557
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:26,317
That's why
I haven't been able to come home.

558
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:27,651
[sighs]

559
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:33,032
Just one more game.
Next time, I promise I'll vote to leave.

560
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:35,784
After one more game,
I'll be able to pay off all my debts.

561
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,786
We'll make a fresh start then. Okay?

562
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,540
Yong-sik. "Next time"?

563
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:42,625
Yeah.

564
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,210
"Fresh start"?

565
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,378
[sighs]

566
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:51,926
What if one of us gets killed before that?

567
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,678
I know…

568
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:58,766
maybe you'd be fine without me.

569
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:04,939
But if something happens to you…

570
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:12,655
I wouldn't have a reason to live,
even if I make it out of here.

571
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,617
Why would you say such a thing?

572
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,536
We'll get through this together.

573
00:42:20,537 --> 00:42:21,372
[sighs]

574
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:27,336
Brother!

575
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,713
[stifled cough]

576
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:30,965
[Dae-ho] Brother Jung-bae!

577
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:33,050
[whimpers]

578
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:35,302
- Man…
- [whimsical music]

579
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,223
[Dae-ho] Hey, just come back here.

580
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:42,226
- No, I'm good here.
- [Dae-ho] Oh, come on.

581
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:44,770
- [Jung-bae] But… Hey.
- [Dae-ho] All right.

582
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:46,772
You should've gone farther away then.

583
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:50,025
It bugs me seeing you
sitting there all pathetic.

584
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,198
[Jung-bae] I'm sorry.

585
00:42:58,325 --> 00:42:59,702
Jun-hee, Young-il. I'm sorry.

586
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:03,455
Gi-hun, I'm sorry.

587
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,751
I borrowed some emergency cash,

588
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:10,421
and the creditors are harassing
my ex-wife and kid.

589
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:13,048
If I play one more game,

590
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,259
I think I'll be able to settle my debt.

591
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:16,802
- So--
- [In-ho] Jung-bae.

592
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:19,680
You of all people shouldn't have done it.

593
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,433
It's not twice as righteous.

594
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:26,061
[sighs]

595
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:29,898
But, looking at the results,
even if you had voted against,

596
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:32,276
we would still have been outvoted.

597
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:35,696
Right? It's not entirely my fault.

598
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:36,989
All right. To be honest,

599
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,743
I understand why you did it.

600
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:44,830
The money isn't enough for me either,
so when I went up to vote,

601
00:43:45,622 --> 00:43:47,791
I did think about playing one more game.

602
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:48,709
You did?

603
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,002
I said I get it.

604
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:53,005
Thank you for understanding.

605
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:57,176
[sighs] But I voted in favor
partly because I feel confident.

606
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:59,595
We did so well as a team, didn't we?

607
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:04,099
If we stick together one more time,
I'm sure we'll be fine. Jun-hee.

608
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,727
I'll make sure we survive the next game--

609
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:07,853
[Gi-hun] "The next game"?

610
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:10,981
In the next game,

611
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:14,068
we might have to kill each other.

612
00:44:16,653 --> 00:44:19,198
[In-ho] Gi-hun, that's a bit much.

613
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,370
There's nothing we can do now,
so let's try to stay positive.

614
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:29,541
We should eat, pull ourselves together,
and try our best again.

615
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:34,129
Here, Jun-hee. You can have mine too.
Hang in there until the next game.

616
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:36,632
- No, it's okay.
- [In-ho] Take it.

617
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:39,385
I don't drink plain milk.

618
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:44,723
Thank you.

619
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:46,058
[Jung-bae] Have my bread too.

620
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:47,851
I don't deserve to eat.

621
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,729
Can I have your milk then?

622
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,024
[whimsical music]

623
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,120
[Yong-sik] It wasn't just me.

624
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:10,082
Oh, look. See?
I'm not the only one who voted in favor--

625
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:18,382
Hyun-ju, why did you do it?

626
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:21,593
We said we were all going
to get together at my house.

627
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:24,179
Why did you change your mind?

628
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:28,142
Mmm? I wouldn't think you'd have
gambling debts like my son.

629
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:33,647
Is it because of the surgery?
Does it cost that much?

630
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:36,984
[sighs]

631
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,611
You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

632
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,906
I can't even keep
my own child under control,

633
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:47,202
so who am I to tell you anything?

634
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:49,872
[sighs]

635
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:55,711
[Hyun-ju] I…

636
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:02,676
Everything was fine
until I told people who I really am.

637
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,722
People would look at me strangely,

638
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:09,600
but I never had any big issues.

639
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:12,644
But…

640
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:16,899
once I told people
I wanted to live as a woman…

641
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:18,192
[melancholy music]

642
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,735
and started transitioning,

643
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:22,529
everything changed.

644
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,163
My mom cried a lot.

645
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,875
And my father stopped talking to me.

646
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,632
I got fired from my job,
and lost all my friends.

647
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:45,677
I wasn't done
with the treatment and procedures,

648
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:50,390
but I wasn't earning any money,
so my debt kept piling up.

649
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,976
Although I felt liberated,

650
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:55,312
my life…

651
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,690
became so much harder.

652
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,150
[Geum-ja] Oh, dear.

653
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:06,949
Well, what did you do for work before?

654
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:09,826
I was in the army.

655
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:11,995
[Geum-ja] Ah…

656
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:17,209
If you make money here, then what?

657
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:18,877
Do you have a plan?

658
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,256
I think I'm going to move to Thailand.

659
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,257
Thailand?

660
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:28,637
I want to play just one more game.
If I win the money… [sniffles]

661
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:33,809
I'll finish my transition there
and buy a small house.

662
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:36,812
I want to start a new life there.

663
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:38,855
I've been to Thailand before.

664
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:41,984
There are a lot of people
like Hyun-ju over there.

665
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:46,780
They're hotter and more beautiful
than most women,

666
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:49,992
and you see them everywhere.
Isn't that right?

667
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:54,663
Yeah. I hear a lot of them
are really beautiful.

668
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,958
You're beautiful too, <i>unnie</i>.

669
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:11,346
[breath trembling]

670
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:14,975
I don't know if I could say "beautiful,"

671
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:17,603
but I've spent some time with you now,

672
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:22,190
and I think you look fine. [laughs]

673
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:24,359
[Yong-sik] You said she was unsightly.

674
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:27,571
[Geum-ja] Hey.

675
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,114
[Geum-ja laughs]

676
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:33,076
[toilet flushing]

677
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,995
[trickling]

678
00:48:35,912 --> 00:48:36,872
[sighs]

679
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,086
You traitor.

680
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:46,256
How can you take a piss
under these circumstances?

681
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:49,301
[urinal flushing]

682
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:53,013
Just finish. You'll get an infection
if you stop mid-stream.

683
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:56,058
[Nam-gyu sighs]

684
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:09,696
[Thanos] Were you really
trying to get out?

685
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,657
What can you even do with 70 million?

686
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:15,369
That's not even enough to pay me back.

687
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:18,747

That coin's price did go up.

If I won the prize alone,
that'd mean you're dead.

Why would I pay you back if you were dead?

Oh, right.

You forgot the lyrics

Even if that were true,

When ladies say
they need to use the bathroom,

it's for reasons they can't tell you.

If you can't understand that,

If I were you,
I would have put everything behind me

and management told us to come out.

and receive more severance pay.

When I was on night watch,
I wanted to go out. Guess why I didn't.

- Yes.

So you stayed because of me?

854
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:18,197
Yeah. I was watching you, and I thought,

"Man, look at this poor little wuss."

Then I knew I couldn't fucking leave you.

I got divorced because of you.

You can slice it up nicely for us.

you're on a fishing boat?

Why did you team up with them then?

are easier to deal with.
