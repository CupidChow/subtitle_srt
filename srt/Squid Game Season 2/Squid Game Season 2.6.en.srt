334
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,481
[Nam-gyu] One more, right, bro?

335
00:21:19,277 --> 00:21:21,530
All right, make it quick.
What do you want?

336
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,907
Jun-hee,

337
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:27,244
once we get out, I'd like to start over.

338
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,037
"Start over"?

339
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,206
How do we do that?

340
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:33,166
Trust me one last time, okay?

341
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:37,462
And we'll have our child,
and start a whole new life.

342
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,968
I did a rough estimate, and based on that,

343
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,387
I think each person
will make 300 to 400 million.

344
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,764
That's gotta convince a lot of people.

345
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,850
I think we could win the next vote.

346
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,477
And if we do,

347
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:54,730
what happens?

348
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,900
So we'd have a lot
if we put our shares together.

349
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,028
I could use that
to pay off a few debts first,

350
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,613
then I'll find something new
to invest the rest in.

351
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,701
No more crypto, no more coins.

352
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:10,912
Listen, there's this whole crew
of stockbrokers that I know.

353
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,790
Their thing is trading futures
and Inverse ETFs.

354
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,251
Their returns broke 100% just last month.

355
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,171
So you don't need me or our child.

356
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,548
All you need is the cash.

357
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,550
No, Jun-hee, it's not like that.

358
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:27,012
I just want us to have enough
so the three of us can live a more--

359
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,096
"Enough"?

360
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,640
And exactly how much is that?

361
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:31,725
Huh?

362
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:36,521
Pay off your debts

to help put an end to your existences.

Hey, Gi-hun. There are still 55 "O"s here.

- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I counted twice.

[In-ho] That might sound like a lot,

396
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,267
but if just six of them
change their minds,

397
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,435
it'll be 50/50.

398
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:42,189
And if somehow we can get seven,
we might even win.

399
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:45,901
Yeah, but a few of the "X"s could also
change their minds and vote "O" now.

If they pressed "X" last time,

they won't change sides.

When they voted to go home,
they were fine with less money.

Now their share of the prize money's
even higher.

I'm definitely pressing X this time.

If five other people do the same,

And if it's six, we win.

If all we need to win
is another five or six people,

then we should just vote like normal.

The total's over 300 million.

[Dae-ho and Jung-bae gasping]

510
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,685
That's it. Two more. Two more!

511
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:38,062
- [masked manager] Player 119.
- Here we go. Two more.

512
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,647
Just two more people to go.

513
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,246
[suspenseful music playing]

514
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,465
Looks like it leads
to somewhere underground.

515
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:48,549
Check it.

516
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,641
[mercenaries scream]

517
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:58,309

[masked manager] Player 015.

00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,413
[beeps]

523
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:23,459
[Jung-bae] He switched,
he changed his vote. He pressed "X." Oh!

524
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,420
That's the sixth person.
That means we're tied.

525
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,422
- Okay, okay.
- Just one more and we win.

526
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,925
Are we… are we really going home?

527
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,469
[masked manager] Player 009.

[players cheer]

530
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,861
It's okay. She just voted the same way.

531
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,362
[masked manager] Player 007.

532
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:02,415
Ma'am, are you sure?
Your son's really gonna vote to go?

533
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:05,001
I'm telling you, I know my son.

534
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:07,754
My Yong-sik's a good person,
and he'll do the right thing.

535
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,881
- [beeps]
- [players cheer]

536
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:11,841
[Dae-ho] He did it! He changed his vote!

537
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:13,342
We're done! It's over!

538
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,180
Let's get outta here!

539
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:19,098
That's right, Yong-sik! That's my son!

540
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,852
- [masked manager] Player 006.
- That was it. He was the seventh one.

541
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,067
We're good now. They're both on our side.

542
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,152
We did it!

543
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,574
[dark music playing]

544
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:42,955
Hey, Gi-hun.

545
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:44,624
Huh?

546
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,626
I'm worried about Young-il.

547
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,171
Why?

548
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:54,467
During the game, we were paired together.

549
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,552
- [beeps]
- [players cheer]

550
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:15,154
That was great.
Nice work, you made the right choice!

551
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:18,032
- [players cheering]
- We got this! [laughs]

552
00:35:18,115 --> 00:35:20,993
[masked manager] And finally, Player 001.

553
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:22,703
Please cast your vote.

554
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:26,999
[intriguing music playing]

555
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,462
[Dae-ho] All right, Young-il.

556
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:32,880
You got this.

557
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:37,635
Hey, guys. I guess it's a 50/50 split.
A tie's better than nothing, right?

558
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,554
Right.

559
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:53,401
[Jung-bae] I don't know, but Young-il…
He scares me a little.

560
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,362
Why?

561
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,408
[Jung-bae] It… it's just that he…

562
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,285
I'm not sure how to bring this up,

563
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:06,330
but during the game,
when we were in our room together…

564
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:09,500
- I saw him mur-- [gasps]
- [beeps]

565
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,127
[players cheer]

566
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,212
[players sigh, laugh in relief]

00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,013
[sighs]

568
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:26,142
We did it. We're good.
It's a tie, we're okay!

569
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:29,478
[masked manager] The final player has made
their choice, and the vote is now over.

570
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:31,606
All right, fine, we wound up with a tie.

571
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,733
So what the hell happens now?

572
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:36,152
Clause three of the consent form:

573
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:40,448
Should the initial vote result in a tie,
the players will vote again.

574
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:44,368
Hold on. When's the next vote?
How long do we have to wait?

575
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:47,830
To ensure you have enough time
to properly consider your options,

576
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:50,041
the second vote
will be conducted tomorrow.

577
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:54,795
Until then, please take this opportunity
to think carefully about your future.

578
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,881
[players murmuring]

[body thuds]

581
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:27,119
Listen, boys,
don't you think we should return to land?

582
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,496
Isn't this game gonna be over

583
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,414
if we don't find that island
in a few days?

584
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:34,085
Yeah, but hold on.
Just look at him. He needs a doctor.

585
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,004
How're you doing?
You can push through it, right?

586
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,382
Yes, sir. Can't complain.

587
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:40,967
The bleeding stopped,

588
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,052
and I stitched him up,
so he should be good.

589
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:45,429
Okay, but even so,
one of your men just died.

590
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:46,806
[Kim] Let's keep searching.

591
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:51,185
He's never gonna rest in peace
until we kill the bastards who did this.

592
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:52,311
But just think.

593
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,689
If these traps were set up for us already,

594
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:57,066
then they know where we are
and where we're going.

595
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:58,192
[Jun-ho sighs]

596
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:02,238
We use a new radio frequency every day
from now on.

597
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,323
Cell phone use is completely banned.

598
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:05,950
Is that clear?

599
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,118
- Got it.
- Yes, sir.

600
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,161
Can you radio the other boat?

601
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,261
What were you trying
to tell me about before?

602
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:26,345
[Jung-bae] Hmm?

603
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,472
You know, about Young-il.

604
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,474
During the game earlier.

605
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:36,564
- [In-ho] Here, you want some of mine too?
- [Dae-ho] Thanks. I'm okay.

606
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:39,692
- [Jung-bae sighs]
- Not bad, right? They're decent, for once.

607
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:41,694
Nothing. It's not him, it's just…

608
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:42,820
It's all of this.

609
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,865
We gotta get out as soon as we can.

610
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:48,284
If I stay any longer,
I'll start losing it too.

611
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:54,999
[Dae-ho] You know, Young-il,

612
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:57,001
I gotta be honest with you.

613
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,337
I thought for a second there,
you'd vote like the first time.

614
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:04,050
Ah, I got so anxious when you went up,
I couldn't watch anymore. [chuckles]

615
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:06,802
'Cause earlier, Jung-bae kept trying
to tell us this weird story--

616
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,387
Hey, come on, eat your food.

617
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:09,513
Aren't you hungry?

618
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,769
Young-il, thank you, man.
You gave us all another chance.

619
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,480
I just wanted to save my own ass,
don't thank me.

620
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:22,735
And anyway,
there's enough money in there now.

621
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:24,487
So I should get out.

622
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,614
While I can.

623
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:31,494
But when we vote tomorrow,

624
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:33,913
do we really think we'll win?

625
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,540
I mean, there's no other choice.

626
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,460
Like Gi-hun was saying earlier,

627
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,754
we should try to convince them.

628
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:45,174
See if we can get
a few of them to change sides,

629
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:46,842
before they call the next vote.

630
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,096
Do you think we can?
Look at them over there.

631
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,640
You know they've gone
completely crazy with greed.

632
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:55,017
[sighs] Here's how I see it.
We have the advantage.

633
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:58,020
We've only had
these <i>gimbap</i> rolls to eat today.

634
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,606
Everyone will be hungry
when they wake up tomorrow.

635
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:03,400
And when you're hungry,
it makes you feel homesick.

636
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,486
That means everyone will want to leave.

637
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:08,697
Hey, guys!

638
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:13,119
Are you really gonna sit over there
eating this dry <i>gimbap?</i>

639
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:16,205
I just need one person to walk over here

640
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:19,875
so that tomorrow morning
we can get the heck out of here

641
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,419
- and all go out for Hanwoo beef.
- [Geum-ja laughs]

642
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:25,005
And what the hell,
I'll cover everyone's meals!

643
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,758
And we'll order <i>naengmyeon</i> too.
Dessert's on me.

644
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,260
Come on, just one of you guys!

645
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:30,803
- We won't bite!
- [players shouting]

646
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:33,889
Once you bastards
all kick the bucket in the next game,

647
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:37,268
we can leave this place
with 800 million each.

648
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,853
With that kind of money,

649
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:42,231
I'll just head to a Hanwoo ranch
and offer to buy it!

650
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:44,316
- [laughter]
- Over here!

651
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,361
- That's right! Come on, guys!
- [Jeong-dae] Come with us.

652
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:49,738
800? Bullshit. You're lying to yourselves.

653
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:52,491
You guys really believe
you'll survive the next one?

654
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:55,327
If we don't stop now,
then everyone over there's gonna die!

655
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,663
Okay, so let's stay
and test that theory out.

656
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,915
See which side loses more.

657
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,459
Instead of just running away
like some fucking wussie.

658
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:06,338
[chuckles] What'd you say? Huh?
What'd you call me?

659
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,299
- Hey, wait.
- Hey, dipshit, say that again.

660
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,925
- Come on.
- [Dae-ho] I'll fuck you up.

661
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,969
- [Jung-bae] Don't threaten civilians.
- Go on.

662
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:16,182
Look, dumbass, I was a fuckin' Marine!

663
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,392
[players laugh mockingly]

664
00:41:18,475 --> 00:41:20,269
Oh, yeah? Okay, well, if you're a Marine,

665
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:22,271
then I'm fucking Special Forces,
you lying shit.

666
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:23,480
You really wanna go there?

667
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:26,233
If you wanna leave so bad,
why stuff your faces with <i>gimbap,</i> huh?

668
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,485
- It'll be quicker if you starve!
- Greedy motherfuckers.

669
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:29,653
[Yeong-sam] Oh, yeah?

670
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,739
[players shouting angrily]

671
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,622
[Yeong-sam]
Thought you guys were soldiers.

672
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:41,707
[shouting continues]

673
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:52,134
[dark music playing]

674
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:01,894
[Thanos] <i>Min-su.</i>

675
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,230
I know you're mad at me, dude.

676
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,357
I'm sorry, boy!

677
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,318
You still shouldn't have betrayed us.

678
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:11,528
That shit really hurt my fuckin' feelings.

679
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,614
- Open the door!
- [grunts] Hey, Min-su.

680
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,325
You said you got scammed
out of your place, right?

681
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:18,869
- You got nowhere to go out there, bro.
- Min-su, open the door!

682
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,955
[Nam-gyu] So come on, dude.
Just one more game.

683
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:24,041
And I promise you, man,
we're gonna keep you safe. Hmm?

684
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:27,461
When we vote tomorrow, you're gonna
press "O," Min-su. Yo, come on!

685
00:42:27,544 --> 00:42:30,839
Whoa, boy. Sit the fuck down.

686
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:33,509
Look, Min-su.

687
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:39,098
Before I got here, things were so rough,
I was gonna jump off the Han River Bridge.

688
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:40,933
Actually, I was there

689
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:44,937
when this man wearing a suit
gave me a business card.

690
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,064
You must have got one too.

691
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,691
Yeah.

692
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,360
Now, I'm not religious or anything, but…

693
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:52,361
How should I put this?

694
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:56,490
It felt like divine intervention.

695
00:42:57,074 --> 00:43:00,369
Like the universe
was giving me a second chance, man.

696
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:03,289
That's when I decided
I was gonna turn my whole life around,

697
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,707
make my mom proud.

698
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:07,501
The thing is,
when someone gets in the way of that,

699
00:43:07,584 --> 00:43:10,004
I don't mean to, but I lose my shit!

700
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:12,131
I'm so fucking angry, man!

701
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:13,590
[Myung-gi] Leave him alone.

702
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,558
Hey. The fuck you doing? Get lost.

703
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:24,560
You want him to switch.

704
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:28,188
Yo, Myung-gi,
who do you think you are, huh?

705
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,024
The National Election Commission?

706
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,066
MG Coin.

707
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:33,902
You're still on my shitlist.

708
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:37,114
So why don't you just take a piss
and get the fuck out of here?

709
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,075
"X"s, over here!

710
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:43,662
These two were just threatening one of us
a second ago!

711
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:46,415
They're pressuring someone to change sides
so they'll win the vote.

712
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:47,833
[Player 047] Is that true?

713
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:51,295
- Hey. What the fuck, man? That's cheating.
- [others murmuring]

714
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:55,382
Whoa, hey. You immature little dipshits,
who taught you that kinda shit was okay?

715
00:43:56,258 --> 00:44:00,679
Hey! Hey! Listen up, "O" Gang!

716
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:03,098
These "X"s over here
tried to fucking attack us!

717
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:04,016
"O"s, come on!

718
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:06,143
What's that all about?
Why you trying to start shit?

719
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:08,354
Quiet, the adults are talking.

720
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,898
You "X"s are all wimpy-ass little shits.

721
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:12,608
Piss your pants and fuck off.

722
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:14,276
We went already, you dumbass.

723
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:16,987
Min-su, wait.

724
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:20,866
MG Coin.

725
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:22,951
You tripping, dude?

726
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,622
Earth to Myung-gi. Hello?

727
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:28,374
[Nam-gyu] It's 'cause of that girl, dude.

728
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:30,959
Remember earlier today,
that bitch we saw talking to him?

729
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:33,545
You know,
the one we thought he was kind of with?

730
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:35,756
Ah.

731
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,342
You sly dog. You were trying
to get some action, weren't you?

732
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:42,012
[Nam-gyu] You know, I started watching her
a little bit more after that.

733
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:45,682
And I noticed she was walking kinda funny.
[laughs] Her belly was--

734
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:48,227
Listen, you fucking assholes,
you leave her alone!

735
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,856
What's up?
We must have really hit a nerve.

736
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,316
Oh, for sure, dude.

737
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:57,069
- MG Coin…
- [Nam-gyu] Something's going on.

738
00:44:57,152 --> 00:45:00,489
if you press "X" one more time,
I swear to fucking God,

739
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:03,325
I'll cut off
one of your sticky little fingers,

740
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,077
give it to that bitch of yours…

741
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,913
[whispering]
…and then make her my bitch.

742
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:10,499
She will love it.

743
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:12,418
- You fucking asshole!
- [players gasp]

744
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:14,878
[players exclaim]

745
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,713
[shouting angrily]

746
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:18,799
[intense music playing]

747
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,360
It's all mine!

748
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:42,156
Your money! Your girl! Your fucking life!

749
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:46,452
- It's all Thanos's property now!
- [straining]

750
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:53,292
You fucking son of a goddamn
motherfucking bitch!

751
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:02,843
- [stabbing]
- [music stops]

752
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:07,764
[intense music playing]

753
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:13,687
[closing theme music playing]
