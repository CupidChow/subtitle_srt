1
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,480
You are such a despicable guy.

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,150
Why are you always provoking me?

3
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:15,080
Why did my mother want to raise someone like you?

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,120
In the future, don't provoke me if you don't have the confidence.

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,950
I thought you two reconciled.
Friends shouldn't be fighting.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,420
Why should I reconcile with that kind of guy?

7
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,760
Are you alright?

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,830
What are you doing?
Why do you always provoke Hyeon Seok?

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,500
If you do not provoke him first...

10
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,210
Son. 
Between family members..

11
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:49,520
No matter what happens,
we cannot give up on each other.

12
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,890
Honey!!

13
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,500
Mother said

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,840
that no matter what happens,
we cannot give up on our family members.

15
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,080
But at that moment, I realized that

16
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,910
sometimes we need to let go

17
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,080
so we can hold tighter.

18
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,760
Year 1995

19
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,680
The sound really resonates.

20
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,020
This is the result from drinking this medicine.

21
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,220
Granny, I kept a specially good one.

22
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,460
Give this drink to grandpa.

23
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,130
Yes, that's right.
We have to work in order to live.

24
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,000
It is good. Everyone please buy.

25
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,610
The medicine is unequally good.

26
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,610
A person's talent is a person's talent.

27
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,620
If not, how can he sing so well like this?!

28
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,290
Yes, that's right.

29
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,730
Everyone come and buy.

30
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,740
You don't have to fetch him personally.

31
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,410
He is my father.

32
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,410
If you can't handle it anymore, come look for me.

33
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,080
I have no problem feeding the three of us.

34
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,090
I really don't know how my father
can have such a good friend like you.

35
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,760
This kid.
You really can talk well.

36
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,760
The train will leave.
Hurry.

37
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,390
How many times do you want to eat tofu?

38
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,690
When will you come to your senses?

39
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,700
You should feed me properly.
It's embarrassing.

40
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,860
What did you do right that I should feed you properly?

41
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,200
If I have to feed you tofu again

42
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:04,040
that will be the end of our relationship.

43
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,380
This kid.
How can you talk like that to your father?

44
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,380
When you become a good father..

45
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:55,120
Say hello.
She will be your mother from now on.

46
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,800
This kid.
He might have thought you're a goddess.

47
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,640
I am Jin Sun Hye.

48
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,640
I'll be your mother from now on.

49
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:15,640
How is it?
Are you satisfied?

50
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,150
Are you not satisfied? She's asking you.

51
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,980
He is still flustered.
Don't yell at him.

52
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,660
We should get along now.

53
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:52,510
That day.
I saw an angel for the first time.

54
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,530
This.
He will now be your father.

55
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,660
He will be your brother.
Isn't he handsome?

56
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,310
Omma, aren't you too much?

57
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,510
We already disagreed.

58
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,340
Yet you still do this.

59
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,850
I can choose who I want to be as my husband.

60
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,020
But that's too much.

61
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,250
But isn't this too much? Our father is much more handsome.

62
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,590
Look at them!
They look like beggars!

63
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,590
They will look good if they wash up.

64
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,430
Washing up is not enough.

65
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:39,760
He is not a doctor.

66
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,430
Who said that my husband has to be a doctor?

67
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,260
At one look, we know that they are not good.

68
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,600
Why are you still marrying him?

69
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:49,270
Because I love him. Will it do?

70
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,610
Go. Take a shower.
You should wash up and get cleaned.

71
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,950
Tomorrow, we are going to register our marriage and have a photo as well.

72
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,620
How? How did you

73
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,290
find that kind of woman even though you were in prison?

74
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,630
You must have a secret.

75
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,300
You marry because of love.

76
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,470
I'm asking you

77
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:22,800
how did you made her fall in love when you were in prison?

78
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,140
There is this one word.

79
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,310
One word?

80
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,140
You say we are important

81
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,140
If we really are

82
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,980
you shouldn't be marrying that kind of man.

83
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,150
Soon you will understand

84
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,490
why I married him.

85
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,990
He will surely treat you like he is your real father.

86
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,830
So I married him.

87
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,990
I do not want to be a son to that kind of man.

88
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,500
I only want you to be happy.

89
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,830
I think that in this way we will become happier.

90
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,500
Please trust me, okay?

91
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:02,010
Go on. What one word is it?

92
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:06,850
What is the reason why that woman agreed to marry you?

93
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,680
It is fate.

94
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,860
Ah really. You.
What fate?

95
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:20,360
Father.
Did you lie again?

96
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:21,860
Are you going to cheat her?

97
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,360
Telling her that after selling a 1O billion land

98
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,370
we will be able to enjoy life?
Am I right?

99
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,200
Right?

100
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:29,700
You think she is so foolish she will let me cheat her?!

101
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,370
I don't think so.

102
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,210
And what you said also doesn't make sense.

103
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,550
I still can't believe that that woman will marry someone like you.

104
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:39,880
It's because of that word.

105
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,220
Love knows no boundaries.

106
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,550
Then you just overboard it.

107
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,720
I still can understand it.

108
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,720
What is it?

109
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:52,230
What happened?
Did you lie again?

110
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,890
Don't you think it's magic?

111
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,560
You have a mother plus a younger brother and sister.

112
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:02,070
It's a miracle. Isn't it?

113
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,080
My son who came from south to north.

114
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,250
The dialect has progressed.

115
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:17,420
How should we describe it?
Isn't this the most basic?

116
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,920
You and I still have the local accent.

117
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:26,930
So here. We must try to speak normally.

118
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:31,270
So this will be the price.

119
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,270
Don't you bathe in prison?

120
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,940
Look. It's all grey.

121
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,110
Look at this.
You also have some.

122
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:48,820
It hurts. It hurts. 
Drink this.

123
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,780
Ah. This kid.

124
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,990
Father said something.

125
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:56,690
Having a family is a miracle.

126
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,960
So I am determined

127
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,300
not to be chased out by them.

128
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:12,970
Who would have thought that our life would be like this?

129
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:17,480
We are staying in a house with a swing in the courtyard.

130
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,820
What are you two doing?

131
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,820
Hurry. Get off.

132
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,820
Our father made the swing.

133
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:28,990
Why are you playing with it?

134
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,830
Why are you playing in my dad's swing?

135
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,330
Sorry.
We will not do it again.

136
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:37,500
Don't touch anything that belongs to our dad.

137
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,500
Don't touch.
Do you understand?

138
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:45,510
Yes, yes. We won't.
We promise not to touch anything.

139
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,670
Come on let's go eat with mum.

140
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,680
That..
If you do not want to call me uncle,

141
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:56,520
Then, you just can call me "Hey!"

142
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,350
Hey.
I don't care what I call you.

143
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:04,690
That is also fine. 
Calling me "Hey" will do.

144
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:11,370
Then call me mugwort or wormwood.
Call me anything.

145
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,700
Why are you still not coming in?
The soup is turning cold.

146
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,870
Let's go.

147
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:25,050
Why are you checking it? Go inside. Quick.

148
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,350
I know

149
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,760
There are a lot of things I can't do in this house.

150
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:38,930
But I should not be chased out.

151
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:44,970
Therefore I must try to keep the promise of not touching anything to stay in this house.

152
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,780
What are you doing?

153
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,280
The wood is not properly placed.

154
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,950
I'm afraid it might hurt the kids.

155
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,450
What about you, Jeon su?

156
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,960
I feel like washing the window curtains.

157
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,790
I will do that.

158
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,790
I have nothing to do anyway.

159
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,460
You have night shift today?

160
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,960
Yeah.
I'll be back tomorrow morning.

161
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,630
This family has two reliable man.

162
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,300
My heart is at ease.

163
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,640
Omma! Omma!

164
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,310
Why? What's wrong? Cockroach?

165
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,310
The bathroom's drain got clogged.
It's because of Hey and this wormwood.

166
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,310
Hey and wormwood?

167
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:38,320
He bathed a while ago. Now it's clogged.

168
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,660
I thought I already cleared it up.

169
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,330
It's all mud.
You didn't rinse it with water.

170
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:51,000
I washed the window curtains that time. I'll give you a good dredge.
I'm sorry.

171
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:56,840
I'll go to work.
You all settle this.

172
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,180
How can you be like this?

173
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,510
Hope you can call us Hey and wormwood.

174
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,180
Mmm...

175
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,460
Why does mum work at night?

176
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,960
She already works 24 hours in the restaurant.

177
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:30,540
Your mother is a nurse.

178
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:35,710
What did you say to fool her?

179
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,710
She is a nurse.

180
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:41,050
How can a nurse marry a man like you?

181
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,720
A man with previous criminal records of fraud

182
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,220
Previous criminal records of fraud?!!

183
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,060
Our mother isn't crazy.

184
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,230
I'm really going insane.

185
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:02,240
This kid.
Be careful with your words.

186
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,570
They still have no good opinion of us.

187
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,410
Sorry.
Father.

188
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,750
Now I know

189
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,750
I must be careful with my mouth at home.

190
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,590
You need help?

191
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,590
Father

192
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,090
Please check if there's anything in need of repair.

193
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,590
I'll take care of it.

194
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,760
Alright.

195
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,090
There are so many things to be repaired.

196
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,260
Is it because this home lacks a man to take care of it?

197
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,100
Hey Gong Joon su

198
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,270
Why?

199
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,100
How come you are shy in front of your mother?

200
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,270
You didn't even dare to raise your head even once.

201
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,770
How can I?

202
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,810
Like father, like son.

203
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,310
You also steal a glance at your mother.

204
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,980
Talking nonsense?
When did I?

205
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,440
Excuse me, may I ask?

206
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:54,780
Do you know where Nurse Jin Sun Hye is working?

207
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,450
At the emergency room.

208
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,950
Thank you!

209
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,720
Mum doesn't just look like an angel.

210
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,030
She really is an angel.

211
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,200
Who are you?

212
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:59,380
That beautiful woman is my mother.

213
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:03,880
What? I don't care what's your relationship with her.

214
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,890
Hey! Go to your mother.

215
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:09,890
Tell her to give me pain reliever.

216
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,980
Don't you have anything to say to me?

217
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:43,190
What is this?

218
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,030
Where did you get this much?

219
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,370
The uncle I worked with gave that to me.

220
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,370
What did you do?

221
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,540
Sell medicine.

222
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,040
At every market fair.

223
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,540
What kind of medicine?

224
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,880
Every kind

225
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,280
There is also this medicine which enhances men's ability.

226
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,620
Where did you get them?

227
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,950
Uncle makes them.

228
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,790
That's not good.

229
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,460
Cheating rural people.

230
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,960
Is it bad?

231
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,300
Uncle said he puts things in that are good for the body.

232
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,000
No harm is done.

233
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,830
It's bad.

234
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,500
Is it?

235
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,840
But why are you giving me the money you earned?

236
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,350
I just want to give it to you.

237
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:47,250
I am grateful since you let us live together with you.

238
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,920
I do not know what I should give you.

239
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,260
So I'll just give you this.

240
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:59,470
Keep the money. Buy books and things you need in school.

241
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,170
For the wedding photoshoot tomorrow

242
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:09,210
Please use this money to buy father a nice suit.

243
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:16,120
This is the first time I've received money from a son.

244
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,450
It feels good.

245
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,790
I'll be going.

246
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:31,470
Gong Joon Su.
I'm very satisfied.

247
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:37,800
For giving me the money you earned.

248
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,980
See you tomorrow morning.

249
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:50,480
Be careful.
And that...

250
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:59,190
Why don't you ever call me mother?

251
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:06,700
Ahm. That.
I'm sorry.

252
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,880
I'm afraid that if I call you mother

253
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,650
This miracle will disappear.

254
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,620
So I don't dare call you mother.

255
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:22,980
Because I feel that only

256
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,850
when I stop selling those drugs,

257
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,690
that's when I'll deserve to call you mother.

258
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:52,810
Kids at the back, look at camera lens and smile.

259
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,990
Kids look at the camera.

260
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,990
They are just like that. Please go ahead.

261
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,830
Is that so?

262
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,830
Ok then. 1, 2

263
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:33,090
It doesn't taste good?
Let's get something else.

264
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,760
You want to eat sweet and sour pork?

265
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,590
Don't act like it's your money.

266
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,920
We're spending mum's money.

267
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:40,430
I'm just tolerating you.

268
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:43,600
We know this uncle has a criminal record.

269
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,110
So?

270
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:55,610
What so?
He has a previous criminal record.

271
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,610
If he is a doctor like our father,

272
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,450
then we will not be against it.

273
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,280
Our father earned a lot.

274
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:05,950
He also received an honor.

275
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,960
Your father was really very influential.

276
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,800
I chose him as your new father.

277
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,470
He saved me when we were young.

278
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,800
But that's not the reason why I love him.

279
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:23,470
And you listen properly.

280
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,310
My husband is your new dad.

281
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,140
Joon Su is also my son.

282
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,480
In the future, when you get married

283
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,150
I will not bother you.

284
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:36,980
I will unconditionally support you and you can marry whomever you love.

285
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,520
So you should also accept my choice.

286
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:44,860
This is not a request. This is an order.
Eat.

287
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,700
Eat like it's delicious.

288
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,550
That time I promised

289
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:08,550
that I will also find someone like mum.

290
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,050
I will love a woman with courage.

291
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,100
He's tall.

292
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,930
Introduce yourself.

293
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,110
Due to personal reasons, I am in 4th grade even though

294
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,940
I am already 13 years old.

295
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:38,280
I will study hard and be a good friend to everyone.

296
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,280
Do you have a poor eyesight?

297
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,450
No ma'am.

298
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:47,790
Then you just sit right next to Jin Joo.

299
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,990
In school, pretend that you don't know me, huh?

300
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,490
I will.

301
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,900
But the fact the we know each other

302
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,400
was soon discovered.

303
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:56,920
Your mother probably wouldn't hurt you.

304
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,440
Gong Joon Su!
You come here.

305
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,270
You are the biggest here yet you are the one who wants to escape.

306
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:25,620
My son, are you afraid that you want to escape?

307
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:29,120
At first, mum thought you to be brave. So it's not it.

308
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:35,130
You married again?

309
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,300
Yes, that's right teacher.

310
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:39,970
He is my eldest son. Please look after him.

311
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,800
Jin Joo!

312
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,990
Are you ashamed that mother remarried?

313
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,990
Mum, why do you only care about them?

314
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:02,490
You made a 13 year-old kid in 4th grade your son.

315
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,990
Is that something to be proud of?

316
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,830
I know you are hurt.

317
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:16,000
But how can I make you accept them?

318
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,170
Don't think that way.

319
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,670
Soon you have to rely to your father and older brother.

320
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,340
Do you know? He has a criminal record.

321
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,350
And that 13 year-old in 4th grade is his son.

322
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,850
How can I not be ashamed?

323
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,520
He is your husband.

324
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,520
You love him.
So you do not feel what I feel.

325
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,020
But everything matters to me.

326
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:42,730
Sorry.
I'm really sorry.

327
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,070
I also have no way out.

328
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,070
When I grow up, I won't fall in love with a person like him.

329
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,240
I will not get married nor have children.

330
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,590
I became aware that

331
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,750
maybe having a family is a miracle to us

332
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,920
but for JinJoo and Hyeon Seok,
it's hard for them to accept it.

333
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,260
That's why I understand

334
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:15,600
why they treat us like insects.

335
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,430
It's expected.

336
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,710
I already said I cannot.

337
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,280
Teacher.
I will never forget this favor.

338
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:37,780
So, please!

339
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,450
Teacher, please.

340
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:40,290
You have been arranged to attend my class.

341
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,460
How can I change it?

342
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,960
I am being cast out.

343
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:46,960
You are the biggest in your class.

344
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:49,130
Who will dare to provoke you?

345
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,470
Teacher, I only have a big frame.

346
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,470
But I am actually weak.

347
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,800
If you do not believe me, try hitting me.

348
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,470
Must you really be like this?

349
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,310
You see. I am weak.

350
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,520
I really am.

351
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,190
Teacher Kim

352
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,020
Is anything the matter?

353
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:22,360
This kid. He wants to change class.
He says he's being cast out.

354
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:24,360
But the truth is he is not.

355
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,370
Is that it?

356
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:34,370
Let's get rid of the formality.

357
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,340
Let's have a man to man talk.

358
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:42,850
If you don't want to say anything,
just return to your class now.

359
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,050
I feel sorry for JinJoo.

360
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,390
Who is JinJoo?

361
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,390
My sister.

362
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,560
Are you twins?

363
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,760
No, we're not.
I am 13 years old.
My sister is 11 years old.

364
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:55,100
Then how can you be in the same grade?

365
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,930
Because I quit school midway and came here.

366
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:05,010
I feel like you have a lot to say to me.

367
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,400
Your brother will transfer to another class?

368
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,900
Doesn't he want to be in this class?

369
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:38,410
You're not Kim Jin Joo anymore.
You're Gong Jin Joo now.

370
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:39,910
Classmates, from now on

371
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:44,750
we will not call her Kim Jin Joo.
Instead we will now call her Gong Jin Joo.

372
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,560
The x-ray showed nothing serious.

373
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:02,060
But if his head aches or if he feels dizzy,

374
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,400
immediately come to the hospital.

375
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,560
Ne.

376
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,900
We are really sorry.

377
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,570
My child also had done wrong.

378
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:13,070
Things like this cannot be avoided between children.

379
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:16,740
Thank you for your understanding.

380
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:20,750
But this is really a problem.

381
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,750
My friend also plans to remarry.

382
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:27,120
Right now she is looking for guys with the same surname as her former husband.

383
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,290
Yes, right.

384
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,960
JinJoo's mum

385
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:36,630
You should also consider the kids.
Is that right?

386
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:44,640
How could she consider that a problem?

387
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:47,810
Sorry.
I didn't find a husband with Kim as his surname.

388
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,480
Mum, you really feel sorry?

389
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,310
In fact, I really think there is nothing to be sorry about.

390
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:55,820
Honey.

391
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:02,990
Omo! Doesn't this take a few days to prepare?

392
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,660
You opened earlier.

393
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:07,660
Although this is the first time to do it, it's not that bad.

394
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:12,330
You. Is that how you evaluate your father, huh?

395
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:15,000
Delicious.

396
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:16,670
Try one. It's delicious.

397
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,840
You really are something.

398
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:21,170
Eat first before you go.

399
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,840
Don't worry about her.

400
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,510
She will meet people like her.

401
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,510
She has to experience hardship to understand.

402
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,020
You have strong words.

403
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,680
You think so?

404
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:33,520
As a mother, I am not too emotional.

405
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:36,190
That's why she's with someone like me.

406
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,030
Bingo!

407
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:44,700
You just should have hit his head softly.

408
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,530
I also felt very wronged.

409
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:52,040
A lot of people also call me Gong Hyeon Seok.
Gong Hyeon Seok.

410
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:54,540
Might as well die and forget it.

411
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:56,540
Like this, mum will regret it.

412
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:59,550
You should not let trash be brought home.

413
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,720
Noona, if you die, what will I do?

414
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,890
I'll die with you. I'm scared.

415
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,720
You sit down. I'll push.

416
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:19,230
I will certainly not become like mum.

417
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,240
I will surely become like dad.

418
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,930
Don't laugh.

419
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,440
He sure can act.

420
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,780
I want to watch, noona.

421
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,440
You wanna die?

422
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:18,960
He laughed. My younger brother laughed.
He laughed.

423
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:22,800
My younger brother laughed because of me.

424
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,150
Here it is.
Thank you.

425
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,150
Please come again.

426
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,150
This the first day. Business is not bad.

427
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,660
You go inside and rest.
You still have night shift.

428
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,160
Don't you know?
I'm like the other people.

429
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:53,490
I don't feel tired if I have to earn.

430
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:57,000
And you married an average man.

431
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,170
We are destined.

432
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,010
My stomach.
Stomach.

433
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,350
Save me.
I have to live.

434
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:17,680
I have a son. He can't live without me.

435
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:20,850
My stomach.

436
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:23,190
That's why we came here.

437
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,690
Doctor save me!

438
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,360
I'm not doctor.

439
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,530
Doctor, save me!
I have a son.

440
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,870
I am nurse. The doctor will be here any moment from now.

441
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,870
Save me.
Save me.

442
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,540
I have a son.

443
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:48,380
I ask you to please calm down.
The doctor will be here.

444
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:51,390
Someone please save me.

445
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:54,220
Sang Man oppa?!

446
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:58,590
Save me.
Doctor!

447
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:10,100
I am ashamed to meet you like this.

448
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,810
What have you done that you're in prison?

449
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,650
I committed something.

450
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,320
Fraud.

451
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:25,150
You always blush when you lie.

452
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:29,190
My face thickened through the years.

453
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,860
Is it because of me?

454
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,860
What are you saying?

455
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,560
It is not because of you that I live this way.

456
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:41,230
That time..
If you did not come..

457
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:48,880
Even if it didn't happen, you and I,
we still can't be married.

458
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:52,380
I am an orphan. I wander anywhere.

459
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:55,550
Your parents cannot let you marry me.

460
00:36:56,550 --> 00:37:00,750
Right. And I also have to look after their health.

461
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,290
Several years ago, dad passed away due to cerebral hemorrhage.

462
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:08,730
Not one year after, mum also passed away because of heart paralysis.

463
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,400
Is that it?

464
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:18,740
You should have gotten married, right?

465
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,910
We parted.

466
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:24,480
What happened?

467
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:26,910
He is an upright doctor.

468
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:29,180
We were to open a clinic in a village without doctors.

469
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,320
We found happiness there.

470
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:32,320
But a typhoon came

471
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:36,990
He died saving the people of the village.

472
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,630
Oppa

473
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,300
Huh?

474
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,640
If not because of me,

475
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:55,780
perhaps you wouldn't become like this, right?

476
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,810
If you didn't

477
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:03,150
try to stop those thugs, I couldn't have escaped.

478
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,990
I am tired.

479
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,820
I am going in to sleep now.

480
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:15,800
Oppa, do you know?

481
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:23,640
You are my first love.

482
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:44,890
Next Episode Preview.

483
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:54,900
My first love will become my final spouse.

484
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,070
Isn't this fate too?

485
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,240
Why did you marry a man like me?

486
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:03,240
Son, you know mum loves you very much right?

487
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:06,950
I don't need it at all.

488
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:10,120
I don't expect them to accept me as their brother.

489
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,290
I only hope that they will not hate me.

490
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:14,620
Hyeon Seok.

491
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:16,460
Hyung!

492
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:19,630
If you again dare to threaten my younger brother, you'll be doomed.
Get it?
