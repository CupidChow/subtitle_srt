1
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,180
Say hello.
She will be your mother from now on.

2
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,580
I am Jin Sun Hye.
Are you satisfied with me?

3
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,980
Regarding my father's things,
don't touch them.

4
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,680
Don't touch.
Do you understand.

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,380
What did you say to fool her?

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,970
Ajumma is a nurse.
How can she marry a man like you?

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,010
We are destined by fate

8
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:33,280
Save me.
I have a son.

9
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,320
Sang Man Oppa.

10
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,340
What?

11
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:37,870
If it wasn't me

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,740
perhaps you wouldn't become like this, right?

13
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,120
I have to go inside to sleep early

14
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,500
Oppa.
Do you know?

15
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,580
You're my first love.

16
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,230
Where's the patient?

17
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,780
Afternoon i leave the hospital

18
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,050
Sun Hye.
Why are you here?

19
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,450
You hurry up.
Is this not the place you should to come

20
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,340
Sit down please

21
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,890
Shit what is it?
You should go now.

22
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,270

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,520
You hurry finish  this things. And just go

24
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,070
I thinking about thath

25
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,320
I have always received blessings from you.

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,760
Once you get up early morning, go eat  fresh  strawberrys.

27
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,990
Put thath on my window and could go

28
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:04,750
On rainy days, you would get soaked to bring me an umbrella.

29
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,960
At the hospital, it was also like this.

30
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,360
What is that? It's just yogurt.

31
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,930
So hurry up and go.
Go.

32
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,310
So.
Starting from now on ...

33
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,880
I feel that it is time for me to treat you well.

34
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,260
What?

35
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,530
First love to becoming the final lover

36
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,740
Isn't it not also fate?

37
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,140
What?

38
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,750
I'm washing clothes.

39
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:24,310
Leave the washing to the washer.
Why do you hand wash every time?

40
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,200
Hand washing is cleaner.

41
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,110
You did not come into this family as a housewife.

42
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,170
I'm interested in doing these things.

43
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,210
Ok, my eldest son

44
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,930
Enjoy doing what interests you.

45
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,930
Older brother is doing all the household chores.

46
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,120
Don't you feel sorry to him.

47
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,500
He is willingly do it himself.

48
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,770
Gong Jin Joo.

49
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,360
Mom, 
Must you call me that way?

50
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,060
I am already confused

51
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,760
You are still acting this way.

52
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,290
I'm sorry.

53
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,140
I am older now.

54
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,520
So you best not provoke me.

55
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:26,360
I think this is menopause.

56
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:32,310
Medicine efficiency is  extremely good.
A little child will be energetic.
Sir come over.

57
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,220
After that what's next?

58
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,280
I am now memorizing the multiplication law.

59
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,300
Did I say anything?

60
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,830
I really am memorizing the law.

61
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,890
I thought you have done so already.
Have you forgotten?

62
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,780
Have you forgotten?

63
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:51,860
I have forgotten a bit.

64
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,940
What happened?
Come out and eat.

65
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,870
Medicine efficency is extremely good.

66
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,390
Mother.

67
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,410
What's wrong?

68
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,280
Mother.
What exactly are you good at?

69
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,510
You also choose a bad husband with bad behavior.

70
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,700
Your cooking also does not taste good.

71
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,230
Why do you make me eat this?

72
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,270
Haven't you always been eating my food

73
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,140
Why do you suddenly so picky?

74
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,180
Didn't I tell you I have grown up?

75
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,400
What's the name of the soup today?

76
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:28,930
Kimchi soup.

77
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,670
Kimchi soup but there is no kimchi in it.
This is not right.

78
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,920
Oh right.
I knew I forgot something.

79
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:43,380
Respected ladyies and gentleman.
Please wait a moment....

80
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,240
Here.

81
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:25,200
Starting from today you
should be be called Gong Jang Guem.

82
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,470
The two of you are not like me.
If it's tasty, you should give praise.

83
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,170
If it is delicious just say it's delicious.

84
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,550
Say that it is tasty.
Then the chef will be happy.

85
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,930
You can now take this as your hobby.

86
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,140
Fine.
Fine.

87
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:42,200
Both of you really know how to order people around.

88
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:46,960
Oh right.
Hyeon Seok and I have something to ask you.

89
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,660
What is it?

90
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,530
If it is regarding divorce,
Then don't say anymore.

91
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,060
You're our mother, but we still dont know you.

92
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,420
Then what is it?
Tell me.

93
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,460
Let us transfer to another school.

94
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,010
Transfer schools?

95
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,200
Then we can start using the new surname.

96
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,750
Gong Jin Ju with Gong Hyeon Seok in the new environment.

97
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,830
Hey.
Even if you dream, Do not think of following us to our new school.

98
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,680
The two of us has a difference of 2 years old.

99
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,210
Still studying together.
I Think that is already enough.

100
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,270
Yes, that's right.
Yes, that's right.
I absolutely will not follow you over.

101
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,480
If you transfer schools.

102
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,370
Then you have to take a bus to the new school. 
Are you alright with that?

103
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:19,940
For a inconsiderate mother.
you do have lots of worries.

104
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:22,830
Here you go.

105
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:23,680
Thank you for your hard work.

106
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,380
Welcome and come again.

107
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,160
Stop selling and just go home.

108
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,690
At this time there are a lot of people drinking alcohol,

109
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,900
Who will come and buy goldfish cake.

110
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,450
It's only your first day.
Wouldn't it be too difficult for you?

111
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,150
My wife is busy during the daytime and evening time.

112
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,020
You work hard.

113
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,100
You want to earn a lot of money.
I too will earn a lot of money.
Work hard.

114
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,630
You too, work hard.

115
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:24,710
Medicine efficiency is extremely good.

116
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,910
There shouldn't be any people around now.

117
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:57,520
It's my first day and my small bag is already full.

118
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,920
Looks like Sun Hye sure is my treasure.

119
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,020
Business seems to be doing ok.

120
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,210
Oh yes, it seems so.

121
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,910
How much do you want?

122
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,290
What do you mean how much?
Shouldn't you give me what is right?

123
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,140
What?

124
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:17,920
You are here.
Don't you know people fear me here.
Uncle.

125
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,110
Yes?

126
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,300
Generally, I would say it to this extent.

127
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,000
Basically you should be able to understand.

128
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,530
What are you saying?

129
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:27,270
Aigoo.
Really.

130
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,240
You need to pay your taxes.
Pay your taxes.

131
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,280
You are doing business at other people's domain.

132
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,660
Just pay your taxes.

133
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,210
I confirmed before that over here you can set up a street stall.

134
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,400
That is why I started this?

135
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,270
You should really listen to the understand my words.

136
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,310
You thought that nobody manages here .

137
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,010
Then you are with left people like us

138
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,050
What do we rely on for our survival?

139
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:05,180
My younger brother is super.

140
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:25,580
You cannot take this.
Don't take.

141
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,300
This punk.
Really let us use a lot of effort.

142
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,210
Next time.
Pay up first.

143
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:36,290
Then  you can start your business here.
Let's go.

144
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:49,890
Father.
Father.
Father.
Father.

145
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:03,150
Father.
Father.

146
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:13,520
Let's not go to your mother's hospital.
I am ashamed.

147
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,750
Our money are all taken.

148
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,960
Where else can we go?

149
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,550
Then son.

150
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,420
What?

151
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,990
shall we?

152
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,540
Shall we say there are 17 gangsters instead of 3?

153
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,240
If there are 17 of them.

154
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,620
You will be dead by now.

155
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,660
Then how about 10?

156
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,700
I feel really embarrassed.

157
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,740
Be it 10 gangsters or 17 gangsters.

158
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,460
The truth is there were 3 of them who beat you up like this.

159
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,670
Then can you consider my pride?

160
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,920
Your mother.
She thinks that I can fight very well.

161
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:54,160
Father.
so you will tell lies.

162
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,690
And boast again?

163
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,560
Not really

164
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,450
It is not like that.

165
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,680
1 vs 7.

166
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,060
Do you have to be like this?

167
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,760
Then just 7 individuals.

168
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:13,710
I fought all of them together.
Eventually because of one person.

169
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,090
Hit the back of the head.
I Fainted.

170
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,810
Then I  became like this.
Do you understand.

171
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,680
How come you are a swindler?

172
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,890
You should be an actor.

173
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:26,800
Please son.
Let me look chivalrous.

174
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:30,710
With your face like that.
How can you look chivalrous?

175
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:39,890
Nothing serious.
That is lucky.

176
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:44,140
Actually.
I could win.

177
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:47,030
but I have to fight against 7 people.

178
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,090
They have an organization.
Are they professional fighters?

179
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,320
Yes, that is right.

180
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,530
So you're telling me they are 7 professional fighters? 
More like a few street gangsters right?

181
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,570
From the Looks of the fish cakes stall.

182
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,460
They should at most be considered to be small street thugs.

183
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,180
Son.
you saw right?
Tell Your mom.

184
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:08,790
Father.
Fought against 7 people.

185
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:15,760
He was attacked from his back and hit on the head.

186
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,460
or else Father would have won.

187
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:20,010
Before it happened. 
It was really a close fight.

188
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:25,110
Father.
used all sorts of styles.
Almost won.

189
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,300
Just at that moment.

190
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,660
They felt that they were unable to defeat father.

191
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:30,550
So went again to call more people.

192
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,030
Husband.
Did you learn martial arts too?

193
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,770
Who says you need to learn martial arts to be able to fight?

194
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:46,190
I am a naturally gifted gighter.

195
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,910
You mean fighter right?

196
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:53,840
Oh yeah.
Right.

197
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:06,080
Exactly how many people are there?

198
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:11,860
Stop lying.
Just one or two people, right?

199
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,900
No.
3 people.

200
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:19,510
So, you two made up all these details and stories on the way here?

201
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,040
Yes, that is right.

202
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,590
He always getting beaten up.

203
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,480
Please do not tell father.

204
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:29,540
On the way coming here.
Making all those up.

205
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,070
I know.

206
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:35,150
What a good pair of father and son.

207
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:36,510
Go back.

208
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:39,740
There is nothing you can do here. 
I will stay with dad.

209
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,120
You will be in charge of your Brother and sister breakfast tomorrow. Ok?

210
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:43,820
Ok.
Don't worry.

211
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,730
Be careful.

212
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,570
My eldest son.
Do you know I especially love you, right?

213
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,240
Son.

214
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,360
I am all right.

215
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,680
I see the leader.

216
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:33,290
I gave him a roundhouse kick.
He was dazed for a moment.

217
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,840
Then at your old age, you can still scare the greatest enemy.

218
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,880
That's true.

219
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:39,580
How could he have known?

220
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:44,510
That a person selling goldfish cake would be such an expert.

221
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,380
In other words.

222
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,760
He sees you as an easy person to bully and creates trouble for you.

223
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:51,310
So today they beat you up like that.

224
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,350
Setting up the street stall again tomorrow, will you be all right?

225
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,070
Will they come and provoke you?

226
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,940
No, they won't.

227
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,980
Not sure if there will only be 7 guys this time.

228
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:03,210
They might bring 17 more guys over.

229
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:10,520
Also cannot let you hurt self asteem.
At there do business.

230
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:11,880
How could I do that?

231
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,430
Although hurt self asteem.

232
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,300
But.
Stay out of a round flat cake a round flat cake is not because of afraid.

233
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,340
Is because despise dirty.

234
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:20,890
Have need me do it matter.

235
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,930
Tonight don't have emergency patient come in.

236
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,160
You just properly accompany your husband.

237
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:33,130
Still have people by my fists hit until fly.

238
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:37,720
Tonight why don't have emergency patient come in?

239
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,740
What are you saying?

240
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,330
I say they probably have to at emergency room accept treatment.

241
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,030
Of course!

242
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:49,450
I already like this.
They be worst off.

243
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,040
Don't you dare look down on me.

244
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:09,510
Never do anything special.
You all sit down and eat.

245
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,460
All of you don't have to treat me as older brother.

246
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,990
Treat me as housewife.

247
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,220
Like this there will be no problem.
Isn't it.

248
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,770
I'm also think so.
Eonni.

249
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:44,190
We are eating foods housewives made.

250
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,520
Starting from now.
You do it food.

251
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,220
Don't let mother do anymore.

252
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:56,940
Fine.
Eat some more.

253
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,300
Mother must do.
You also must certainly stop.

254
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,150
Do you understand.

255
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,190
Yes... Yes...

256
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:02,890
And.

257
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,440
So we become closer.
Do you understand.

258
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:06,970
Of course!

259
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:12,410
Housewife.

260
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,810

00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,640
Mother for a while will be back.

264
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,630
Older sister.

265
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,820
What's wrong?

266
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,010
That...

267
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,370

You surely never put correctly.

332
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,710
Otherwise, smell surely is the same.

333
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:03,450
Where did you learn prepare a meal the?

334
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,980

I big son met a that kind of the father.
Very hard work.

339
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:53,260
Why mother compared to us is more like Oi?

340
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,620
What's wrong?

341
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:57,850
Mother at kitchen embrace Oi.

342
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,270
Is that the truth?

343
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,990
Mother compared to us is more like Oi.

344
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,350
That's right.

345
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,050
You really are an idiot.

346
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,410
Just because he is outsider.

347
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,600
So mother then treat him better.

348
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,130
We are mother real children.

349
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,000
So treat us very casual.

350
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:16,040
After you grown up, you will know.

351
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:19,100
Mother will not anything for Oi do it.

352
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:21,990
So.
Oi.
Forever is a outsider.

353
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,690
