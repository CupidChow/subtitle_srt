1
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:50,958
I had sleep paralysis last night.

2
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:58,333
- Min Joon, could you take a photo for us?
- Please?

3
00:02:58,416 --> 00:02:59,375
Sure.

4
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:01,750
- Count, please.
- One, two…

5
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,250
I think you should take
the ghost masks off first.

6
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:08,541
You…

7
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,541
- Min Joon.
- Min Joon!

8
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,541
Only First wore it. I didn't.

9
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:13,583
Balloon!

10
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,166
- Just a moment, it's my mom.
- Sure.

11
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:19,833
Hey, take a photo for me.

12
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,458
Hello, Mom.

13
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,791
<i>Min Joon, don't forget to update me</i>

14
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,041
<i>about the chapel restoration.</i>

15
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,583
Okay, I'll do that
after I have a look around.

16
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:32,333
<i>My friends also want to know
how far it has progressed.</i>

17
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:34,500
- I'll see to that.
- <i>Okay.</i>

18
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:35,458
I got to go, Mom.

19
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:36,750
- <i>Love you.</i>
- I know.

20
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,041
Even dumber than me.

21
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,291
One, two, three… Got you!

22
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,291
First, Balloon,

23
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,875
I'll follow them to take more photos.

24
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:09,916
- Okay.
- All right.

25
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,791
Let's meet at the drink vendor.

26
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,166
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

27
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,041
Let's make a GIF photo.

28
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,041
GIF, right?

29
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,416
First, I can't get used
to the weather in Thailand.

30
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,666
Why is it so hot?

31
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,333
Thank you.

32
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,583
Only a camel can stand this weather.

33
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,916
You're so pretentious!

34
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,583
Were you conceived at the North Pole?

35
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,125
Stop complaining about the heat already.

36
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,833
What makes it worse is your costume.

37
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:31,875
Go get changed.

38
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,958
Yours is worse than mine actually.

39
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,750
Why? Python print is trendy.

40
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,583
Who chose your costume today?

41
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,083
Mom.

42
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,916
- Mom chose it for me.
- So you really go all out?

43
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,083
Yes, I go all out tonight.

44
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,083
Tiger?

45
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,833
Here, Auntie.

46
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,250
Welcome to our shop.

47
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:58,791
Here, Auntie.

48
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,208
Hey, she called you auntie.

49
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,458
She said you are old.

50
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:08,041
She said you have wrinkles on your face,

51
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,583
droopy eyelids, terrible nose shape.

52
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,250
You have hearing loss and your mouth…

53
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,541
Foul-mouthed?

54
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:18,500
It's so hot now.
Stop getting on my nerves.

55
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,208
And you. Stop rubbing it in.

56
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:23,750
Oh, more wrinkles now.

57
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:24,750
Hey.

58
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,916
- Where is my inhaler?
- Why should I have it?

59
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,125
Here, this inhaler

60
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:36,041
will freshen you up
like standing on the Everest.

61
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:44,583
Feeling hot?

62
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:48,541
You should use this handheld fan
so you don't tire yourself.

63
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,208
- So caring.
- So caring.

64
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,791
Oops, sister.

65
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,291
When it's hot like this,

66
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:01,541
it makes your pretty face oily.

67
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:05,500
Use this blotting paper
to keep you pretty at all times.

68
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,416
All the time, huh?

69
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,875
How convenient.

70
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,333
Hey, what's your name?

71
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:15,125
Why are you so perfect?

72
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,250
- I'm Yim.
- Yim?

73
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,541
Yim…

74
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:22,625
The inhaler, fan, and blotting paper
are 350 baht in total.

75
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:27,250
What? Didn't you give them to me
because you like me?

76
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:30,000
Take them back then. All of them.

77
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,791
You can't return used items.

78
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:35,333
And you tricked me into buying.
It's a scam.

79
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:38,916
I haven't been in Thailand for a while,
but I know the laws.

80
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,208
Google it.

81
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,500
Google it, sis.

82
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,166
Listen.

83
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:50,166
According to the Criminal Code,
section 271.

84
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,791
- 271.
- The punishment is

85
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:55,291
- imprisonment for up to three years,
- Three years, do you know?

86
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:59,208
a fine, do you have the money,
up to 60,000 baht…

87
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:00,666
Do you have 60,000?

88
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,958
Or both imprisonment and a fine.

89
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,041
Call the police now.

90
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,875
Go on, so I can also file a complaint that

91
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:12,666
you sexually harassed me. Guys…

92
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,458
It's not true. This kid was…

93
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:18,958
You touched my face.
That was sexual harassment.

94
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,250
According to the Criminal Code,
section 397,

95
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:25,125
the punishment will be ten years
imprisonment, 200,000 fine

96
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,000
or both imprisonment and a fine.

97
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,291
What should we do?

98
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,666
Pay him.

99
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,875
- What?
- Pay him, I don't have any cash.

100
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,291
It's 350 baht, please.

101
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:50,833
Thank you.

102
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,166
Give me the change.

103
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:55,416
Received 500 baht for 350 baht purchase.

104
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:59,875
Oh my. Sis, I don't have enough change.

105
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:03,291
Take these candies instead.

106
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,916
Thank you for your support.
I appreciate it.

107
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:10,791
Candy? I'll suck your candy.
You grinny idiot!

108
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:18,125
- Are you interested in buying insurance?
- Yes.

109
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:21,166
You can take this brochure.

110
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,250
Thank you,
but what if I want to be a broker?

111
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,333
THAI LIFE INSURANCE

112
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,625
This looks delicious.

113
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,166
- How much is it?
- Fifty baht.

114
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,750
It's three for 100 then. First, pay her.

115
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:35,750
Me again?

116
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,250
I already paid earlier.

117
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:40,333
Fine, only 100 baht, I'll pay then.
So stingy.

118
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,166
All right, you pay.

119
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:43,833
Where's my purse?

120
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:45,875
Thief!

121
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:46,833
Hey, wait.

122
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:48,750
Wait! What's going on?

123
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,666
- A thief stole my purse and ran away.
- He's there!

124
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,916
My pork rinds!

125
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,416
- My pork rinds!
- I'll come back to pay. Just a second!

126
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,041
Please help!

127
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,416
- Help!
- Please help!

128
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,291
- Thief! Here you are.
- Hey, thief!

129
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,250
Get him, Min Joon!

130
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,041
Get him, everyone. Get him good.

131
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,583
- Get him.
- You, thief!

132
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,041
- How could you do this?
- Pick him up, Min Joon.

133
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:14,250
Get him up.
What's he going to do? Get him.

134
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,416
Stop! It's me, Nott!

135
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,708
- Novice Nott!
- Novice Nott!

136
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,791
Are you all right?

137
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,208
I'm sorry, Novice Nott.

138
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,333
Are you okay?
Why did you do this, Min Joon?

139
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,333
That's too violent!

140
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:30,000
- You told me to get the thief!
- You can't do this!

141
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,958
- You even kneed him yourself!
- Stop.

142
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,625
Both of you are the violent ones.

143
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:36,375
Got hit on your head?
Do you need help to think straight?

144
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:39,541
- I told you to stop but you didn't listen.
- Shut up!

145
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:43,958
Nott, I'm sorry.

146
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,333
Is this your house?

147
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,791
I never know you have a house
in the countryside.

148
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,958
I lived here when I was a kid.

149
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,375
I haven't come back
since I went to be a trainee in Korea.

150
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,750
And nobody lives here?

151
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,625
Not since my grandpa died.

152
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:15,375
It must be dusty.
Can't we stay at a hotel?

153
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,333
We can sleep here.

154
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:18,958
My mom had someone clean it up.

155
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,625
Oh, I like sleeping.

156
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:27,250
Excuse me, Balloon!
Don't you want to help us with stuff?

157
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,916
I'm talking to Min Joon.

158
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,875
Where were we again?

159
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,916
Come talk to me, come on.

160
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,291
- Come talk to me. Talk to the luggage.
- Do you need help?

161
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,416
Take a photo with me.

162
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,000
Nott, hurry up.

163
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,125
I'll catch up in a bit.

164
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,000
- How do you like it?
- Make me look skinny.

165
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,541
You know, like…

166
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,250
Sis, I woke up like this. Zero effort…

167
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,791
- Just chilling with the view? Move, then.
- Right.

168
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,583
First, take photos of me.

169
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,250
Intertwined Nagas?

170
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,291
Shit!

171
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:42,333
Let me see.

172
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,750
- Here.
- This looks good.

173
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,416
- This looks good, huh?
- You are so good.

174
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,666
Come on.

175
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,208
Here you go.

176
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:12,125
Thank you, sis. How much is it?

177
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,125
- It's all right. This is on me.
- This place?

178
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,541
What's your name, by the way?

179
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,875
- I'm Nai Hua.
- I'm Balloon.

180
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,416
And I'm First.

181
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,666
I didn't ask you.

182
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,208
Drive safely.
I might buy you a new motorbike.

183
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:26,000
It seems worn down, rusty, and old.

184
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,416
- Go back home. Go.
- It's too hot, First.

185
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:42,000
Girl, will you bring me a menu?

186
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,958
No room with AC here.

187
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:47,125
We don't have a menu,
just order what you want.

188
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:50,208
If we can, we'll make it.
If we can't, you just won't get to eat.

189
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:57,916
Then I want a stir-fried water crab with…

190
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,250
Curry!

191
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:02,500
Make sure it's top-rated curry.

192
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:06,125
- I want something more local.
- Yes, local.

193
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,208
Then I'd like a hellish soup

194
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:12,416
with eels that broke
the third Buddhist precept.

195
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,500
All right.

196
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,208
Our new customers are crap!

197
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,500
Oh, sorry.

198
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:26,583
They want fried curry crab
and hellish eel soup!

199
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:33,458
Excuse me. I'd like seafood tom yum
and deep-fried sea bass with fish sauce.

200
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:36,958
- Yes, sweetie.
- "Yes, sweetie." Cancel everything.

201
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,125
What do you want then?

202
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,250
I want something clean.

203
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,875
We only eat healthy food.

204
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,541
Toilet bleach then.

205
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,583
Drink that so your mouth will be clean.

206
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,250
What is your problem?

207
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,458
Want a slap on your face?

208
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,666
You talk like this, people won't eat here.

209
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,083
Even dogs won't eat here.

210
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,500
First, get back!

211
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,666
Who said dogs won't eat at my restaurant?

212
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:06,958
Who said that, huh?

213
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,083
You, you, or you?

214
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,458
This way, come back this way.

215
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,041
I said it. So what?

216
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,791
You idiot. Have you tried my food?

217
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,625
How do you know that dogs won't eat it?

218
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,083
This dog of yours has a foul mouth.

219
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,333
Who would want to eat here?

220
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:22,416
But you've never tried.

221
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,958
You can't accuse that my food is bad.

222
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,416
You can't!

223
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,833
Why can't I say it?

224
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,166
First, let's get back.

225
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,041
You won't leave…

226
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,208
until you

227
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,041
taste my cooking skills.

228
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,041
Are you asking for trouble?

229
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,250
You dog's-boob face!

230
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:51,083
Come on, you coffin-worshipping scum.

231
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,083
How dare you call me
coffin-worshipping scum!

232
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:54,916
- No!
- You dog's-boob face!

233
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,500
- Nott, back off!
- You dog's-boob face!

234
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,500
You come here!

235
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:02,666
Back off!

236
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,916
- What? Stop that!
- It's dirty!

237
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,333
What are you doing?

238
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,166
What are you doing?

239
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,041
Back off.

240
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:11,791
Back off.

241
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:14,291
You! Do Min Joon!

242
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,333
- Ouch.
- Come here. You come here now.

243
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,166
Come here.

244
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,583
- Do Min Joon!
- Hey! Stop!

245
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,541
Do Min Joon.

246
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,541
- Do Min Joon.
- What did he say?

247
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,583
- Do Min Joon?
- Do Min Joon, huh?

248
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,333
- Do Min Joon?
- Enough, bitch.

249
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,000
Here.

250
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,250
There you go.

251
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45,333
What…

252
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,166
What did you bring us?
It's flat like your face.

253
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,666
It's a fish, can't you see?

254
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,083
- What fish is this?
- And what is this?

255
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:58,833
It looks so oily. It must be greasy.

256
00:16:58,916 --> 00:16:59,791
I can't eat this.

257
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,125
Your loss, bitch.

258
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,208
So delicious!

259
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,708
I'm telling you,
if you open a restaurant in Bangkok,

260
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:10,541
I'll definitely be your regular.

261
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,958
Nott, don't exaggerate.

262
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,833
You just never had dinner.

263
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:20,958
No one can resist this delicious food.

264
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,375
Girl, get your boobs away.

265
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:28,750
He wants to eat food, not you.

266
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,083
Just try.

267
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,958
How is it? Good?

268
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,041
Well?

269
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,125
Don't.

270
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:50,666
No, you don't.

271
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,958
You are just hungry.

272
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,583
Yes, just like that.

273
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,625
Get a big bite. Bigger.

274
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,541
Damn, this bitch.

275
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,375
- I still insist.
- What?

276
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:12,625
Even dogs won't eat it.

277
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,833
But you did.

278
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:17,083
- Yes, so good.
- You tried it all.

279
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,291
- Is it good?
- Yes, delicious.

280
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:19,916
I told you.

281
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,958
Damn!

282
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:25,750
Don't pretend to know me.

283
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:26,791
Good.

284
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:29,416
The food is really good, Pong, Bow.

285
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,500
What?

286
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,333
How do you know my old name?

287
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:41,416
That boy!

288
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,500
Dull Boy!

289
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:45,875
- Dull Boy!
- Dull Boy!

290
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:52,083
He looks more vibrant and handsome!
He's changed!

291
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,375
Why didn't you tell us
you know each other?

292
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,958
You were fighting. I didn't have a chance.

293
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,333
You started it. I saw that.

294
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,791
Who would think that the Dull Boy

295
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:07,875
would grow up to be
Do Min Joon, the superstar?

296
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:13,208
I think we have a lot to catch up.

297
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,875
Bring it on.

298
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,708
Cheers. Let's drink.

299
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:18,666
Give me some.

300
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,083
You hoarded them all.

301
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,791
So…

302
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,000
So why do you come back here?

303
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,750
You miss me, right?

304
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:31,750
It's not like that.

305
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,541
My mom asked me to work on the old chapel

306
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,875
then I'd like to visit a friend there.

307
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:38,666
Old chapel?

308
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,166
- Friend?
- Yes.

309
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,708
But at that old chapel, it's…

310
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:46,416
It's…

311
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:48,750
It's what?

312
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,208
Aren't you afraid of sin
for talking about a chapel at a party?

313
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:54,416
It's time to drink!

314
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,708
Let's celebrate for the chapel.

315
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,916
Bottoms up. Down, down, down.

316
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,291
<i>- Rock, paper, scissors!
- Rock, paper, scissors</i>

317
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:21,916
<i>- Shoot!
- Shoot!</i>

318
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:23,416
- Shoot!
- Shoot!

319
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:24,958
- Shoot!
- Shoot!

320
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:26,791
- Shoot!
- Shoot!

321
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,416
- Shoot!
- Shoot!

322
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:30,458
- Shoot!
- Shoot!

323
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:31,500
- Shoot!
- Shoot!

324
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,041
- Yes!
- Damn.

325
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,291
Go on.

326
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,708
Close your eyes. Don't peek.

327
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,250
One, two, three, four, five,

328
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:51,458
six, seven, eight, nine,

329
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,458
ten!

330
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:04,875
Sir, have you seen my friend?

331
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:09,791
<i>Do!</i>

332
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:12,708
<i>Do!</i>

333
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,333
Min Joon, I think this place looks creepy.

334
00:25:07,416 --> 00:25:09,500
Didn't you say
that the contractors will fix it?

335
00:25:11,708 --> 00:25:14,708
Let's take a look inside.

336
00:25:46,958 --> 00:25:48,125
Oh, dear.

337
00:25:53,541 --> 00:25:55,625
From the way it looks,

338
00:25:55,708 --> 00:25:57,291
it doesn't seem to need restoration.

339
00:25:57,375 --> 00:25:59,000
First, you are exaggerating.

340
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:00,791
Building a new one seems easier.

341
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:03,500
Just look.

342
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:06,250
What are you doing?

343
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:12,208
We meet again.

344
00:26:12,291 --> 00:26:13,666
What do you want to buy?

345
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:16,250
I want nothing from you, grinny idiot.

346
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,166
Novice, where are all the workers?

347
00:26:21,791 --> 00:26:23,250
They all left.

348
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:26,500
We are looking for new contractors,

349
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:29,583
but no one wants to.

350
00:26:30,166 --> 00:26:33,250
When can this be finished then?

351
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:37,458
Please understand those
who gave donations.

352
00:26:37,541 --> 00:26:40,041
The money is still there.

353
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:42,375
It's in the temple's bank account.

354
00:26:43,791 --> 00:26:45,250
The chapel isn't hard to fix.

355
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:48,041
The hard part is getting inside.

356
00:26:49,791 --> 00:26:52,166
Well, why can't they enter, Novice?

357
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,416
There is a…

358
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:06,375
Min Joon, what are we doing here?

359
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,291
Let's get out of here! Hurry up!

360
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:09,875
Quick! This way!

361
00:27:19,291 --> 00:27:21,083
- Hurry up!
- Run!

362
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:25,083
Run, Balloon, run! Come this way!

363
00:27:25,166 --> 00:27:28,083
- Don't follow me.
- Wait up.

364
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:33,875
Novice, what was it at the chapel?

365
00:27:33,958 --> 00:27:35,791
Do you need to ask?

366
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:38,750
It seems to be haunted.

367
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:40,916
It's Pee Nak's ghost.

368
00:27:41,625 --> 00:27:42,750
- Again?
- Again?

369
00:27:43,708 --> 00:27:46,166
Come on, like you've seen
Pee Nak's ghost that often.

370
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,791
Bitch, why didn't you tell us
about the ghost last night?

371
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,166
When would I have a chance?

372
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,666
You kept drinking and drinking. Now look.

373
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,041
Got it all in your face.

374
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:58,833
Lately, I have had dreams
about Pee Nak's ghost.

375
00:27:58,916 --> 00:28:00,416
Which one did you see?

376
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,708
The first, the second,

377
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:04,125
or the third one?

378
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,916
A new one.

379
00:28:07,708 --> 00:28:08,583
A new one?

380
00:28:08,666 --> 00:28:11,625
But I'm not sure
if we should call him Pee Nak…

381
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:13,250
because…

382
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:51,541
Damn it.

383
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:55,083
Why did you have to kill yourself
in a chapel?

384
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:04,041
Why didn't they
take the rope off with the body?

385
00:29:18,541 --> 00:29:22,458
Why do you want the medicine now,
Reverend Father?

386
00:29:35,625 --> 00:29:36,541
Tinn?

387
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:39,583
Who likes to wear a mask?

388
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:43,291
- That's right! Cleft lip.
- That's right! Cleft lip.

389
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:44,750
Yes, that one.

390
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:47,000
That's the one.

391
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:51,000
<i>- You were born ugly. Nobody loves you.
- You were born ugly. Nobody loves you.</i>

392
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:55,708
- Born hideous! Ghost-faced boy!
- Born hideous! Ghost-faced boy!

393
00:29:55,791 --> 00:29:57,208
Boo!

394
00:29:57,291 --> 00:29:58,625
Go! Get out!

395
00:29:58,708 --> 00:30:00,208
Ghost-faced!

396
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:03,833
Ghost-faced is upset.

397
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:06,750
Get lost! Go away!

398
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:08,916
Cleft lip.

399
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,583
Ghost-faced.

400
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:15,541
- Cleft lip!
- Cleft lip! Ghost-faced!

401
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,166
Do you want to play?

402
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:29,000
Press here and it will go forward.

403
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:30,458
Try it.

404
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,416
Here, this is backward,
turn right, turn left.

405
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,166
Do you see?

406
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:40,375
Make a turn--

407
00:30:43,791 --> 00:30:46,125
You can't play well wearing a mask.

408
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,291
Why don't you take it off?

409
00:30:53,958 --> 00:30:55,750
Come on, take it off.

410
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:27,708
Do you see it better now?

411
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:30,125
Let's try again.

412
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:33,958
Your friend is Pee Nak's ghost?

413
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:38,083
Do you know where Tinn's body is?

414
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:39,666
I want to visit his grave.

415
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,791
Min Joon, this is enough.

416
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:44,750
Stop getting yourself involved
with Pee Nak's ghost. Let's go back.

417
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:47,958
Let's leave, Min Joon, please.

418
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:53,666
We should go back, Min Joon.

419
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:55,708
Min Joon…

420
00:32:00,666 --> 00:32:03,750
No way. I won't take you there
even if you paid me.

421
00:32:04,666 --> 00:32:06,375
Money can't buy me…

422
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:10,541
but thousand baht notes can.

423
00:32:10,625 --> 00:32:12,291
This way, please.

424
00:32:12,375 --> 00:32:13,916
- Hey, Yim.
- Be careful.

425
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,250
You are really asking for trouble, Yim.

426
00:32:17,916 --> 00:32:19,500
This is a shortcut.

427
00:32:20,791 --> 00:32:21,708
Be careful.

428
00:32:24,083 --> 00:32:25,166
You go ahead.

429
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:28,375
This way. We are almost there.

430
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:33,625
Why do they hang them there? So creepy.

431
00:32:33,708 --> 00:32:35,625
It's a belief of our village.

432
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:39,333
These ghost masks are used
in the Ghost Festival.

433
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,500
Ghosts come from the jungle.

434
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:42,708
When the festival ends,

435
00:32:42,791 --> 00:32:44,625
we return them here.

436
00:33:06,166 --> 00:33:07,333
Gosh, it's so scary.

437
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:10,875
- Almost there. After the next right--
- Guys.

438
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:12,333
What?

439
00:33:12,416 --> 00:33:13,791
Did you hear anything?

440
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:14,791
No.

441
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:17,125
Why are you scaring us like that, Nott?

442
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:21,041
There is no sound whatsoever. Let's go!

443
00:33:23,666 --> 00:33:24,916
- Let's keep going.
- Your hearing seems to have improved

444
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,166
since you moved to Bangkok.

445
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:27,208
Nott, come on!

446
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:30,291
This way, Min Joon.

447
00:33:31,166 --> 00:33:33,000
- It's right here.
- I'm scared. What's all this?

448
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:34,083
Right here.

449
00:33:37,541 --> 00:33:39,083
Min Joon, be careful.

450
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:40,750
For unnatural deaths,

451
00:33:41,375 --> 00:33:44,375
according to the belief here,
we don't cremate them,

452
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:46,916
but we bury them instead.

453
00:33:49,083 --> 00:33:50,208
That's right.

454
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,625
And this one is complimentary.

455
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:55,541
Free of charge.

456
00:33:57,541 --> 00:33:58,791
Here.

457
00:33:59,291 --> 00:34:00,541
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

458
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:25,541
TINN TREENUCH, 23 YEARS OLD

459
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:45,833
Excuse me.

460
00:34:45,916 --> 00:34:46,958
Yes?

461
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:49,000
Please take this yellow robe
to make merit.

462
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,333
See you.

463
00:34:56,458 --> 00:34:57,791
What a coincidence.

464
00:34:58,291 --> 00:34:59,166
I think…

465
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,000
this is not a coincidence.

466
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,333
Was it that time…

467
00:35:05,416 --> 00:35:06,333
That we met…

468
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:30,833
Min Joon, I think
we should go back to Bangkok.

469
00:35:32,666 --> 00:35:33,833
I think--

470
00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:37,458
First!

471
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:52,791
There is a tool kit in the trunk.

472
00:35:53,541 --> 00:35:54,583
I'll go check it out.

473
00:35:54,666 --> 00:35:55,541
Thank you.

474
00:35:57,666 --> 00:36:00,375
Stop being puzzled.
Look, we almost went down there!

475
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,916
Tell you what,
during accidents, don't act hysterical.

476
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,458
Stay calm to handle the situation.

477
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:10,416
Stay calm? You were the loudest.

478
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,208
"Ah," was all I said.

479
00:36:14,458 --> 00:36:15,458
<i>Do!</i>

480
00:36:19,458 --> 00:36:23,166
Balloon, when the tire exploded,

481
00:36:23,833 --> 00:36:25,041
I felt strange.

482
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:28,708
It was like…

483
00:36:28,791 --> 00:36:30,500
Like what?

484
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:32,875
Like something pulled the steering wheel.

485
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:34,041
Bullshit.

486
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:35,291
It was just your driving.

487
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:36,625
I'm serious.

488
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:42,208
A ghost?

489
00:36:42,291 --> 00:36:43,208
Shut up.

490
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:44,791
Then what?

491
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,916
First, Balloon…

492
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,541
Min Joon?

493
00:36:57,208 --> 00:36:58,125
Min Joon.

494
00:36:58,833 --> 00:36:59,833
Min Joon.

495
00:37:01,583 --> 00:37:03,333
Min Joon!

496
00:37:03,416 --> 00:37:04,708
Min Joon!

497
00:37:04,791 --> 00:37:06,458
- Min Joon, no!
- Min Joon.

498
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:07,791
Min Joon!

499
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:10,666
- You might fall down, Min Joon.
- Stop!

500
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,375
- Min Joon!
- Oh, no!

501
00:37:38,208 --> 00:37:39,833
- Nott!
- Nott! No!

502
00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:57,833
Did you find him?

503
00:37:58,416 --> 00:38:00,125
- Nott, this way.
- Min Joon.

504
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:01,375
This way.

505
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,708
- Did you find him?
- I can't find him.

506
00:39:11,791 --> 00:39:13,458
- Just go around.
- Min Joon!

507
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:16,250
- There he is!
- Behind you!

508
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:18,875
- Min Joon!
- Hurry up! Quick!

509
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,458
Hold him up!

510
00:39:20,541 --> 00:39:21,875
- Easy!
- Be careful!

511
00:39:21,958 --> 00:39:23,291
- Min Joon.
- Min Joon.

512
00:39:23,375 --> 00:39:25,333
- You'll be all right, Min Joon!
- Please wake up!

513
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:28,125
What the hell happened? I'm scared, First.

514
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:31,250
Harder.

515
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:33,541
Min Joon!

516
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:37,083
- He's back. Min Joon!
- He is awake!

517
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,125
- Min Joon.
- Min Joon.

518
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:40,375
Min Joon.

519
00:39:40,458 --> 00:39:41,500
Min Joon.

520
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:42,833
- Min Joon.
- Min Joon.

521
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:45,958
Are you all right?

522
00:39:46,041 --> 00:39:48,625
Why don't you try drowning
to see if you're all right or not?

523
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:50,833
Under the water…

524
00:39:50,916 --> 00:39:52,416
it's like in my dream.

525
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:54,458
Or…

526
00:39:54,541 --> 00:39:55,750
were I dreaming?

527
00:39:57,125 --> 00:39:58,125
You weren't dreaming.

528
00:39:58,708 --> 00:40:00,750
If you don't believe… Balloon…

529
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:02,416
What?

530
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,208
Bitch!

531
00:40:04,291 --> 00:40:06,625
- You should slap him, not me!
- Are you hurt?

532
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:07,916
Of course, bitch!

533
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:12,333
If you are still not sure…

534
00:40:12,416 --> 00:40:13,416
Nott…

535
00:40:14,958 --> 00:40:17,041
- Get your face closer.
- You slap, I punch.

536
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:18,416
Go on.

537
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,125
- I'm sorry.
- Go on.

538
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,166
Everyone, let's get him back home.

539
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,208
Let's go.

540
00:40:25,291 --> 00:40:26,875
Get Balloon home too.

541
00:40:29,875 --> 00:40:31,000
Are you hurt?

542
00:40:31,791 --> 00:40:33,541
- Are you hurt?
- I am.

543
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:34,000
Look. Is it pretty?

544
00:41:36,166 --> 00:41:37,333
That's funny.

545
00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:49,333
Chop-chop, First.

546
00:41:54,333 --> 00:41:55,458
Shove them all in.

547
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:58,125
Hurry up, Novice, or we'll die.

548
00:41:58,208 --> 00:41:59,375
First, Balloon…

549
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:01,625
Where's your luggage?

550
00:42:01,708 --> 00:42:03,333
Please don't leave yet.

551
00:42:03,416 --> 00:42:04,958
I need your help for my friend.

552
00:42:05,541 --> 00:42:07,541
We are not social workers for ghosts.

553
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:10,083
How many times have we almost died
because of Pee Nak's ghost?

554
00:42:10,166 --> 00:42:13,500
But Tinn was my friend. He only had me.

555
00:42:13,583 --> 00:42:14,666
I have to help him.

556
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:16,583
Why didn't you help him when he was alive?

557
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:19,416
- There is no use helping him now.
- Balloon…

558
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,333
Even though he has become a ghost,
I won't abandon him.

559
00:42:22,416 --> 00:42:24,500
You only care about yourself.
You'll never understand.

560
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:26,541
Right, I don't understand.

561
00:42:28,791 --> 00:42:30,416
First, let's go.

562
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:32,708
Balloon, calm down.

563
00:42:32,791 --> 00:42:33,833
You stay and help him then.

564
00:42:33,916 --> 00:42:35,166
Calm down…

565
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:36,250
Come on.

566
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:42,666
I'll go back soon.

567
00:42:48,458 --> 00:42:50,083
Don't worry, First.

568
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:51,666
I'll stay and help him.

569
00:42:52,958 --> 00:42:54,791
Okay, take care.

570
00:42:55,958 --> 00:42:56,958
I'll call you.

571
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,208
Let's go.

572
00:43:16,208 --> 00:43:17,208
Thank you.

573
00:43:23,833 --> 00:43:25,500
Why did you brake so suddenly, First?

574
00:43:26,541 --> 00:43:32,208
I know that you didn't leave
because you're scared of Pee Nak's ghost.

575
00:43:34,625 --> 00:43:36,708
- I'm scared.
- That's not true.

576
00:43:36,791 --> 00:43:39,041
You are just upset about
what Min Joon said.

577
00:43:43,541 --> 00:43:46,500
Balloon, people like us…

578
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,750
should understand this pain very well.

579
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:52,708
Friends help each other.

580
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,708
His friend is our friend too.

581
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,291
We only have each other.

582
00:44:06,166 --> 00:44:07,958
Would rather die than live as a coward.

583
00:44:08,041 --> 00:44:08,958
Hey.

584
00:44:10,166 --> 00:44:13,750
You were bullied both physically
and verbally before.

585
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,958
Min Joon's friend was not as strong

586
00:44:21,666 --> 00:44:23,541
to fight back like you did.

587
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:26,333
More importantly,

588
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:29,750
I know you still love…

589
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:32,666
and care about Min Joon.

590
00:44:42,916 --> 00:44:43,958
I'm just…

591
00:45:24,041 --> 00:45:24,958
Shit!

592
00:45:31,541 --> 00:45:32,458
Hey!

593
00:45:33,083 --> 00:45:34,458
Nott, I can't open it.

594
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:38,333
- Min Joon!
- Nott!

595
00:45:38,416 --> 00:45:40,500
- Min Joon!
- Nott!

596
00:45:40,583 --> 00:45:41,625
Nott!

597
00:45:41,708 --> 00:45:43,083
Min Joon!

598
00:45:43,166 --> 00:45:44,208
Tinn!

599
00:45:44,291 --> 00:45:46,250
Tinn, No! Tinn! Don't do it!

600
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:48,208
Nott.

601
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:52,708
Min Joon…

602
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:53,791
Nott, are you all right?

603
00:46:23,666 --> 00:46:26,125
- Balloon. First.
- Min Joon.

604
00:46:26,208 --> 00:46:28,291
- Are you all right, Min Joon?
- It hurts.

605
00:46:28,375 --> 00:46:29,458
Be careful, Min Joon.

606
00:46:30,041 --> 00:46:31,041
- First.
- How are you?

607
00:46:31,125 --> 00:46:32,333
Why didn't you come in, bitch?

608
00:46:32,916 --> 00:46:34,291
I'm looking out for you. Hurry up.

609
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:35,500
Sheesh, you…

610
00:46:35,583 --> 00:46:37,083
- Min Joon, take it easy.
- Let's go.

611
00:46:37,166 --> 00:46:38,541
- Min Joon.
- Ouch.

612
00:46:38,625 --> 00:46:39,833
Be careful.

613
00:46:39,916 --> 00:46:41,166
Take it easy.

614
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:42,125
Come along.

615
00:46:54,916 --> 00:46:55,916
Hey!

616
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:58,000
What are you looking at?

617
00:46:59,041 --> 00:47:01,291
- I'm worried about him.
- Look higher then.

618
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:03,500
Ouch. Take it easy.

619
00:47:05,166 --> 00:47:06,750
Be gentle.

620
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:09,458
Was that your hand or your foot, First?

621
00:47:11,458 --> 00:47:12,375
That's harsh, Min Joon.

622
00:47:13,916 --> 00:47:16,833
- I'm sorry.
- Being this snappy, you're fine then?

623
00:47:19,375 --> 00:47:20,500
I'm good now.

624
00:47:22,458 --> 00:47:24,500
Thank you for coming back to help.

625
00:47:25,083 --> 00:47:26,541
What? Who came back to help?

626
00:47:26,625 --> 00:47:28,458
First wouldn't stop complaining,

627
00:47:28,541 --> 00:47:29,541
so I tagged along.

628
00:47:29,625 --> 00:47:30,708
I'm not here to help.

629
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:33,375
Are you sure?

630
00:47:42,666 --> 00:47:43,583
Balloon.

631
00:47:45,333 --> 00:47:48,458
I'm sorry for saying that to you.

632
00:47:50,583 --> 00:47:54,041
It's your mouth. Say whatever you want.

633
00:47:55,208 --> 00:47:57,458
Are you his wife? Acting up like that.

634
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:03,583
I'm so sorry.

635
00:48:04,833 --> 00:48:06,791
I said you only think about yourself.

636
00:48:07,375 --> 00:48:10,083
In fact, you always put me first.

637
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:15,458
Hey,

638
00:48:16,041 --> 00:48:18,125
he apologized to you.

639
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:20,791
Won't you apologize to him too?

640
00:48:21,375 --> 00:48:22,458
I apologize when I'm wrong.

641
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:24,958
- I've never seen you apologize.
- Because I'm never wrong!

642
00:48:25,041 --> 00:48:26,916
- So pretentious!
- Piss off!

643
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I'm sorry.

644
00:48:28,083 --> 00:48:29,166
I'm so sorry.

645
00:48:35,291 --> 00:48:36,375
Min Joon.

646
00:48:36,458 --> 00:48:38,458
Why are you still involving yourself
with the ghost?

647
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:39,791
He's scary.

648
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:44,500
Although you were his close friend,
he won't spare you.

649
00:48:45,083 --> 00:48:46,458
We intend to help Tinn.

650
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:48,333
What?

651
00:48:48,416 --> 00:48:49,708
Are you crazy?

652
00:48:49,791 --> 00:48:52,000
- How can anyone help a ghost?
- Right.

653
00:48:52,083 --> 00:48:53,208
- We can.
- We can.

654
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:01,041
Novice, why did he
kill himself in the chapel?

655
00:49:01,125 --> 00:49:03,041
Well, it's like this.

656
00:49:03,125 --> 00:49:05,791
Check the offerings again.

657
00:49:05,875 --> 00:49:06,958
Chief.

658
00:49:07,041 --> 00:49:09,375
Do you have everything
for the ordination ceremony?

659
00:49:09,916 --> 00:49:11,416
I think so.

660
00:49:13,208 --> 00:49:15,375
Oh, we're still missing the yellow robe.

661
00:49:15,958 --> 00:49:17,583
Can I get it from the temple?

662
00:49:17,666 --> 00:49:18,958
Yes.

663
00:49:19,041 --> 00:49:22,000
Chief, don't be stingy.

664
00:49:22,083 --> 00:49:23,125
It's your son's ordination.

665
00:49:23,208 --> 00:49:24,500
You take from the temple again.

666
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:28,583
With a sincere heart,
everything is meritorious.

667
00:49:29,958 --> 00:49:32,000
Right, meritorious.

668
00:49:32,083 --> 00:49:34,458
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

669
00:49:35,708 --> 00:49:37,583
No, this yellow robe is mine.

670
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:39,583
What do you need it for, cleft lip?

671
00:49:39,666 --> 00:49:40,791
I want to be ordained.

672
00:49:43,291 --> 00:49:44,958
Someone like you?

673
00:49:45,041 --> 00:49:46,708
Nobody will let you ordain.

674
00:49:48,541 --> 00:49:49,500
Give it back.

675
00:49:53,458 --> 00:49:54,750
- Chief.
- Cleft lip!

676
00:49:54,833 --> 00:49:56,083
Calm down, Chief.

677
00:49:56,583 --> 00:49:57,541
If you can be ordained,

678
00:49:58,125 --> 00:50:00,791
I'll have the whole village
bow at your feet, cleft lip.

679
00:50:01,375 --> 00:50:03,750
Just wait and see. I'll be ordained.

680
00:50:04,333 --> 00:50:06,666
- Let go! You cleft lip…
- Chief, stop.

681
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:09,083
Come here. Where are you going?

682
00:50:09,166 --> 00:50:10,458
Where are you going? Come here.

683
00:50:14,708 --> 00:50:18,000
<i>The condition that you have</i>

684
00:50:18,083 --> 00:50:20,833
<i>is the reason why
you can't practice</i> Dhamma

685
00:50:20,916 --> 00:50:23,583
<i>and perform the monk's roles
to the fullest.</i>

686
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,416
<i>Why is that, Reverend Father?</i>

687
00:50:27,833 --> 00:50:30,500
<i>Is it because I'm disabled and ugly?</i>

688
00:50:32,166 --> 00:50:34,916
<i>Is it so revolting that I can't be a monk?</i>

689
00:50:35,583 --> 00:50:37,208
<i>It's not like that.</i>

690
00:50:37,708 --> 00:50:42,708
<i>Buddhism never discriminates
against anyone for that reason.</i>

691
00:50:42,791 --> 00:50:44,666
Then why don't you ordain me?

692
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:47,000
If I were in yellow robes,

693
00:50:47,083 --> 00:50:48,791
people would stop bullying

694
00:50:48,875 --> 00:50:50,416
and looking down on me.

695
00:50:51,333 --> 00:50:53,166
Please allow me to ordain.

696
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:57,333
Becoming a monk to run away
isn't the right path.

697
00:50:58,041 --> 00:51:00,458
Regardless of what's proper or not,

698
00:51:01,041 --> 00:51:03,791
I cannot ordain you.

699
00:51:03,875 --> 00:51:05,833
You are just like the others…

700
00:51:07,666 --> 00:51:09,750
who refuse to let me ordain.

701
00:51:11,458 --> 00:51:12,708
Or perhaps…

702
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:19,583
you simply can't bear to see an ugly guy

703
00:51:19,666 --> 00:51:22,708
hold a position equivalent to yours,
revered by all?

704
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:28,708
Before expecting others to respect you,

705
00:51:29,583 --> 00:51:31,958
you should respect yourself first.

706
00:51:34,208 --> 00:51:35,541
Let me ask you again.

707
00:51:36,875 --> 00:51:38,083
If you are ordained,

708
00:51:38,833 --> 00:51:42,125
do you want people to respect
the yellow robe you wear

709
00:51:42,625 --> 00:51:44,541
or to respect yourself?

710
00:51:45,666 --> 00:51:47,583
It doesn't matter,

711
00:51:48,166 --> 00:51:49,666
as long as they respect me!

712
00:52:47,291 --> 00:52:51,125
Why was I born
with disabilities and ugliness?

713
00:52:51,208 --> 00:52:57,291
Even Buddhism discriminates against me.

714
00:52:58,458 --> 00:53:02,875
People have judged me all my life.

715
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,208
Now…

716
00:53:09,291 --> 00:53:12,708
I will decide for myself.

717
00:53:22,083 --> 00:53:25,708
<i>If I can't make you respect me as a monk,</i>

718
00:53:25,791 --> 00:53:29,416
<i>I will make you respect me out of fear.</i>

719
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:52,875
<i>Today, there is a person
of great kindness.</i>

720
00:53:52,958 --> 00:53:59,250
<i>Today is a beautiful and auspicious day.</i>

721
00:54:00,458 --> 00:54:05,541
<i>Father's son, mother's son
will be ordained.</i>

722
00:54:11,708 --> 00:54:13,458
Let go of my son.

723
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:15,375
Bow to my feet.

724
00:54:16,875 --> 00:54:19,958
I beg you. Please let go of my son.

725
00:54:20,041 --> 00:54:22,375
Let go of my son.

726
00:54:23,625 --> 00:54:24,708
Let go of my son.

727
00:54:25,291 --> 00:54:27,583
Reverend Father
has to be responsible for this.

728
00:54:27,666 --> 00:54:29,041
Get rid of him from our chapel.

729
00:54:29,125 --> 00:54:30,208
- That's right.
- That's right.

730
00:54:30,291 --> 00:54:33,750
Reverend Father is a monk,
not an exorcist.

731
00:54:33,833 --> 00:54:34,750
Novice.

732
00:54:34,833 --> 00:54:36,416
It's your responsibility.

733
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:39,916
He can't be ordained
and now nobody can as well?

734
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,541
Evil ghosts like him won't reincarnate.

735
00:54:42,625 --> 00:54:45,208
Tinn is already dead.
Why do you curse him?

736
00:54:45,291 --> 00:54:48,666
If he's dead, then just go.
Why does he linger and stir up trouble?

737
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:50,416
- Yes.
- Right.

738
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:53,291
Everyone in the village is scared of him.

739
00:54:53,875 --> 00:54:56,041
Tinn must have wanted everyone
to pay respect to him,

740
00:54:56,541 --> 00:54:58,000
so he chose to die in the chapel.

741
00:54:59,541 --> 00:55:01,708
Every time we defeat Pee Nak's ghosts,

742
00:55:02,916 --> 00:55:07,875
it's because we free them
from their chains of conscience.

743
00:55:09,125 --> 00:55:11,666
If we can make Nak Tinn's spirit

744
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:14,333
cross over and move beyond
the time of his suicide,

745
00:55:15,375 --> 00:55:18,875
he might be freed
and take responsibility for his actions.

746
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,250
Okay.

747
00:55:23,333 --> 00:55:27,250
Let's start from stopping him
from hanging himself.

748
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:29,458
So who's going to do it?

749
00:55:30,166 --> 00:55:32,166
Someone who knows the chapel well.

750
00:55:35,625 --> 00:55:38,250
- No.
- I'd rather not.

751
00:55:38,333 --> 00:55:41,083
Actually, it could be
not just about being ordained.

752
00:55:41,666 --> 00:55:44,458
I've never seen anyone being nice to him.

753
00:55:48,708 --> 00:55:51,541
Are you drawing your own ghostly face?

754
00:55:52,291 --> 00:55:53,708
Cleft lip.

755
00:55:53,791 --> 00:55:55,458
Take this, ghost face!

756
00:55:55,541 --> 00:55:57,458
Go bark somewhere else, Pong.

757
00:56:00,625 --> 00:56:02,500
- Go away.
- Born with ghostly face.

758
00:56:02,583 --> 00:56:04,375
- Will you leave?
- We are leaving.

759
00:56:04,458 --> 00:56:06,083
Hurry up.

760
00:56:07,708 --> 00:56:08,666
You scaredy-cats!

761
00:56:13,875 --> 00:56:16,583
It's because you bullied him
since he was a kid.

762
00:56:16,666 --> 00:56:20,458
No wonder why he grew up hating you guys.

763
00:56:21,083 --> 00:56:24,625
We just teased him. It was harmless fun.

764
00:56:24,708 --> 00:56:27,208
And we just got used to it.

765
00:56:27,291 --> 00:56:29,875
Did he enjoy it too?

766
00:56:29,958 --> 00:56:34,666
You shouldn't mock or belittle others.

767
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:37,791
How would you feel
if you were in his shoes?

768
00:56:38,375 --> 00:56:39,541
Have some empathy.

769
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,583
It's not too late
to fix your bad habits now

770
00:56:44,666 --> 00:56:46,083
so nobody has to die again.

771
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:48,208
Please shut up.

772
00:56:50,791 --> 00:56:55,875
It must be the wound
from how he was treated all his life.

773
00:56:55,958 --> 00:56:59,625
Even after death,
he didn't get cremated like the others.

774
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:03,041
Should we do it like what we did
to Nak Non?

775
00:57:03,125 --> 00:57:05,583
We cremated his body.

776
00:57:07,416 --> 00:57:08,708
That was how

777
00:57:09,208 --> 00:57:11,750
I got dragged into the chapel
and nearly died.

778
00:57:13,166 --> 00:57:14,625
Luang Pee!

779
00:57:14,708 --> 00:57:17,583
Help me. I can't breathe.

780
00:57:17,666 --> 00:57:19,750
Okay, let's not do that.

781
00:57:21,333 --> 00:57:25,500
I think we should start
from Nak Tinn's house

782
00:57:26,166 --> 00:57:28,083
to find more information about him.

783
00:57:29,541 --> 00:57:32,666
Stop the ghost from killing himself
at the chapel?

784
00:57:33,458 --> 00:57:36,750
Dig up the body in the cemetery?

785
00:57:38,083 --> 00:57:41,708
Go to the ghost house to find what?

786
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:44,000
What should we do first?

787
00:57:44,875 --> 00:57:47,166
Let's try everything all at once.

788
00:57:47,666 --> 00:57:49,250
"Min Joon is our friend.

789
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:51,125
Helping his friend is like
helping our friend."

790
00:57:51,208 --> 00:57:55,000
Here, I'm taking you
to help your friend now.

791
00:57:56,083 --> 00:57:58,458
Stop complaining.
Isn't Min Joon your friend too?

792
00:57:58,541 --> 00:58:01,541
Just in and out.
It's getting dark, Balloon.

793
00:58:01,625 --> 00:58:03,708
I'm not even that close to that
Do Min Joon guy.

794
00:59:03,333 --> 00:59:04,666
Shit!

795
00:59:20,166 --> 00:59:22,041
You two, dig over there.

796
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:23,708
Why do we have to help you dig?

797
00:59:23,791 --> 00:59:25,166
Will we finish on time if you don't?

798
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:27,291
- Hurry up so it gets done quickly. Go!
- Right!

799
00:59:30,291 --> 00:59:31,833
I trust you.

800
00:59:33,875 --> 00:59:35,041
Come here.

801
00:59:37,458 --> 00:59:38,583
Come here?

802
00:59:38,666 --> 00:59:40,500
Do you think you can tell me what to do?

803
00:59:40,583 --> 00:59:42,041
Yes. You tell him.

804
00:59:49,916 --> 00:59:51,750
Bonus, let's do it!

805
00:59:51,833 --> 00:59:53,083
- Yes.
- Hurry up.

806
00:59:53,166 --> 00:59:54,166
I'm not good with this.

807
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:55,166
- Give me that.
- There.

808
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:56,958
Faster.

809
00:59:58,041 --> 01:00:00,500
Hurry up. Dig it all up.

810
01:00:01,625 --> 01:00:03,166
No matter how deep, I won't hesitate.

811
01:00:03,958 --> 01:00:05,416
- Don't stop.
- Keep digging.

812
01:00:05,958 --> 01:00:07,125
We are almost there.

813
01:02:15,208 --> 01:02:17,000
Are you sure about this, Yim?

814
01:02:18,125 --> 01:02:19,250
We've come this far, Novice.

815
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:22,000
Let's hurry and do it.

816
01:02:24,625 --> 01:02:26,166
Bring me the scaffolding.

817
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:39,791
Stay still. Hold tight.

818
01:02:40,375 --> 01:02:42,166
Don't worry. I won't let go, Yim.

819
01:03:00,958 --> 01:03:02,375
Are you almost done?

820
01:03:02,958 --> 01:03:04,625
Calm down. I've just got here.

821
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:27,083
Novice! Wait!

822
01:03:30,916 --> 01:03:32,750
I can't hold onto it.

823
01:03:32,833 --> 01:03:34,083
All right, Yim!

824
01:03:34,166 --> 01:03:35,458
Novice!

825
01:03:35,541 --> 01:03:37,708
Novice!

826
01:03:41,958 --> 01:03:43,333
Where are you going?

827
01:03:43,416 --> 01:03:45,541
Where are you, Novice?

828
01:03:47,166 --> 01:03:49,166
- Hurry! Let's go!
- Let's go, Yim!

829
01:03:50,208 --> 01:03:51,291
Quick!

830
01:04:44,041 --> 01:04:45,250
What is that, Min Joon?

831
01:04:55,416 --> 01:04:59,375
YOU LEFT ME.

832
01:04:59,458 --> 01:05:03,916
YOU LEFT ME.

833
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,875
<i>Tinn, when they bully you while I'm gone…</i>

834
01:05:08,458 --> 01:05:09,666
you have to fight back.

835
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:13,083
If you can't fight them, write it down.

836
01:05:13,166 --> 01:05:15,500
I'll avenge you
when I come back next semester.

837
01:05:16,083 --> 01:05:17,666
Will you really come back?

838
01:05:18,625 --> 01:05:20,500
Of course. I promise.

839
01:05:57,125 --> 01:05:59,166
Oh, my…

840
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:00,625
- It's done!
- We're done.

841
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:02,375
It's done!

842
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:04,166
First, look! Gay power.

843
01:06:07,291 --> 01:06:09,791
The force of desire, you gay peasant.

844
01:06:11,208 --> 01:06:13,750
What did you tell them?

845
01:06:14,333 --> 01:06:15,458
I lied to them that

846
01:06:15,541 --> 01:06:17,666
if they did it,
I would show them Min Joon's junk.

847
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:18,833
Min Joon's…

848
01:06:20,375 --> 01:06:21,625
I'm so nasty.

849
01:06:37,083 --> 01:06:38,000
Min Joon.

850
01:06:38,708 --> 01:06:40,125
You open it!

851
01:06:40,208 --> 01:06:44,500
If you don't,
you'll sleep in the graveyard tonight.

852
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:45,750
- I won't!
- I won't!

853
01:06:45,833 --> 01:06:48,583
Fine, then you won't see any junk.
Let's go.

854
01:06:48,666 --> 01:06:50,166
Wait up. Stop!

855
01:06:51,666 --> 01:06:53,041
- I'll open it.
- What now?

856
01:06:53,125 --> 01:06:55,083
Simple. Easy. Let me.

857
01:06:59,166 --> 01:07:00,125
Shit!

858
01:07:30,583 --> 01:07:32,166
For the junk.

859
01:07:43,166 --> 01:07:45,375
- Hey, Peary.
- What?

860
01:07:45,458 --> 01:07:46,666
- Lift it up.
- Me again?

861
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:47,708
Yes.

862
01:07:47,791 --> 01:07:49,416
Why is it always me, Balloon?

863
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:50,666
Lift it up. Quick!

864
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:52,375
Can't we cremate him in the coffin?

865
01:07:52,458 --> 01:07:54,250
Can you show him…

866
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,875
a bit of respect?

867
01:07:58,791 --> 01:08:00,458
Quick! And show me some respect! Dammit!

868
01:08:00,541 --> 01:08:02,000
Is there anything, Min Joon?

869
01:08:09,666 --> 01:08:10,750
Min Joon!

870
01:08:20,166 --> 01:08:21,166
Min Joon!

871
01:08:30,208 --> 01:08:32,291
First!

872
01:08:32,375 --> 01:08:33,375
Let's go.

873
01:08:36,041 --> 01:08:37,208
Bonus!

874
01:08:54,541 --> 01:08:56,458
Tinn!

875
01:09:03,791 --> 01:09:04,958
Tinn, no!

876
01:09:07,833 --> 01:09:09,208
No, Tinn.

877
01:09:09,291 --> 01:09:10,166
Don't hurt me.

878
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:13,708
Tinn, no!

879
01:09:14,916 --> 01:09:16,166
- I'm sorry.
- Min Joon!

880
01:09:22,541 --> 01:09:23,791
Nott, help me!

881
01:09:25,083 --> 01:09:27,000
Tinn, I'm sorry.

882
01:09:28,916 --> 01:09:30,500
Come on! Turn off!

883
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:31,958
I did wrong to you.

884
01:09:32,041 --> 01:09:34,750
Nott!

885
01:09:40,375 --> 01:09:42,416
Tinn, I'm sorry.

886
01:09:47,875 --> 01:09:49,250
You left me!

887
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,375
- Peary!
- Help me.

888
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,791
Sis!

889
01:10:25,875 --> 01:10:28,000
Where are you, sis?

890
01:10:28,083 --> 01:10:31,416
You can't die now.
You don't have a husband yet.

891
01:10:32,291 --> 01:10:34,041
Sis, where are you?

892
01:10:34,125 --> 01:10:35,375
Sis!

893
01:10:36,750 --> 01:10:40,875
Sis, where are you?

894
01:10:43,083 --> 01:10:45,000
Where are you, sis?

895
01:10:45,083 --> 01:10:47,750
Who will keep me company?

896
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:49,958
Sis!

897
01:10:57,166 --> 01:10:58,166
Damn it!

898
01:10:59,291 --> 01:11:00,458
Shit.

899
01:11:00,541 --> 01:11:01,541
- Go.
- Go.

900
01:11:05,583 --> 01:11:06,708
Sis!

901
01:11:06,791 --> 01:11:08,500
Sis, where are you?

902
01:11:08,583 --> 01:11:11,625
Sis, I don't want to be alone.

903
01:11:11,708 --> 01:11:13,000
Sis!

904
01:11:16,291 --> 01:11:19,333
I was so afraid I'd be all alone.

905
01:11:22,458 --> 01:11:24,541
Let's get up. Hurry.

906
01:11:24,625 --> 01:11:27,541
Go, go. Let's come up first. Quickly!

907
01:11:33,916 --> 01:11:35,208
Come up, quick!

908
01:11:41,208 --> 01:11:43,000
- You go first.
- You go first.

909
01:11:43,083 --> 01:11:44,625
You're first, you're born on a Saturday.

910
01:11:44,708 --> 01:11:45,833
You are a B-blood type too.

911
01:11:45,916 --> 01:11:47,166
But I read that a Saturday-born must open.

912
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:48,333
I don't believe you.

913
01:11:48,833 --> 01:11:50,208
What do we do?

914
01:11:50,291 --> 01:11:54,500
How about you open,
and I swing, hit, and run?

915
01:11:56,083 --> 01:11:58,125
- Sounds safe.
- Sounds safe.

916
01:12:09,208 --> 01:12:10,250
- Open…
- And hit!

917
01:12:10,333 --> 01:12:11,208
Open it!

918
01:12:13,291 --> 01:12:14,875
- I'll open it.
- Yes.

919
01:12:14,958 --> 01:12:15,916
Open!

920
01:12:25,208 --> 01:12:27,541
First, why are you so scared?

921
01:12:29,833 --> 01:12:32,333
The other Pee Nak's are bigger than him.

922
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:38,333
He is small, we can manage it.

923
01:12:38,416 --> 01:12:41,541
Like you are not scared, you ran first.

924
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:43,333
I'll hit him.

925
01:12:43,416 --> 01:12:45,291
- Open.
- Then hit.

926
01:12:46,041 --> 01:12:47,958
- Stop.
- Stop!

927
01:12:48,708 --> 01:12:50,000
Why are you approaching?

928
01:12:50,083 --> 01:12:52,708
We are here to help you.

929
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:56,750
There, you stole it from him.

930
01:12:56,833 --> 01:12:58,375
He's mad now. Give it back.

931
01:12:58,458 --> 01:13:00,291
I'll give it back and we're even, okay?

932
01:13:00,375 --> 01:13:01,583
Here you go.

933
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:03,625
Take it!

934
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,250
- Yes!
- Yes!

935
01:13:14,333 --> 01:13:16,916
How's that? You see what Mama can do?

936
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,250
You are awesome!

937
01:13:18,333 --> 01:13:19,666
You got stung for sure.

938
01:13:21,625 --> 01:13:24,541
Stay out of my way!

939
01:13:33,125 --> 01:13:35,041
- First!
- Balloon!

940
01:13:39,166 --> 01:13:41,166
- Are you good, Peary?
- Yes.

941
01:13:41,958 --> 01:13:43,666
Come on, faster.

942
01:13:52,083 --> 01:13:53,291
It's the vines, sis.

943
01:13:53,375 --> 01:13:54,666
Help me.

944
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:56,333
Ouch.

945
01:13:57,375 --> 01:13:58,500
Don't get any closer.

946
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:04,250
First!

947
01:14:04,875 --> 01:14:08,875
First!

948
01:14:08,958 --> 01:14:10,708
First! Come here!

949
01:14:18,208 --> 01:14:19,583
Tinn. No!

950
01:14:29,958 --> 01:14:32,416
I'm scared. I don't want to die.

951
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,250
That's right.

952
01:14:35,083 --> 01:14:35,958
Tinn.

953
01:14:37,041 --> 01:14:39,166
Why are you so angry at us?

954
01:14:40,041 --> 01:14:42,875
Are you angry about what I said?

955
01:14:42,958 --> 01:14:44,750
It was just a joke.

956
01:14:45,458 --> 01:14:50,083
- We meant no harm. Really.
- Yes.

957
01:14:50,833 --> 01:14:53,666
What I've said and done,

958
01:14:54,541 --> 01:14:56,625
I didn't kill you.

959
01:14:56,708 --> 01:14:58,458
You actually killed yourself.

960
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:09,333
I'm sorry.

961
01:15:10,625 --> 01:15:12,791
Just tell me what you want.

962
01:15:13,583 --> 01:15:14,958
Talk to me.

963
01:15:16,458 --> 01:15:20,583
I beg you. I'll give you anything.

964
01:15:23,625 --> 01:15:25,583
<i>Why don't you eat at your place?</i>

965
01:15:25,666 --> 01:15:27,416
Why do you eat here?

966
01:15:27,916 --> 01:15:29,750
People are too scared to come in.

967
01:15:33,791 --> 01:15:36,666
Cleft lip!
Why did you feed my food to a dog?

968
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:39,416
- Look.
- I bought it.

969
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:41,875
I can do anything I want with it.

970
01:15:41,958 --> 01:15:44,333
Then get out.
Don't ever come back here again.

971
01:15:44,416 --> 01:15:45,375
Go!

972
01:15:46,541 --> 01:15:47,500
Hey!

973
01:15:50,166 --> 01:15:51,958
Cleft lip, what did you do to my daughter?

974
01:15:52,041 --> 01:15:53,666
She threw a rock at the dog.

975
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:55,541
Well, it was at the dog, not you.

976
01:15:55,625 --> 01:15:57,708
She is just a kid.

977
01:15:57,791 --> 01:16:00,541
You are not only ugly but cruel too.

978
01:16:01,541 --> 01:16:03,166
Just remember this.

979
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:06,166
I'll make you bow to me.

980
01:16:07,875 --> 01:16:09,875
Bow to my feet.

981
01:16:13,541 --> 01:16:18,416
<i>If that's the case,
you should become a monk.</i>

982
01:16:18,916 --> 01:16:21,541
I won't give you monk offerings,

983
01:16:22,416 --> 01:16:25,500
but I'll give you funeral wood flowers.

984
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:28,083
You ghost face!

985
01:17:22,708 --> 01:17:24,375
- Holy shit!
- Is it a ghost?

986
01:17:24,458 --> 01:17:26,458
Your face, First.

987
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:28,125
What's with it?

988
01:17:28,208 --> 01:17:29,708
What happened to your face?

989
01:17:30,541 --> 01:17:31,958
- Here! Look!
- What is it?

990
01:17:32,041 --> 01:17:33,125
I don't know.

991
01:17:33,666 --> 01:17:35,833
Must be the lip filling.

992
01:17:40,083 --> 01:17:42,375
See? I told you!

993
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:47,833
- My lips.
- Bitch.

994
01:17:47,916 --> 01:17:49,625
I told you not to overfill your lips.

995
01:17:49,708 --> 01:17:51,541
I didn't. I got stung by wasps.

996
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:53,583
That'll be fun. How long?

997
01:17:53,666 --> 01:17:54,708
Just stung.

998
01:17:54,791 --> 01:17:55,708
So what stung you?

999
01:17:55,791 --> 01:17:57,125
A wasp.

1000
01:17:57,208 --> 01:17:58,500
I'm serious. How long?

1001
01:17:58,583 --> 01:18:00,458
Dammit! Enough with your gag!

1002
01:18:01,708 --> 01:18:03,208
So hideous.

1003
01:18:03,291 --> 01:18:05,250
Bitch, you want a punch in the face?

1004
01:18:05,333 --> 01:18:06,291
Damn it.

1005
01:18:06,375 --> 01:18:13,208
One, two, three, four,

1006
01:18:13,291 --> 01:18:16,875
- Shush…
- five, six,

1007
01:18:16,958 --> 01:18:18,000
Hear that?

1008
01:18:18,083 --> 01:18:20,833
seven, eight,

1009
01:18:22,416 --> 01:18:24,791
nine, ten!

1010
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:28,416
Why would you play hide and seek so late?

1011
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:30,250
If you get spooked--

1012
01:18:31,416 --> 01:18:32,958
- What?
- A ghost…

1013
01:18:36,291 --> 01:18:38,208
Hide yourself.

1014
01:18:38,291 --> 01:18:39,583
I'm going to find you now.

1015
01:18:41,791 --> 01:18:44,083
- A ghost. Get down.
- So scary.

1016
01:18:57,166 --> 01:18:58,208
First. Hide now. Quick!

1017
01:19:01,458 --> 01:19:03,541
Take a look first.

1018
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:16,125
- He's walking.
- Let's go.

1019
01:19:18,875 --> 01:19:20,250
Go. Quick!

1020
01:19:29,916 --> 01:19:31,708
Go back!

1021
01:19:32,583 --> 01:19:34,916
Where is he now? Where is he?

1022
01:19:46,458 --> 01:19:49,333
Where are you?

1023
01:19:49,416 --> 01:19:51,916
He's keen on finding us, damn kid.

1024
01:19:53,291 --> 01:19:55,250
Where are you hiding?

1025
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:58,208
Let's hide in this box.

1026
01:20:03,833 --> 01:20:05,041
Shit!

1027
01:20:05,125 --> 01:20:08,041
This is not a box. It's a coffin.

1028
01:20:08,750 --> 01:20:11,000
- Think of it as removing bad luck.
<i>- Sathu.</i>

1029
01:20:13,333 --> 01:20:14,916
Is anyone in there?

1030
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,333
Nobody, right?

1031
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:18,583
Nothing in the coffin.

1032
01:20:23,916 --> 01:20:27,083
No one, right? Nothing inside?

1033
01:20:27,166 --> 01:20:28,291
Nothing.

1034
01:20:29,333 --> 01:20:30,333
Get in, Mama.

1035
01:20:32,666 --> 01:20:34,125
Close the lid.

1036
01:20:35,166 --> 01:20:36,416
Why do you come in?

1037
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:37,791
We stick together, right?

1038
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:39,875
Go find somewhere else.
This is mine. It's too small!

1039
01:20:44,333 --> 01:20:46,000
What do I do now?

1040
01:21:03,083 --> 01:21:05,375
Oh, shit!

1041
01:21:05,458 --> 01:21:07,333
Here he comes.

1042
01:21:12,291 --> 01:21:14,583
Where are you hiding?

1043
01:21:17,125 --> 01:21:19,000
- First.
- What now?

1044
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:20,500
Can you see if he's gone?

1045
01:21:22,166 --> 01:21:25,500
Hey…

1046
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:30,750
Clear. Nothing is here.

1047
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:33,833
Why don't you get up and see it for sure?

1048
01:21:33,916 --> 01:21:35,333
Why don't you take a look yourself?

1049
01:21:35,416 --> 01:21:36,541
I can't get out.

1050
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:43,333
See? What can you really do to me,
you shitty ghost?

1051
01:21:50,750 --> 01:21:52,041
First!

1052
01:22:01,541 --> 01:22:03,208
Nothing here.

1053
01:22:09,458 --> 01:22:10,583
Why are you screaming?

1054
01:22:11,666 --> 01:22:13,250
You're being too loud!

1055
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:15,750
I get it.

1056
01:22:20,416 --> 01:22:23,208
Why didn't you shush earlier
so he wouldn't know?

1057
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,125
- Got you!
- First!

1058
01:22:56,750 --> 01:22:58,333
First, you bitch.

1059
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,250
Shush your ass. He's right in front of me!

1060
01:23:01,333 --> 01:23:04,625
Stop shushing already.

1061
01:23:04,708 --> 01:23:07,041
I can't take it anymore, you damn ghost.

1062
01:23:07,625 --> 01:23:09,458
Everybody tries to help him,

1063
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,708
but he just wants to harm others.

1064
01:23:11,791 --> 01:23:16,083
Just let him be in a vengeful circle then.

1065
01:23:17,458 --> 01:23:19,333
Calm down, First.

1066
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:22,416
I think there might be another way out.

1067
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,125
I can't be calm, Min Joon.

1068
01:23:25,208 --> 01:23:27,708
Look at my face.

1069
01:23:27,791 --> 01:23:29,708
And look at everyone.

1070
01:23:36,916 --> 01:23:37,875
Yes?

1071
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:39,916
Are you here?

1072
01:23:40,541 --> 01:23:41,916
Please come right in.

1073
01:23:46,708 --> 01:23:47,791
Who's that?

1074
01:23:55,333 --> 01:23:57,000
- Kiddee!
- Kiddee!

1075
01:23:57,083 --> 01:23:58,166
Who's that?

1076
01:23:58,250 --> 01:23:59,458
- Hello.
- Who?

1077
01:23:59,541 --> 01:24:01,125
Hello.

1078
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,458
I know everything.

1079
01:24:04,333 --> 01:24:08,291
I know that you all are in danger.

1080
01:24:08,833 --> 01:24:11,916
I'm telling you,
danger can happen at any time.

1081
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,750
You all must be mindful

1082
01:24:13,833 --> 01:24:15,791
and always think about
those you leave behind.

1083
01:24:15,875 --> 01:24:18,000
Prepare a pen. Over there.

1084
01:24:18,083 --> 01:24:21,750
Sorry, who's Bonus and who's Peary?

1085
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:23,458
I'm Peary.

1086
01:24:23,541 --> 01:24:24,458
I'm Bonus.

1087
01:24:24,541 --> 01:24:26,625
Okay, so here it is.

1088
01:24:26,708 --> 01:24:27,541
There he goes.

1089
01:24:28,958 --> 01:24:30,375
- Just a moment.
- The usual.

1090
01:24:30,458 --> 01:24:32,750
Here, have life insurance
with Thai Life Insurance

1091
01:24:32,833 --> 01:24:35,541
to insure yourself and those you love.

1092
01:24:35,625 --> 01:24:39,125
The policy details
are as I have explained.

1093
01:24:39,208 --> 01:24:40,125
And you don't have to--

1094
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:41,916
- I already have it.
- We all have it.

1095
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,083
- All of you?
- Yes.

1096
01:24:43,166 --> 01:24:44,166
Go on.

1097
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:46,541
I got so good at signing, just doing that.

1098
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:49,875
- I signed it.
- Thank you so much.

1099
01:24:53,833 --> 01:24:55,666
- Is that all?
- Just look at him.

1100
01:24:55,750 --> 01:24:57,791
Goodbye, everyone.

1101
01:24:58,291 --> 01:24:59,666
- Wait.
- Wait.

1102
01:24:59,750 --> 01:25:01,833
- Wait, let me say something.
- Sure.

1103
01:25:01,916 --> 01:25:04,666
You got here,
make some money, and you are leaving?

1104
01:25:04,750 --> 01:25:07,041
- I'll see you later. Goodbye.
- Wait, Kiddee.

1105
01:25:07,625 --> 01:25:08,833
I want to make a claim.

1106
01:25:08,916 --> 01:25:11,416
- I'll see to it, First. I got to go.
- Good.

1107
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:13,666
- Goodbye.
- What?

1108
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:15,083
What's with him?

1109
01:25:16,041 --> 01:25:17,375
Such an idol.

1110
01:25:20,458 --> 01:25:23,708
Now we're done with sales. Let's continue.

1111
01:25:24,250 --> 01:25:25,750
Yes, let's get started.

1112
01:25:26,666 --> 01:25:28,583
We can't bring his body to cremate.

1113
01:25:30,541 --> 01:25:32,000
Found nothing from the chapel.

1114
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,666
But at Nak Tinn's house…

1115
01:25:39,041 --> 01:25:42,958
I think we have to start from…

1116
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,166
"You left me."

1117
01:25:48,541 --> 01:25:50,416
It's not me, over there.

1118
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:52,291
"You left me." What does it mean?

1119
01:26:07,833 --> 01:26:09,958
- Do!
- What? Tinn!

1120
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:42,666
<i>I left him.</i>

1121
01:26:44,250 --> 01:26:45,750
<i>I broke my promise.</i>

1122
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:48,416
<i>I let him get hurt all alone.</i>

1123
01:26:51,458 --> 01:26:53,458
Don't dwell on it too much.

1124
01:26:53,541 --> 01:26:55,458
Promises that can't be kept

1125
01:26:55,541 --> 01:26:58,041
are just empty lies, that's all.

1126
01:26:58,791 --> 01:27:01,833
Novice, if you can't console,
just stay quiet.

1127
01:27:04,541 --> 01:27:08,958
And you saw intertwined Nagas underwater?

1128
01:27:10,458 --> 01:27:11,833
Intertwined Nagas?

1129
01:27:13,375 --> 01:27:14,916
What is it?

1130
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,291
Intertwined Nagas
are the combination of two Nagas.

1131
01:27:20,875 --> 01:27:23,791
It represents love.

1132
01:27:26,041 --> 01:27:30,916
<i>As the legend goes,
whenever intertwined Nagas occurred, </i>

1133
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,208
<i>fertility would bless the land. </i>

1134
01:27:33,291 --> 01:27:37,625
<i>Revered as sacred,
saw the joyful descent of deities. </i>

1135
01:27:38,625 --> 01:27:42,541
<i>The two Naga lords
willingly sacrificed their immortality,</i>

1136
01:27:42,625 --> 01:27:45,875
<i>abstaining from mating
with others of their kind.</i>

1137
01:27:46,958 --> 01:27:49,833
<i>They spat out the celestial glass,</i>

1138
01:27:49,916 --> 01:27:54,375
<i>each glass representing each Naga,
merging into one being. </i>

1139
01:27:54,458 --> 01:27:59,958
<i>With a solemn oath across five lifetimes
to never betray their vow.</i>

1140
01:28:08,833 --> 01:28:12,750
<i>It is believed that there is a submerged
statue of intertwined Nagas.</i>

1141
01:28:12,833 --> 01:28:16,375
<i>They guard and protect
the people in our village.</i>

1142
01:28:17,166 --> 01:28:19,916
I think this legend could indeed be true.

1143
01:28:21,333 --> 01:28:23,333
Legend says that

1144
01:28:23,416 --> 01:28:26,041
people who can see the intertwined Nagas

1145
01:28:27,375 --> 01:28:29,541
must be those who are closely connected

1146
01:28:29,625 --> 01:28:31,791
or the descendants of Nagas.

1147
01:28:45,875 --> 01:28:47,250
You coward.

1148
01:28:58,708 --> 01:29:01,208
You liar, you broke your promise!

1149
01:29:51,875 --> 01:29:53,458
Do you feel how I feel now?

1150
01:30:09,833 --> 01:30:10,875
<i>Hey, Yim.</i>

1151
01:30:11,750 --> 01:30:13,291
Do you see Nott and First?

1152
01:30:13,375 --> 01:30:14,208
No, I don't.

1153
01:30:14,291 --> 01:30:15,958
Where the hell are they?

1154
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:22,666
What are you eating?

1155
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,583
Those wasps that stung you.

1156
01:30:28,458 --> 01:30:30,166
Why are there so many? How did you do it?

1157
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:32,458
It's not easy, you know.

1158
01:30:33,041 --> 01:30:35,916
Before I can get these wasps,
I had to burn their nest.

1159
01:30:36,625 --> 01:30:38,250
So difficult.

1160
01:30:38,333 --> 01:30:40,541
But delicious. It's worth it.
Do you want to try?

1161
01:30:40,625 --> 01:30:42,041
Burn the wasps' nest?

1162
01:30:42,125 --> 01:30:43,125
Want to try some?

1163
01:30:46,416 --> 01:30:47,416
Tinn.

1164
01:30:49,291 --> 01:30:50,625
I'm sorry

1165
01:30:51,666 --> 01:30:53,166
that I just came back for you now.

1166
01:30:56,291 --> 01:30:58,083
<i>You left me.</i>

1167
01:30:58,791 --> 01:31:00,541
<i>You broke your promise.</i>

1168
01:31:01,250 --> 01:31:03,500
<i>You let them bully me.</i>

1169
01:31:04,041 --> 01:31:05,875
<i>You are not my friend anymore.</i>

1170
01:31:06,666 --> 01:31:10,166
<i>You left me.</i>

1171
01:31:10,250 --> 01:31:12,333
<i>You broke your promise!</i>

1172
01:31:13,291 --> 01:31:14,500
<i>You left me.</i>

1173
01:31:14,583 --> 01:31:15,791
It's my fault.

1174
01:31:16,333 --> 01:31:19,375
I left you. I didn't keep my promise.

1175
01:31:21,875 --> 01:31:23,666
Yet you never forget about me.

1176
01:31:23,750 --> 01:31:25,375
<i>But you forget about me.</i>

1177
01:31:26,750 --> 01:31:27,708
Tinn.

1178
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:32,333
The wound in the heart
may be difficult to heal,

1179
01:31:32,416 --> 01:31:34,416
but it can be done.

1180
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:37,791
If you are holding on to the grudge,

1181
01:31:38,333 --> 01:31:40,416
you won't find happiness, Tinn.

1182
01:31:41,291 --> 01:31:44,250
No matter what you think of me,
you will always be my friend.

1183
01:31:44,333 --> 01:31:45,750
I'm sorry, Tinn.

1184
01:31:45,833 --> 01:31:48,500
You are not my friend!

1185
01:32:13,541 --> 01:32:17,291
You left me!

1186
01:32:19,666 --> 01:32:20,708
Isn't this sinful?

1187
01:32:21,416 --> 01:32:22,875
Just burn it all down.

1188
01:32:22,958 --> 01:32:26,208
Through sin, it will turn into merit.
We have to build a new chapel anyway.

1189
01:32:27,291 --> 01:32:28,708
What foolish thoughts.

1190
01:32:29,916 --> 01:32:31,166
First, show them.

1191
01:32:33,791 --> 01:32:35,583
Who came up with this idea?

1192
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:40,333
I did, actually.
I planned this all by myself.

1193
01:32:40,416 --> 01:32:42,083
I came up with it and planned it.

1194
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,541
Then do it yourself.
You'll earn the merit.

1195
01:32:50,791 --> 01:32:52,208
Stop!

1196
01:32:52,916 --> 01:32:55,208
I don't want any merit. Watch my mouth.

1197
01:32:55,291 --> 01:32:56,833
I-don't-want-any-merit.

1198
01:32:56,916 --> 01:32:59,625
I'm-a-sinner. I-won't-do-it!

1199
01:32:59,708 --> 01:33:01,083
- Yes!
- Period!

1200
01:33:02,166 --> 01:33:03,708
Calm down. You don't want to do it?

1201
01:33:03,791 --> 01:33:05,208
- No, I don't.
- Neither do I.

1202
01:33:05,291 --> 01:33:09,708
You don't want to do it.
I don't want to do it, then…

1203
01:33:09,791 --> 01:33:10,750
You grinny idiot!

1204
01:33:12,333 --> 01:33:15,708
I don't want to do it.
This temple is my home.

1205
01:33:15,791 --> 01:33:17,458
You want me to burn down my home?

1206
01:33:17,541 --> 01:33:19,000
Here is to buy a new home.

1207
01:33:38,125 --> 01:33:40,083
The flame of hope.

1208
01:33:49,416 --> 01:33:51,000
- You grinny idiot!
- I can't. I just can't.

1209
01:33:51,083 --> 01:33:52,791
Can I change my mind?

1210
01:33:52,875 --> 01:33:54,708
No, hurry up. Get it over with.

1211
01:33:54,791 --> 01:33:58,125
My dear, come on.

1212
01:33:58,208 --> 01:34:01,333
Why don't you think of a new house, dear?

1213
01:34:01,916 --> 01:34:04,500
That's good…

1214
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:06,666
Good.

1215
01:34:09,083 --> 01:34:10,208
Don't burn it!

1216
01:34:12,541 --> 01:34:14,875
Yim, please don't do this.

1217
01:34:18,375 --> 01:34:20,875
- What did you do?
- I'm sorry.

1218
01:34:22,166 --> 01:34:23,583
It's done.

1219
01:34:24,625 --> 01:34:26,500
I'm sorry, Novice. I'm sorry.

1220
01:34:26,583 --> 01:34:29,916
Mission completed.
We burned it. It's done.

1221
01:34:35,333 --> 01:34:37,541
Good job, my dear!

1222
01:34:37,625 --> 01:34:39,000
Guys.

1223
01:34:39,083 --> 01:34:41,583
Guys, where is Do Min Joon?

1224
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,166
- First, where is Min Joon?
- Oh, right.

1225
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:47,666
- Where is Min Joon?
- I don't know.

1226
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:15,458
We meet again.

1227
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:20,791
Who are you?

1228
01:35:21,583 --> 01:35:23,583
When you die and reborn,

1229
01:35:24,208 --> 01:35:26,208
the body changes.

1230
01:35:27,166 --> 01:35:29,000
Even though the same spirit exists,

1231
01:35:29,958 --> 01:35:32,750
it's not the same person in every life.

1232
01:35:36,083 --> 01:35:37,416
Are you Tinn?

1233
01:35:38,666 --> 01:35:40,708
Were you a Naga in your past life?

1234
01:35:40,791 --> 01:35:42,375
I'm not the only one

1235
01:35:42,458 --> 01:35:44,083
who was a Naga.

1236
01:35:51,083 --> 01:35:52,583
In past life,

1237
01:35:53,666 --> 01:35:55,833
we both were Nagas.

1238
01:35:57,833 --> 01:36:00,833
The essence of Naga
is buried deep in our souls,

1239
01:36:01,833 --> 01:36:04,750
and the bond between us ties us together,

1240
01:36:06,041 --> 01:36:07,875
allowing us to reunite

1241
01:36:08,541 --> 01:36:09,708
and help each other.

1242
01:36:17,458 --> 01:36:18,416
Hey.

1243
01:36:19,125 --> 01:36:20,083
Wait.

1244
01:36:22,208 --> 01:36:24,333
- Hey.
- <i>Wherever the knot is tied,</i>

1245
01:36:24,416 --> 01:36:25,833
<i>untie it there.</i>

1246
01:37:14,583 --> 01:37:16,541
Tinn, I'm sorry.

1247
01:37:16,625 --> 01:37:17,666
I'm sorry.

1248
01:37:19,125 --> 01:37:21,291
Hey! It's Min Joon! In there!

1249
01:37:22,250 --> 01:37:24,208
- He's inside?
- Min Joon!

1250
01:37:24,291 --> 01:37:26,875
- Min Joon!
- Min Joon!

1251
01:37:26,958 --> 01:37:29,375
- Min Joon!
- Min Joon!

1252
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:36,500
He is trying to help you
and you hurt him, you bastard!

1253
01:37:36,583 --> 01:37:38,541
Min Joon! Let me go!

1254
01:37:48,250 --> 01:37:49,625
Min Joon!

1255
01:37:49,708 --> 01:37:50,875
Min Joon!

1256
01:37:52,208 --> 01:37:54,583
What's that? Balloon! What's that?

1257
01:37:56,833 --> 01:37:58,750
Min Joon!

1258
01:38:01,416 --> 01:38:02,375
Let go!

1259
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,083
Min Joon!

1260
01:38:05,291 --> 01:38:07,625
- It's the Naga!
- Naga?

1261
01:38:07,708 --> 01:38:08,791
The Naga!

1262
01:38:08,875 --> 01:38:11,125
It's the Naga!

1263
01:38:13,250 --> 01:38:16,375
- He comes to help. He's here!
- Please help, Naga!

1264
01:38:50,166 --> 01:38:51,791
Naga! He's here!

1265
01:38:51,875 --> 01:38:56,208
- Quick, Naga! Please help Min Joon!
- Naga!

1266
01:38:56,291 --> 01:38:57,833
Please help him.

1267
01:39:00,333 --> 01:39:01,458
- Oh shit!
- Min Joon.

1268
01:39:44,708 --> 01:39:46,291
You hurt me.

1269
01:40:45,166 --> 01:40:46,416
Please help him.

1270
01:41:37,208 --> 01:41:38,791
<i>Wherever the knot is tied,</i>

1271
01:41:38,875 --> 01:41:40,541
<i>untie it there.</i>

1272
01:41:43,750 --> 01:41:48,041
<i>Do! Help me, Do! Help!</i>

1273
01:41:48,125 --> 01:41:50,916
<i>Do, help me! Help me, Do!</i>

1274
01:42:00,708 --> 01:42:02,625
<i>Will you really come back?</i>

1275
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,375
<i>Of course. I promise.</i>

1276
01:42:16,708 --> 01:42:19,000
<i>Tinn!</i>

1277
01:42:19,083 --> 01:42:20,583
Where are you, Tinn?

1278
01:42:21,791 --> 01:42:23,041
Tinn!

1279
01:42:26,625 --> 01:42:28,916
Anybody help! My friend is drowning!

1280
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,333
Is there anyone here?

1281
01:42:30,416 --> 01:42:33,666
Please help! My friend is drowning!

1282
01:42:36,416 --> 01:42:38,708
Tinn, are you all right?

1283
01:42:38,791 --> 01:42:39,875
Tinn.

1284
01:42:40,583 --> 01:42:41,583
You left me.

1285
01:42:46,416 --> 01:42:47,791
Where is he?

1286
01:42:48,625 --> 01:42:50,791
A boy is drowning? Over there?

1287
01:42:59,541 --> 01:43:02,416
<i>Tinn, I won't let go of your hand
this time.</i>

1288
01:43:20,375 --> 01:43:24,125
<i>Thank you, Do, for never leaving me.</i>

1289
01:43:30,541 --> 01:43:31,583
<i>Tinn!</i>

1290
01:45:02,416 --> 01:45:04,541
You must be relieved now.

1291
01:45:05,708 --> 01:45:06,833
- Yes.
- Yes.

1292
01:45:07,541 --> 01:45:11,750
This chapel
will be ready for use in no time.

1293
01:45:12,375 --> 01:45:14,250
Thank you, everyone.

1294
01:45:14,875 --> 01:45:16,833
Don't mention it, Reverend Father.
It's nothing.

1295
01:45:19,208 --> 01:45:21,250
Subduing the ghost is one thing.

1296
01:45:22,583 --> 01:45:25,083
Burning down a chapel is another.

1297
01:45:28,083 --> 01:45:29,416
- It's you.
- It's you, isn't it?

1298
01:45:29,500 --> 01:45:31,958
You are a troublemaker.

1299
01:45:32,041 --> 01:45:36,000
Hey, Yim, will you go to work
with me in Bangkok?

1300
01:45:36,083 --> 01:45:38,250
Yes, of course, but…

1301
01:45:38,333 --> 01:45:40,833
Both of you
won't do anything to me, right?

1302
01:45:41,541 --> 01:45:44,625
No. If we do, we'll end up in jail.

1303
01:45:46,250 --> 01:45:47,833
But in the future…

1304
01:45:47,916 --> 01:45:49,166
- Who knows?
- Who knows?

1305
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:52,250
- Yim, we're in the temple.
- Oh, my!

1306
01:45:52,333 --> 01:45:53,458
You behave. Behave.

1307
01:45:53,541 --> 01:45:55,041
Don't be naughty.

1308
01:46:18,583 --> 01:46:19,791
Make a wish, Nott.

1309
01:46:31,250 --> 01:46:32,500
Thank you.

1310
01:46:32,583 --> 01:46:33,791
I wish you all the happiness.

1311
01:46:33,875 --> 01:46:36,041
- Thank you, everyone.
- Okay.

1312
01:46:37,958 --> 01:46:39,375
Shall we start? I'm excited.

1313
01:46:40,708 --> 01:46:41,875
Guys,

1314
01:46:41,958 --> 01:46:44,125
I want to thank all of you as well

1315
01:46:44,208 --> 01:46:45,541
who helped me and my friend.

1316
01:46:45,625 --> 01:46:47,416
No need to thank us.

1317
01:46:47,500 --> 01:46:50,208
Your friend is like our friend.

1318
01:46:50,291 --> 01:46:54,625
Sure,
Min Joon's friend is like our friend.

1319
01:46:55,208 --> 01:46:57,083
That doesn't include those gay peasants.

1320
01:47:03,916 --> 01:47:04,916
Thank you, Yim.

1321
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,041
Don't mention it.

1322
01:47:09,458 --> 01:47:10,875
Is everything okay, Nott?

1323
01:47:14,541 --> 01:47:15,791
Do you guys hear anything?

1324
01:47:17,333 --> 01:47:19,416
- No.
- I don't hear a thing.

1325
01:47:27,583 --> 01:47:29,708
Here is the pendant.

1326
01:47:29,791 --> 01:47:31,000
Brace yourself.

1327
01:47:32,458 --> 01:47:33,875
I think you should keep it.

1328
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,541
There, grab it!

1329
01:47:38,291 --> 01:47:39,916
The journey has just begun.

1330
01:47:44,916 --> 01:47:46,000
Guys,

1331
01:47:46,541 --> 01:47:48,500
I'll ordain during the school break.

1332
01:47:49,083 --> 01:47:51,916
I'd like to dedicate the merit
to all Pee Naks.

1333
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:53,416
<i>Sathu.</i>

1334
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:54,875
- That's great.
- Good.

1335
01:48:02,666 --> 01:48:04,875
- Nott.
- Nott!

1336
01:48:04,958 --> 01:48:06,458
Nott, what's wrong?

1337
01:48:06,541 --> 01:48:08,250
- Nott?
- Nott, are you all right?

1338
01:48:10,250 --> 01:48:11,583
- Nott.
- Nott.

1339
01:48:11,666 --> 01:48:12,958
Try to calm down now.

1340
01:48:20,250 --> 01:48:21,250
Calm down, bro.

1341
01:48:33,833 --> 01:48:35,083
Have you forgotten me, brother?

1342
01:48:48,208 --> 01:48:49,708
Cut two. Take three.

1343
01:48:50,791 --> 01:48:52,583
Are you saying that he is a nuisance?

1344
01:48:52,666 --> 01:48:54,166
What the hell are you driving?

1345
01:48:56,083 --> 01:48:58,625
My heart dropped, damn you.

1346
01:48:58,708 --> 01:49:00,083
Oh, you are overreacting.

1347
01:49:00,166 --> 01:49:02,208
Nott, don't take your shirt off.

1348
01:49:02,291 --> 01:49:03,583
Very good. Okay.

1349
01:49:08,333 --> 01:49:09,375
Got you!

1350
01:49:09,458 --> 01:49:10,416
Why do you suddenly turn up?

1351
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:12,750
You turn up everywhere. I'm out of here.

1352
01:49:12,833 --> 01:49:14,083
I'm scared. No!

1353
01:49:18,458 --> 01:49:19,458
Into the bog again?

1354
01:49:20,041 --> 01:49:21,708
Mark, 224.

1355
01:49:22,333 --> 01:49:23,708
Where are my shoes?

1356
01:49:24,583 --> 01:49:26,500
<i>All right. Cut! Okay.</i>

1357
01:49:26,583 --> 01:49:29,000
Intertwined Nagas are all over my face.

1358
01:49:29,083 --> 01:49:30,500
Bitch!

1359
01:49:32,666 --> 01:49:34,166
Nobody touches the candy.

1360
01:49:34,250 --> 01:49:35,500
I'll suck it then.

1361
01:49:43,875 --> 01:49:44,958
<i> Here's how it goes</i>

1362
01:49:45,041 --> 01:49:47,000
<i>There lived a neighbor auntie
Who wasn't pleased</i>

1363
01:49:47,083 --> 01:49:49,875
- Speak it out.
- Come on. We understand

1364
01:49:49,958 --> 01:49:51,833
- Now say…
- Again. Go.

1365
01:49:51,916 --> 01:49:53,833
Got to… Here, damn it.

1366
01:49:53,916 --> 01:49:55,000
Hang it.

1367
01:49:55,083 --> 01:49:58,000
Everyone, come and have a look.
Look at these thugs.

1368
01:49:58,083 --> 01:49:58,958
So chaotic.

1369
01:50:01,875 --> 01:50:03,458
Cut.

1370
01:50:05,333 --> 01:50:06,375
I feel cold on my back.

1371
01:50:06,458 --> 01:50:09,416
No, hug her. Hug.

1372
01:50:11,166 --> 01:50:12,750
No, I beg you.

1373
01:50:12,833 --> 01:50:14,875
Don't think of me that way.

1374
01:50:15,458 --> 01:50:17,291
Tighter. One more time.

1375
01:50:20,291 --> 01:50:22,333
- Don't tell me…
- Yes, one more time.

1376
01:50:33,291 --> 01:50:35,291
No, don't delete it. We just recorded it.

1377
01:50:36,916 --> 01:50:38,333
Why are you following me?

1378
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:43,291
- Tar.
- It's Nott.

1379
01:50:45,583 --> 01:50:46,791
Did we miss something?

1380
01:50:46,875 --> 01:50:48,291
- Min Joon.
- Nott!

1381
01:50:54,291 --> 01:50:55,333
Nott!

1382
01:50:58,000 --> 01:50:59,916
Okay, get up now.

1383
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,083
Don't tell me…

1384
01:51:01,166 --> 01:51:02,375
That was good. Done.

1385
