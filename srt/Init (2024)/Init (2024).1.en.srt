1
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:13,868
- Where is this?
- Oh, it's over there.

2
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,880
- Thank you.
- Sure.

3
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,285
Good afternoon.
I am Luisa Reyes.

4
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,270
I'm from the same town
as Grace Cruz.

5
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,863
Grace, the one who just
graduated from nursing?

6
00:00:39,888 --> 00:00:43,676
Yes. She gave me your address.

7
00:00:43,954 --> 00:00:46,784
She said I should try
if there is still a vacancy.

8
00:00:47,158 --> 00:00:50,801
You're lucky,
the one who reserved earlier called.

9
00:00:50,826 --> 00:00:53,238
They cancelled because they'll
study next semester instead.

10
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:55,887
Good thing there's still a vacancy.

11
00:00:57,246 --> 00:00:58,496
It's almost five o'clock.

12
00:00:59,162 --> 00:01:03,051
Here's what we'll do. Go inside
and wait for me in the living room.

13
00:01:03,077 --> 00:01:05,848
I just need to pay this bill.
It's a disconnection notice.

14
00:01:05,873 --> 00:01:08,129
- Okay. Thank you.
- Sorry for the inconvenience.

15
00:01:08,154 --> 00:01:10,191
- There's people inside. Okay?
- Okay.

16
00:05:31,376 --> 00:05:32,449
Sorry for the wait,

17
00:05:32,474 --> 00:05:33,954
the line was long at the payment center.

18
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:35,498
- It’s okay.
- What was your name again?

19
00:05:35,523 --> 00:05:36,523
I’m Luisa.

20
00:05:36,548 --> 00:05:37,592
Oh, Luisa.

21
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,571
Why didn't you turn this on?

22
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:43,728
- You’ve been waiting for a while.
- It’s okay. Thank you.

23
00:05:47,283 --> 00:05:49,610
Oh. Sorry...

24
00:05:51,239 --> 00:05:54,470
I thought the other boarders
would arrive later.

25
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:57,025
Zander, this is Luisa,

26
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,877
- our new boarder.
- Is that so?

27
00:05:59,142 --> 00:06:00,963
Welcome to the boarding house.

28
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:08,849
You'll enjoy it here.

29
00:06:09,673 --> 00:06:11,508
What I mean is,
we're all nice here.

30
00:06:12,882 --> 00:06:13,882
Excuse me...

31
00:06:16,013 --> 00:06:17,311
Anyway,

32
00:06:19,317 --> 00:06:20,676
this room here

33
00:06:21,886 --> 00:06:25,075
is where Zander
and his live-in partner Jhen stays.

34
00:06:25,316 --> 00:06:29,286
The other one is Edrick and Jeff’s room.

35
00:06:29,311 --> 00:06:31,185
It’s small, enough for two guys.

36
00:06:31,463 --> 00:06:34,263
Facing their room is yours.

37
00:06:34,863 --> 00:06:37,607
You’re two women sharing that room.
The rent is 2,500 pesos a month.

38
00:06:37,632 --> 00:06:41,161
One month advance, one month deposit.
So that's five thousand.

39
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:42,934
Wait...

40
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,279
Here it is.

41
00:06:50,735 --> 00:06:53,458
By the way, you can cook if you want.

42
00:06:53,574 --> 00:06:56,349
- Yes, Grace mentioned that to me.
- Okay.

43
00:06:56,421 --> 00:06:58,982
What the boarders usually do is chip in

44
00:06:59,007 --> 00:07:00,896
for food and gas to save money.

45
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:03,560
Okay. Thank you.

46
00:07:03,585 --> 00:07:04,888
Sit there for a while.

47
00:07:05,256 --> 00:07:07,825
- I’ll just get the contract.
- Okay.

48
00:08:04,986 --> 00:08:07,358
Mom, please don't cry.

49
00:08:07,383 --> 00:08:11,796
- I'll call you all the time.
- Manila is so far, Luisa.

50
00:08:12,006 --> 00:08:13,663
You'll be alone there.

51
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:16,193
Who will take care of you?

52
00:08:16,218 --> 00:08:19,999
What about your meals?
What if you get sick?

53
00:08:20,898 --> 00:08:23,468
Mom, please don't worry too much.

54
00:08:23,568 --> 00:08:25,288
I can take care of myself.

55
00:08:25,313 --> 00:08:28,647
Besides, the boarding house
I’ll be staying at is safe.

56
00:08:28,672 --> 00:08:31,983
It was recommended by Grace,
the Barangay Captain's daughter, right?

57
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:35,483
She also lived there
while studying in Manila.

58
00:08:35,508 --> 00:08:38,765
Maybe you shouldn't go.
Just study here instead.

59
00:08:38,797 --> 00:08:41,116
There are also colleges here in town.

60
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:43,912
That way, you won't be far from us.

61
00:08:43,937 --> 00:08:46,679
The scholarship I got is in Manila, Mom.

62
00:08:48,108 --> 00:08:49,655
It would be a waste.

63
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,101
I’ve worked and waited so long
for this opportunity.

64
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,640
Will I let fear defeat me, Mom?

65
00:08:55,665 --> 00:08:59,519
Don't worry, I'll come home immediately
during the semestral break.

66
00:08:59,544 --> 00:09:01,851
I'll also call you every day.

67
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:03,171
We’ll take your word on that!

68
00:09:06,626 --> 00:09:08,671
Take care there, okay?

69
00:09:13,968 --> 00:09:17,460
Tag him along. I like him.

70
00:09:17,652 --> 00:09:18,874
Oh my god, wait.

71
00:09:21,357 --> 00:09:22,859
Sorry, girl.

72
00:09:23,408 --> 00:09:25,554
Oh my, did I wake you up?

73
00:09:25,579 --> 00:09:28,593
- No. It's okay.
- I'm Dianne.

74
00:09:28,898 --> 00:09:30,585
Are you my new roommate?

75
00:09:31,406 --> 00:09:34,717
Wait, what kind of room is this,
it’s so boring.

76
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:37,132
What the hell? Party lights?
Crazy.

77
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,679
There. Perfect, right?

78
00:09:40,704 --> 00:09:42,913
- Is this okay with you, hon?
- Yeah, sure.

79
00:09:42,938 --> 00:09:46,070
I like having colored lights
to brighten up our room.

80
00:09:46,095 --> 00:09:48,015
Unlike the other rooms, so dull, right?

81
00:09:48,256 --> 00:09:50,816
Oh, by the way, I'm in my second year
in Mass Communication. You?

82
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:52,398
First year, BS Education.

83
00:09:53,183 --> 00:09:54,898
Hm. I see.

84
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:57,335
So, it’s your first time
in a boarding house?

85
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,030
I've been here for two years.

86
00:09:59,055 --> 00:10:02,999
Well, it's good here.
It’s actually safe.

87
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:07,124
Uh, it’s close to school,
the market, groceries, et cetera.

88
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:11,312
And there are no rude loiterers
on the streets.

89
00:10:11,337 --> 00:10:13,148
You'll enjoy it here.

90
00:10:13,602 --> 00:10:14,602
That's good to hear.

91
00:10:14,652 --> 00:10:16,554
Oh my god, wait...

92
00:10:18,164 --> 00:10:19,164
Hold on.

93
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,122
Have you met
our other boardmates?

94
00:10:22,147 --> 00:10:23,874
Just Zander.

95
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:26,677
My god.

96
00:10:27,207 --> 00:10:28,207
Handsome, right?

97
00:10:28,599 --> 00:10:31,936
Don’t worry. You'll meet
the others later during dinner.

98
00:10:32,601 --> 00:10:33,912
But before that,

99
00:10:34,247 --> 00:10:35,913
do you want a bit of...

100
00:10:36,573 --> 00:10:38,405
info about them?

101
00:10:39,646 --> 00:10:42,734
Jhen, Zander's live-in partner.

102
00:10:42,874 --> 00:10:44,154
Mass Communication’s her course.

103
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:47,609
- Oh, you’re the new boarder here?
- So good!

104
00:10:47,634 --> 00:10:50,015
- I’m Jhen.
- Luisa.

105
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,468
She's nice, but gets grumpy
when she and Zander fight.

106
00:10:54,493 --> 00:10:57,234
Maybe she’s not getting
screwed enough. Kidding!

107
00:10:57,554 --> 00:11:00,905
And that is Zander,
Jhen's live-in partner.

108
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,890
Second year, Civil Engineering.

109
00:11:02,915 --> 00:11:06,280
He attracts a lot of attention from girls,
so Jhen gets jealous often.

110
00:11:06,352 --> 00:11:09,611
- Sorry, I was on a call.
- Here’s Jeff, second year Architecture.

111
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:11,096
- Quiet...
- Oh, thank you.

112
00:11:11,121 --> 00:11:12,280
Reserved.

113
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:14,192
But he's delicious too.

114
00:11:14,217 --> 00:11:15,257
Want some more food?

115
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:18,407
And Edrick, varsity player.

116
00:11:18,432 --> 00:11:20,913
- His sport? Sex.
- Bro, I'm just going to grab something.

117
00:11:23,669 --> 00:11:26,773
- Hey, someone texted you.
- Can you hand it over to me?

118
00:11:27,292 --> 00:11:30,124
He's very horny.
Says he's pansexual,

119
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:33,999
be it woman or a man,
he’ll go for it.

120
00:11:34,024 --> 00:11:37,421
Just like me...
Just kidding!

121
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:40,820
- Come on, just a little. Please.
- I don’t want to.

122
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,734
[muffled chatter]

123
00:11:42,763 --> 00:11:44,109
It’s really tasty.

124
00:11:47,495 --> 00:11:50,577
Luisa, have you finished enrolling?

125
00:11:50,602 --> 00:11:52,421
The cashier closed on me.

126
00:11:52,601 --> 00:11:55,921
I'll go earlier tomorrow to finish this up.

127
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:57,291
- Okay.
- How about you?

128
00:11:57,525 --> 00:11:59,570
I finished this morning, girl.

129
00:11:59,634 --> 00:12:01,238
Where are you headed then?

130
00:12:02,384 --> 00:12:05,095
Out with friends.
Because you know,

131
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,945
school starts on Monday,
so it's all about fun, fun, fun

132
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,976
while we still can.
Why don’t you join me?

133
00:12:10,903 --> 00:12:13,406
- I have a lot to do.
- Okay, sure.

134
00:12:13,431 --> 00:12:15,140
I might not get home till midnight.

135
00:12:15,165 --> 00:12:18,577
I already told Arman, okay? Bye.

136
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:15,875
Luisa?

137
00:17:34,508 --> 00:17:37,136
- Get out now.
- Huh?

138
00:17:38,763 --> 00:17:39,763
Luisa?

139
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,902
We both wanted what happened.

140
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,844
My only request is that
nobody else finds out about this,

141
00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:48,556
or else, I'll report you.

142
00:17:51,749 --> 00:17:55,619
Don't worry, only the two of us
will know about this.

143
00:17:56,526 --> 00:17:58,017
Go on. Get out.

144
00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:15,596
Girl?

145
00:18:18,921 --> 00:18:19,921
Girl!

146
00:18:20,322 --> 00:18:21,322
Oh, sorry.

147
00:18:21,422 --> 00:18:23,064
My god. Girl.

148
00:18:23,601 --> 00:18:25,251
Jeff sent these for you.

149
00:18:26,729 --> 00:18:27,729
Hmm!

150
00:18:28,823 --> 00:18:31,002
Jeff's clearly courting you, huh?

151
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,429
I don't know about that.

152
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,790
Seriously, are you playing clueless?

153
00:18:36,476 --> 00:18:38,228
Do you think I haven’t noticed,

154
00:18:38,253 --> 00:18:40,613
how he’s been accompanying you
to and from school for weeks?

155
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,393
And girl,

156
00:18:42,808 --> 00:18:46,095
chocolates? And just friends?

157
00:18:46,398 --> 00:18:49,588
He hasn't said anything about courting me.

158
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:51,213
That's exactly it.

159
00:18:51,615 --> 00:18:54,451
Where were you born in
the mountains, Aunt Luisa?

160
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:56,470
Tell me,

161
00:18:58,501 --> 00:19:01,307
if he tells you he's going to court you,

162
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,064
would you say yes?

163
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,604
Jeff's nice.

164
00:19:09,509 --> 00:19:10,674
Smart...

165
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:13,401
He’s a Dean’s Lister too.

166
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:16,057
And you know, he’s like...

167
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:20,057
He looks like he'd be loyal
if you two dated.

168
00:19:20,753 --> 00:19:22,776
Like a perfect boyfriend.

169
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:25,753
Right? Right? Am I right?

170
00:19:26,276 --> 00:19:30,706
Oh, girl, I see that smile.
I know that smile.

171
00:19:30,731 --> 00:19:34,245
I know it.
You like him too, huh?

172
00:19:35,304 --> 00:19:36,635
No, I don't.

173
00:19:37,446 --> 00:19:38,658
Oh please.

174
00:19:40,028 --> 00:19:41,815
Your nose might grow longer you know.

175
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,010
Liars go to hell, you know.

176
00:19:44,488 --> 00:19:45,956
Just admit it,

177
00:19:46,156 --> 00:19:47,596
you like him too, right?

178
00:19:50,508 --> 00:19:51,757
I knew it.

179
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,532
You've been giddy since earlier.

180
00:19:58,718 --> 00:20:00,446
But it can't happen.

181
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,673
Oh girl, I get it.

182
00:20:04,024 --> 00:20:07,008
It's probably because your parents
wouldn't approve.

183
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:12,306
They want you to finish school first
before dating. Is that it?

184
00:20:12,746 --> 00:20:15,345
You don't have to tell them
right away, right?

185
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,345
Just use him as inspiration.

186
00:20:17,828 --> 00:20:21,157
Just remember, girl.
Know your limits, okay?

187
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,596
And also...

188
00:20:22,786 --> 00:20:25,720
don’t you ever, ever...

189
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,372
give in so easily.

190
00:20:28,067 --> 00:20:29,915
If only it were that simple...

191
00:20:30,966 --> 00:20:32,634
Why couldn't it be?

192
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:36,369
Whatever.

193
00:21:05,452 --> 00:21:08,237
Babe, wait up.

194
00:21:08,328 --> 00:21:09,328
What?

195
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,726
Babe, I'm going to be late.

196
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,625
We’ll do it quickly.
Come on.

197
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,094
Lorraine is about to arrive
to pick me up.

198
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:21,406
Just tell her to pick up Cara first.

199
00:21:21,585 --> 00:21:23,711
Later, okay? For now, this.

200
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,212
What are you doing?

201
00:22:37,004 --> 00:22:39,246
Cook it just like yesterday.

202
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,297
Luisa.

203
00:22:40,804 --> 00:22:42,305
Let’s eat. My treat.

204
00:22:42,438 --> 00:22:45,195
I have somewhere to go
before heading to school.

205
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:46,804
Let me come with you.

206
00:22:46,829 --> 00:22:48,828
- Miss, make it to go.
- No need.

207
00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:51,333
No, it’s okay.

208
00:22:51,358 --> 00:22:54,156
- My class starts later anyway and...
- I said, no.

209
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:57,812
No, Jeff. Don't accompany me ever again.

210
00:23:07,034 --> 00:23:09,203
Hey, that's early.

211
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:11,976
I don't have classes on Fridays.

212
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,359
Is this okay with Arman?

213
00:23:15,398 --> 00:23:17,084
He's not here, he went to Pampanga.

214
00:23:17,171 --> 00:23:18,438
Come on, let's drink.

215
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,554
Sure thing.

216
00:23:20,797 --> 00:23:22,851
- Nice.
- I’ll just change.

217
00:23:22,876 --> 00:23:24,593
- Make it fast.
- Okay.

218
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:54,280
Oh, girl...

219
00:28:54,884 --> 00:28:56,585
it’s so refreshing
to take a cold shower.

220
00:28:57,085 --> 00:28:58,296
My god.

221
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:03,222
Luisa, are you okay?

222
00:29:04,378 --> 00:29:06,053
You enjoyed it, right?

223
00:29:06,674 --> 00:29:09,796
Hey, I don't usually do that...

224
00:29:09,821 --> 00:29:11,882
it’s actually my first time
to do a three-way.

225
00:29:12,253 --> 00:29:14,296
And with someone
who isn’t my boyfriend.

226
00:29:14,321 --> 00:29:16,546
That damn alcohol.

227
00:29:16,967 --> 00:29:18,581
But I did enjoy it.

228
00:29:19,017 --> 00:29:21,210
Good thing I don't have a boyfriend.

229
00:29:21,514 --> 00:29:24,265
At least there’s no
guilt in doing it. Right?

230
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,499
[sighs]

231
00:29:26,671 --> 00:29:27,671
How about you?

232
00:29:29,408 --> 00:29:31,351
Was it also your first time
doing three-way?

233
00:29:32,929 --> 00:29:36,546
But I was surprised by you.
You're quite wild, girl.

234
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,538
To think you weren't even drunk.

235
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,976
Ah...

236
00:29:41,414 --> 00:29:45,397
So that's why Jeff
doesn't stand a chance with you,

237
00:29:45,439 --> 00:29:48,772
because you like Edrick.

238
00:29:48,812 --> 00:29:50,324
Just a heads-up, girl,

239
00:29:50,726 --> 00:29:52,757
he doesn’t know how to love.

240
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,858
All he knows is sex.
You might regret it.

241
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,507
You might be hoping for something
that won’t happen.

242
00:29:58,779 --> 00:30:00,608
I don't like him.

243
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,726
So it was all just sex?

244
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,022
Damn.

245
00:30:05,697 --> 00:30:07,741
Looks like we're alike.

246
00:30:08,193 --> 00:30:10,718
I've liked Edrick for a long time.

247
00:30:10,743 --> 00:30:13,390
But it’s impossible,
for him to be my boyfriend.

248
00:30:13,993 --> 00:30:15,515
But at least now...

249
00:30:15,844 --> 00:30:17,936
I’ve already tasted him, right?

250
00:30:18,336 --> 00:30:20,936
Who would’ve thought he had
a damn big note.

251
00:30:21,343 --> 00:30:23,546
I felt like being devirginized
all over again.

252
00:30:24,382 --> 00:30:27,061
I gave up my virginity early, girl.

253
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:30,458
I was only 16 years old then
with my first boyfriend.

254
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:32,795
Shit. Do you know
what he did to me?

255
00:30:32,982 --> 00:30:37,515
I caught him with another girl.
That jerk.

256
00:30:39,013 --> 00:30:40,013
How about you?

257
00:30:41,441 --> 00:30:42,441
Hm...

258
00:30:43,695 --> 00:30:45,124
When was your first?

259
00:30:45,935 --> 00:30:47,569
With your first boyfriend?

260
00:30:49,027 --> 00:30:50,897
- Second?
- No.

261
00:30:50,943 --> 00:30:52,025
Third?

262
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,050
Fourth?

263
00:30:53,296 --> 00:30:55,702
It wasn’t my boyfriend
who did it.

264
00:30:57,037 --> 00:30:58,843
Not your boyfriend?

265
00:30:59,522 --> 00:31:00,834
You’re crazy.

266
00:31:01,487 --> 00:31:03,593
You’re even wilder than I am.

267
00:31:03,961 --> 00:31:05,804
It was our neighbor.

268
00:31:07,438 --> 00:31:09,460
Then, a classmate.

269
00:31:10,016 --> 00:31:11,787
Then, my godfather.

270
00:31:12,734 --> 00:31:14,647
Then, my teacher.

271
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:18,882
Then, my cousin’s boyfriend.

272
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,890
Then...

273
00:31:22,469 --> 00:31:25,483
Then, I can't remember anymore.

274
00:31:26,313 --> 00:31:29,420
I can’t remember
because there were so many.

275
00:31:30,273 --> 00:31:31,647
So many...

276
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,874
Sorry.

277
00:31:37,215 --> 00:31:40,249
I can’t control myself, Dianne.

278
00:31:42,529 --> 00:31:44,866
I can’t help it.

279
00:31:46,476 --> 00:31:47,801
Sorry. Sorry.

280
00:31:58,872 --> 00:31:59,872
Luisa...

281
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,538
I spoke with a psychiatrist...

282
00:32:04,325 --> 00:32:05,325
For what?

283
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:07,154
For you to have a consultation.

284
00:32:08,142 --> 00:32:09,672
I don't want to, Dianne.

285
00:32:09,776 --> 00:32:12,788
Girl, you need professional help.

286
00:32:12,813 --> 00:32:15,007
I already told them about
what's happening to you.

287
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,343
Their initial finding is

288
00:32:17,677 --> 00:32:18,882
you are a nymphomaniac.

289
00:32:18,907 --> 00:32:20,936
Why did you tell someone else?

290
00:32:21,295 --> 00:32:23,811
Luisa, it's a psychiatrist.

291
00:32:23,836 --> 00:32:27,116
Even so... This condition
is embarrassing.

292
00:32:27,589 --> 00:32:29,640
I don't want others to know.

293
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:32,054
I don't want to be laughed at.

294
00:32:32,126 --> 00:32:34,358
I don't want people
to find me disgusting.

295
00:32:34,383 --> 00:32:38,366
I told you that because I thought
I could trust you.

296
00:32:38,425 --> 00:32:40,429
You can trust me...

297
00:32:40,454 --> 00:32:42,499
I won't tell anybody else.

298
00:32:42,734 --> 00:32:45,741
- But you need to see a psychiatrist.
- I don’t want to.

299
00:32:46,866 --> 00:32:48,677
I don’t want my mom
to know about this.

300
00:32:48,702 --> 00:32:51,210
- They won't find out. I promise.
- No.

301
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:53,450
- Come on, Luisa.
- I said no, Dianne.

302
00:32:53,475 --> 00:32:56,351
- So they can prescribe you the right...
- I don’t want to.

303
00:32:57,046 --> 00:32:58,329
Luisa!

304
00:35:30,564 --> 00:35:31,564
Arman?

305
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:32,879
Yes, Luisa?

306
00:35:32,976 --> 00:35:36,362
I’m in Pampanga,
I’ll be back tomorrow.

307
00:35:36,807 --> 00:35:38,268
Why? What’s wrong?

308
00:36:33,709 --> 00:36:36,021
Oh, hey, Luisa.
What’s up?

309
00:36:36,155 --> 00:36:38,762
Are you looking for Jeff?
There he is, asleep.

310
00:36:38,982 --> 00:36:41,280
I don't know what's with him,
he's been drinking for weeks.

311
00:36:41,305 --> 00:36:43,327
I've asked him why but...

312
00:40:27,404 --> 00:40:28,447
Babe...

313
00:40:34,139 --> 00:40:36,639
You bastards!

314
00:40:38,287 --> 00:40:39,372
Get over here.

315
00:40:39,913 --> 00:40:41,975
- Babe...
- Come here.

316
00:40:42,098 --> 00:40:43,182
That’s enough...

317
00:40:43,667 --> 00:40:44,751
Get over here.

318
00:40:45,351 --> 00:40:46,944
You slut!

319
00:40:49,911 --> 00:40:53,319
- Jhen, what’s happening?
- You whore!

320
00:40:54,316 --> 00:40:56,632
Jhen, that’s enough.
What’s happening here?

321
00:40:56,657 --> 00:40:58,905
I just caught my boyfriend in bed

322
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:00,882
with your slutty roommate!

323
00:41:01,896 --> 00:41:03,665
- Luisa?
- Come here!

324
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:04,690
- Enough.
- Jhen!

325
00:41:05,882 --> 00:41:08,022
You bitch!

326
00:41:08,047 --> 00:41:11,803
You know Zander is my boyfriend,
but you still went after him!

327
00:41:11,828 --> 00:41:13,835
You act all innocent and then...

328
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:16,710
- Jhen, that’s enough.
- You're a whore!

329
00:41:16,735 --> 00:41:19,803
Did you enjoy my boyfriend? Huh?

330
00:41:19,828 --> 00:41:22,944
Why not Jeff? Or Edrick?

331
00:41:22,969 --> 00:41:24,695
They don't have girlfriends.

332
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,920
Or Arman?

333
00:41:25,945 --> 00:41:27,428
Answer me!

334
00:41:27,453 --> 00:41:29,975
- Jhen, stop.
- Answer me!

335
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,046
Don't tell me you're in love
with my boyfriend,

336
00:41:32,071 --> 00:41:33,593
or I might kill you!

337
00:41:33,618 --> 00:41:34,780
Argh!

338
00:41:34,805 --> 00:41:37,022
You’re in love with my boyfriend?

339
00:41:37,047 --> 00:41:40,061
You’re in love with him? Answer me!

340
00:41:40,086 --> 00:41:42,944
Answer me!

341
00:41:42,969 --> 00:41:45,053
- Do you love him? Do you?
- Jhen, stop it!

342
00:41:45,078 --> 00:41:46,585
I don’t love him!

343
00:41:47,803 --> 00:41:49,771
I don't love them!

344
00:41:50,372 --> 00:41:54,147
I don't love Edrick
and I don’t love Arman!

345
00:41:54,172 --> 00:41:55,874
Are you saying...

346
00:41:55,899 --> 00:41:58,444
you've been with
all of them? Tell me!

347
00:41:58,469 --> 00:42:02,428
What? You’ve been
with all of them?

348
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:04,585
So you're not just a slut!

349
00:42:04,917 --> 00:42:08,264
You’re a pervert! A pervert!

350
00:42:08,842 --> 00:42:10,413
Pervert!

351
00:42:10,438 --> 00:42:12,678
- Arman!
- Move out of the way!

352
00:42:12,703 --> 00:42:15,007
- Get out of the way.
- [screaming]

353
00:42:15,248 --> 00:42:17,190
[groaning] Let go of...

354
00:42:17,722 --> 00:42:20,389
- Enough!
- That's enough, Jhen...

355
00:42:20,414 --> 00:42:24,639
- Why me, Zander?
- I’m sorry.

356
00:42:25,733 --> 00:42:29,070
- Zander, why me?
- I’m sorry. I’m sorry...

357
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:43,155
Babe. Babe...

358
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:45,061
Babe, let’s talk about this.

359
00:42:45,086 --> 00:42:47,233
- It only happened once...
- Shut up!

360
00:42:47,286 --> 00:42:49,983
It won’t happen again.
You know that I love you so much.

361
00:42:50,008 --> 00:42:51,008
Please don’t leave me.

362
00:42:51,281 --> 00:42:53,139
I’ll do everything... Babe...

363
00:42:54,362 --> 00:42:56,232
- Babe...
- So you're still alive.

364
00:42:56,711 --> 00:42:58,522
I'll break up with Zander...

365
00:42:58,684 --> 00:43:00,733
So? Are you happy now?

366
00:43:00,905 --> 00:43:03,115
You can have all these men
for yourself.

367
00:43:03,398 --> 00:43:05,788
Including Zander,
you can have him if you want.

368
00:43:06,265 --> 00:43:07,465
You’re happy with that, right?

369
00:43:07,811 --> 00:43:09,115
Because you’re a freak!

370
00:43:09,383 --> 00:43:12,928
Jhen, enough.
Luisa is pregnant.

371
00:43:13,046 --> 00:43:14,046
[scoffs]

372
00:43:16,571 --> 00:43:19,177
Great. My question to you is,

373
00:43:19,459 --> 00:43:22,147
how does it feel to be pregnant

374
00:43:22,172 --> 00:43:24,507
and not know
who the father of your child is?

375
00:43:24,819 --> 00:43:26,018
That's your karma!

376
00:43:26,632 --> 00:43:28,186
You damn freak!

377
00:43:31,197 --> 00:43:32,436
Get out of my way.

378
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:34,460
Babe...

379
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:38,519
Jhen...

380
00:43:40,276 --> 00:43:41,538
Are you okay?

381
00:43:44,148 --> 00:43:45,148
Mom...

382
00:44:08,418 --> 00:44:09,715
I’m sorry, Mom.

383
00:44:11,323 --> 00:44:12,935
I’m sorry.

384
00:44:21,122 --> 00:44:25,166
Nymphomania is a psychological disorder

385
00:44:25,191 --> 00:44:27,744
where a woman

386
00:44:27,769 --> 00:44:31,213
has an excessive need and obsession

387
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:34,306
with sex that are
difficult to control.

388
00:44:34,424 --> 00:44:36,947
But there is a cure for this illness.

389
00:44:38,266 --> 00:44:41,588
You have to undergo psychotherapy.

390
00:44:41,841 --> 00:44:44,955
I’ll also prescribe some
medications for you.

391
00:44:45,046 --> 00:44:47,720
But this isn't easy to treat.

392
00:44:47,745 --> 00:44:51,002
It requires perseverance, patience,

393
00:44:51,172 --> 00:44:53,564
and faith in God

394
00:44:53,589 --> 00:44:56,801
to completely overcome

395
00:44:56,826 --> 00:44:58,953
this psychological disorder.

396
00:44:59,593 --> 00:45:02,455
It can also be helpful

397
00:45:02,752 --> 00:45:06,799
to have family and friends
to support you.

398
00:45:08,478 --> 00:45:09,947
I’ll be here for you.

399
00:45:35,905 --> 00:45:36,947
My child,

400
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:41,098
I know you are the
result of my mistakes.

401
00:45:41,816 --> 00:45:43,786
Forgive me, my child.

402
00:45:44,379 --> 00:45:46,083
I was weak...

403
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,262
I promise,

404
00:45:50,534 --> 00:45:55,020
I will make sure that my mistakes
will not happen again.

405
00:45:55,818 --> 00:45:59,700
And I will do everything
to make our lives right,

406
00:46:00,178 --> 00:46:02,738
your life, my child.

407
