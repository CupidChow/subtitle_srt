Please drive faster.

19
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,500
Young Master, what did you

20
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,220
promise Miss Gu?

21
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,100
I want you

22
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,060
to be my boyfriend.

23
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:26,820
Huh?

24
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:28,980
What does that mean?

25
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,540
It means

26
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,100
I want you to come here every day

27
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,180
to teach me about incense and its use

28
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,380
until the money is repaid.

29
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,540
Every day, okay?

30
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:39,460
Alright,

31
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,540
I promise.

32
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,700
Since Miss Gu is so straightforward,

33
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,500
you must

34
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:45,980
keep your promise

35
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,620
and do it well.

36
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:48,780
Of course.

37
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,060
Isn't your money...

38
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:01,700
Father,

39
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,610
this money came from dubious sources.

40
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,540
What do you mean?

41
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,020
Well done.

42
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,260
Organize everything.

43
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,540
We're heading to Nanjing.

44
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,380
Father.

45
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,860
Since I've completed my task,

46
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,060
I want

47
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,820
to ask you for something.

48
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,540
When Master collects the money later,

49
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,340
don't forget to ask him

50
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,420
for something.

51
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,500
Speak.

52
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:35,900
What do you want?

53
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,580
The management rights
to Zhang's Department Store.

54
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,380
I believe that

55
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,060
I've inherited your skills

56
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,500
in commerce.

57
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:45,700
Father, if you're

58
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,500
willing to entrust
Zhang's Department Store

59
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,820
to me,

60
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,740
I can double

61
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,700
its profits.

62
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,300
Impudent!

63
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,820
How dare you directly
make demands of your father?

64
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,060
Do you have no manners?

65
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,540
(If we speak so bluntly to Master,)

66
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,580
(I'm afraid)

67
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,780
(he won't agree.)

68
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,260
(Whether Master agrees
isn't the point.)

69
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,580
(The important thing is his reaction.)

70
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,860
If Master hesitates even slightly,

71
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,180
it means

72
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,500
he hasn't yet regarded you as an enemy.

73
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:16,820
(And if)

74
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,340
(his reaction is otherwise?)

75
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,700
(Then it means your ambition)

76
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,180
(has already been noticed by him.)

77
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,700
(And we'll have no retreat.)

78
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,500
(It'd be equivalent to)

79
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,940
(formally declaring war on him.)

80
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,260
Ambition is a good thing,

81
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,940
just like when I was young.

82
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,740
(Have you considered
that if we do this,)

83
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,580
(it might drive us to a dead end?)

84
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,700
Doing this

85
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,580
is precisely to see the dead end.

86
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,180
I'll think about it

87
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,460
when I return from Nanjing.

88
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:50,940
Yes.

89
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,780
Then which path will we take to survive?

90
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,860
Have you decided?

91
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:03,980
The Gu family.

92
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,100
Just now,

93
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,780
what expression did Master have?

94
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,420
I'm afraid we're about to engage
in direct conflict with them.

95
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,180
On the way back,

96
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,300
you said

97
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,260
the Gu family

98
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,860
was a way out.

99
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,460
Will you ask the governor again?

100
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,700
Have you noticed that today,

101
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,140
in the Governor's Manor,

102
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,940
Miss Gu Yanran seemed

103
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,020
to like you very much?

104
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,380
I know what you mean.

105
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:32,860
It won't happen.

106
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:39,900
Young Master.

107
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,300
Let's go.

108
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,780
We can't wait any longer.

109
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,620
If we delay,

110
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,420
Zhang Hanyi will walk all over you.

111
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,620
When father was home,

112
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,780
I couldn't act freely.

113
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,580
Now that he's gone far away,

114
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,660
watch how

115
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,580
I'll finish him off.

116
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,500
Young Master,

117
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,860
wake up!

118
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,540
Come in.

119
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:25,980
Young Master,

120
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,700
the tailor shop has delivered
your new clothes.

121
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,740
New clothes?

122
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,940
But I didn't order any.

123
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,420
I ordered them for you.

124
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,380
Why are you giving me clothes?

125
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,700
Because today

126
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,180
is your birthday.

127
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,260
My birthday?

128
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,580
Even my father doesn't know my birthday.

129
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,020
How did you know it?

130
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,260
There are many people
who care about you.

131
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,620
How difficult could it be
to know your birthday?

132
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,060
Today is the first frost.

133
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,860
After the frost descends,

134
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,060
the chill will follow.

135
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,220
Only by enduring the frost

136
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,260
can one achieve true character.

137
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,860
I suppose the name Zhang Hanyi

138
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,540
comes from that sentiment.

139
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,140
My name was chosen

140
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,860
by my mother.

141
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,380
But she passed away

142
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,700
when I was very young.

143
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,380
Don't move.

144
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,460
Alright.

145
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,100
Young Master, would you like
to go out for a walk

146
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,380
and take a day off?

147
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:47,500
Where to?

148
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,820
To celebrate your birthday.

149
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,300
Alright.

150
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:51,820
Come,

151
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,220
let's go.

152
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,460
This is the first time
I'm celebrating my birthday.

153
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,340
Thank you.

154
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,020
Where are we now?

155
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,900
The Governor's Manor.

156
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,900
Why did you bring me here?

157
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,900
You promised Miss Gu to teach her
about incense and its use,

158
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,980
so you must keep your word.

159
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,060
Why don't you fulfill the promise first,

160
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,860
and then we'll go celebrate?

161
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,500
So, you gave me a suit

162
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,140
just to please

163
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,500
Gu Yanran?

164
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,690
Only by maintaining good relations
with the Gu family

165
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,700
can we stand against Master.

166
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,140
From childhood to now,

167
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,580
this is the first time
anyone's remembered my birthday.

168
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,820
It's also the first time

169
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,100
someone has given me a gift.

170
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,620
So I just want to ask you one thing.

171
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,100
Did you give me a gift

172
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,220
out of sincerity

173
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,820
or pretense?

174
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,020
To help you quickly
become the Zhang family owner.

175
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,020
Understood.

176
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,100
What are you doing here?

177
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,100
What do you mean, Governor?

178
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,190
I heard my sister lent you
30 thousand silver coins.

179
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,570
Miss Gu generously provided funds.

180
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,940
I'm deeply grateful.

181
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,460
So I came to teach Miss Gu about incense

182
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,460
and fulfill my promise.

183
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,460
All the money in the Gu family
is earned by me.

184
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,300
Why don't you thank me?

185
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,740
Not a word, huh?

186
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:00,980
Fine.

187
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,700
Practice with me.

188
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,100
Consider it your way

189
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,300
of thanking me.

190
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,020
Alright.

191
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,100
I happen to want to fight too.

192
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,300
Liancheng.

193
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,860
What are you doing?

194
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,620
Zhang Hanyi is my guest.

195
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,060
Are you alright?

196
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,060
My brother is like that.

197
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:21,940
Don't mind him.

198
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,380
Come on,

199
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,700
let's go to the incense room.

200
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,260
Incense?

201
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,700
Let me try too.

202
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,500
Good.

203
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,340
This smells good.

204
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,460
How about this one?

205
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,180
This one smells better.

206
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,500
Liancheng,

207
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,900
can you not mess around?

208
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,660
I'm taking a class.

209
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,860
Just go do your thing.

210
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,780
I want to learn too.

211
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:54,980
I'll just sit in

212
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,860
and not speak, okay?

213
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,100
No.

214
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,380
Just go out.

215
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,940
Go take care of your business.

216
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,060
Mr. Zhang,

217
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,420
let's continue with the lesson.

218
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,660
Alright.

219
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,300
Mr. Zhang,

220
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,620
what's written on this handkerchief?

221
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,180
"Love is like the wind."

222
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,940
Did you know I understand French
and embroidered this for me?

223
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,620
You got it wrong.

224
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,560
Wanyue gave this to me.

225
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,500
Who is Wanyue?

226
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,980
My personal maid.

227
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,780
That's impossible.

228
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,700
How could a maid know French?

229
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,820
You're lying.

230
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,980
You like me, don't you?

231
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,500
Governor.

232
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,380
When did you get here?

233
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,140
Why do you walk so silently?

234
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,860
Calm down, Governor.

235
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,420
I didn't mean anything else.

236
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,720
It's just that it seems

237
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,700
you don't like my young master.

238
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,740
So I wanted to know why.

239
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,260
Could it be because Miss Gu

240
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,500
likes my young master?

241
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,900
Yanran is my sister.

242
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,100
She can't like a blind man.

243
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,420
What right do you have
to look down on him?

244
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,620
If it weren't for him,

245
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,980
Miss Gu wouldn't have smelled Ruoshui
in her lifetime.

246
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,700
Say that again?

247
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,500
If you truly care about your sister,

248
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,500
you wouldn't want
to see her suffer, right?

249
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:23,500
Yanran...

250
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,940
Yanran must want her brother's blessing,

251
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,180
not to be torn apart.
