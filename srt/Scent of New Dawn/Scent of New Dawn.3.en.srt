00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:14,300
Master,

19
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,420
better not force it.

20
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,700
I've long grown tired

21
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,780
of matters between men and women.

22
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,260
I'm not tired yet.

23
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,340
I'm not tired yet.

24
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,100
I'm not tired yet.

25
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,020
I still want it.

26
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:35,980
Master.

27
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,300
I'll strangle you, you wretched woman.

28
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,660
I'll strangle you!

29
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,580
Go back to your courtyard now.

30
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:14,900
Without my permission,

31
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,300
you're not allowed to leave.

32
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,260
Did you hear me?

33
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:18,700
Yes.

34
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,500
My father

35
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:14,780
can't get it up?

36
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:16,580
Yes.

37
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,860
That's why I can't be pregnant.

38
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,500
It's almost showing.

39
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,500
Think of something.

40
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,420
We can't keep the baby.

41
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,780
I can't leave the manor.

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,140
Buy the miscarriage medicine.

43
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,420
Remember, don't buy it in Jiang City.

44
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,620
And be quick.

45
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,420
So much trouble.

46
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:33,780
Fine,

47
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,220
leave it to me.

48
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,180
Stay out of it.

49
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:37,900
Let's go.

50
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,020
They're gone.

51
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,180
You've learned so many secrets
on one night.

52
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,020
What's your next move?

53
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,060
Stay still for now.

54
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,660
Secrets held in hand

55
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,700
are like a sword.

56
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,480
If you strike at the wrong time,

57
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,580
you'll only hurt yourself.

58
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,180
Let's go.

59
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,380
Madam Mu,

60
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,700
why don't you try this?

61
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,300
This will cover the scars.

62
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,940
When did you come in?

63
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,900
Two days ago, I accidentally got hurt
and have been using this balm.

64
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,140
See? It covers them completely.

65
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:34,660
Leave.

66
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,300
Madam Mu, don't fear me.

67
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,340
Let me help you.

68
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,960
Come, apply this first and see.

69
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:41,620
Look.

70
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,300
We can try.

71
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,220
Just try.

72
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,300
See?

73
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,340
It's completely covered.

74
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,620
It's really gone.

75
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,660
I just

76
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,100
don't want

77
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,980
anyone to see the scars on me.

78
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,260
I understand.

79
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,940
You have one on your neck as well.

80
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,060
Don't move.

81
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:19,940
Done.

82
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,220
This is my mother's secret formula.

83
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,460
Isn't it effective?

84
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,300
I don't think

85
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,620
I've ever seen you before.

86
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,100
Which courtyard are you from?

87
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,300
Madam Mu,

88
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,900
I'm from Young Master Hanyi's courtyard.

89
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,620
You can call me Wanyue.

90
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,460
Thank you.

91
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,700
Stop.

92
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,220
You're Wanyue?

93
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,060
Yes.

94
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,060
Madam Chunxiao.

95
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,620
You're the one Qianli mentioned,

96
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,390
the wretched woman.

97
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,780
Madam Chunxiao,

98
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,940
did I do something wrong?

99
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,140
You're a maid.

100
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,860
Do I need a reason to hit you?

101
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,700
How dare you hit me?

102
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:22,780
Madam Chunxiao,

103
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,980
I must return this slap.

104
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,210
My mother said I've had demonic energy
since I was little.

105
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,900
If someone hits me,
I must hit them back.

106
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,340
Otherwise, the one who hit me
will lose their blessings.

107
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,660
You dare mock me?

108
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,820
I haven't finished.

109
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,620
Madam Chunxiao.

110
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,380
What I have to say is crucial,

111
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:35,980
but

112
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,580
I can only tell you.

113
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,620
It's true.

114
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,540
Please believe me.

115
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,540
Madam Chunxiao,

116
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,620
I know your secret.

117
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,100
Don't provoke me.

118
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:50,700
Otherwise,

119
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,340
I'll let the entire household know.

120
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:56,620
Madam Chunxiao,

121
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,780
I won't do it again.

122
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,060
Please spare me.

123
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,420
Go.

124
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,820
Thank you.

125
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,380
You said you want revenge
on Zhang Wencai.

126
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,940
What's the plan?

127
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,980
Though the Zhang family is large,

128
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,820
it's far from indestructible.

129
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,660
We can break it down step by step,

130
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,740
from the inside out.

131
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,100
With just a blind man

132
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,540
and a maid?

133
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,740
I'll be your eyes,

134
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,700
so you won't be blind.

135
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,500
You'll be my backbone,

136
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,540
so I'll no longer be a maid.

137
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,060
(Even so,)

138
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,780
(we're just two ants
clinging to each other for warmth.)

139
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:05,940
(Without strength,)

140
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,380
(how can we bring down a mountain?)

141
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,890
(Since we don't have strength,)

142
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,580
(we must find a way)

143
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,500
(to obtain it.)

144
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:19,180
(What do you plan to do?)

145
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:26,740
Young Master,

146
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,420
to bring down Zhang Wencai,

147
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:29,860
what we need

148
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,740
is a higher patron.

149
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,300
And now, that patron

150
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,420
has already arrived at the gate.

151
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:45,020
(Gu Liancheng, Governor of Jiang City)

152
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,380
Ah,

153
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,780
you're indeed unpretentious, Governor.

154
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,300
Indeed a true soldier's demeanor

155
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,540
and a pillar of the nation.

156
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,060
Spare me the pleasantries.

157
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,680
I asked you to recreate
a perfume for me.

158
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:58,860
Today,

159
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,220
I've come to collect it.

160
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:01,660
Of course.

161
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,860
Governor, please come in.

162
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,260
So

163
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,420
you already knew

164
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,860
the governor would come here?

165
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,860
And you knew

166
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,340
how to use him.

167
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,100
There's a certain scent

168
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,060
the governor has sought for two years.

169
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,400
No one else has been
able to recreate it.

170
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,380
I've heard the Zhang family

171
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,980
are the top incense makers.

172
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,340
Master Zhang, don't let me down.

173
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,020
Governor,

174
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,100
rest assured.

175
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,700
My master

176
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,980
fully understands your intention.

177
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:35,940
Young Master,

178
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,420
this is your chance.

179
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,380
As long as you gain
the governor's favor,

180
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,500
he'll be our patron.

181
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,500
Do you know the saying,

182
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,760
"Being near the patron
is like being near a tiger"?

183
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,660
Indeed, he's a tiger,

184
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,540
but also a strong support.

185
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,260
With him as support,

186
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,420
we can act against Zhang Wencai

187
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,940
without fear.

188
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,140
Great.

189
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,500
You broke

190
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,220
one of the pair of vases

191
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,540
used by Emperor Chongzhen,

192
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,380
leaving the other
as the only one of its kind.

193
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:08,980
Well done.

194
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,340
Zhang Wencai,

195
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,900
you're trying to fool me with these?

196
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,860
There's something more substantial.

197
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,260
Carry it in.

198
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,420
Governor.

199
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,140
If I wanted money,

200
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,540
would I need to play games with you?

201
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,580
Three days.

202
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,180
I'll give you three more days.

203
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,900
If you can't create the perfume
I want in three days,

204
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,180
it won't just be vases that get smashed,

205
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,220
huh?

206
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:55,940
Take it away.

207
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,180
Don't waste Master Zhang's
good intentions.

208
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,460
I'll leave it to you, Master Zhang.

209
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,180
You're so sure

210
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,420
he'll give the task to me?

211
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,740
Master,

212
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,500
I've asked all the incense makers
in Jiang City.

213
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,220
They said

214
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,220
there's no scent

215
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,820
in it.

216
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,460
It seems the governor

217
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,980
is determined to have it.

218
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,860
But we can't recreate it.

219
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,700
Master Zhang,

220
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,740
Young Master Hanyi is quite talented.

221
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,820
Why not let him try?

222
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,900
If he succeeds,

223
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,300
it'll be a pleasant surprise.

224
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,700
He's my own flesh and blood.

225
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,340
What if he fails?

226
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,700
Let him take the blame?

227
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:48,660
Forgive me.

228
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,700
Forgive me.

229
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,140
Some sins are best borne

230
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,340
by one's own

231
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,780
