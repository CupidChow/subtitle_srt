Father.

20
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,780
Laurent's matter was
really not my fault.

21
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,380
It was my brother who set me up.

22
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,260
But rest assured,

23
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,860
I didn't let him take advantage of me.

24
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,340
I didn't lose a single cent.

00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,620
(Chariot, Soldier, Cannon)

26
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,260
Qianli,

27
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,300
come sit.

28
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:24,700
Oh.

29
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:33,980
This matter is strange.

30
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,140
Where did Hanyi

31
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,420
get the money
to open a department store?

32
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,100
This is a minor matter.

33
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,140
Forget it.

34
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,820
(Chariot, Soldier, Cannon, Pawn)

35
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,940
Watch the game carefully.

36
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,260
I'll teach you a few tricks today.

37
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,900
Are you teaching me chess,

38
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,900
or teaching me how to deal with Hanyi?

39
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,460
The river is three parts wide,

40
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,540
but strategy runs deep.

41
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,540
The way of chess

42
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,420
(Chariot, Soldier, Cannon, Pawn, Horse)
is no different from battle.

43
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,260
(Wanxiang Department Store)

44
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,340
We'll stay here for now.

45
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,460
There's still very little here.

46
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,340
We'll add more things later.

47
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,420
Why is there a piano here?

48
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,100
That night at the Zhang Manor,

49
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,420
you didn't get to play.

50
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,460
I wanted to help fulfill
that wish for you.

51
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,580
Thank you for remembering.

52
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,540
Just saying thank you isn't enough.

53
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,740
Can you

54
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,820
be my teacher

55
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,140
and teach me to play?

56
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,260
Sure.

57
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,860
But Young Master,

58
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,460
I'm a very

59
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,900
strict teacher.

60
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,060
Come,

61
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,300
listen.

62
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,020
Listen to this melody.

63
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,220
It says that right now,

64
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,820
I'm very happy.

65
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,740
Young Master, you're amazing.

66
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,300
You're quite talented at the piano.

67
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,780
It's not talent.

68
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,620
I watched others play when I was little.

69
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,100
Back then, I...

70
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,380
I wasn't blind yet.

71
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,540
Actually, you've never told me

72
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,820
how your eyes

73
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,740
ended up like this.

74
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,540
(Eighteen years ago,)

75
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,700
(my mother died of illness.)

76
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,210
(I walked all the way
from my hometown to Jiang City)

77
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,420
(to find my father.)

78
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,820
(I only knew)

79
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,200
(that he worked as a housekeeper
at the Lin Manor.)

80
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,540
(Unexpectedly,)

81
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,700
- (when I arrived in Jiang City,)
- Father!

82
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,700
(the Lin Manor became the Zhang Manor.)

83
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,300
Father!

84
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,890
- (My father rose from a housekeeper)
- Father!

85
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,100
- (to becoming Master Zhang.)
- Father!

86
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:07,700
Father!

87
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,460
Kid, how can you cut in line?

88
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,540
Go to the back and line up.

89
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,300
Go away.

90
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,820
Hey, go.

91
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,500
Don't, please.

92
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:13,980
Let me go!

93
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:14,340
Don't.

94
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,020
Child,

95
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,300
even if you didn't say anything,

96
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,380
I'd still give food to you.

97
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,380
Here,

98
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,260
take two buns.

99
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,460
We want two as well.

100
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,180
Go away!

101
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,100
I'm not leaving!

102
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,220
Father!

103
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,180
I'm Hanyi.

104
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,340
You used to be a housekeeper
at the Lin Manor.

105
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,820
Your hometown is Jun County.

106
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,300
Everyone there knows you're my father.

107
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,500
Father,

108
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,900
mother is dead.

109
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,620
Are you abandoning me?

110
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,660
Divorce me.

111
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:52,740
My dear,

112
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:53,700
it's all my fault.

113
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,100
I was young and foolish

114
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,100
and made a mistake.

115
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,060
Is youth the problem?

116
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,180
You already had a wife

117
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,470
but deliberately hid it from me.

118
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:04,780
Zhang Wencai,

119
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,020
tell me honestly today.

120
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,380
Did you marry me for my family's money?

121
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,780
I've always been devoted to you.

122
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,780
Heaven can testify.

123
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,420
I didn't tell you
because I cared too much about you.

124
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,300
I was afraid that if you knew,
you'd leave me.

125
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,500
Besides,

126
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,100
the child will be born soon.

127
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,780
If we separate,

128
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,540
the child

129
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,700
will be fatherless.

130
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,340
You're using the child to threaten me?

131
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,980
Let me tell you, Zhang Wencai.

132
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,580
My family can afford
to raise this child.

133
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,020
A child without a father

134
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,180
can still live.

135
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,380
Anyway,

136
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,900
his mother is already dead.

137
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,100
I'll let him be your son

138
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,340
and call you mother, okay?

139
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,100
Call me mother?

140
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,660
A village bumpkin?

141
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,900
Never in this lifetime.

142
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,460
My dear,

143
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,740
please forgive me.

144
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,060
I'll kneel before you.

145
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,300
In any case, I'll handle this matter
in a way that satisfies you.

146
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,300
How will you satisfy me?

147
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,340
By sending him back home?

148
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,300
So he can pop up

149
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,940
one day,

150
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,100
replace my child,

151
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,620
and take everything that belongs to him?

152
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,140
Zhang Wencai,

153
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,260
stop scheming.

154
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,780
My mind is made up.

155
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:15,660
Hey.

156
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:16,660
Hey, my dear.

157
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,220
My dear!

158
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:28,780
Hanyi,

159
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,420
what's wrong?

160
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,020
Father, I'm scared.

161
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:35,820
Don't be afraid.

162
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,020
I'm here.

163
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:37,980
Father,

164
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,180
you acknowledge me now?

165
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,180
Of course.

166
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,290
It's just it's been a year
since I last saw you.

167
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,460
You've grown,

168
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,860
so I didn't recognize you.

169
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:46,940
Father, don't worry.

170
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,220
I won't fight for anything.

171
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,340
I won't take anything.

172
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,700
I'll also

173
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,660
be filial to your wife

174
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,780
and treat her like my mother.

175
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,380
Good child.

176
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,460
Are you hungry?

177
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,060
Yes.

178
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,940
I brought a roast chicken for you.

179
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,060
You eat first, father.

180
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:07,740
I'm okay

181
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,020
I'm not hungry.

182
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:09,820
You eat.

183
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,540
Eat a lot,

184
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,700
and you won't have to suffer anymore,

185
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,740
huh?

186
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,620
My mind is made up.

187
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,580
What if I make him disappear completely?

188
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,820
You want to kill him?

189
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,820
Madam, push harder!

190
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,100
Use more strength!

191
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,700
Hold on, madam!

192
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:32,580
Madam!

193
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:33,860
Madam!

194
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,100
Hold on!

195
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,140
Push!

196
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,140
It's almost there.

197
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,340
Push!

198
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:40,940
Push harder!

199
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,980
Madam, the water is coming.

200
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,700
Good job!

201
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,340
Madam!

202
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,500
Push!

203
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,540
Hold on, madam!

204
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,660
A little more effort!

205
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,540
Deep breath.

206
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,820
More effort!

207
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:52,980
Madam!

208
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,100
Bad news.

209
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,960
The incense workshop
was struck by lightning.

210
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,020
Master!

211
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,900
Master!

212
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,340
Master!

213
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,500
The beam was struck down.

214
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,420
How could this happen?

215
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,300
Master.

216
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,460
Madam has given birth.

217
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,180
Master.

218
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,540
Master, madam has given birth!

219
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,940
Ah, it's a son!

220
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,300
The mother and child are safe.

221
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,140
But wasn't it...

222
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,580
a difficult labor?

223
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,180
Ah,

224
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,300
the doctor said

225
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,020
it was pure luck.

226
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,220
If it had been anyone else,

227
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,260
both mother and child

228
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,500
would've been in danger.

229
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,420
Could it be fate?

230
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,860
Why are you standing here?

231
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,940
Save him!

232
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,140
Since then,

233
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,820
I lost my sight.

234
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,220
Everyone thought I was useless

235
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,060
and no longer a threat.

236
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,460
All these years,

237
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,880
I've only told you

238
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,100
this secret.

239
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,140
Young Master,

240
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,700
the world after blindness is so dark.

241
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,300
Are you afraid?

242
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,660
I used to be.

243
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,300
But not anymore.

244
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,980
Didn't you say

245
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,580
you're my eyes?

246
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,700
With you here,

247
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,740
how am I different from anyone else?

248
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:12,820
Young Master.

249
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,100
I want to make

250
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,300
a new promise to you.

251
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,580
I promise

252
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,940
I'll do everything I can

253
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,300
to cure your eyes.

254
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,860
I'll make you see

255
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,260
the world again.

256
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,940
Do you believe me?

257
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,220
I do.

258
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:39,860
Young Master.

259
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,460
Have you ever thought about

260
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,900
leaving the Zhang Manor with me

261
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,860
and openly opposing the Zhang family

262
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,500
won't be

263
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,740
an easy path?

264
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:52,020
Zhang Wencai is the chairman
of the Chamber of Commerce.

265
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,900
He'll surely use the Chamber

266
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,140
to suppress us.

267
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,180
I understand.

268
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,820
But with you here,

269
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,900
I have no fear.

270
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,020
What do you think will happen?

271
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:32,780
Hey,

272
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,580
Mr. Zhang is here.

273
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:34,900
Chairman Zhang.

274
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,580
Chairman.

275
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,820
Chairman, you called us here urgently

276
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,540
about Wanxiang Department Store, right?

277
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,900
Jiang City is only so big.

278
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,380
If someone takes a seat at the table,
someone else must leave.

279
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,420
And the one leaving

280
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,820
won't be us.

281
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,060
We've been in Jiang City for years.

282
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,740
There's never been an outsider before.

283
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,900
Wanxiang Department Store is the first.

284
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,580
It proves

285
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,020
they're something.

286
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,380
Master Zhang,

287
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,860
you're our chairman.

288
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,340
What should we do next?

289
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,460
You decide.

290
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:08,860
Pull the goods.

291
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,860
I want to see the shelves
of Wanxiang Department Store

292
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,900
empty.
