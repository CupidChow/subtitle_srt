00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:10,620
Hanyi,

19
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,300
you know the importance
of this matter, don't you?

20
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:14,600
Don't worry, father.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,160
It concerns the Zhang family,

22
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,100
so I'll spare no effort.

23
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:17,620
Go.

24
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,140
Father.

25
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:22,940
Qianli.

26
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,020
If the matter is handled well,

27
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,620
you'll take the credit.

28
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,500
If it's not,

29
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,540
it'll be his fault.

30
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:32,900
Understood?

31
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:36,860
Thank you, father.

32
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,540
As twilight falls,

33
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,020
snow dances wildly.

34
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,260
Scattered into the mud,

35
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,500
ground into dust.

36
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:02,980
It must be

37
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,060
the Winter Plum Blossom.

38
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,620
We only have three days.

39
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:06,900
Be quick.

40
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,220
(Only the faint fragrance remains)
(What's your next move?)

41
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,660
(Governor Gu Liancheng
is a man of temperament.)

42
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,060
(Once he's impressed,)

43
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,260
(he'll surely form a bond with you.)

44
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,860
(Therefore, after we finish,)

45
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,300
(we must personally present it to him.)

46
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,100
(Only by doing so)

47
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,190
(can we prevent others
from taking the credit)

48
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,780
(and gain the chance to meet with him.)

49
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:44,700
It's done.

50
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,700
The scent is identical to the one
on the handkerchief.

51
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,660
Well,

52
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,620
I knew it.

53
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,700
Young Master Hanyi
will definitely succeed.

54
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,380
May I have a sniff?

55
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,420
Hey, the governor and the master

56
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,180
are waiting.

57
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,260
I'll take it to them.

58
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,460
Mr. Wang, I wish to hand
it to the governor.

59
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,740
Who made this perfume?

60
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:23,700
Governor.

61
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,260
Hey.

62
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,020
It was

63
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,140
my son.

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,900
Smell it for yourself.

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,790
Master Zhang,
do you find it pungent as well?

66
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,620
Your son used this nonsense to fool me?

67
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,340
For this perfume,

68
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,220
I've come to your manor three times

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,420
Governor...

70
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,780
Even Zhuge Liang

71
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,580
came out of the hut after three visits.

72
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,340
But after three visits,

73
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,980
you give me this nonsense,

74
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,420
huh?

75
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,100
Hey.

76
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:01,820
Father.

77
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,140
Father!

78
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,980
Governor, calm down.

79
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,700
There must be some misunderstanding.

80
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,790
The perfume was crafted
by my eldest son, Zhang Hanyi.

81
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,740
Why not summon him here

82
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,140
to give you an explanation?

83
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,020
Zhang Hanyi,

84
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:21,700
kneel!

85
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:23,940
Master Zhang,

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,280
I don't need the perfume anymore.

87
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,540
But this outrage can't

88
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,860
go unanswered.

89
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,090
Killing your son wouldn't be
excessive, right?

90
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:32,660
I submit to

91
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,780
your punishment.

92
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,820
That perfume wasn't
the finished product.

93
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,960
The housekeeper left in a rush

94
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,180
and took the wrong one.

95
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,220
Mr. Wang.

96
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,940
You were right.

97
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,410
The master wouldn't let me
meet the governor.

98
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,560
How could such a credit-worthy matter
fall to you?

99
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,300
When a scapegoat is needed,

100
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,220
it's your time to shine.

101
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,460
Just wait.

102
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,220
That flawed perfume

103
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,260
will surely anger the governor.

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,680
This is the scent
I've been searching for

105
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,780
for two years.

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,580
Your family indeed lives up to its name.

107
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,140
Young Master Zhang, rise.

108
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,340
Thank you, Governor.

109
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,780
In that case,

110
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,780
please make more of this perfume.

111
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,880
I'll come to your shop
to collect it later.

112
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,420
Give me the address of your shop.

113
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:03,940
Governor,

114
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,400
it's Zhang's Incense Shop

115
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,460
on Xihe Street.

116
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:13,890
See you at the shop.

117
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,380
Governor, take care.

118
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,020
You did that on purpose.

119
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,860
Do you even have a shop?

120
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,900
I was caught off guard.

121
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,780
Would you rather I expose

122
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,940
your Zhang's Department Store?

123
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:34,740
You...

124
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,340
Enough.

125
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,890
Did you think I wouldn't notice

126
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,460
such a petty trick?

127
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,300
I'm

128
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,260
very sorry.

129
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,100
Punish him accordingly.

130
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,860
As for the incense shop,

131
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,990
it's not something
you can claim at will.

132
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,580
You may wield the whip.

133
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,580
Yes, master.

134
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,500
Punish him accordingly.

135
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,770
(Given your success
in crafting the perfume,)

136
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,180
(I'll spare you ten lashes.)

137
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,700
Young Master, are you alright?

138
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,140
It's nothing.

139
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,500
I'm used to it.

140
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,180
Even after making
the governor's perfume,

141
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,740
father's attitude toward me
is still unlikely to change.

142
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,020
It seems

143
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,020
I must stoke the flames further,

144
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,660
forcing Zhang Wencai

145
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:29,980
to see the truth.

146
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,460
What shall we do?

147
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,500
Let's put the secrets we hold

148
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,100
to good use.

149
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,020
Make sure you clean thoroughly.

150
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,380
Leave no corners untouched.

151
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,700
Even the pond must be dredged clean.

152
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,300
Hey, what's this?

153
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,460
It might be medicine dregs.

154
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,140
Why would such dregs be in the pond?

155
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,990
Quick, take it to the housekeeper.

156
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,340
Tianhua powder,

157
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,140
musk,

158
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,580
peach kernel and croton.

159
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,980
They break up stasis,

160
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,740
and induce discharge,

161
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,660
all used for

162
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,340
inducing miscarriage.

163
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,020
Which courtyard was this found in?

164
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,380
It was fished out
of the back garden pond.

165
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,020
No idea who threw it there.

166
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,340
Has anyone been taking medicine?

167
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,100
Not sure.

168
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,500
Recently,

169
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,060
it's been cold and windy.

170
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,380
The three madams have all caught chills,

171
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,580
so medicines are being brewed
in every courtyard.

172
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,660
Don't say anything for now.

173
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,810
I'll be going to
the Chamber of Commerce tonight.

174
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,980
Investigate further when I return.

175
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,340
Yes.

176
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:33,940
Child,

177
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,540
don't come looking for me.

178
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,420
I was forced.

179
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:40,660
Bad news.

180
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,660
My father knows.

181
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,540
Father found the remnants

182
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,340
of the miscarriage medicine.

183
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,500
Didn't I tell you repeatedly

184
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,460
to dispose of them outside the manor?

185
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,700
I did take them out.

186
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,700
Who knows how those remnants came here?

187
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:58,860
What should we do?

188
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,060
Sooner or later, it'll lead to us.

189
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,300
I have an idea.

190
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,420
We'll pin the medicine

191
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,820
on Madam Mu.

192
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:24,820
Master.

193
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,340
Master, bad news.

194
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,140
Madam Mu...

195
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,300
She went after your back...

196
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,100
Why are you running?

197
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,460
I told you not to run.

198
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,700
Madam Mu,

199
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,860
I'll never forget your kindness.

200
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,380
Come on.

201
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,180
Stripped but claimed innocence?

202
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,020
Father,

203
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,820
I saw this dog crawling out

204
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,820
of Madam Mu's bed with my own eyes.

205
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,900
You still dare deny it?

206
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,140
Drag him out and flog him.

207
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,420
I'm innocent, master.

208
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,700
Madam Mu saw my coat was torn
and was mending it for me.

209
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,620
I did nothing, master.

210
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,940
The Zhang family is a renowned
household in Jiang City.

211
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:01,980
Master,

212
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,380
such matters must

213
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,900
be thoroughly investigated.

214
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:05,540
Master,

215
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,420
Madam Li.

216
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,460
(Li Yu'e, wife of Zhang Wencai)
Whether this is adultery,

217
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,500
get Ms. Hua from Qinhuai Pavilion

218
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,220
to confirm it.

219
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,020
Hmm,

220
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,740
it's a good idea.

221
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,660
Bring Ms. Hua.

222
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,140
Master, madam,

223
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,180
Ms. Hua has arrived.

224
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,100
Master, madam.

225
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:43,980
Ms. Hua,

226
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,660
examine carefully.

227
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,620
Yes.

228
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,820
Since she's innocent,

229
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,380
why not examine here?

230
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,300
Yes.

231
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,020
Father,

232
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,780
Madam Chunxiao has a point.

233
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:09,940
Examine her here.

234
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,740
Madam Mu,

235
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,020
please sit.

236
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,860
Ms. Hua has confirmed

237
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,180
Madam Mu's

238
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,460
innocence.

239
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,660
In the Zhang family,

240
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,860
such scandals can't exist.

241
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,740
(I have an idea.)

242
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,500
(We'll pin the medicine)

243
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,940
(on Madam Mu.)

244
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,480
Then we'll turn their scheme
to our advantage.

245
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,940
I'll act as planned.

246
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,140
(However,)

247
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,940
(I must trouble a servant boy.)

248
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:03,620
Master,

249
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:04,820
Madam Li,

250
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,740
I'm innocent,

251
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,260
but they slander me like this.

252
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,060
Today,

253
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,060
I must seek justice for myself.

254
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:11,700
Impossible!

255
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,460
A few days ago,

256
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,860
I smelled medicine
in Madam Chunxiao's room.

257
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,500
The scent was different
from our cold medicine.

258
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,820
I asked her out of kindness,

259
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:20,990
but she cursed me on the spot.

260
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:21,900
Surely

261
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,700
she's done something shameful

262
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,060
and is retaliating against me.

263
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:25,980
What are you saying?

264
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,180
Master, madam, please investigate.

265
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,260
When have I taken medicine?

266
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,260
When have I cursed you?

267
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,100
Master,

268
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,340
she's spouting nonsense!

269
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,780
Ms. Hua, examine

270
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,300
Madam Chunxiao as well.

271
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,460
I've done nothing.

272
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,580
Why examine me?

273
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,420
Sit down.

274
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,660
Ms. Hua,

275
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,420
examine.

276
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,180
Madam Chunxiao,

277
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,100
let me feel your pulse.

278
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,140
Master, madam,

279
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,780
Madam Chunxiao

280
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,900
recently miscarried.

281
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,660
You're talking nonsense!

282
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,140
I...

283
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,700
I'm not lying.

284
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,260
Madam Chunxiao

285
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,420
has indeed recently miscarried.

286
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,220
Master.

287
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,900
Master, I'm sorry.

288
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,180
Spare me this time.

289
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,660
I'll do anything you say.

290
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,860
Please spare my life, master.

291
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,340
Shameless woman.

292
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,820
You've disgraced our family's name.

293
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,900
Zhang Qianli,

294
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,020
you beast!

295
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,140
Silence!

296
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,220
The Zhang family

297
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:09,940
Shut up!

298
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,380
is full of beasts!

299
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,580
Scoundrel!

300
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,460
Scoundrel!

301
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,500
Scoundrel!

302
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:33,900
Scoundrel!

303
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:38,820
Scoundrel!

304
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:39,820
Scoundrel!

305
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:40,940
Scoundrel!

306
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:41,940
Scoundrel!
