(Zhang's Incense Shop)
Yanran, come home first.

19
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,260
I'm fine.

20
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:12,780
- Go home.
- I'm fine.

21
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,500
- I'll drink with you, let's go.
- I can still drink.

22
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,180
Let's continue.

23
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,660
I can still drink.

24
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,260
Why are you so quiet?

25
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,780
Weren't you being so loud just now?

26
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,540
Don't throw up on me.

27
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,520
If you throw up on me, I'll hit you.

28
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,100
What's wrong?

29
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,780
Don't think I won't hit you
just because you're crying.

30
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,900
I really like Zhang Hanyi,

31
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,180
but they still treat me
like an outsider.

32
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,180
I sold my favorite belongings

33
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,540
to raise money for them,

34
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,660
but they didn't even need it.

35
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,420
I truly like Zhang Hanyi,

36
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,020
but he likes Wanyue.

37
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,860
Wanyue is so smart,

38
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,460
and she still wants me as a partner.

39
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,100
I'm not good enough.

40
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:24,820
Liancheng,

41
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,180
I'm so cold.

42
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,100
Liancheng,

43
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,300
you have to be nicer to Zhang Hanyi.

44
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,380
Zhang Hanyi is really good.

45
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,540
Well,

46
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,660
Governor.

47
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,380
Governor,

48
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,340
I've come to visit

49
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,940
and brought a little gift.

50
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,500
I hope you'll accept it.

51
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,220
You must know

52
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,380
Zhang Hanyi and Wanyue

53
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,020
very well now.

54
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,100
These two aren't simple.

55
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,940
They've gone to great lengths

56
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,540
to get close to you.

57
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,980
First, they helped you with the perfume,

58
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,300
and then

59
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,220
they approached your sister, Gu Yanran.

60
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,020
Governor,

61
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,500
don't you know their true intentions?

62
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,260
Speak plainly.

63
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,060
They clearly

64
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,500
want to use your influence,

65
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,660
to climb the social ladder,

66
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,800
and take advantage of you.

67
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,580
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,740
I really shouldn't

69
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,700
speak so freely.

70
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,780
This is Wanyue's

71
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,940
contract of servitude as a maid.

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,990
I'm handing it over to you.

73
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,620
How you choose to deal

74
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,460
with Wanyue is entirely up to you.

75
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:18,980
I'll just

76
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,700
take my leave now.

77
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,260
(Contract of Servitude)

78
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,340
(Zhang's Incense Shop)

79
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,240
We'll sign the contract
at the department store.

80
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,740
Finally, this day has come.

81
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,540
After establishing ourselves,

82
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:41,780
the next step

83
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,500
is to swallow up the Zhang family.

84
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,980
Master will return in a few days.

85
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,420
The real storm

86
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,780
is yet to come.

87
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:49,940
Is anyone there?

88
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,540
Come out.

89
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,580
I'll go take a look.

90
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:53,900
Alright.

91
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,020
Is anyone here?

92
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,500
Is anyone here?

93
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,420
Anyone here?

94
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,180
What are you doing?

95
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,020
Hey!

96
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:01,600
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

97
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,100
What are you doing?

98
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,460
What is this?

99
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,860
Why arresting me for no reason?

100
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,580
Young Master!

101
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,580
Young Master!

102
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,060
Wanyue.

103
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:09,660
Wanyue.

104
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,020
Wanyue.

105
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:14,540
Let's go.

106
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,540
Wanyue.

107
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,460
Wanyue.

108
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:18,940
Wanyue.

109
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,140
Wanyue.

110
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,220
Wanyue.

111
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:27,940
Wanyue.

112
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,380
Wanyue.

113
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:37,900
Wanyue.

114
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,380
Wanyue.

115
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:40,620
Wanyue.

116
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:41,740
Wanyue.

117
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,420
(Governor's Manor)

118
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,420
Wanyue.

119
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,660
Wanyue.

120
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,100
The governor has ordered,
no one is allowed inside.

121
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,260
Gu Liancheng,

122
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,380
come out here!

123
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,260
Gu Liancheng!

124
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:13,780
Gu Liancheng!

125
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,540
Zhang Hanyi,

126
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,220
last time we didn't get to fight.

127
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,060
Today, let's have a proper one-on-one.

128
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,100
Where's Wanyue?

129
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:30,860
If you win,

130
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:31,980
Wanyue is yours.

131
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,060
If you lose,

132
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,820
Wanyue will be mine.

133
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,100
Alright.

134
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,590
If you go back on your word,

135
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,140
I'll kill you.

136
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,760
Governor, what does this mean?

137
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,620
Yanran never had alcohol before.

138
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,460
Last night she cried.

139
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,180
I've never seen her
cry like that in my life.

140
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,900
Zhang Hanyi

141
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,820
made my sister cry like that?

142
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,500
Where's Yanran?

143
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,500
Can I see her?

144
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,540
Yanran likes Zhang Hanyi so much.

145
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,740
What's so great about Zhang Hanyi?

146
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,660
If it weren't for Yanran,
I'd shoot him myself.

147
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,140
You of all people should understand.

148
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,380
Liking someone

149
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,300
doesn't follow reason,

150
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,060
nor is it something you or I can decide.

151
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,240
I can't let Yanran be
the only one heartbroken.

152
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,860
I'll make Zhang Hanyi
feel that pain too.

153
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,820
How about I marry you,

154
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,340
so he'll never

155
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,420
have love in this lifetime?

156
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,740
You and Yanran

157
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,780
aren't siblings.

158
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,660
You like Yanran.

159
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,580
How do you know?

160
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,300
Who told you?

161
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,460
Are you going to kill
everyone who knows?

162
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,540
Answer my question directly.

163
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,500
Who else knows about this?

164
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,700
Who told you?

165
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,540
You did.

166
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:15,860
Governor,

167
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,260
your eyes

168
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,180
can't lie.

169
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,500
Governor,

170
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,420
you didn't do anything wrong.

171
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,580
You just fell in love with someone.

172
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,780
This world has many taboos and rules,

173
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,900
but no one has the right to judge you.

174
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,620
Love takes many forms.

175
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,900
As long as your conscience is clear,

176
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,680
Yanran will always be
the most important person to you.

177
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,460
That's enough.

178
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,380
Thank you for saying that.

179
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,500
Thank you.

180
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,700
(Can you tell me)

181
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,940
(what Zhang Hanyi has)

182
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,540
(that makes Yanran like him so much?)

183
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,260
You like him too, don't you?

184
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,540
(I like Zhang Hanyi)

185
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,380
(because he and I)

186
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,020
(are from the same world.)

187
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,780
(We're different from you.)

188
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,220
(In our world, there is no sunlight,)

189
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,380
(only humiliation,)

190
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,420
(hatred,)

191
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,660
(and endless darkness.)

192
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,540
Only by warming each other
in the darkness,

193
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,220
by using our faint light
to illuminate one another,

194
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,260
can we survive.

195
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,300
Young Master.

196
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,100
Wanyue.

197
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,100
Young Master.

198
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,700
Are you alright?

199
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,220
I'm fine.

200
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:04,860
Are you alright?

201
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,420
I'm fine.

202
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,060
Young Master.

203
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:14,970
Young Master.

204
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,540
Let's go.

205
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:35,620
♪Light rain drizzles
gently in my dreams♪

206
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:41,700
♪Pure white flowers fall
into memories with the wind♪

207
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:47,820
♪Children holding each other tightly,
not expecting separation later♪

208
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:53,020
♪Thoughts shatter into drifting clouds♪

209
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:59,820
♪We gazed at the distant scenery
outside the window♪

210
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:05,780
♪Letting the butterflies
at our fingertips fly away♪

211
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,460
Young Master.

212
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,340
This medicine will hurt.

213
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,860
Bear with it.

214
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,580
♪When the wind stops
and the clouds scatter♪

215
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,980
♪And you turn back
in the glow of the sunset♪

216
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,340
♪I run through the broken space-time♪

217
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:30,060
♪Trying to hold your hand♪

218
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,580
♪When the rain stops and the snow melts♪

219
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,100
♪You stand at the end of time♪

220
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,420
♪Your gaze is so gentle♪

221
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,580
♪Just like before♪

222
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,380
It's done.

223
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,140
Young Master,

224
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,020
I never asked before.

225
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,020
How did you get these scars

226
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,100
on your body?

227
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,900
Which one?

228
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,260
This one.

229
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,340
When I was a child,
Zhang Wencai beat me with a stick.

230
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,100
This one?

231
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,780
Zhang Qianli used firecrackers.

232
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:04,580
And this one?

233
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:05,980
Madam Li

234
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,780
burned me with a pipe.

235
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,780
Young Master,

236
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:20,980
if,

237
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,420
for our plan,

238
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,540
we have to kill your father,

239
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,180
would you still continue?

240
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,460
He's not my father.

241
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,060
He's never treated me as his son.

242
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,460
And I've never

243
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,340
seen him as my father.

244
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,180
If it weren't for him,

245
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,060
my mother wouldn't have died.

246
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,380
So,

247
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,380
if one day you want to take his life,

248
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,220
I'll become

249
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,300
your blade.

250
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,420
Put on your clothes first.

251
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:14,940
Mother,

252
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,540
this is what they call
"returning the jade intact."

253
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,980
Father has sent a telegram

254
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:19,840
saying he'll be back

255
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,460
the day after tomorrow.

256
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,380
When he comes back

257
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,900
and finds out about
what Zhang Hanyi has done,

258
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,860
he'll probably beat him to death.

259
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,540
Bring the car around.

260
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,500
Yes.

261
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,420
Liancheng,

262
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,660
why are you so late?

263
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,060
I've been dressed
and waiting for you forever.

264
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,740
This is very new.

265
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,460
My sister's mood has improved.

266
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:10,940
That's right.

267
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,260
I don't like Zhang Hanyi anymore.

268
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,460
That fast?

269
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,540
Weren't you upset just yesterday?

270
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,780
The me from yesterday

271
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,260
died in a fever.

272
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,380
The me of today

273
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,540
doesn't need love.

274
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,340
From now on,

275
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,100
I'll chase the wind without stopping.

276
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,180
Love can still be trusted.

277
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,020
You just picked the wrong person.

278
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,380
Alright.

279
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,180
Let's drop it.

280
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,180
Enough.

281
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:33,780
Hey,

282
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,380
Liancheng,

283
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,500
where did you get these flowers?

284
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:37,900
Nowhere.

285
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:38,980
Are those for me?

286
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:39,580
No.

287
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:40,660
Not from me.

288
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,720
From the hospital.

289
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,980
They give flowers at discharge.

290
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,180
Alright.

291
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:47,900
Let's go.

292
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,140
Take me to work.

293
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:49,540
Hey.

294
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,740
Didn't you say
you don't like him anymore?

295
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,420
What work?

296
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:55,700
Work...

297
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,580
work and men aren't related.

298
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,900
This is my career.

299
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,580
Shut up.

300
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,180
You're barely recovered.

301
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,340
Go home and rest.

302
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,540
Come on, I don't have a fever anymore.

303
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,590
Feel it if you don't believe me.

304
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,460
You're so grown up.

305
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,980
Why are you always so touchy?

306
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,780
What's wrong? You're my brother.

307
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,380
Even when I'm 70 or 80,
I'll still hug you.

308
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,540
Why shouldn't I?

309
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,020
I'll just keep hugging.

310
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:18,820
Keep hugging.

311
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:21,740
Doctor,

312
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,780
I'm discharged.

313
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,940
Is there anything else?

314
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,610
Before discharge,

315
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,980
you need a thorough checkup.

316
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:26,940
Exactly.

317
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,620
She needs to be checked properly.

318
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,430
Why do you have to insist on
going to that silly job?

319
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,520
What's wrong with that?

320
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,100
I think the fever
is making you confused.

321
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,160
