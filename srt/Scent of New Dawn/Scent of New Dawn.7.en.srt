That's it.

20
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,420
Mu Lan,

21
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,660
you have no freedom in the Zhang family.

22
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,700
If I ever get the chance,

23
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,020
I'll come see you.

00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,740
(Mu Lan,)

25
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,260
(we've made a promise, okay?)

(Okay.)

29
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,060
(I promise.)

30
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:52,980
Alright,

31
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,500
you should go back.

32
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:56,820
Go.

33
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:05,860
Madam Mu.

34
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,060
Thank you.

35
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,380
May I ask one more thing of you?

36
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,980
I want to hear White Rose

37
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,020
sing a song.

38
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,220
It's okay.

39
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,100
Master won't find out.

40
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:11,900
Make way.

41
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,900
Make way.

42
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,940
(Zhang's Incense Shop)
Twenty-nine.

43
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,940
Thirty.

44
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:18,860
Thirty thousand.

45
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,780
Not a cent less.

46
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,500
Take it to Master.

47
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,380
Bad news!

48
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,350
Xiaohu got into trouble.

49
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,420
Police are at the door.

50
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:27,540
What?

51
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,980
You're Xiaohu's boss?

52
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,100
Yes.

53
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,460
What happened to Xiaohu?

54
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,340
Come with us.

55
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,540
Officers, may I ask

56
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,820
what exactly happened?

57
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,780
Your employee

58
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,220
groped a woman and was caught by us.

59
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:42,860
Officer,

60
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,820
please give me justice.

61
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,820
This bastard

62
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,020
groped my wife's butt.

63
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,460
You must cut off his hand

64
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,100
to avenge my wife's honor.

65
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,500
Did you do it or not?

66
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,620
I wouldn't even touch her myself.

67
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,060
Honorable officer,

68
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,540
you must seek justice for my wife.

69
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,540
Hey,

70
00:03:59,060 --> 00:03:59,700
Hanyi,

71
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,380
you're finally here.

72
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,420
If you hadn't come,

73
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,620
our Zhang family's employee

74
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,860
would've lost his hand.

75
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:09,980
What's going on?

76
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,580
Xiaohu,

77
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,540
- don't be afraid.
- Our money has been targeted.

78
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,640
Even if you made a mistake,

79
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,180
my brother and I

80
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,540
will have your back.

81
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,700
The officer is asking
if you groped the woman's butt.

82
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,060
Just tell everyone the truth.

83
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:20,900
Did you

84
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,100
do it or not?

85
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,020
A real man takes responsibility
for his actions.

86
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,380
Even if you did it,

87
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,740
we Zhang family

88
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,900
will stand

89
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,740
by you

90
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,420
and your mother.

91
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:39,700
Speak.

92
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,220
Did you do it or not?

93
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:47,660
He nodded.

94
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,100
He nodded.

95
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,820
He admitted to groping my wife's butt.

96
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,700
Today, I must cut off one of his hands.

97
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,060
Wait a minute.

98
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,620
Let's see who dares

99
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,900
to touch the employee
of the Zhang family.

100
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,100
You just want money, right?

101
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,820
My brother has brought the money.

102
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:01,890
However much you want,

103
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,990
the Zhang family will pay.

104
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:03,860
Isn't that right,

105
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:04,540
Hanyi?

106
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,020
If he can't raise the money
in three days,

107
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,900
sell this maid to make up

108
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:12,940
the amount.

109
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,380
No one cares, right?

110
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,020
Fine.

111
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,340
I'll take his hand.

112
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:26,860
Stop.

113
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,100
Hanyi,

114
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,060
he works for the incense shop.

115
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,180
Will you really just stand by

116
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,700
and watch Xiaohu lose his hand?

117
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:34,860
I think

118
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,780
if this can be solved with money,

119
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,180
it's not really a problem.

120
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:39,500
How about this?

121
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,940
I'll negotiate with him.

122
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,740
Name your price.

123
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,700
Is money everything?

124
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,980
Can money buy my wife's honor?

125
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,180
That's enough.

126
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,220
Alright.

127
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,100
Since you're so sincere,

128
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,740
I won't ask for too much.

129
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,140
Fifty thousand

130
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:00,940
silver coins.

131
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,060
Fifty thousand?

132
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,700
You must be crazy.

133
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,260
Hey,

134
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,740
do you think my brother's money
falls from the sky?

135
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,180
Hanyi.

136
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,740
Hanyi, I think 50 thousand

137
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,660
is a bit much.

138
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,060
What do you think?

139
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,980
Hanyi, how about this?

140
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,820
I'll try to negotiate again.

141
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,660
Twenty thousand coins.

142
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:22,820
Not a cent more.

143
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,140
Then forty thousand.

144
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,300
I said 20 thousand,

145
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,340
and 20 thousand it is.

146
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:28,120
Thirty thousand.

147
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,820
Yes, 30 thousand coins.

148
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,780
Not a cent less,
or I'll cut off his hand.

149
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:32,900
Hey,

150
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,740
Hanyi,

151
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,300
what about 30 thousand?

152
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,660
I've really done my best.

153
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:43,820
Fine.

154
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,300
Maybe she could fetch a good price.

155
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,300
Sell this maid to make up

156
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,020
the amount.

157
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,180
Stop.

158
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,940
What do you say, Young Master?

159
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,980
I'll pay.

160
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,820
Let him go.

161
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,900
Hey, Hanyi.

162
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,900
It's 30 thousand...

163
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,900
I said I'll pay.

164
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,020
Let him go.

165
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,060
That's 30 thousand silver coins

166
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,060
for one hand.

167
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,340
It's not worth it.

168
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:23,900
Want to reconsider?

169
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,020
Here's exactly 30 thousand.

170
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,860
You're so generous.

171
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,180
What a coincidence.

172
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,380
Ergou,

173
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,940
are you just

174
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,220
after my brother's 30 thousand coins?

175
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,500
- Speak.
- Cut the nonsense.

176
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:37,820
Release him.

177
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:40,980
Alright, Hanyi.

178
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,460
I'll hand it over to him.

179
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,300
Xiaohu,

180
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,580
we spent 30 thousand silver coins

181
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,060
to save your hand.

182
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,940
You must remember our great kindness.

183
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,220
Folks of Jiang City,

184
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,860
since justice has been served,

185
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,100
you all

186
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,940
can disperse.

187
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,260
Disperse.

188
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,740
Well.

189
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,980
How much time is there until nightfall?

190
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,060
Less than two hours.

191
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,140
Take me to the Governor's Manor.

192
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,580
Last time,

193
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,180
you offended the governor.

194
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,460
Perhaps I should be the one

195
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,260
to broach this topic later.

196
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:42,980
Don't intervene

197
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,220
in this matter.

198
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,100
Are you still worried about that day?

199
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,900
If I can make good relations
with the governor,

200
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,300
it'll only help our future plans.

201
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,780
If you become the governor's wife,

202
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,860
then who will be my eyes?

203
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,540
Young Master,

204
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,500
I promised to be your eyes,

205
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,880
and I'll never go back on my word.

206
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,060
Wait in the car for me.

207
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,900
The governor will return soon.

208
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,280
Young Master Zhang, please wait.

209
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,100
This way.

210
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,020
(Young Master Zhang?)

211
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,420
If I'm not mistaken,

212
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,420
you must be

213
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,660
the owner of the handkerchief
cherished by the governor.

214
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,900
You have the scent of Ruoshui on you.

215
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,660
You know Ruoshui?

216
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,660
I crafted Ruoshui for the governor.

217
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,020
Ruoshui was clearly

218
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,180
made by an elderly
craftsman named Zhang Hanyi.

219
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,540
My brother searched all over Jiang City

220
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,980
and finally found this master.

221
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,890
I wouldn't call myself a master.

222
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,500
But

223
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,940
I'm Zhang Hanyi.

224
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,860
You're Zhang Hanyi?

225
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,140
Miss,

226
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:49,900
may I ask...

227
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,780
My name is Gu Yanran.

228
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,860
Gu Liancheng is my brother.

229
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,580
Thank you for creating Ruoshui.

230
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,900
Miss Gu, you're welcome.

231
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,340
When will the governor return?

232
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,340
I have an emergency.

233
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:02,900
Governor.

234
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,740
Thirty thousand silver coins?

235
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,380
After you have dinner,

236
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,620
I'll ask someone to deliver it.

237
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,060
Miss Gu,

238
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,860
I must have this money before nightfall.

239
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,600
You'll skip dinner?

240
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,060
Apologies.

241
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,060
The situation is urgent.

242
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:15,460
Fine.

243
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,260
Then wait here.

244
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,300
Stop.

245
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,180
What are you doing here?

246
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,180
Governor,

247
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,460
Young Master Hanyi has come to see you.

248
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,020
Zhang Hanyi

249
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,020
came to see me?

250
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:27,620
Yes.

251
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,540
Thirty thousand coins.

252
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,500
Here it is.

253
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,020
Thank you, Miss Gu.

254
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,160
Please write an IOU.

255
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:34,860
I'll repay soon.

256
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,700
I don't want that.

257
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,620
I want

258
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,500
you.

259
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,180
Where is he?

260
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,220
Young Master is...

261
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:49,620
Governor.

262
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,500
Governor.

263
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,180
Liancheng, you're back.

264
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,540
What were you just doing

265
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,620
with my sister?

266
00:11:59,180 --> 00:11:59,940
Liancheng,

267
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,540
you were mistaken.

268
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,860
He's the real Zhang Hanyi,

269
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,460
not some old man.

270
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,860
Don't you have things to do?

271
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,060
Go take care of them.

272
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,940
Don't forget what you promised me.

273
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,100
Alright.

274
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,260
Bye.

275
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,500
Don't forget.

276
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,380
Young Master.
