35
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,460
How could she compare to me?

36
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,260
I've done so much for Jiang City!

37
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,180
This is not for you to decide.

38
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,880
Fairness lies in the hearts
of the people.

39
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:57,660
Exactly.

40
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,860

to his own woman,

41
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,100

00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,180

43
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:06,500
True.

44
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,340
Have you ever had a conscience

45
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,280
for us small merchants?

46
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,820
Why should I trust you?

47
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,660
I don't trust you!

48
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,460
If you're so ruthless to your own wife,

49
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,740
why should I trust you?

50
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,420
Today he'd kill his own woman

51
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,020

52
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,780
tomorrow he'll stab us in the back.

53
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,540
I propose

54

60
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,980
Expulsion is necessary.

61
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:31,860
- Yes.
- Expel him.

62
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,300
Agreed!

Father.

71
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,740
All the businesses in Jiang City

72
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,540
are refusing to supply us.

73
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,140
Our shelves have already been cleared.

74

81
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,220
I'm sorry.

82
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,140

83
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,220

84
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:08,740

88
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,860
What use is that?

89
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,980
I taught you so much,

90
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,540
but you're even worse than a blind man.

91
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,820
Really, a good-for-nothing son.

92
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,100
You're so useless.

93
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:24,940
Go!

99

are none of my business.

100
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,580
He said I'm not as good as Zhang Hanyi,

101
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,060
that blind man.

102
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,460
How am I worse than him?

103

I will.

206
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,060
When did you wake up?

207
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,380
When you kissed me,

208
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,980
I suddenly realized,

209
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,860
the next moment,

210
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,940
