18
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,360
- I'm fully recovered.
- I think you're confused.

19
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,380
Why do you have to insist?

20
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:12,980
You should...

21
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:17,780
Liancheng!

22
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:49,660
Liancheng!

23
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,620
Liancheng, how are you feeling?

24
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,940
Hold on.

25
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:53,900
Liancheng.

26
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,260
Stop!

27
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,180
Stop running!

28
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,260
Stop!

29
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,300
Stop!

30
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,260
The hospital isn't safe.

31
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,190
Go to the incense shop.

32
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,180
Liancheng,

33
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,420
hang in there.

34
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,140
Hurry up.

35
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,260
Wanyue!

36
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:22,500
Quick.

37
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,700
Please help my brother!

38
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,780
Come in.

39
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,460
Bear with it.

40
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:40,620
Yanran.

41
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,180
Liancheng.

42
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,020
Liancheng, I'm here.

43
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,220
Yanran.

44
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:43,980
Liancheng.

45
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,300
Yanran.

46
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:47,820
Don't worry.

47
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,460
He's out of danger now.

48
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,820
Thank you both.

49
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:58,820
Governor.

50
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:01,740
It's all my fault.

51
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,020
I failed to guard the hospital.

52
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,780
Please punish me.

53
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,100
Did you find him?

54
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,300
He got away.

55
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,500
But I can confirm

56
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,740
it was done by the Japanese.

57
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,740
Right now, assassinations

58
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,980
are happening nationwide,

59
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,060
all masterminded

60
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,420
by the Japanese.

61
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,500
Governor,

62
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,980
this place isn't safe either.

63
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,300
We should take Miss Gu

64
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,180
back to the manor.

65
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,500
Alright.

66
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,700
Be careful.

67
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:39,620
Governor,

68
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,620
should Young Master and I
go back with you?

69
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,300
That won't be necessary.

70
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,650
You've just escaped critical danger

71
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,830
and need further observation.

72
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,740
I think I must go back with you.

73
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,580
You go ahead.

74
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,420
I'll get the medicine

75
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,360
and catch up right away,

76
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:50,900
huh?

77
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,980
(That smell just now...)

78
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,620
Make way.

79
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,700
(This smell...)

80
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,020
Sir, stop for a second.

81
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,100
Young Master.

82
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,460
Wait a moment.

83
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,540
What is this place?

84
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,900
Japanese Chamber of Commerce.

85
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,980
Governor, it's all my fault.

86
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,780
I failed to guard the hospital.

87
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,300
Please punish me.

88
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,260
Governor is in danger!

89
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,140
Quickly inform him.

90
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:33,700
Alright.

91
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,060
Hello?

92
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,020
Governor's Manor?

93
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,260
Governor is in danger.

94
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:58,900
What are you doing?

95
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,100
Sir,

96
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,980
this tea is for Miss Gu.

97
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,100
I'll take it.

98
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:04,500
Go ahead.

99
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,340
Yes.

100
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:14,620
Liancheng,

101
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,620
I specially prepared this tea for you.

102
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:17,620
Here,

103
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,260
try it.

104
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:36,900
How is it?

105
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,860
Why does it taste a bit bitter?

106
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:40,940
Bitter?

107
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,220
Impossible, it's clearly sweet.

108
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,020
It's sweet.

109
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,500
Liancheng, what's wrong?

110
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:50,740
Liancheng.

111
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:51,660
Liancheng.

112
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,480
Liancheng, what's happening to you?

113
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:55,980
Liancheng.

114
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,900
So it was you.

115
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,660
Governor's Manor?

116
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,220
I need to speak with Miss Gu Yanran.

117
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,140
Wanyue,

118
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,460
this is Yanran.

119
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,940
Governor is in danger.

120
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:23,990
Be cautious of his adjutant.

121
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,540
What?

122
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,060
Commence action.

123
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,300
Yes.

124
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,380
Who sent you to kill me?

125
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,500
You won't talk?

126
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,700
Fine.

127
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:52,660
Take him away.

128
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,220
By any means necessary,

129
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,860
make him talk.

130
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:56,780
Yes.

131
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,460
Wanyue,

132
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,540
thanks to your reminder,

133
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,740
a disaster was avoided.

134
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,700
No need to thank me.

135
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,340
If you must, thank my young master.

136
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,700
It was him who smelled the scent

137
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,290
of the Japanese Chamber
on the adjutant.

138
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,700
You brat,

139
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,360
did you deliberately
make me owe you one?

140
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,300
We just had a fight.

141
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,660
We're not enemies.

142
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,380
When did you fight?

143
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,100
Hey,

144
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,460
Gu Liancheng, what are you doing?

145
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,300
Liancheng.

146
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,780
I never owe anyone.

147
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,900
Whether you like it or not,

148
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:38,380
I want to swear brotherhood with you.

149
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,540
I'm a bit older than you.

150
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,260
I'm the elder brother,
you're the younger one.

151
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,540
In the name of Lord Guan,

152
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,100
from now on,
my life is my brother Zhang Hanyi's.

153
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,440
I'll do anything for him

154
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,380
without hesitation.

155
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:57,620
Alright,

156
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,340
get up.

157
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,020
Did you ask for my permission?

158
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,260
Lord Guan has already heard it.

159
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,860
Whether you like it or not,

160
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,780
we're brothers now.

161
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,860
From now on,

162
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,840
everything in the past

163
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:11,860
is written off.

164
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,700
I know you and Miss Wanyue
are starting a business.

165
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,860
You'll need plenty of money.

166
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,140
This 500 thousand

167
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,500
is my investment.

168
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,380
Consider the shares
under my sister's name.

169
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,460
Liancheng,

170
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,020
you...

171
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,900
You're so nice.

172
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,660
You're being decent for once.

173
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,060
I'm no decent person.

174
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:33,920
Hey, let go.

175
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:34,620
They're watching.

176
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:34,990
I won't.

177
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:35,980
I won't.

178
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:36,820
Miss Wanyue.

179
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,980
Let go.

180
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,300
The department store can open now.

181
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,900
I won't.

182
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,740
Alright, stop it.

183
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,020
Wanyue,

184
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,740
your contract of servitude.

185
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,060
Governor gave it to me.

186
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,340
After you take the contract,

187
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,060
will you leave me?

188
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:04,900
Forget it.

189
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,260
You're my young master.

190
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,220
The contract

191
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,500
should stay with you.

192
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,100
I...

193
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,300
I didn't mean it that way.

194
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,100
Young Master,

195
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,740
in your hands this is
no longer a contract of servitude.

196
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,500
It's a contract of cooperation
between us.

197
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,980
It's my promise to you.

198
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:19,980
You mean

199
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,060
you won't leave me?

200
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,180
Before the Zhang family's business
is in our hands,

201
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,140
I won't leave you.

202
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:27,940
And after that?

203
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,380
People live for the present.

204
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,900
We'll deal with the future

205
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,100
when it comes.

206
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,260
Alright.

207
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:39,700
Young Master,

208
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,300
I have a surprise for you.

209
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:41,940
Want it?

210
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,020
What surprise?

211
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,900
I'm not telling you.

212
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,180
I'll show you at home.

213
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:48,900
Come,

214
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:49,500
this way.

215
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,740
(Zhang's Incense Shop)

216
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,540
Young Master,

217
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,540
I think

218
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,060
I can cure your eyes.

219
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,420
This is my mother's secret recipe.

220
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,500
But the treatment will take a long time.

221
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,580
You must be patient.

222
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,580
If one year isn't enough,

223
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,100
I'll wait for ten years.

224
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,500
If ten years isn't enough,

225
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,820
I'll wait for 20 years.

226
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,740
There will always be hope.

227
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,140
Look,

228
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,700
we had no capital at all,

229
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,340
but we opened a department store

230
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,100
before Master returned.

231
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:24,620
Yes,

232
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,700
from tomorrow onward,

233
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,300
the department store

234
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,020
will be ours.

Bravo.

Wishing you great success!

Congratulations!

244
