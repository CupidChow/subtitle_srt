00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,340
(The maid, Wanyue,)

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,380
- (overstepped boundaries)
- (It's ten years you're gone)

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,340
- (with improper behaviors.)
- (and I'm living.)

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,580
(She also deceived the master.)

5
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:17,380
(If l've tried hard not to recall,)

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,450
- (According to the family rules,)
- (I'd say also I can't ignore.)

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,460
(she's to be punished
by kneeling all night.)

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,500
(Twenty years ago,)

9
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,260
- (Anyone pleading for leniency)
- (there was also such a snowfall.)

10
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,330
(will be punished equally.)

11
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,900
(The snow continued to fall.)

12
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,540
(The world was covered in white.)

13
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,980
(It buried the scandals
of this manor)

14
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,100
(and concealed the bloodstains
on the hands of the Zhang family.)

15
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,980
(I saw them build the towering estate.)

16
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,700
(I saw them host lavish banquets.)

17
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,420
(But the snow)

18
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,500
(will eventually melt.)

19
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,060
(The day the heavy snow melts,)

20
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,100
(I want to see the Zhang family)

21
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,420
(drown in rivers of blood.)

22
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,020
(Except for you,)

00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,940

(Zhang family,
incense makers in Jiang City)

43
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,580
Young Master Hanyi,

44
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,490
we're having rice balls today.

45
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,500
What filling do you like?

46
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:34,290
I'll bring you some.

47
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,380
(Zhang Hanyi, eldest young mater)
Take whatever you like.

48
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,620
I don't like those.

49
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:37,740
Thank you.

50
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:39,580
Wait.

51
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,140
Yes?

52
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,900
Why don't you take away
the cover there?

53
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:45,820
Roast chicken?

54
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,100
Young Master, there's roast chicken.

55
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,820
Did you forget what day it is today?

56
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,660
Your birthday.

57
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,460
Enjoy it.

58
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,540
You've had it tough with me.

59
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,340
But...

60
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,380
We can still afford

61
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,500
a roast chicken.

62
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,560
Thank you, Young Master.

63
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,380
Zhang Hanyi.

64
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,460
Zhang Hanyi!

65
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,460
Madam Chunxiao wants you
in the study to burn incense.

66
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:14,460
Hurry up!

67
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,700
Don't keep her waiting!

68
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,460
What nonsense.

69
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:20,980
How arrogant.

70
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:21,980
Dare to boss you around?

71
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:22,820
Come on.

72
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:23,460
It's fine.

73
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,060
Go ahead and eat.

74
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,500
I'll be back soon.

75
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,740
Young Master, let me go with you.

76
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,460
Just enjoy your meal.

77
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,820
Young Master Hanyi, you came.

78
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,860
Madam Chunxiao.

79
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,180
The master is out on business.

80
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,540
No one is here to keep me company.

81
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,260
I'm bored.

82
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,340
(Chunxiao, Third Concubine)

83
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,060
I heard you wanted to smell incense,

84
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,060
so I brought everything

85
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,700
from the incense storage.

86
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,580
Which one would you

87
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,900
like to try?

88
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,700
I was just reading Jin Ping Mei.

89
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,940
It says, "Curtains embroidered
with gold hooks.

90
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,900
There are silver mats and coral pillows.

91
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,260
Nearby the small seal script

92
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,580
burns a wisp of ambergris."

93
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,820
Young Master Hanyi,

94
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,860
what kind of incense is that?

95
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,100
You must've forgotten.

96
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,020
I have eye trouble.

97
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,020
I can't see clearly.

98
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,860
Then I'll come closer,

99
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,300
so you can see.

100
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,980
Meeting a lover in dreams of the boudoir.

101
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,420
It must be

102
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,780
Sandalwood Pavilion.

103
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,540
You're indeed knowledgeable.

104
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:12,900
Well,

105
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,820
can you light one for me?

106
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,260
Of course.

107
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,660
Look at you.

108
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,700
Why are you sweating?

109
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:26,900
Madam Chunxiao.

110
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,020
I'm a clumsy blind man.

111
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,460
Perhaps you should step back.

112
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,540
I wouldn't want to soil your clothes.

113
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,700
Well...

114
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,900
(Zhang Qianli, Second Young Master)

115
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,100
Young Master Qianli,

116
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,660
thrilling, isn't it?

117
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,380
You sure know how to play.

118
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,140
Getting this blind man here
was the right move.

119
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,340
(Qianli)

120
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,120
Madam Chunxiao,

121
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,420
the incense is lit.

122
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:06,900
Ah,

123
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,340
you may go now.

124
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,180
I want to read a bit longer.

125
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:12,900
Yes.

126
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,380
Your elder brother Zhang Hanyi

127
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,820
is indeed more handsome than you.

128
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,340
Xiaoman.

129
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,180
Xiaoman.

130
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,140
Xiaoman.

131
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,900
Our rules dictate

132
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,780
each courtyard gets three rice balls.

133
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,460
You took five.

134
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,980
Did you steal two to eat yourself?

135
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,540
I only took three.

136
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,820
I didn't steal any!

137
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,260
I didn't steal!

138
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,460
Still denying it?

139
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,820
You like rice balls, don't you?

140
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,660
Wangcai!

141
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,060
Yes.

142
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:14,890
Young Master Qianli.

143
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:15,860
Feed him!

144
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:16,500
Yes.

145
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,500
Come on, eat.

146
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,700
I didn't steal!

147
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,990
- Good.
- Eat them all.

148
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,580
Feed them all.

149
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,820
Don't waste a single one.

150
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:25,660
Eat!

151
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,100
Xiaoman.

152
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:27,620
Xiaoman.

153
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:29,820
Xiaoman.

154
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:31,660
Xiaoman.

155
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,540
I didn't steal!

156
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,340
Eat!

157
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,260
I didn't!

158
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:35,990
- Alright.
- I didn't!

159
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,890
Just admit it was my brother

160
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,460
who made you steal,

161
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,020
and I'll let you go.

162
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,020
Still won't confess?

163
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,620
Very ungrateful.

164
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,740
Beat him to death!

165
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,180
Don't you wrong my young master again!

166
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,060
My young master is better than you!

167
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:19,700
Xiaoman.

168
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:20,700
Xiaoman.

169
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,020
Xiaoman.

170
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,060
Xiaoman.

171
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,860
Xiaoman.

172
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,820
Xiaoman, are you alright?

173
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,300
Xiaoman.

174
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,780
Xiaoman.

175
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,900
You servant is a thief.

176
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,900
He stole two rice balls
and refused to admit it.

177
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,220
Hanyi,

178
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,380
I've already taught him a lesson.

179
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,020
Oh dear,

180
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,940
how can he be so fragile?

181
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,740
Just after a couple of blows,

182
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,980
he's already dead.

183
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:54,860
Hanyi,

184
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,180
such a fragile servant
isn't worth keeping.

185
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,540
I've got a few

186
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,380
sturdy ones here.

187
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,780
If you don't mind,

188
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,580
I'll give you one.

189
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,900
Hey, any of you want to go

190
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,700
serve Young Master Hanyi?

191
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,380
No one?

192
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,220
Fine, then just

193
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,500
serve him here.

194
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,220
Give Young Master Hanyi a bath.

195
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,540
Hey.

196
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,340
Aim properly!

197
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:25,700
Hey.

198
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,300
Have a good bath.

199
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:31,860
Let's go.

200
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,620
Take him away and bury him.

201
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,920
(Young Master Hanyi,)

202
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,300
(you clearly have the ability.)

203
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,260
(Why do you let them bully you?)

204
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,540
Huh?

205
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,100
Still floating?

206
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,260
Are you dead?

207
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,220
Hey,

208
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,060
blind man!

209
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:08,900
Are you dead?

210
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,060
Come on.

211
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,420
It hasn't been that long.

212
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,540
Hey, blind man.

213
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,540
So you were pretending all along?

214
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,860
Young Master Hanyi, I'm sorry.

215
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,340
Young Master Qianli made me.

216
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,100
I'm just a servant.

217
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:44,890
Please spare...

218
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,620
I'm sorry,

219
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,260
Xiaoman.

220
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,260
(Zhang Wencai, owner of Zhang family)

221
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,460
They're indeed a wealthy family.

222
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,860
New maids, line up.

223
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,460
Once you're in the Zhang Manor,

224
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,380
you must follow our rules.

225
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,500
Take your tags,

226
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,920
go to your respective courtyards,

227
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,580
and report to your masters.

228
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,500
Understood?

229
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,340
