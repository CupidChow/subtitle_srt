00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:18,940
Hanyi.

19
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,380
I trusted you so much.

20
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,060
You betrayed me.

21
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,380
One Though is like this.

22
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,860
I've explained

23
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,260
"Become a Buddha

24
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,980

26
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,300
Hand Wanyue over to me.

27
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,140
Otherwise, I'll kill you.

28
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,460
Kill him.

29
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:53,700
Kill him.

30
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:54,900
Kill him.

31
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,300
Kill him.

32
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,540
Kill him.

Water.

35
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:58,980
Ah.

36
00:02:59,100 --> 00:02:59,660
Alright.

37
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,800
- Wanyue.
- I'll get water.

38
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,460
Wanyue.

39
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:05,740
Get up.

40
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,100
You're awake.

41
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,100
Young Master.

42
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:13,740
What?

43
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,380
Young Master, you can see.

44
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,020
Yes.

45
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,300
Come on,

46
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,700
take the medicine.

47
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,500
Ms. Xu.

48
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,580
Why are you here?

49
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,420
Hanyi brought me over.

50
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,340
Hanyi took all the eye medicine

51
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,220
to save you.

52
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,700
Isn't that medicine very toxic?

53
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:30,860
That medicine...

54
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,820
Aren't I just fine?

55
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:32,740
I'm alright.

56
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:33,620
Wanyue.

57
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,300
We're safe now.

58
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,540
Don't worry.

59
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:45,860
I'm fine.

60
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,300
From now on, we'll all be fine.

61
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,700
When I was little,
Ms. Xu used to treat people here

62
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,820
to earn money for the family.

63
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,700
She always told me to learn from her

64
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,020
so I could take over.

65
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,620
Unfortunately,

66
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,100
I was too focused

67
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,660
on revenge back then.

68
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,100
I didn't learn well.

69
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,060
To this day,

70
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,500
I'm still just a half-trained doctor.

71
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:12,700
Wanyue,

72
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,620
shall we start over?

73
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,700
Start over?

74
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,300
We can renovate this place.

75
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,180
You and Ms. Xu can practice medicine.

76
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,620
We can also sell incense.

77
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,100
We'll start a new life,

78
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:24,900
okay?

79
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,700
Sure.

80
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,060
We'll start a new life

81
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,580
right here.

82
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,300

83
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,020

101
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,540
Look.

102
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,060
It's really beautiful.

103
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,740

107
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:36,860
Wanyue,

108
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,900
don't blame him.

109
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,220
He just didn't want you to be sad.

110
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,060
Actually,

111
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,220
even if I hadn't taken all the medicine,

112
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,820
I wouldn't have lived long.

113
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,740
Can you make up a lie for me?

114
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,460
Don't tell Wanyue

115
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,340
that I'm dying.

116
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,940
I just want to see her happy
for a little longer.

117
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,700
I want to see her

118
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,980
smile for a little longer.

119
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,300
Will you?

120
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,820
Ms. Xu, tell me.

121
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,940
How much longer does he have?

122
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,900
These past days,

123
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,300
he's been relying entirely on medicine.

124
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,860
Tomorrow,

125
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,340
his vision will be completely gone.

126
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,460
When he goes completely blind,

127
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,380
his life will end.

128
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,580
Young Master,

129
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,300
I've decided.

Our little puppy,

131
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,700

Pear Candy,

133
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,060
alright?

134
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,700
From now on,

135
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,140
I'll take it to the riverbank for a walk

136
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,660
every day.

137
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,980
You promised me.

138
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,660
Come, let's eat.

139
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,740
Such a feast.

140
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,700
All your favorite dishes.

141
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,380
Come.

142
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,900
After we eat,

143
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,300
shall we take a walk by the river?

144
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,100
Sure.

145
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,060
Let's bring Pear Candy along.

146
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,540
Alright.

147
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,060
Come on,

148
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:35,780
Pear Candy.

149
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,660
Wanyue,

150
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,300
I'm a little tired.

151
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,860
Then let's sit here.

152
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:41,700
Alright.

153
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,300
Here.

154
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,100
Wanyue.

155
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,060
I want

156
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,860
to eat another pear candy.

157
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,340
Alright.

158
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,340
Here.

159
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,740
The first time in my life

160
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,020
I ever ate pear candy

161
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,340
was from you.

162
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,140
One candy, and the pain will go away.

163
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,620
Back then,

164
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,780
I still called you "Miss."

165
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,260
Now,

166
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,140
I call you "Young Master."

167
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,580
Miss.

168
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,740
Young Master.

169
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,540
Miss.

170
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,300
I feel a little sleepy.

171
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,780
I want to rest for a while.

172
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,300
Sleep.

173
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,100
Remember to wake me up.

174
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,820
Later, our Young Master still

175
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,860
has to go home and practice calligraphy.

176
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,100
Alright.

177
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:33,020
(Spring of 1945, Jiang City)

178
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,900
Hey, over here.

179
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,700
Oh, coming.

180
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,340
Wanyue.

181
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:45,820
Yanran.

182
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,300
It's been 13 years.

183
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,700
I'm back.

184
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,140
It's good you're back.

185
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,500
It's good.

186
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,180
Let's go home.

187
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,220
Alright.

188
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:10,660
Come.

189
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:13,900
Let's go.

190
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,180
I brought Yanran to see you.

191
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,300
Zhang Hanyi

192
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,500
is buried here?

193
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,300
Yes.

194
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,580
But

195
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,380
I don't see a grave.

196
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,740
He was indeed buried here.

197
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,220
In the first spring after his death,

198
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,620
a pear tree grew here.

199
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,660
Later, it grew taller and taller.

200
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,020
Just as the ancients said,

201
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,180
"Now, it stands tall like a pavilion."

202
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,300
You love pear blossoms,

203
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,500
so a pear tree is growing here.

204
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,660
Someone must've planted it.

205
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,940
Hanyi planted it.

206
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,780
(Wanyue,)

207
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,100
(when you read this letter,)

208
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,660
(I've likely already passed.)

209
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,420
(To Wanyue)

210
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,460
(If I had never met you in this life,)

211
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,500
(perhaps I'd have long ceased
to linger in this world.)

212
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,860
(Perhaps I'd have left
this world long ago.)

213
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,620
(I often thought fate was unfair to me.)

214
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,500
(But whenever I stood by your side)

215
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,180
(holding your hand,)

216
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,020
(I felt grateful)

217
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,420
(for the kindness fate has shown me.)

218
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,180
(I don't know why I love you,)

219
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,660
(just as I don't know
why people live and die.)

220
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,540
(But I know deeply that I love you.)

221
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,780
Don't let her know.

222
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,340
Never come

223
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,860
looking for me again.

224
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,340
(I originally planned)

225
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,020
(to leave silently before death arrived)

226
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,860
(to face it alone,)

227
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,260
(but in the end, I lacked the courage.)

228
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,740
Don't tell Wanyue

229
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,140
that I'm dying.

230
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,860
(So please forgive me)

231
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,580
(for not telling you
about my illness sooner.)

232
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,100
(Selfishly, I feared
breaking your heart.)

233
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,700
(Selfishly,)

234
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,260
(I only wished to spend
the last days of my life)

235
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,460
(watching your smile.)

236
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,580
(Selfishly,)

237
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,780
(I left before you.)

238
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,020
(Please forgive me.)

239
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,420
(From now on,
I'll no longer be by your side.)

240
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:36,740
(Wanyue,)

241
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,740
(I don't know if the days ahead
will be better.)

242
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,940
(I worry that one day,
war will reach our village.)

243
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,780
(That you'll long for a hug,)

244
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,180
(but no one will give you one.)

245
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,060
(But I don't have much time left.)

246
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,020
(So I brought many pear seeds)

247
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,580
(to let them be buried with me.)

248
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,060
(My shade)

249
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,340
(will always be here waiting for you.)

250
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,460
(Wanyue,)

251
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,300
(you must live on.)

252
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,300
(You promised me)

253
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,580
(to be my eyes)

254
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,580
(and to see the world for me.)

255
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,220
(You must see enough,)

256
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,220
(then come find me,)

257
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,100
(and tell me)

258
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,700
