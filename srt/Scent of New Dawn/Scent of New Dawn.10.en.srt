I know, okay?

00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:16,780
It's Miss Gu.

24

Let's see who dares to touch him.

00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:19,860
Miss Gu,

26
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,220
this is a personal grudge.

27
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,100
The Gu family shouldn't interfere.

28
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,660
I insist on interfering.

29
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:25,660
Mr. Wu,

30
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,500
perhaps we should let this go for now.

31
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,540

Miss Gu,

35
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,300
it's a misunderstanding.

36
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:46,900
Let's go.

37
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:48,620

00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,580
How was it, Mr. Zhang?

40
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,700
Wasn't I cool?

41
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,100
Thank you for stepping in, Miss Gu.

42
00:01:59,300 --> 00:01:59,900
But

43
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:00,900
why are you here?

44
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,020
Didn't we agree I'd visit you?

45
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,900
I'm here to work.

46
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,140
Work?

47

of Zhang's Incense Shop.

Wanyue.

51
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,020
Why didn't you tell me about this?

52
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,060
There's more.

53
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,340
Miss Gu

54
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,740
has another surprise for you.

55
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,100
Surprise?

56
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,820
Come with me.

57
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,100
(Wanyue,)

58
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,140
(what's this all about?)

(Miss Gu introduced us
to a business opportunity.)

60
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,060
(If we secure it,)

61
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,900
(we'll have the capital
to confront Zhang Wencai.)

62
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,900
Mr. Laurent.

63
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,940
Miss Yanran.

64
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,060
It's so wonderful
to see you again in China.

65
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,380
Everything going well?

66
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:43,980
Thank you.

67
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:44,940
Everything is fine.

68
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:09,580
Young Master,

69
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:10,860
this way.

70
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,260
Nice to meet you.

71
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,540
Miss Yanran,

72
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,660
you should know

73
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,580
how important this batch
of perfume is to me.

74
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:19,620
So,

75
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,100
I recommended the best
incense maker to you.

76
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,940
Mr. Zhang is so young

77
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,220
and also blind.

78
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,420
Can he really create the perfume I want?

79
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,620
What kind of perfume

80
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,100
does Mr. Laurent want?

81
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,260
Mr. Laurent

82
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,260
wants to recreate
a classic French perfume,

83
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:37,820
Sophia,

84
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,780
but with a Chinese touch.

85
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,300
He originally planned
to place the order in France,

86
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,900
but time is too tight.

87
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,860
He can't make it.

88
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,180
So, he hopes to find
an incense maker in China to create it.

89
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,460
Come on,

90
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,180
Mr. Laurent.

91
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,100
This is Sophia.

92
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,860
Can you make it?

93
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:27,900
No problem.

94
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,100
I can do it.

95
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,860
Are you sure you don't want to smell it

96
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,020
before deciding?

97
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,340
I've already smelled it.

98
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,740
Wait a moment, Mr. Zhang.

99
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,820
What are you doing?

100
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,740
How can he enter my studio?

101
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,780
Don't worry, Mr. Laurent.

102
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,300
Don't worry.

103
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,500
Just wait a moment.

104
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,300
Don't worry.

105
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,380
Mr. Laurent,

106
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,740
please examine it.

107
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,100
(Zhang's Incense Shop)

108
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,860
So, what does Mr. Laurent mean?

109
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:44,610
Did it work?

110
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,990
He's not saying anything definite.

111
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:51,700
Zhang's Incense Shop.

112
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,100
Mr. Laurent,

113
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:53,940
please hold.

114
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,500
Young Master.

115
00:05:59,020 --> 00:05:59,540
Hello?

116
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,100
Alright.

117
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,180
No problem.

118
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:11,780
How did it go?

119
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:12,940
It's done.

120
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,770
They want one thousand bottles

121
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,620
for 200 thousand.

122
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,020
But

123
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,900
we must complete the order in a week.

124
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:20,860
Why such urgency?

125
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,700
Laurent said

126
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,580
this batch is

127
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,780
for the Chiang family.

128
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,160
Madam Song is going to the U.S.
next month for fundraising,

129
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,210
and the perfume
is meant as a gift to take along.

130
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,540
Can we finish such a large order?

131
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,340
We must.

132
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,060
If we don't,

133
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,460
we'll have to pay him
400 thousand in penalty.

134
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,220
Double the amount?

135
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,540
No way.

136
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,420
Let's not take this deal.

137
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,300
We have to.

138
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,740
Fortune favors the bold.

139
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:42,820
With 200 thousand,

140
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,020
our incense shop

141
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,180
can transform into a department store.

142
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,220
So,

143
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,780
we must develop

144
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,100
the Chinese-style formula

145
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,780
and produce the samples within a week.

146
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,820

147
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,940

148

(Fragrance Spectrum)

149

(Angelica)

153
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:48,860
We did it.

154
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,340
Great.

155
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,140
Great!

156
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:56,740
Over here.

157
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,100
Be careful.

158
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:08,380
(Formula)

159
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:15,940
Well done.

160
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:17,980
Not bad at all.

161
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,065

Wanyue.

163
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,500
Miss Gu.

164
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,180
All 40 types of materials we needed

165
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,500
are out of stock.

166
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:35,940
How is that possible?

167
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,220
Last night, someone suddenly
bought them all,

168
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:38,980
and only

169
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,460
the ones we needed.

170
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,860
Who's so shameless?

171
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,060
Miss Gu,

172
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,540
your words are quite harsh.

173
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,740
I spent my own money to buy materials.

174
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,500
How does that make me shameless,

175
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,260
huh?

176
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,220
Xiaohu,

177
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,900
you stole our formula.

178
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,100
Xiaohu,

179
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,540
thank you.

180
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,500
I'm here today

181
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,860
to return your formula.

182
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:10,860
Hanyi,

183
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,020
since you're busy,

184
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,020
I'll be leaving now.

185
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,100
Xiaohu.

186
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,860
How's the factory doing?

187
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:27,860
Don't worry.

188
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,460
Samples will be ready today.

189
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,060
Let's go.

190
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:33,980
Okay.

191
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,820
He looked so honest.

192
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,260
How could he do such a thing?

193
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,380
Xiaohu,

194
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,140
was it really you?

195
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:43,940
Young Master,

196
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,180
I'm sorry.

197
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,980
I was forced to do it.

198
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,780
They threatened me with my mother.

199
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,500
I really had no choice.

200
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,620
Leave.

201
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,460
I don't want to see you again.

202
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,300
Young Master,

203
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:10,940
what do we do?

204
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,540
The delivery is due next week.

205
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,020
Right now,

206
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,300
we have to redevelop the formula.

207
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:17,980
Is there still time?

208
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,660
Don't worry.

209
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,340
We still have a chance.

210
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,500
Young Master Qianli.

211
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:42,980
Young Master Qianli.

212
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,900
The product is ready.

213
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,020
How is it?

214
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,820
Start mass production now.

215
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,100
Sure.

216
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,740
This is the scent.

217
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,580
I'll arrange for someone
to pick up the goods.

218
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,960
For now, there's only one bottle.

219
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,820
What do you mean?

220
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,260
Mr. Laurent, please

221
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,420
give us one more week.

222
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,820
In a week,

223
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,780
we'll have one thousand bottles ready.

224
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,980
Say that again?

225
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,140
How many bottles do you have?

226
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,220
For now,

227
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,620
only this one bottle.

228
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,180
Yanran,

229
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,380
this is the person you introduced to me?

230
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,820
Mr. Laurent, due to the shortage
of materials,

231
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,060
we're also anxious.

232
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,380
Please grant us another week.

233
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,700
I beg you.

234
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,580
Didn't I tell you

235
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,620
who this perfume is for?

236
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,660
Can you afford to offend them?

237
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,700
You're doomed.

238
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,700
You've dragged me down with you too.

239
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,500
I knew you Chinese people

240
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,260
can't be trusted.

241
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:11,580
Mr. Laurent.

242
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,700
Mr. Laurent.

243
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,780
Not all Chinese people

244
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,260
are like them.

245
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,140
And who are you?

246
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,260
I'm the manager of the largest
department store in Jiang City,

247
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,220
Zhang Qianli.

248
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,300
Nice to meet you.

249
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,620
I've come with sincerity.

250
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,660
Mr. Laurent,

251
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,990
the perfume you're looking for

252
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,420
is this one, correct?

253
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:41,980
Yes,

254
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,660
I'm looking for Sophia.

255
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,820
How did you know I wanted Sophia?

256
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,200
What's your relationship with them?

257
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,140
You're together?

258
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,020
No.

259
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,620
If you must define a relationship,

260
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,980
it's

261
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,740
competitors.

262
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,100
Careful.

263
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,340
Come on.

264
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,700
Please step aside.

265
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,620
Make way.

266
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,020
Here.

267
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,380
I made one thousand bottles like this.

268
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,300
These are just a small portion.

269
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,820
You have one thousand bottles?

270
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,710
All in stock

271
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,140
and ready for delivery at any time.

272
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:21,980
That's great.

273
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,720
I'll take them all.

274
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,300
Thank you for trusting me, Mr. Laurent.

275
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,700
I've always done business

276
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,180
with integrity.

277
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,860
Even if I breach the contract,

278
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,860
I'll pay the penalty

279
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,620
honestly.

280
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,020
I'll definitely pay

281
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,660
the 400 thousand penalty.

282
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,420
However,

283
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,980
it's no small amount.

284
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,260
Mr. Laurent,

285
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,220
please give us

286
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,380
a few more days.

287
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,500
How do I know you won't run away?

288
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,660
I want the money today,

289
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,380
or I'll see you at the police station.

290
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:56,860
Your choice.

291
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,180
Mr. Laurent,

292
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,860
we'll definitely pay.

293
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,400
I'll vouch for them
in the name of the Gu family.

294
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,460
Even if they run,

295
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,500
the Governor's Manor can't run, right?

296
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,140
Please grant them a few more days.

297
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,620
Please.

298
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,500
Mr. Laurent,

299
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,660
I think

300
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,900
they're quite pitiful.

301
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:15,820
Come on.

302
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,300
For my sake,

303
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,300
what about

304
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,740
giving them

305
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,540
one day?

306
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,420
It's only 400 thousand.

307
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,180
One day

308
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:25,900
should be enough.

309
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,060
One day is too short.

310
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:27,980
I'll give you one day.

311
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,620
Mr. Laurent has

312
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,100
already been generous.

313
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,420
Be grateful.

314
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,300
Fine.

315
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,380
No problem.

316
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,420
Mr. Laurent,

317
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,180
if you don't mind,

318
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,380
let's sign the contract now.

319
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,340
Cash

320
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,140
for goods.

321
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,500
Deal.

322
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,020
Deal.

323
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,580
One day.

325
