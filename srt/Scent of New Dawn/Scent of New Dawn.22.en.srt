Big news!

19
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,980
The Governor of Jiang City,
Gu Liancheng, suddenly died.

20
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,100
(Jiang City)
The Japanese army took control.

21
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,380
Former chairman of the Chamber
of Commerce, Zhang Wencai

22
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,990
was appointed as the chairman
of the Sino-Japanese Liaison Committee,

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,300
willingly becoming a traitor.

24
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,540
Big news!

25
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,060
The Governor of Jiang City,
Gu Liancheng, suddenly died.

26
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,420
The Japanese army took control.

27
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,380
(Letter of Appointment)

28
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,700
(Zhang Wencai appointed chairman)

29
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,500
You see,

30
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,580
Zhang Wencai wants us
to pay taxes to the Japanese,

31
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,540
and the amount is even more
than what we earn.

32
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,020
What kind of nonsense is this?

33
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:40,900
Wanyue,

34
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,380
you're our chairwoman.

35
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,260
You must have a plan, right?

36
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,700
He's targeting you.

37
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,680
We all followed you
and chose you as chairwoman,

38
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,800
so you must take responsibility.

39
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,420
Alright,

40
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,780
everyone calm down.

41
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,420
This isn't entirely Wanyue's fault.

42
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,200
Right now, the Japanese are in charge,

43
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,500
and we're all having a hard time.

44
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:55,900
Hey,

45
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,820
how can you say that?

46
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,860
She's the chairwoman,

47
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,300
so she can't just do nothing.

48
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,420
What should we do now?

49
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,620
Say something.

50
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,460
Zhang Wencai,

51
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,780
what do you want?

52
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,700
Of course, I want to kill.

53
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,100
But

54
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,820
not yet.

55
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,460
Sato wants to see you.

56
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,100
Take them.

57
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:33,660
Wanyue.

58
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,180
Wanyue!

59
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,420
Wanyue!

60
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,940
(Japanese Army Headquarters
in Jiang City)

61
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,780
Mr. Sato,

62
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,900
they're here.

63
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,220
Hanyi,

64
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,660
I've heard so much about you.

65
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,380
We finally meet.

66
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:15,780
Please, sit.

67
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:33,900
Hanyi,

68
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:35,980
take a sniff.

69
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,180
Mosquito Repellent?

70
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,260
No,

71
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,300
No, this isn't our formula.

72
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,260
This contains

73
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,260
marigold.

74
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,940
My marigolds come
from a farther, warmer place,

75
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,100
so their fragrance is stronger.

76
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,660
Even such a subtle difference

77
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,140
doesn't escape you.

78
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,360
You truly are
a genius in incense-making.

79
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,620
Why have you

80
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,500
captured us?

81
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,420
Just say it directly.

82
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,780
To be frank,

83
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,260
I've been interested
in Chinese incense culture.

84
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,340
I appreciate you.

85
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,540
I hope

86
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,460
we can have a private discussion.

87
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:34,900
Flowery Dew.

88
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:35,660
Ruoshui.

89
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,900
Sophia.

90
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:37,980
Mosquito Repellent.

91
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,460
Hanyi,

92
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,180
I like every incense you make.

93
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,580
But with your talent,

94
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,380
making these is truly beneath you.

95
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,180
You want me to make incense for you?

96
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,020
Exactly.

97
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,500
I want you to recreate the legendary
lost incense recorded in ancient texts.

98
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,140
Only these

99
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,940
are worthy of your talent, Hanyi.

100
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,300
In Legends of Incense,

101
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,860
there's mention of a scent

102
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,900
called "One Thought."

103
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,020
Become a Buddha

104
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,990
(Legends of Incense)
or become a devil with one thought.

105
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,300
I'm very curious

106
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,380
what kind of scent

107
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,580
could be so intoxicating?

108
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:33,740
Hanyi.

109
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,500
Hanyi.

110
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,260
I'm afraid

111
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,380
you'll be disappointed.

112
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,260
I can't recreate

113
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,300
lost incense.

114
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,820
If even you can't do it,

115
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,140
then who else in this world could?

116
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:50,940
I'm sorry,

117
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,500
but I can't help.

118
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,100
Hanyi.

119
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,180
I advise you to reconsider my offer.

120
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,020
After all, you've lost your protector.

121
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,420
It won't be easy to survive here.

122
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:13,900
Wouldn't you agree,

123
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,940
Miss Wanyue?

124
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,020
I'll think it over carefully.

125
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,100
Release them.

126
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,060
Yes.

127
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,570
Young Master,

128
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,380
today I saw several teenage girls

129
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,340
being taken into
the Japanese Chamber.

130
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,460
I noticed as well.

131
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,340
That incense studio was strange.

132
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,060
I couldn't be sure what I smelled,

133
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,260
but I'm certain

134
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,460
it was dangerous.

135
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,580
We mustn't cooperate with Sato.

136
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:07,860
Do as you see fit.

137
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:27,340
No one is here.

138
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:29,980
Sir, no one is here.

139
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,820
Sir, no one is here.

140
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,980
Leave Jiang City.

141
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,300
When?

142
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:36,980
Now.

143
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,020
Alright,

144
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:38,980
I'll help you.

145
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,300
Launch a citywide pursuit.

146
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,180
I won't allow them to leave Jiang City.

147
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,990
(The streets are full
of Japanese soldiers.)

148
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,700
(They must be after us.)

149
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,500
(Jiang City)
Young Master,

150
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,560
once we get on the train, we'll be safe.

151
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,940
How many fingers?

152
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:46,500
Two.

153
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:47,780
How many?

154
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,420
Three.

155
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:49,860
How many?

156
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,460
Two.

157
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:51,700
How many?

158
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,340
Young Master,

159
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,780
they're targeting the blind.

160
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,100
How many?

161
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:58,860
This is three.

162
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:00,700
How many?

163
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,300
Four.

164
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,380
How many?

165
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,180
One.

166
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:05,980
How many?

167
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,460
Three.

168
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,420
Go.

169
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,300
How many?

170
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,940
Answer me.

171
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:15,900
How many fingers?

172
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,100
You're so careless.

173
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,460
Officer,

174
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,500
we're together.

175
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,180
Wait,

176
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,820
you haven't answered my question.

177
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,220
How many fingers?

178
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,180
Five.

179
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:50,700
Go.

180
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,500
Move forward.

181
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:57,860
How many?

182
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:04,820
Wanyue.

183
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:05,420
Yes?

184
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,500
Once we leave Jiang City,

185
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,100
let's forget everything.

186
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,420
Forget everything?

187
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,420
Yes.

188
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,260
I know what Jiang City means to you.

189
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,420
It means the same to me.

190
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,100
Everything that happened in Jiang City,

191
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,580
the good,

192
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,660
the bad,

193
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,220
love

194
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,620
or hatred.

195
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,060
But

196
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,220
we're just ordinary people.

197
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,820
If there were no war,

198
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,900
perhaps we could fight for something.

199
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,500
But in times like these,

200
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,060
we're merely grains of sand,

201
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,660
unable to resist the flood.

202
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,540
Wanyue,

203
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,300
those who're alive must live well.

204
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,940
That's the greatest respect
for the dead.

205
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,220
When we arrive in a new place,

206
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,860
let's not open an incense shop.

207
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,500
Let's open a clinic, shall we?

208
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,980
You'll be the owner,

209
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,500
and I'll be your assistant.

210
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,900
We'll plant a pear tree in the yard.

211
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,220
And we'll have

212
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,420
a little puppy.

213
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,890
We'll bicker and laugh together
for a lifetime,

214
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,660
alright?

215
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:49,660
Wanyue.

216
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:50,700
Wanyue.

217
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:52,780
Let go of me!

218
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:54,940
Wanyue!

219
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:56,940
Wanyue!

220
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:00,980
Wanyue!

221
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,300
Wanyue!

222
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,220
Wanyue!

223
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,500
Wanyue!

224
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,260
Wanyue!

225
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:09,700
Wanyue!

226
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,580
Miss Wanyue.

227
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:23,820
(Jiang City)

228
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:29,740
(Hello?)

229
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,820
(Is this the Japanese
Chamber of Commerce?)

230
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,380
(I need to speak to Sato.)

231
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,660
(You're back.)

232
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,020
(Have you arranged)

233
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,340
(everything)

234
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,700
(with Qiao?)

235
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,990
(It's all taken care of.)

236
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,380
(Don't worry.)

237
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,180
(That's good.)

238
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,220
I've helped you keep him.

239
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,220
When will you fulfill

240
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,700
your promise to me?

241
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,340
The train is about to leave.

242
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,420
Why don't we go somewhere else

243
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,700
to talk?

244
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:01,700
Wanyue.

245
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,180
Wanyue.
