Say that again?

19
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,820
If you truly care about your sister,

20
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,740
you wouldn't want
to see her suffer, right?

00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,020
Yanran...

22
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,180
Yanran must want her brother's blessing,

not to be torn apart.

24
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,500
You're right.

25
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,460
There's nothing more painful
than unrequited love in this world.

26
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,860
So, please, be magnanimous

27
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,450
and stop making things difficult
for my young master.

28
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,220
You're quite an interesting maid.

29
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,020
I've never met such

30
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,180
a devoted maid in my life.

31
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,900
Even though you lent me money,

32
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,300
it doesn't mean you can do
as you please.

33
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,980
Hey, why are you angry so quickly?

34
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:15,940
Just now, I was...

35
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,740
I was giving you

36
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,780
a Western greeting kiss.

37
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,100
I've been in France for so long,
and it's become a habit.

38
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,300
China doesn't have that,

39
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,180
so please refrain

40
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,380
from doing it again.

41
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,340
I won't do it anymore.

42
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,860
I'm sorry, okay?

43
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,380
Is it clean now?

44
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,380
It's clean.

45
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,740
Let's resume the lesson.

46
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,460
Please have a seat.

47
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,990
The history of incense use
in China is very long.

48
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,740
Two thousand years ago,

49
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,900
people started to wear scented sachets.

50
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,300
Mr. Zhang,

51
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,980
do you also have one?

52
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,460
May I take a sniff?

53
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:51,740
Miss Gu,

54
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,820
we agreed earlier on the rules.

55
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,370
How can you go back on your word?

56
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,180
Alright.

57
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,140
Don't be so stern all the time.

58
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,380
I'm just curious.

59
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,980
I won't bother you anymore, okay?

60
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:01,580
Continue.

61
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,220
Young Master, good job.

62
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,260
I thought I had wiped it clean.

63
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,580
It seems it's going smoothly.

64
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,260
Isn't this the outcome you wanted?

65
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,020
Not just me,

66
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,500
it's us.

67
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,820
Let's go celebrate your birthday.

68
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,620
Is there a place you want to go?

69
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,280
That's alright.

70
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,380
I'm tired.

(Zhang's Incense Shop)

72
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,100
Young Master,

73
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,180
I've cooked longevity noodles for you.

74
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:02,900
Take it away,

75
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,300
I'm not hungry.

76
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,660
Then I'll leave it here.

77
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,300
Eat it while it's hot.

82
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,980
is your birthday.

83
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,460
There are many people
who care about you.

84
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,980
How difficult could it be

85
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,140
to know your birthday?

86
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,220
Alright.

87
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,460
(Looking good.)

88
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,980
(Did you give me a gift)

89
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,740
(out of sincerity)

90
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,060
(or pretense?)

91
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,500
To help you quickly
become the Zhang family owner.

92
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,300
It seems it's going smoothly.

93
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,820
(Isn't this the outcome you wanted?)

94
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,500
(Not just me,)

95
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,860
it's us.

Young Master,

102
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,340
wake up.

103
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:11,820
Young Master?

104
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,460
I'm coming in.

105
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,940
You're already dressed.

106
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,500
Why didn't you call me?

107
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,680
When I thought about meeting Gu Yanran,

108
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,540
I couldn't wait.

109
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,580
Did you sleep well last night,

110
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:31,940
Young Master?

111
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,500
Yes,

112
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:34,860
better than ever.

113
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,020
I even dreamt of Gu Yanran.

114
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,260
Let's go.

115
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,820
I'll take you to the Governor's Manor.

116
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,100
Hey,

117
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,620
you'll only be waiting outside.

118
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,300
I'll go alone instead

119
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,660
to avoid Gu Yanran

120
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,700
misconstruing our relationship.

121
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,020
Place bergamot at the door
to give off a fresh, sweet aroma.

122
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,590
Those who enter and leave

123
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,740
will carry its fragrance.

124
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,180
Hang a Tianzhu aloeswood sachet
in front of the mirror

125
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,100
to calm the mind.

126
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,300
Reflect on oneself

127
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,580
when facing the mirror.

128
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,620
White birch ointment
from Changbai Mountain,

129
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,620
mixed with Siamese Bodhi incense pills,

130
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,540
clears the senses

131
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,160
for a good night's sleep.

132
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,260
Here, over here.

133
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,620
Please help me pick it up.

134
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,540
Sorry to trouble you.

135
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,740
Apologies.

136
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,500
Is this yours?

137
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:49,540
Thank you so much.

138
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,660
You're really kind.

139
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,580
Is your young master here again

140
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,380
for lessons with Miss Gu?

141
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,020
Yes.

142
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,500
You didn't know.

143
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,860
No men were allowed

144
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,140
in the Governor's Manor before.

145
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,660
The governor is very protective
of his sister.

146
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,060
Elder brothers are like fathers,

147
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,740
and the governor is a doting one.

148
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,980
That's where you're wrong.

149
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,060
I overheard

150
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,900
the old housekeeper once say

151
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,020
the governor and Miss Gu
aren't real siblings.

152
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:17,990
Mind your own business.

153
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,740
Get back to work.

154
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,860
Got it.

155
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,180
That's all for today.

156
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,140
Let me walk you out.

157
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,300
No need.

158
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,540
Miss Wanyue has come
to pick me up.

159
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,180
I'll take my leave.

160
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,220
You got it wrong.

161
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,180
Wanyue gave this to me.

162
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,150
It doesn't mean anything.

163
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,820
Who is Wanyue?

164
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,740
My personal maid.

165
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,740
It's Wanyue again.

166
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,020
Young Master,

167
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:34,780
let's go.

168
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,060
Okay.

169
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,420
Miss,

170
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,380
this is a letter for you
from Miss Wanyue.

171
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:04,900
By the way,

172
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,980
I bought some pear candy.

173
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,540
Do you want some?

174
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,540
Pear candy.

175
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,180
(I have pear candy.)

176
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,220
(Have one,)

177
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,220
and the pain will go away.

178
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,020
(It doesn't hurt anymore.)

179
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,140
Young Master Qianli,

180
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,420
without Master Zhang,

181
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,740
there'd be no Green Gang today.

182
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,740
Your matters are

183
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,220
our Green Gang's matters.

184
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,540
I'm counting

185
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,380
on you then.

186
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,140
(Zhang's Incense Shop)

187
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,380
Zhang Hanyi!

188
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,100
Let's go.

189
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:26,860
Where is he?

Get out!

192
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,540
Young Master.

193
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,540
What do you want?

194
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,380
Young Master, be careful.

00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,300
They're fighting.

199
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,000
What happened?

200
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,330
Why are they fighting so fiercely?

201
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,420
What's happening?

202
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,660
Let's go.

203
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,860
Don't act rashly, Young Master.
