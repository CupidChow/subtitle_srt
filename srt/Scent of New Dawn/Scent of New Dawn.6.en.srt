I'm back.

Why can't you take a joke,

27
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:33,620
huh?

28
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:34,620
Let go!

29
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,340
Did a donkey kick your head?

Talking about dying like it's nothing.

If you're so eager to die,
follow me to the battlefield.

32
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,460
At least you'd be a hero.

33
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,980
You must be out of your mind.

34
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,500
What a buzzkill.

35
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,100
Let's go.

36
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,260
Young Master.

37
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,460
Young Master.

38
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,140
You didn't need to defy the governor.

39
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,580
After all, we might rely on him.

40
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,620
If

41
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,740
I hadn't stopped the governor,

42
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,620
would you have gone with him?

43
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,900
I would.

44
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,900
But I'd definitely come back.

45
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,740
Our revenge is

46
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,340
not yet complete.

47
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,220
If

48
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,700
you had gone to his manor,

49
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,460
weren't you afraid he might...

50
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,300
It's been a long time

51
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,540
since I felt fear.

52
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,220
Those who have experienced
despair and terror

53
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,540
will grow armor on their hearts.

54
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,900
And they'll no longer fear.

55
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,260
Young Master, aren't you the same?

56
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,900
Unfortunately,

57
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,900
there's a crack

58
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,260
in my armor.

59
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,220
But

60
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,660
that's the only place
where light can enter.

61
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,540
Young Master,
you said you liked me just now.

62
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,660
Did you really mean it?

63
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,060
I...

64
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,380
I just went along

65
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,060
with the governor's words.

66
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:12,660
That's good.

67
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,220
You shouldn't like someone like me.

68
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,700
If that crack

69
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,140
is your weakness,

70
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,420
I advise you to seal it.

71
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,820
That light

72
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,340
was never meant for us.

73
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,980
(But that light isn't someone else.)

74
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:38,900
(It's you,)

75
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,220
(Miss.)

76
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,980
(Jiang City)

77
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,540
What a fine gentleman.

78
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,780
He must be here to pick someone.

79
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,900
How fortunate.

80
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,980
Such a grand procession.

81
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,740
Exactly.

82
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,980
Who is it for?

83
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,420
(Gu Yanran, Gu Liancheng's sister)

84
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:19,980
Liancheng!

85
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,020
Liancheng.

86
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:28,800
Look at the camera!

87
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:33,990
You studied abroad for so long,

88
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,580
but you still act like a kid.

89
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,940
Let me see if you've changed.

90
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,220
It's been two years.

91
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,020
Did you miss me?

92
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:39,780
No.

93
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,340
I wrote you ten letters,

94
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,580
and you only replied to one.

95
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:43,900
I don't think

96
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,740
you care about me.

97
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,660
Who said that?

98
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,860
I brought you a gift.

99
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,500
Daisies from France.

100
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,090
They traveled across the ocean with me.

101
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,180
I watched them

102
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,140
sprout and grow.

103
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,020
I timed it perfectly.

104
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,280
They bloomed just as I arrived.

105
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,140
Do you like them?

106
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,060
That's it?

107
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,340
Just potted flowers?

108
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,260
And so little?

109
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,490
There are many fun
and delicious things in France

110
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,800
and this is all you brought back?

111
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:06,500
Of course not.

112
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:06,900
Come.

113
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,700
Come home with me.

114
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,740
There's more at home.

115
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,380
(Jiang City)

116
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,180
Let me ask you.

117
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,340
in France, were there any foreigners

118
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,580
chasing after you?

119
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:17,860

140
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,860
didn't you say in your letters
that you'd find a wife?

00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,230
You're going back on your word again.

For me, getting married is easy.

143
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,140
Then hurry up.

144
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,160
You might not be anxious,
but I'm worried for you.

145
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,780
What's the rush?

146
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,340
Well,

147
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,980
it's about seniority.

148
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,180
If you don't get married,
I'll have to wait, too.

149
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,140
You're not in a hurry to marry,

150
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,780

This...

158
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:42,580
What is it?

159
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,020
This...

160
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:43,860

Oh my goodness.

164
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,740
I thought something happened.

165
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,340
You were shouting early in the morning.

166
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,100
I already told you in the letter,

167
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,460
someone recreated it.

168
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,580
Oh.

169
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,020
Now I remember.

170
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,340
An incense maker named

171
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,980
Zhang Hanyi.

172
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,260
Isn't he a talented young man?

173
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,540
Can I meet him?

174
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:05,940
No.

175
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,020
He's an old man.

176
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,220
And he's not in Jiang City.

177
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:09,740
Fine.

178
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:11,780
Stop shouting.

179
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,420
I heard yesterday

180
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,700
(Zhang Manor)
the shop had a good day.

181
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,820
Thanks to the governor

182
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,980
for buying everything.

183
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,460
That Gu Liancheng
who held a gun to my head?

184
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,140
You seem to

185
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,300
know him well.

186
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,180
Father, you misunderstand.

187
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,300
In fact, Gu Liancheng

188
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,820
almost killed me.

189
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,220
Everyone in the shop saw it.

190
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,140
He and I

191
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,260
are enemies.

192
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,180
Moreover,

193
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,180
he disrespected you.

194
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,580
I'd never get close to him.

195
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,260
Good.

196
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,620
Since you want
to contribute to the family,

197
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,260
I'll give you a chance.

198
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,380
The Nanjing government
is demanding money.

199
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,180
In three days,

200
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,900
I'll go to Nanjing
on behalf of our Chamber of Commerce.

201
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,340
As for the fundraising,

202
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,620
I'll leave it to you.

203
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,260
Father, how much do you

204
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,100
need me to raise?

205
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,180
Thirty thousand silver coins.

206
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,180
You have two days.

207
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,740
That should be enough.

208
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,140
Master,

209
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,380
thirty thousand is not a small amount.

210
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,020
If he fails to raise the money
in three days,

211
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,860
wouldn't it jeopardize
your business in Nanjing?

212
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,220
I heard from the shop staff

213
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,660
Gu Liancheng

214
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,380
seems to be very interested in Wanyue.

215
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,540
Maybe she could fetch a good price.

216
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,100
It's settled then.

217
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,220
If he can't raise the money
in three days,

218
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,700
sell this maid to make up

219
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,540
the amount.

220
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,260
I'll do my best

221
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,780
to raise the money.

222
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,340
The shop's daily income

223
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,540
is only 700 silver coins.

224
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,460
Given the current situation,

225
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,660
it's impossible to raise 30 thousand
in two days from the shop.

226
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,660
Young Master, if you don't mind,

227
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,020
I might have an idea.

228
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,460
What is it?

229
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,700
I think

230
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,380
I could borrow 30 thousand

231
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,460
from the governor.

232
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,260
I won't allow it.

233
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,340
I remember in the past,
the Chamber fundraised

234
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,980
by inviting famous actresses
to perform in the theater.

235
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,420
The money from ticket sales,

236
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,980
auctions

237
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,300
and donations

238
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,500
covered the amount needed.

239
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,220
Do you know who is
the most famous actress now?

240
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:55,860
It's

241
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:56,620
Red

242
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,260
Rose.

243
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,460
(Singer Red Rose)

244
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,340
But I heard she has a grudge

245
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,520
against the Zhang family.

246
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,940
Young Master Zhang, listen carefully.

247
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,540
I'd help anyone

248
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,790
but those from the Zhang family.

249
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:08,780
Miss Red Rose,

250
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,140
we can discuss

251
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,460
the concert later.

252
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,540
Today, I invited you here

253
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,320
because someone wants to see you.

254
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,900
Miss, let's go.

255
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,460
Stop wasting words with him.

256
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,260
Chen Feng.

257
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,060
Mu Lan.

258
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,140
It's been a long time.

259
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:47,940
Mu Lan,

260
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,660
I've missed you.

261
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,900
I've missed you too.

262
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,100
I miss

263
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,460
the days we shared.

264
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,140
(It turns out Madam Mu)

265
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,620
(is the well-known
White Rose in Shanghai.)

266
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,220
(Back in the day,
White Rose and Red Rose)

267
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,310
(were as close as sisters.)

268
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,100
(Later,)

269
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,180
(the owner sold White Rose
to the Zhang family)

270
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,500
(and Red Rose to Long Wu,
leader of the Green Gang.)

271
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,120
(The two girls have rarely)

272
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,460
(seen each other since.)

273
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,980
(Their fates were)

274
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,820
(forever changed.)

275
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,380
Mother,

276
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,220
with the money from auction, donation

277
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:43,960
and ticket sales,

278
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,580
they've collected 30 thousand.

279
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,100
Recently, Zhang Hanyi
has been stealing the spotlight,

280
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,540
overshadowing you everywhere.

281
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,060
Your father already resents you
because of your affair with Chunxiao.

282
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,860
If you let that brat continue to rise,

283
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,700
how will you survive?

284
00:13:59,220 --> 00:13:59,700
(No.)

285
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,020
Alright.

286
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,770
Let's go home.

287
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:01,745
(The money mustn't reach father.)

288
00:14:01,745 --> 00:14:02,327
