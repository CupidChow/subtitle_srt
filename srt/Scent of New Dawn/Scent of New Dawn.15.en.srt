(Wanxiang Department Store)

19
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,020
We're now offering a deal.

20
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,100
Take a look at this.

21
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,420
Take care.

22
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,340
Come back next time!

23
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,260
Hello, guest.

24
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:29,540
Get lost.

25
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,260
Get lost, now.

26
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,180
Get lost, hurry.

27
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,220
Get out!

28
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,020
What are you doing?

29
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,340
Take both of these crates.

30
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,540
No, you can't take them.

31
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,340
Why not?

32
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,500
We paid for them.

33
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,700
How can you take them?

34
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,820
We can't take them, huh?

35
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:40,740
Beat them.

36
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,740
Beat them to death.

37
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,300
Stop!

38
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,220
Stop!

39
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,420
Stop!

40
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,060
The Chamber of Commerce
asked us to take them back.

41
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,220
(Chamber of Commerce?)

42
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:55,860
Tell them to stop.

43
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,740
I'll personally return the goods.

44
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,580
I can tell them to stop,

45
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,940
but you must agree
to be my concubine first.

46
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:07,860
Great.

47
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,060
Did you see that?

48
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,420
In broad daylight,

49
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,820
the shop owner actually hit me.

50
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,380
You barged in
and tried to rob them first.

51
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,820
Now you're turning the tables?

52
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,110
Didn't you see them hitting me?

53
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,300
So what if they did?

54
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,940
Consider yourself lucky.

55
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,700
I could even shoot you.

56
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,340
Miss Gu.

57
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:23,820
Shoot me.

58
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,180
Right here, come on!

59
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,060
Shoot me!

60
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:26,980
Shoot me!

61
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,860
Shoot me right here!

62
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:28,660
Yanran,

63
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,940
they're here to cause trouble.

64
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,160
Don't fall for their trap.

65
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,300
You don't dare shoot?

66
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,480
You should've said so earlier.

67
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,340
Come on, brothers,

68
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,100
take the goods!

69
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:38,700
Hurry!

70
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:39,620
Hurry up!

71
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,390
You can't take them!

72
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:41,980
You!

73
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,900
What are you doing?

74
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,060
Let him go! Stop!

75
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:45,780
Let go!

76
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,020
Go away!

77
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:51,940
Go away!

78
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,700
Go away!

79
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,580
Did you see that?

80
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,700
The shop owner fired a gun in public!

81
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,860
She's trying to harm innocent civilians!

82
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,740
Make way!

83
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,060
Firing a gun in public is illegal.

84
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:19,820
Take her.

85
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

86
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,380
Do you know who I am?

87
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,940
My brother is Gu Liancheng!

88
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,380
If you take me, he won't let you off!

89
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:24,900
Wanyue.

90
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,180
He's the leader.

91
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,180
He's the one who beat us

92
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,080
and smashed our shop.

93
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,260
Take her too.

94
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,300
Yes.

95
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,100
And

96
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,380
clerks from Wanxiang,

97
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,100
Wanyue!

98
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,620
take them all!

99
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:34,940
Yes.

100
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:37,700
Wanyue!

101
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:42,900
Brothers.

102
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:43,660
Yes!

103
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:49,700
Follow me!

104
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:50,340
Yes!

105
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:56,980
Oh, Governor!

106
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,620
You dare touch my people?

107
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,940
Oh, Governor.

108
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,500
This is a misunderstanding.

109
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,260
I already

110
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,860
let them go.

111
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,300
Governor.

112
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,100
Arresting my sister

113
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,300
is already a capital offense.

114
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,340
Governor, don't shoot.

115
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,020
How would I dare

116
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,780
hurt Miss Gu,

117
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,740
your sister?

118
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,380
Ouch!

119
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:17,940
Speak!

120
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,860
Where is she?

121
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:19,820
She...

122
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:20,700
She...

123
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:21,460
Well...

124
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,220
Liancheng.

125
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:23,820
Governor.

126
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,580
Look,

127
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,260
isn't she right here?

128
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,420
Your superior came to fetch her.

129
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,660
How could I refuse?

130
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,060
My superior?

131
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,220
Brother Gu.

132
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,300
What superior?

133
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,260
That's too formal.

134
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:39,900
Mr. Feng?

135
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,180
Brother Gu.

136
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,500
It's been so long

137
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,260
since we parted in Nanjing.

138
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:56,900
Brother Gu,

139
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,700
I've been so worried about you.

140
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,340
I heard

141
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,860
you were recently ambushed.

142
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,460
How's your recovery?

143
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,700
Are you alright now?

144
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,380
Thanks for your concern, Mr. Feng.

145
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,020
I'm fine now.

146
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,580
An assassination is no small matter.

147
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:15,590
By the way,

148
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,820
have you found out who was behind it?

149
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:18,700
Not yet.

150
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,740
But with time,

151
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,100
we'll get it out of him.

152
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,100
That won't do.

153
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,880
These matters require
swift, precise action.

154
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,660
Dragging it out won't help.

155
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,900
How about this?

156
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:28,990
I'll help interrogate.

157
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,540
Mr. Feng,

158
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,300
why is my prisoner

159
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,460
in your hands?

160
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,820
It's a minor issue.

161
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,900
Who holds him doesn't matter,

162
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,700
as long as we get the truth.

163
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,700
No one is perfect.

164
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,260
If you confess honestly

165
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,300
about who sent you,

166
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,740
I'll ask the governor

167
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,740
to show mercy

168
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,660
and let you go.

169
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:15,860
Mr. Feng,

170
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,180
it was...

171
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,900
It was my own mistake.

172
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,700
No one sent me.

173
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,700
Good.

174
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,900
At least you take responsibility.

175
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:25,700
Alright,

176
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,260
apologize to the governor,

177
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,700
and if he's generous,

178
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:30,940
he'll spare you.

179
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,020
Thank you, Governor!

180
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:38,940
Thank you, Governor!

181
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,900
Thank you, Governor!

182
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,780
Thank you, Governor!

183
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:41,880
Thank you, Governor!

184
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,780
Thank you, Governor!

185
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,260
Thank...

186
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,820
A traitor who betrays his own superior

187
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,020
doesn't deserve to live.

188
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,860
You already knew who was behind it,

189
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,900
but you didn't want me to keep digging.

190
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,860
Nice move, Mr. Feng.

191
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,540
Silencing the witness

192
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,020
and cutting off my lead.

193
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,580
I killed the man

194
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,460
you wanted dead.

195
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,780
I protected the person

196
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,340
you wanted to protect.

197
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,540
You owe me one,

198
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,580
whether you like it or not.

199
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,100
Oh, right.

200
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,220
Brother Gu,

201
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,580
think carefully.

202
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,900
Don't waste

203
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,860
the prime seat I've saved for you.

204
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,620
Please.

205
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,740
This gentleman

206
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,100
(Sato, Japanese merchant)
is a friend from Japan.

207
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:53,980
Mr. Sato

208
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,340
is doing business in Jiang City

209
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,260
and will be

210
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,580
stationed here long-term.

211
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,980
Since fate brought us together,

212
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,740
let's keep in touch.

213
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,660
We're all brothers.

214
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:02,740
Here.

215
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,580
It seems

216
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,460
the governor doesn't
want to drink with me.

217
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,540
It's not that.

218
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,980
There just isn't enough wine.

219
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,060
All of this would be enough.

220
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,700
Apologies.

221
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,900
I'm late.

222
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,300
It's my fault.

223
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,620
I'll take a penalty drink.

224
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,100
I'll drink.

225
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:44,700
It's my fault.

226
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:45,780
I'll drink.

227
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,900
Drinking alone isn't enough.

228
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,220
Let me show some hospitality.

229
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:07,980
Here.

230
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,540
Mr. Zhang

231
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,900
is very sincere.

232
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:17,860
Master Zhang,

233
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,390
you really know how to do business.

234
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,220
Liancheng,

235
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,460
let's purchase this summer's
military mosquito coils

236
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,140
from Master Zhang.

237
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,100
I've approved it.

238
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:25,990
As for the payment,

239
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,140
you'll cover it first.

240
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,660
Come on, let's keep drinking.

241
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:30,580
Come.

242
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,300
Drink.

243
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:33,900
Drink.

244
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,140
Master Zhang, please.

245
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:50,940
(Liancheng,)

246
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,180
(the wind may uproot trees,)

247
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,700
(but it can't bend grass.)

248
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,460
Sometimes, a man must bow his head.

249
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,660
And if I refuse?

250
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,220
(A snake struck at its weak spot dies.)

251
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,220
(A dragon touched at
its scale is wounded.)

252
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,140
(Brother Gu,)

253
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,860
(you're not alone in this world.)

254
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,420
(Yanran, don't blame me.)

255
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,660
(I can't let you take the risk.)

256
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,860
Starting tomorrow,
watch Miss Gu carefully.

257
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,460
She can't leave the manor.

258
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,140
Yes.

259
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,380
Father,

260
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,820
I hear the Japanese
influence is growing.

261
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:27,860
I don't think

262
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,780
Gu Liancheng is a threat anymore.

263
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,340
Gu Liancheng?

264
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,780
He's just this.

265
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,780
(Bishop)

266
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,980
This game isn't over yet.

267
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:38,700
Father,

268
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,300
what's our next move?

269
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,300
(Pawn)
Move it.

270
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,560
At a crucial moment like this,

271
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,220
what can a mere pawn do?

272
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,180
Never be careless when you're ahead.

273
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,060
A pawn crossing the river

274
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,300
is still a threat.

275
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,820
(Cannon)

276
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,100
Sir,

277
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,020
I'm here to collect
the sandalwood powder.

278
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,060
We're not selling.

279
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:03,860
Sir,

280
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,300
don't go back on your word.

281
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,900
I have the order form right here.

282
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,020
I pay you,

283
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,100
and you sell me the goods.

284
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:10,860
Xiaohu,

285
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,460
right now in Jiang City,

286
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,180
you won't find any sandalwood powder.

287
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:15,660
Go back

288
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,620
and tell your master

289
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,260
to give up.

290
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:17,940
What?

291
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:18,900
Wait.

292
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,020
Sir,

293
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,860
you can't refuse to sell.

294
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,570
Without sandalwood powder
as an adhesive,

295
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,500
we can't make incense!

296
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,300
Sir,

297
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,500
I beg you,

298
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,700
please sell it to me.

299
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,580
If you sell,

300
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,780
I'll do anything to thank you.

301
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:30,860
I can't sell it.

302
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,340
Wait, sir.

303
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:31,780
Great.

304
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,420
Xiaohu.

305
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,620
Ergou.

306
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,220
You'll do anything?

307
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,460
You said so.

308
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,700
Xiaohu, help me!

309
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,180
Xiaotao?

310
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:42,660
- Xiaohu!
- Mother?

311
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,540
Mother!

312
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,300
You...

313
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,660
Xiaohu, you have two choices.

314
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,380
Either

315
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,700
we kill your mother right now.

316
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,220
Or

317
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,380
you strip your woman naked

318
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,420
for everyone to see.

319
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,100
I'll kill you!

320
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:56,740
Go ahead!

321
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,180
Kill me!

322
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:58,620
Xiaohu!

323
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,100
Come on!

324
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,300
Kill me!

325
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:00,900
Kill me!

326
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:01,700
Kill me!

327
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,620
Let go of me!

328
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,620
Let go of me!

329
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,600
Look at what you've done.

330
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,020
You're really ungrateful.

331
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:08,860
If it were me,

332
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,500
I'd just strip her right away.

333
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,660
So tomorrow,

334
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,860
I could find another woman.

335
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,500
Right?

336
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,400
That's right, brother.

337
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,660
Mother...

338
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,300
Oh?

339
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,900
So you don't want
to save your mother, huh?

340
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,020
That makes sense.

341
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,340
She's old and doesn't have much time left.

342
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,340
But this woman

343
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,700
can keep you company for a bit.

344
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:33,940
I didn't expect this.

345
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,220
Xiaohu,

346
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,900
turns out you're a devoted man.

347
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,340
Ergou,

348
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,450
I don't want the sandalwood powder.

349
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,100
I don't want it.

350
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:42,580
Hey,

351
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,540
how can you say that?

352
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,900
I already brought it to you.

353
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:46,860
Here, take it.

354
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,100
Here it is!

355
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,940
You think you can just ask for it

356
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,000
and then refuse it?

357
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,500
You think you can treat me like a dog?

358
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,660
Then I'll trade my life for it.

359
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,300
Xiaohu!

360
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,300
Ergou,

361
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,500
tell them to let me go.

362
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,460
I...

363
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,990
I'll take off my clothes.

364
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,220
No!

365
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,300
No, Xiaotao!

366
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,260
Ergou,

367
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,580
we're from the same place.

368
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,100
Please spare us, okay?

369
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,100
I beg you.

370
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:14,820
Beg me?

371
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,700
Begging me now?

372
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,020
Where were you before?

373
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:17,610
Where were you?

374
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,490
Where were you before?

375
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,580
Now you want to beg me?

376
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,100
Come here.

377
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:22,700
Ergou,

378
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,300
we're from the same place.

379
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,260
I beg you.

380
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,860
- Alright.
- Please spare us.

381
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,860
Let me be honest with you.

382
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,140
Since I first laid eyes on Xiaotao,

383
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,100
well,

384
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,300
I've been dying to know

385
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:37,980
what she looks like

386
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,340
underneath her clothes.

387
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,820
You beast!

388
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,620
Ergou, you beast!

389
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,220
- You beast!
- People like him

390
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,460
are just too much.

391
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,300
Ergou!

392
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,380
You beast!

393
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,020
Xiaotao.

394
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,700
Shameless.

395
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:52,160
Come here.

396
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:52,700
Shameless!

397
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,660
Get closer to me.

398
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,100
Xiaotao.

399
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,180
No!

400
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:02,940
Do it.

401
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:07,980
Folks,

402
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,380
since you're all here,

403
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,600
let's all have a look at this.

404
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,900
You beast, Ergou!

405
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,940
Xiaotao!

406
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,700
Red.

407
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:19,900
Bright red.

408
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,300
My lucky color.

409
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,260
Seeing red excites me.

410
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,220
Hurry up and strip!

411
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,700
Come on!

412
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,700
Let me help you.

413
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,300
No!

414
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,660
Ergou, let Xiaotao go!

415
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,660
I'll do whatever you want!

416
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,100
Good.

417
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,980
Now that's a real man.

418
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,820
Ah, enough.

419
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,020
Why did you do that to them?

420
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,060
Xiaohu,

421
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,660
I respect you.

422
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,580
You're a man of loyalty and love.

423
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,660
Don't worry.

424
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:55,900
I won't kill you.

425
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,340
I won't touch them either.

426
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,060
I'll even give you

427
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,420
one way out.

428
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:18,980
(Pawn)

429
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,420
(Cannon)

430
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,900
(As long as you burn down
the warehouse at Wanxiang,)

431
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,540
(I'll let these two women go.)

432
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,300
Mother,

433
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,180
Xiaotao,

434
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,900
I'm sorry.
