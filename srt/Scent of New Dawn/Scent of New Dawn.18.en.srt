Zhang Wencai?

24
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,500
Why is he here?

25
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,660
Why wasn't I invited

26
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,700
for such a big banquet?

27
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,660
He doesn't mean well.

28
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,500
Why is she on a leash?

29
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,860
This is outrageous.

30
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,700
It can't be anything good.

31
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:56,620
Wanyue.

Stop.

35
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,260
Please take a look.

Everyone is so happy today,

40
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,940

45
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,660

00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,820
do you like it?

52
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,780
Zhang Wencai,

53
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,260
are you still human?

54
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,820
How can you

55
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,180
harm your own woman for revenge?

56
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,740
Don't rush.

57
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,820
I came here today to be the good guy.

58
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,260
I'm giving you the chance to save her.

59
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,100
Just give me the formula
for the Mosquito Repellent,

60
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,060
and I'll give her to you.

61
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:38,980
Look,

62
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,100
I've already written the divorce letter.

63
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,820
No!

64
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,380
Wanyue, you can't give it to him.

65
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,100
Mm?

66
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,100
Wanyue,

67
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,180
if you still want to be the chairwoman,

68
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,620
you can't give him the formula.

69
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,740
Zhang Wencai,

70
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,020
times are different now.

71
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:56,980
I'll take her away

72
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,020
without your consent.

73
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,740
Good.

74
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,180
Let's see if you can take her.

75
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,500
Mu Lan.

76
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,220
No one can take her away.

77
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,540
That's too cruel.

78
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:16,980
Zhang Wencai,

79
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,500
stop it already.

80
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,700
You're above the law.

81
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,860
Do you think no one can see it?

82
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:22,780
Exactly.

83
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,900
It's my business to manage my woman.

84
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,300
It's none of your business.

85
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:27,860
Chairwoman Wanyue,

86
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,820
what do you think?

87
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,100
No!

88
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,100
I'll give you.

89
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:38,980
Really?

90
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,100
It's just a formula.

91
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,300
Here you go.

92
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,460
Isn't this just giving in?

93
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,460
You can't give it to him!

94
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,620
Ah, come on.

95
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,660
How can this be?

96
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,500
Wanyue.

97
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,740
She really gave it?

98
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,660
The business world of Jiang City
is about to change.

99
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,020
It's real, Master.

100
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,100
Come on.

101
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:44,900
Mu Lan.

102
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,220
(Divorce)

103
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,340
You're free now.

104
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,900
Even if I'm free,

105
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,060
where can I go?

106
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,140
Apart from the Zhang Manor,

107
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,580
where else would accept me?

108
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,580
Mu Lan, you can come
to Wanxiang Department Store.

109
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,300
We'll always welcome you.

110
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,420
Can Wanxiang Department Store

111
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,820
provide me with a life of luxury?

112
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,100
If I don't work,

113
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,380
can you support me?

114
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,380
I'm a weak person.

115
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,380
Your place isn't where I belong.

116
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,020
I can't accept

117
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,060
your kindness.

118
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,820
What's going on?

119
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,860
Why tear it?

120
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,980
What does this mean?

121
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:52,700
Madam Mu.

122
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,220
Didn't she just save her?

123
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,100
She doesn't want it.

124
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,860
She's truly degenerate.

125
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:00,940
She deserves it.

126
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,180
Mu Lan.

127
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,780
Master,

128
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,940
let's go home.

129
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,060
There's always something hateful

130
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:27,980
about a pitiful person.

131
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,620
She was treated so badly earlier.

132
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,500
She deserved it.

133
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,020
Silly woman, isn't it?

134
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,300
She went though such trouble.

135
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,660
What's wrong with her?

136
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,620
It's all because of her.

137
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,100
Yeah.

138
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,620
She's so cheap.

139
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,580
Heartless.

140
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,500
What a disgrace.

141
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:51,860
Exactly.

142
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,860
Maybe this is all part of their act.

143
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,100
Mu Lan,

144
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,260
you've finally realized

145
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,100
who your true master

146
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,580
really is.

147
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,500
Yes, Master.

148
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,340
I've been weak my whole life.

149
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,980
But this time,

150
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,100
I want to live for myself.

151
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:22,660
Madam Mu

152
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,220
has her own choice.

153
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,420
She's always wanted to leave,

154
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,060
but why is she suddenly regretting it?

155
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,300
Even if I'm free,

156
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,580
where can I go?

157
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,420
Mu Lan is in danger.

158
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,500
Wanyue.

159
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:43,660
Wanyue.

160
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,060
Mu Lan.

161
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:48,820
Mu Lan.

162
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,300
Mu Lan.

163
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,540
Wanyue.

164
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,140
Get up.

165
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,180
Mu Lan, hold on.

166
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,620
I'll take you to the hospital.

167
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,500
Wanyue,

168
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,660
I'm sorry.

169
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,500
I couldn't kill him.

170
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,380
Sorry.

171
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,580
Mu Lan, why are you so silly?

172
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,100
Why didn't you leave with me?

173
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,020
You helped me with so many things,

174
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,820
I also want...

175
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,180
I want to do something for you.

176
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,580
Don't cry.

177
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,740
I have one thing

178
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,820
I want to ask you to help me with.

179
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:29,900
Say it.

180
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,700
I can help you with anything.

181
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:32,860
Say it.

182
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,340
I want...

183
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,100
I want

184
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,700
to sing "Wuxi Scenery" for you again.

185
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,420
This way,

186
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,900
I'll have no regrets.

187
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,100
Mu Lan.

188
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,860
Mu Lan, listen to me.

189
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,700
You need to live.

190
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,420
You're already Mu Lan,

191
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,580
not Madam Mu.

192
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,140
You're my White Rose.

193
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,780
