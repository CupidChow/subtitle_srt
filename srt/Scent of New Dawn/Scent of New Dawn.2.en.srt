18
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,510
Young Master Hanyi.

19
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,820
It's you.

20
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,540
What did you see?

21
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,580
I saw your servant

22
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,580
beaten to death
by Young Master Qianli's men.

23
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,700
And you were humiliated

24
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,420
and thrown into the freezing pond.

25
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:11,740
And

26
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,740
I saw you drown

27
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,620
Young Master Qianli's man.

28
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,340
This alone is enough to have you killed.

29
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,100
Yes,

30
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,020
I saw things I shouldn't have.

31
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,180
Young Master,

32
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,780
you can silence me at any time.

33
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,180
Zhang Hanyi.

34
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,260
Where is my servant?

35
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,140
What servant?

36
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,140
I don't know.

37
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,740
The one called Wangcai.

38
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,140
Wangcai?

39
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,260
Young Master Qianli,

40
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,540
do you mean a guy

41
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,180
who's tall and sturdy
with a square face and thick lips?

42
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,140
You've seen him?

43
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:53,780
Where is he?

44
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,700
Young Master Qianli,

45
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,820
just now I passed by the back garden

46
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,500
and saw Wangcai

47
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,860
by the pond.

48
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,620
He...

49
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,460
What happened to him?

50
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:08,700
He...

51
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,900
he was fishing out a tea cup.

52
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,460
It must've been a very valuable one.

53
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,660
I saw his foot slip, and he hit his head
on the stone by the bank

54
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,020
and fell into the water, motionless.

55
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,300
I reported it to the housekeeper.

56
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,940
He's taken people to rescue him.

57
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,020
Such bad luck!

58
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:32,780
Let's go.

59
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,300
Who are you?

60
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,740
I'm Wanyue.

61
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,520
(Wanyue, maid of Zhang family)
From now on,

62
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,820
I'll be

63
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,900
your personal maid.

64
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,660
If you're here for money,

65
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,540
you've come to the wrong person.

66
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,380
I'm here for money,

67
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,020
but not entirely for money.

68
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,020
And I didn't come
to the wrong person.

69
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,180
The person I'm looking for is you,

70
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,900
Zhang Hanyi,

71
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,860
the son of Master Zhang's original wife.

72
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,900
Your clothes are a bit dirty.

73
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,740
Let me help you change.

74
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,260
Why are you

75
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:21,980
approaching me?

76
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,820
I want to work with you.

77
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,180
Work with me for what?

78
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,340
I want you to help me

79
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,140
bring down the Zhang family.

80
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,900
Do you even know what you're saying?

81
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,220
I do.

82
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,940
But why should I work with you?

83
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,580
These scars

84
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,460
are all thanks to Zhang Wencai.

85
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,420
And like you,

86
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,260
I'm also someone struggling in the dark.

87
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,140
(Sweetheart,)

88
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,420
(this is your birthday gift
from me and your father.)

89
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,100
(Do you like it?)

90
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,460
(I do!)

91
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:46,980
(But mother,)

92
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,420
(what's this?)

93
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,860
(This is called a piano.)

94
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,180
(It can play many beautiful songs.)

95
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,220
(That's wonderful!)

96
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,860
(Then I want to hear you
play the piano right now.)

97
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,740
(Alright.)

98
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:58,420
(Come.)

99
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,900
(Let me play for you now.)

100
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:01,740
(OK!)

101
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:14,980
Don't speak.

102
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,020
Someone's coming.

103
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:16,620
Hide quickly.

104
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,020
This room is forbidden territory.

105
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,620
No one is allowed here.

106
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,660
Madam Chunxiao?

107
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,380
My dear.

108
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,540
It's been only a few days,
but you couldn't wait?

109
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,060
Missed me, huh?

110
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,540
Stop joking.

111
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,220
I have serious business.

112
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,460
Alright.

113
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,180
Let's take care

114
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,500
of this 'serious business' now.

115
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,380
I haven't had my period.

116
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,740
That's big news.

117
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,580
I'll get you a doctor.

118
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,380
Maybe you caught a cold?

119
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,340
Idiot!

120
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,660
I'm pregnant.

121
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,340
That's great.

122
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,340
Now I'll have a little brother,

123
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,140
huh?

124
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,860
The child is yours.

125
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:32,780
I know.

126
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:33,860
If you don't tell,

127
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:34,980
and I don't tell,

128
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,740
who will know if the child is mine

129
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,140
or my father's?

130
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,500
After all, it belongs
to the Zhang family.

131
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,420
When the child is born,

132
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,180
it might even

133
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,700
look more like my father.

134
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:53,730
Someone's coming.

135
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,540
Hide quickly.

136
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,620
Hide in the wardrobe.

137
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,340
This wardrobe won't open.

138
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,260
There's no time.

139
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:06,940

00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,580
