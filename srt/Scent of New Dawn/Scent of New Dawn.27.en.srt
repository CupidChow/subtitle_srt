18
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,260
I want to see Sato.

19
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,060
Sato.

20
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:29,860
Sato.

21
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,540
Young Master Zhang.

22
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,540
You

23
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:48,780
are my final spice.

24
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,780
Young Master Zhang,

25
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,300
I've handed the incense to Mr. Sato.

26
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,260
Please go back and rest.

27
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,160
He'll come to see you.

28
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,220
This is

29
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,860
the true maiden incense.

30
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,620
What are you doing?

31
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,940
You're not Wanyue.

32
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:30,820
Where did you

33
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,060
get this hairpin?

34
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,980
I picked it up in the hallway just now.

35
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,580
(Then do as you said.)

36
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,420
I hope you'll survive.

37
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,740
As for what exactly
the maiden incense is,

38
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,580
I'll think it over again.

39
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:44,740
Wanyue.

40
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,300
Wanyue.

41
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,340
Wanyue.

42
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:02,940
Wanyue.

43
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:03,740
Wanyue.

44
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,020
Sato.

45
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,220
I want to see Wanyue.

46
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,100
Wanyue.

47
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,100
Wanyue.

48
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,180
Wanyue.

49
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,860
This medicine for treating
the eyes is effective,

50
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,380
but the dosage must
be strictly controlled.

51
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,400
If overdosed,

52
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,690
although it can restore vision,

53
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,100
it'll also be lethal.

54
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,620
If Sato is poisoned by One Thought,

55
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,100
his subordinates will
immediately know it's you.

56
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,980
You still won't escape.

57
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:54,780
So,

58
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,220
I didn't choose a lethal poison,

59
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,100
but a hallucinogenic one.

60
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,740
It can make people hallucinate,

61
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,860
like moths drawn to a flame,

62
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,700
seeking their own demise.

63
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:56,620
Jerk.

64
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:23,900
Wanyue.

65
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,020
Shijinosuke.

66
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,220
I miss you so much.

67
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,580
Father.

68
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,380
I was wrong, father.

69
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,060
Sweetheart.

70
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,700
My daughter.

71
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,180
Don't be afraid.

72
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:54,900
It's okay.

73
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,660
Who are you?

74
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,820
I'm here to help you.

75
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,060
Can you take me to the riverbank?

76
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,420
No.

77
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,260
You can't die.

78
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,020
But living is so painful.

79
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,820
If I die, I won't be beaten every day.

80
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,180
I won't have to starve anymore.

81
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,980
You must live on.

82
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,140
One day, you'll meet
a very important person.

83
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,100
You must wait until that day,

84
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,300
understood?

85
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,220
Live on.

86
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,700
Don't die.

87
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,100
Understood?

88
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:49,860
Come on.

89
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,940
Last time wasn't enough.

90
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,140
Let's fight again.

91
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:54,940
Brother Gu.

92
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,180
Hurry up.

93
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:56,980
Stop waiting.

94
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,420
Hurry!

95
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,520
Why are you standing there?

96
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,420
Stop spacing out.

97
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:05,580
Hey!

98
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,060
Brother Gu.

99
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,020
What are you doing?

100
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:08,900

102

Hey!

103
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,220
If you don't let go,

104
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,220
I'll throw you over!

105
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,420
Brother.

106
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:19,980
Zhang Hanyi!

107
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,020
Why are you hugging my brother?

108
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,660
Only I can hug my brother.

109
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,420
- Come on.
- If you want to hug,

110
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,500
