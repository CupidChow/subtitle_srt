74

Just now, Hanyi asked me
the same question.

75
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,660
Please, sit.

76
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,820
Today, you're all my honored guests.

77
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,340

Mr. Sato,

79
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,980
you know my relationship

80
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,260
with Zhang Wencai.

81
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,740
A blood feud

82
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,420
can't be reconciled.

83
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,300
Miss Wanyue,

84
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,820
after careful consideration,

85
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,020
I've decided to personally take

86
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,620
the position of chairman
of the Sino-Japanese Liaison Committee.

87
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,100
You two will serve

88
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,980
as my vice chairpersons.

89
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,580
Power will be equally divided.

90
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,220
You can watch over each other.

91
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,180
That isn't

92
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,300
what you promised me before.

93
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,700
If you disagree,

94
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,380
I can let Mr. Zhang take

95
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,700
the sole position of vice chairman.

96
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,060
Fine.

97
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:43,580
Each gets half.

98
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:44,900
I accept.

99
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,660
Hanyi,

100
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,420
I've done well

101
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,980
as a mediator, haven't I?

102
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,460
I already agreed
to make incense for you.

103
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,420
I'll keep my promise.

104
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,700
There's no need to go to
such lengths to mock me.

105
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,780
Hanyi, you're indeed a wise man.

106
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,180
But there's no need
to state everything so plainly.

107
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:05,740
Well then,

108
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,460
since we're reconciling,

109
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,740
the two of you

110
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,700
should shake hands.

111
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,380
Great.

112
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,100
Harmony above all.

113
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,100
Harmony above all.

114
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,100
That's unnecessary.

115
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,540
Miss Wanyue,

116
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,740
you just said you'd reconcile.

117
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,700
How can you reconcile
without a handshake?

118
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,180
Look at Mr. Zhang,

119
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,460
he's so sincere.

120
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:38,890
Give him some respect.

121
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,940
These hands

122
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,940
killed my parents.

123
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,940
If you want me to shake them,

124
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,540
you might as well chop them off.

125
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,780
We just said harmony above all,

126
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,680
and now you want to
cut off someone's hands.

127
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,100
If you continue like this,

128
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,020
I'll have to let Mr. Zhang

129
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,420
take the sole position of vice chairman.

130
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,340
Is that okay,

131
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,380
Mr. Zhang?

132
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:12,900
I'll serve

133
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,220
with utmost loyalty.

134
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,820
But if that happens,

135
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,860
won't you take revenge on Miss Wanyue?

136
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:20,980
I'll only

137
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,900
repay her well.

138
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,220
Miss Wanyue, listen.

139
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,540
A magnanimous person like Mr. Zhang

140
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,660
deserves to be in this position.

141
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:51,780
Sato,

142
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,500
this isn't what you promised me before.

143
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:03,740
Let go.

144
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,060
Let go.

145
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:11,940
Let go.

146
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,540
Let go!

147
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,540
I was just joking.

148
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,100
Hanyi.

149
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,580
Mr. Zhang,

150
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,380
you may leave now.

151
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,340
Yes.

152
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,060
Mr. Sato.

153
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,420
Call upon me

154
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,500
whenever you need.

155
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,940
Sometimes I truly envy you.

156
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,060
I wish I could love someone

157
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,620
as deeply as you love Miss Wanyue.

158
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,360
Of course, she also loves you as much.

159
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:55,940
Alright then.

160
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,300
Miss Wanyue,

161
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,780
allow me to escort you.

162
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,140
Hanyi really cares for you.

163
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,420
Miss Wanyue, you must have special charm

164
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,740
to captivate an incense master
so deeply.

165
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,420
Could it be that you have
a mesmerizing fragrance?

166
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,340
Nothing special.

167
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,700
Take care.

168
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,460
"Fragrance lingers on magpies.

169
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,860
Scent clings to hounds
as they tread through Lulong."

170
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,530
One Thought is already
70 percent complete.

171
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,660
The remaining 30 percent

172
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,020
requires the essence of a girl

173
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,900
to perfect it.

174
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,580
I've had my maid

175
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,620
read Legends of Incense to me.

176
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,380
Ninety percent comes from
Northern Song incense records.

177
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,390
The ancients compared
maidens to cardamom.

178
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,900
According to the records,

179
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,460
the so-called maiden incense
should be cardamom.

180
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,380
Even children know maidens
are likened to cardamom.

181
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,660
Do you think I don't?

182
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,100
I've never heard
of using human as material.

183
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,220
The art of incense
is the path of a gentleman,

184
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,220
not your so-called sorcery.

185
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,060
Then tell me,

186
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,860
how do we complete the final 30 percent?

187
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,500
But to achieve this final 30 percent,

188
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,060
perhaps

189
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,460
it requires a life in exchange.

190
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,060
Hanyi,

191
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,980
are you ready?

192
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,820
What do you mean

193
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,860
by a life in exchange?

194
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,520
"Incense warms silk curtains to mist.

195
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,450
Firelight fills the courtyard,
candles aglow."

196
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,300
To refine the final 30 percent,

197
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,460
the incense master and the material

198
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,860
must endure extreme heat.

199
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,300
So you need...

200
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,220
A steaming furnace.

201
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,060
(Cardamom's fragrance)

202
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,900
(transforms under high temperatures.)

203
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,380
(The incense master must evaluate
the changes in scent,)

204
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:29,980
(waiting for)

205
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,980
(the most perfect moment.)

206
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,220
(I'll stay here,)

207
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,850
(waiting for that moment.)

208
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,860
Then this place

209
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,940
will become more painful than hell.

210
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,340
What if you're steamed to death?

211
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:05,700
(If I die,)

212
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,020
(then I die.)

213
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,060
But I promise you,

214
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,540
before I die,

215
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,290
I'll complete it for you.

216
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:16,740
That's good.

217
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:17,660
However,

218
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,300
I have one condition.

219
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,940
Wanyue mustn't know.

220
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,390
You don't want to break her heart?

221
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,540
I admire you more and more, Hanyi.

222
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,660
Then do as you say.

223
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,780
I hope you survive.

224
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,180
I'll give you three more days.

225
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,740
Otherwise,

226
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,820
I'll use my method.

227
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,540
A fragrance that can captivate Hanyi

228
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,860
must be the most perfect maiden incense.

229
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,180
Go away!

230
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,060
Go away!

231
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:27,780
Go away!

232
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,500
Go away!

233
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,460
Go away!

234
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,460
Go away!
