at 50, one understands destiny.

20
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,700
I have come this far

21
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,500
by following the tide.

00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:19,580
Now,

the Empire of Japan

24
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,100
is thriving,

25
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,580
leading East Asia

26
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,660
in harmony and prosperity.

27
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,220
It's an unstoppable force.

28
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:28,860
I'm unworthy

29
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,980
yet honored by Mr. Sato's recognition,

30
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,660
serving as the chairman

31
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:37,460
of the Sino-Japanese Liaison Committee.

32
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,320
From now on,

33
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,860
I look forward to your support.

34
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:43,820
Cheers.

35
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,900
Thank you, Chairman Zhang.

36
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,100
Oh, Qiao.

37
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,980
You're a rare sight.

38
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:04,980
Governor Wang,

39
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,060
you're not from Jiang City,

40
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,700
so you wouldn't know Qiao's story.

41
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,540
Come, let me tell you.

42
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,180
Oh, a story?

43
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,140
This is the famous

44
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,660
Qiao of Jiang City.

45
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,500
Back then,

46
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,460
Qiao of Jiang City

47
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,980
was the top courtesan
of Qinhuai Pavilion.

48
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,180
Her first night

49
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,740
was sold for an exorbitant price.

50
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,780
Mr. Ma of Jiang City spent a fortune

51
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,980
to take Qiao home.

52
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,820
But who would've thought
he wasn't blessed to enjoy it?

53
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,260
The following year,
while heading south to smuggle salt,

54
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,420
he ran into bandits

55
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,340
and was killed.

56
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:43,740
From then on,

57
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,260
the Ma family

58
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,700
was held together

59
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,060
by Qiao alone.

60
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,100
Oh, quite the remarkable woman.

61
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,940
Ah, but you left out her true specialty.

62
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,540
Ah, right,

63
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,060
I almost forgot.

64
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,660
Back in Qinhuai Pavilion,

65
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,580
Qiao had a unique skill,

66
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,180
one that even money

67
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,860
couldn't always buy a glimpse of.

68
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,260
Oh my.

69
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,580
What kind of skill?

70
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,260
I was fortunate to witness it

71
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,100
once in Qinhuai Pavilion.

72
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,020
Well,

73
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,100
they say

74
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,460
this skill has a foreign name,

75
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,300
Dogman.

76
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,380
It's said to have been passed down

77
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,860
from the Western courts.

78
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:26,900
Dogman?

79
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,460
Yes.

80
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,100
Does it mean a dog man?

81
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,100
Ah, Governor Wang,
I heard you studied abroad.

82
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,100
You're knowledgeable.

83
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,780
Qiao,

84
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,300
grant me this favor

85
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,780
and show everyone

86
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,940
your skill for fun.

87
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,180
Come on.

88
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:45,940
Just for fun.

89
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,900
Bravo!

90
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,820
Bravo! Show us.

91
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,100
Show us.

92
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,900
Are you denying me this favor?

93
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:02,780
Forget it.

94
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,140
There will be plenty of chances.

95
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,460
Chairman Zhang,

96
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,620
let's drink.

97
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,140
Drink.

98
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,300
Go to Jiang City Private Primary School.

99
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,700
Bring me the child named Ma

100
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,100
from Class Three.

101
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:15,780
Yes.

102
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,100
Don't touch my son!

103
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,060
That depends on you.

104
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,500
Or do you want to perform
in front of your son?

105
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,060
Housekeeper.

106
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:31,660
Yes.

107
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,540
I'll do it.

108
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,900
Here's a bone for you.

109
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:58,420
Come.

110
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,220
Crawl.

111
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,340
Dogman.

112
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:09,940
Ah.

113
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:16,740
Bravo.

114
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,620
Applaud.

115
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:18,820
Applaud.

116
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,300
Wonderful.

117
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,580
Governor Wang, there's something better.

118
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:26,740
Crawl through.

119
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,620
Crawl through.

120
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,100
Crawl through.

121
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,140
Crawl through.

122
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,500
Dogman.

123
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,860
Hey.

124
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,260
Applaud.

125
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,660
Applaud.

126
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,140
That's not ordinary.

127
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,380
Qiao, get up.

128
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,220
If you keep kneeling,

129
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,860
I'll kill you.

130
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,860
Oh, it's Wanyue.

131
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,500
I've been looking for you.

132
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,580
Didn't expect you to come uninvited.

133
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,660
I wasn't invited
for Master Zhang's birthday,

134
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,540
so I had to come myself.

135
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,580
I even brought you a gift.

136
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,540
Ah.

137
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,260
Ah!

138
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,380
This is a coffin.

139
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,700
This is a coffin!

140
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,660
Outrageous!

141
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,420
You...

142
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,220
What are you doing?

143
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,140
Take her down!

144
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,700
Quick, throw her out!

145
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,420
Throw her out!

146
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,420
Chief Li,

147
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,020
an attack at my doorstep.

148
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,300
Will you intervene?

149
00:06:59,420 --> 00:06:59,860
Chief.

150
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,540
Chief Li.

151
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,500
You're the police chief.

152
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,820
Do you still want your job?

153
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,340
Arrest her!

154
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,660
Will you intervene, Chief Li?

155
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,140
Well,

156
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,700
I'm sorry, Master Zhang.

157
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:21,900
This matter

158
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,740
is beyond our jurisdiction.

159
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,780
What do you mean?

160
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,000
(Newly appointed Chairwoman
of the Sino-Japanese)

161
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,420
(Liaison Committee, Lin Wanyue)

162
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,620
Sato replaced you.

163
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,420
Rumors can't be trusted.

164
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,140
Chief Li,

165
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:40,900
tie her up!

166
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,060
Apologies, Master Zhang.

167
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,420
Urgent business at the station.

168
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,280
I must take my leave.

169
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:44,540
You...

170
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,780
Don't leave just yet.

171
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,820
You haven't finished the meal.

172
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:55,980
Miss Lin.

173
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,740
Very well.

174
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,180
Since you've come to your senses

175
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,580
and joined Mr. Sato,

176
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:01,860
then from now on,

177
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,180
we're friends.

178
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,260
This coffin is good.

179
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,660
It symbolizes promotion and wealth.

180
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,820
You're my guest.

181
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,380
Please come inside.

182
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,820
I'd also like to see

183
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,580
Master Zhang's special skill.

184
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,740
Special skill?

185
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,900
Not everyone

186
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,460
can perform such a skill.

187
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,100
Master Zhang is no ordinary person.

188
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:38,740
Fine.

189
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,060
Bark for me.

190
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,620
No,

191
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:03,820
that way.

192
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,580
Watch closely.

193
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,700
Don't let her kill Zhang Wencai.

194
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,580
(The show)

195
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,700
(is just beginning.)

196
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,820
Are you crazy?

197
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,140
Ouch.

198
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,060
Hanyi,

199
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,580
please.

200
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,340
I won't disturb you.

201
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,540
Young Master, do you still remember

202
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,820
the tune I taught you?

203
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,340
What if I do?

204
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:12,980
And what if

205
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,420
I don't?

206
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,820
Things have changed.

207
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,260
It doesn't matter anymore.

208
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,460
You can hate me.

209
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,540
I told you long ago.

210
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,780
The greatest goal of my life

211
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,780
is revenge.

212
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,140
This is medicine for your eyes.

213
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,220
I won't be by your side,

214
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,540
so you must control the dosage yourself.

215
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,540
I no longer wish to see this world.

216
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,060
Is that necessary?

217
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,340
I don't blame you.

218
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,660
Then let's just say

219
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,740
we were never meant to be.

220
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,090
If there is a next life...

221
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,180
Enough.

222
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,580
There won't be.

223
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,820
I only know that

224
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,020
in this life,

225
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,460
you loved me.

226
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:35,940
That's enough.

227
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,820
Take care, Young Master.

228
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,940
It's you.

229
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,020
It's this man

230
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,820
who personally killed your own son.

231
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:34,860
Hey!

232
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,460
Hey!

233
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,380
Open the door!

234
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:38,940
Open the door!

235
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,380
Open the door!

236
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,540
Open it!

237
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,020
Open it!

238
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:43,500
Open...

239
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,500
Stop it!

240
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,476
