(Mourning)

20
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,140
I've chanted the Diamond Sutra
for 18 years,

21
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,340
yet why haven't my sins

22
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,980
been cleansed?

23
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,860
Didn't I leave Zhang Hanyi alive?

24
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,820
Didn't I follow the will of heaven?

25
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,900
The Buddhist scriptures

26
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,700
speak of karma and retribution,

27
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,900
but those are my mistakes

28
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,300
and my sins.

29
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,420
Why isn't the punishment on me?

30
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,980
What does it have to do with my son?

31
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,140
I was deceived too.

32
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,700
Zhang Wencai tricked me

33
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,220
and took my money.

34
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,180
But I was already married him

35
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,140
and had his child.

36
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,540
What else could I do?

37
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,500
The world says

38
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,540
Buddha is compassionate.

39
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,460
Bodhisattva saves those in suffering.

40
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,540
It's all fake.

41
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,180
It's all fake.

42
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,820
Qianli!

43
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,460
My son!

44
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,100
Qianli!

45
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,700
Madam.

46

Madam!

47
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,660
Someone help!

48
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,100
Qianli,

49
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,780
don't blame me.

50
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,820
You were the Zhang family's last hope.

51
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,500
Only by sacrificing you

52
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,300
can this game be played to the end.

53
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:49,340

54
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,220
(Governor's Manor)

55
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,140
Make way!

56
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,710
Commissioner Chen,

57
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,180
we can't tolerate this.

58
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,460
Just say the word,

59
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,020
and I'll drive them out of Jiang City.

60
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,060
I have six words for you.

61
00:03:59,060 --> 00:03:59,980
Think carefully.

62
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,380
What six words?

63
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,300
Before resisting outsiders,
pacify the inside.

64
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,540
At a time like this,

65
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,820
that's just nonsense!

66
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:07,940
Hello?

67
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:09,820
Commissioner Chen?

68
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,180
Hello?

69
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,900
Coward!

70
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:16,900
Liancheng.

71
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,420
Yanran, I'm sorry.

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,360
I've been under a lot of pressure.

73
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,420
I didn't scare you, did I?

74
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,860
It's fine, Liancheng.

75
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,740
Whatever you do, I'll support you.

76
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,100
Yanran.

77
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:31,660
Liancheng,

78
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,820
New Year's is coming.

79
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,040
We should be happy.

80
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,740
I'm heading to the market
to buy some food.

81
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,740
Do you want anything?

82
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,180
Speak now,

83
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,460
or I won't bring you anything.

84
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,300
I don't need food.

85
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:44,900
Buy me some flowers.

86
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,020
Alright.

87
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,820
No more sulking.

88
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:49,740
Sure.

89
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,940
Zhang Wencai has colluded
with the Japanese.

90
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:58,900
Brother Gu,

91
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,500
what do you plan to do next?

92
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,990
The higher-ups don't want me to act,

93
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,820
but I won't just sit tight.

94
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,140
So war is inevitable?

95
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,020
Yes.

96
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,220
I'm a soldier.

97
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,380
I can't stand by
while the people suffer.

98
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,580
Wanyue and I have discussed it.

99
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,260
If war breaks out,

100
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,160
she'll use her position as chairwoman

101
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,900
to mobilize merchants for donations.

102
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,780
We can handle

103
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,020
supplies and logistics.

104
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,300
That's great.

105
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,500
With your support,

106
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,380
I feel more confident.

107
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:26,980
But

108
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,340
I have one request.

109
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,500
You want

110
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,500
to send Yanran away?

111
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,700
Only if she leaves Jiang City

112
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,420
can I fight without worries.

113
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,180
If I escort her,

114
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,260
it'd expose my whereabouts,

115
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,700
so I must ask for your help.

116
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,180
When do you plan to send her?

117
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:43,980
Tomorrow afternoon.

118
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,580
By what means?

119
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,260
Train.

120
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,460
Does Yanran know?

121
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,500
If she knew,

122
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,020
she wouldn't agree to leave alone.

123
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,420
Yanran is my sister.

124
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,100
If she stays, she'll be in danger.

125
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:56,860
Wanyue,

126
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,500
you wouldn't want to see
Yanran get hurt either, right?

127
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,020
I understand.

128
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,700
I promise you.

129
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,900
Tomorrow is the last chance.

130
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,900
Are you sure you want to stay

131
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,140
and not leave with Yanran?

132
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,100
Since we've agreed
to fight alongside you,

133
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,740
how could we retreat now?

134
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:21,860
Okay.

135
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,740
Miss, do you want to buy flowers?

136
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,380
Sure.

137
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,700
Where are your flowers?

138
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,220
Over there. I'll take you.

139
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:36,620
Okay.

140
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,300
Sure.

141
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,460
Take a look, fresh out of the oven.

142
00:06:57,163 --> 00:06:57,985
Over there.

143
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,420
So many?

144
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,500
It's all yours.

145
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,460
Miss, this is too many.

146
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,580
When I was your age,

147
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,540
I also sold flowers

148
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,100
with my brother.

149
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,300
Selling flowers isn't easy.

150
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,100
If you ever can't sell them,

151
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,780
come to the Governor's Manor.

152
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:34,820
I'll buy them all.

153
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,180
But,

154
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,620
Miss,

155
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,980
someone just gave me a lot of money

156
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,660
to bring you here.

157
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,820
What?

158
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,740
Zhang Wencai,

159
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,340
you beast!

160
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,620
What are you doing?

161
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,580
Let go of me!

162
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,620
What am I doing?

163
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,980
You're still so naive.

164
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,100
Even now,

165
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,460
you still don't know?

166
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,860
Let go of me!

167
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,260
My brother won't let you off!

168
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,620
Miss Gu,

169
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,580
it's time for you to grow up.

170
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,860
Just enjoy yourself.

171
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,020
Let go of me!

172
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,500
Let go!

173
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,460
Zhang Wencai!

174
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,580
(Qianli,)

175
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,900
(your death won't be in vain.)

176
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,260
Liancheng!

177
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,260
Help!

178
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,020
(Those who forced you to death,)

179
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,500
Liancheng!

180
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,060
(General)
(I won't let a single one of them go.)

181
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,780
Help!

182
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,260
Gu Liancheng,

183
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,340
soon you won't be
the Governor of Jiang City.

184
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,180
Help!

185
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,900
Miss Gu!

186
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,260
Miss Gu, wake up!

187
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,420
Someone!

188
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,340
Someone!

189
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:17,900
Brother Gu,

190
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,380
don't be reckless now.

191
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,420
The higher-ups have already
promised you a promotion.

192
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,660
They'll transfer you to Nanjing.

193
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,500
At this moment, you must hold back!

194
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,740
You must endure!

195
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,700
You must endure!

196
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,900
Endure!

197
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:31,900
Yanran.

198
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,860
Get a good night's sleep.

199

When you wake up,

200
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,460
I'll send you to France.

201
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,220
Liancheng,

202
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,140
I'm scared.

203
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,300
I'm scared.

204
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:19,940
I'm here with you.

205
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,500
Yanran, don't be afraid.

206
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:02,900
Yanran,

207
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,260
when you get to France,

208
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,660
remember to write me letters.

209
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,340
Liancheng,

210
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,580
will you come to France to see me?

211
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,300
Of course.

212
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,990
Once I've settled matters in Jiang City,

213
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,900
I'll come find you.

214
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,260
Okay.

215
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:44,900
Well,

216
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:45,860
Brother Gu,

217
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,580
I'm telling you.

218
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,100
this time you did the right thing.

219
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,590
You understand the bigger picture now.

220
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,900
I assure you,

221
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,860
when you get to Nanjing,

222
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,940
you'll rise step by step.

223
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,700
This is an order from above.

224
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,500
If you don't go,

225
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,660
that'd be treason.

226
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,140
Gu Liancheng,

227
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,260
how dare you shoot me!

228
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,620
The higher-ups won't forgive you!

229
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,100
I'll bear the consequences of today.

230
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,860
There's something I must do,

231
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,580
but I don't want to see
your blood spilled.

why did you hurt my sister?

241
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,300
Your sister was hurt by the Japanese,

242
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,180
