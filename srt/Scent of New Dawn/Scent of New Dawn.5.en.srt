Master.

Wencai.

20
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,220
Can you spare Qianli this time

21
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,100
for my family's sake,

22
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:27,580
huh?

23
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,180
Using your family to pressure me again?

24
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,620
I...I didn't mean that.

25
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,540
Twenty years ago,

26
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,620
I bowed to your family's influence.

27
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,700
But now,

28
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,140
my family is the most respected
in Jiang City.

29
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,180
Master.

30
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,420
Master.

31
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,460
Master,

32
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,220
he's your favorite son!

33
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,580
Master.

34
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,140
Father.

35
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,460
I...I know I've done wrong.

36
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,660
I acted foolishly.

37
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:50,460
Father,

38
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,620
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,140
From childhood to now,

40
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,860
I've spoiled you endlessly.

41
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,140
And yet, you committed
such shameful acts.

42
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,660
Drink this

43
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,300
and preserve our family's reputation.

44
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:19,580
Father.

45
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,140
Father.

46
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,420
We're father and son.

47
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,380
You've given me wealth and luxury,

48
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,700
and treated me with kindness.

49
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,100
I'm a useless son

50
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,700
who has broken moral taboos.

51
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,620
I'll repay your kindness

52
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,620
in another life.

53
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,140
This is the incense shop
managed by Madam Chunxiao.

54
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,380
It's yours to run now.

55
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,700
Thank you, father.

56
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,980
Don't forget to make the perfume
for the governor.

57
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,300
I understand.

58
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,220
Father.

59
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,460
The tea isn't poisoned.

60
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,340
You're my most cherished son.

61
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,340
How could I bear to let you die?

62
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,260
Father.

63
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,140
Father, you've forgiven me?

64
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,020
Remember,

65
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,780
you're the Zhang family's only hope.

66
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,700
Your brother can't compare to you.

67
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,540
Everything I have will one day be yours.

68
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,100
As long as you ask,

69
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,300
I'll give it to you,

70
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,340
even my concubines.

71
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:46,860
Father.

72
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,020
I...I acted foolishly.

73
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,340
I'll never deceive you again.

74
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,620
Never again.

75
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,540
She was just a woman.

76
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,580
In my eyes,

77
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,180
women are merely money.

78
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,780
But

79
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,860
what belongs to me,

80
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,740
even a needle

81
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,220
or a thread,

82
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,700
it's yours if I give it to you.

83
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,020
If I don't give it,

84
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,940
you must never steal

85
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,860
or snatch it.

86
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,460
Understood?

87
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,100
Yes, father.

88
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:17,660
I...

89
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,580
I know I've done wrong.

90
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,500
I...I'm sorry.

91
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,420
I'll never do it again.

92
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:20,820
Father.

93
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,780
Please believe me.

94
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,700
Alright.

95
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,820
Your mother is worried about you.

96
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,180
Go reassure her.

97
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:32,780
Father,

98
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,940
I'll go at once.

99
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:42,780
Master,

100
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,580
Young Master Hanyi has gone to the shop.

101
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,340
Keep a close eye on him.

102
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:49,740
Yes.

103
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,380
I'll prepare immediately.

104
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,220
(Zhang's Incense Shop)

105
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,100
Come again next time.

106
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:58,940
Hey,

107
00:05:59,100 --> 00:05:59,620
blind man,

108
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,540
what are you doing?

109
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,220
Hey,

110
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,300
over here.

111
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,660
Master has already instructed.

112
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,550
The shop will be managed
by Young Master Hanyi.

113
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,860
Watch your mouth.

114
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:14,340
You...

115
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:14,940
Happy now?

116
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,260
Let me make it clear.

117
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,100
In the Zhang family,

118
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,500
there's only Young Master Qianli.

119
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,060
What Young Master Hanyi?

120
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,100
Never heard of him.

121
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,140
Hey, blind man,

122
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,220
get out of here!

123
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,340
Go away.

124
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,020
Who are you?

125
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,550
A maid.

126
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,660
Young Master Qianli's maid?

127
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,740
Young Master Hanyi's maid.

128
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,500
Darn it.

129
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,890
You're Young Master Hanyi's maid...

130
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,420
Hey.

131
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:42,380
Ouch.

132
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:47,820
From today on,

133
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,020
I'm the owner of Zhang's Incense Shop.

134
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,220
You may not have heard of me,

135
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,900
but you must respect my maid.

136
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,580
She represents me entirely.

137
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,380
Am I clear enough now?

138
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,580
You just...

139
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,460
You just wait!

140
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,580
Everyone, go back to work.

141
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,100
Yes, Young Master.

142
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,420
Put it there.

143
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,660
I'm sorry, Young Master.

144
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,920
I shouldn't have
strayed too far from you.

145
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,340
Are you hurt?

146
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,580
I'm fine.

147
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,620
Can you check if there's

148
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,280
any fragrance powder on my shoes?

149
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,380
Fragrance powder?

150
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,260
None.

151
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,180
Young Master.

152
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:32,820
It's nothing.

153
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,860
You walk so quietly.

154
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,300
That way,

155
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:37,980
I can hear

156
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,020
where you are.

157
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,580
The environment outside Zhang Manor
is too unfamiliar to me.

158
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,140
I need you to stay by my side
at all times

159
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,380
to be my eyes.

160
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:47,940
I need to always

161
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:49,900
hear the sound of the silver bells.

162
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,860
Don't make me lose track of you again.

163
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:01,780
Then,

164
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,020
let me first show you around the shop.

165
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,100
First is the counter area.

166
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,620
All the products are displayed here

167
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,780
for customers to choose from.

168
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,820
This is our incense counter.

169
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,500
Incense is our shop's signature product.

170
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,820
Further inside is the experience room.

171
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:32,980
Be careful here.

172
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,620
There's a curtain.

173
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:38,740
Careful now.

174
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,820
There's a sofa here.

175
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,140
The sofas are

176
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,020
the latest Western designs.

177
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,540
Next,

178
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,580
can you smell the fragrance?

179
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,540
This is...

180
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,180
This is

181
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,060
the fragrance workshop.

182
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,420
Young Master.

183
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,700
This is your fragrance workshop.

184
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,960
Young Master,
call out if you need anything.

185
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,260
I'll step out now.

186
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:34,540
Get out.

187
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:35,900
Get out,

188
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:36,980
all of you.

189
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:37,500
Hurry.

190
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,660
(Zhang's Incense Shop)

191
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,290
Is Young Master Hanyi here?

192
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,860
I'm here for the perfume.

193
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,020
Young Master has prepared

194
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,300
your Ruoshui Perfume.

195
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,540
I'll fetch it right away.

196
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,060
Governor.

197
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,100
Governor.

198
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,060
We received a telegram.

199
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,380
Miss Gu's ship returned
to Shanghai ahead of schedule.

200
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,220
She's in Shanghai?

201
00:09:59,380 --> 00:09:59,780
Yes.

202
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,860
She's on her way back here.

203
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,580
She even asked in the telegram

204
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:03,820
about whether you're married.

205
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,100
I'll load the perfume.

206
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:05,820
(Oh no,)

207
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:06,950
(I forgot about this.)

208
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,420
Governor,

209
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,910
the perfume you ordered

210
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,900
has been handed to your guards.

211
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,540
(Liancheng,)

212
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,020
(you must find a wife)

213
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,180
(before I return.)

214
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,020
Young Master was checking the goods.

215
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,500
I apologize for the delay.

216
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,060
I'll go get him.

217
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:21,500
No need.

218
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,100
Bring the box inside.

219
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,260
This is...

220
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,260
I'm taking all your shop's stock.

221
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,660
Close up early today.

222
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,380
Come with me.

223
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,860
May I ask what you mean?

224
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,300
There's no need to be so tense.

225
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,340
I just want you to come back with me

226
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,940
to be my wife for one day.

227
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,900
Your wife?

228
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,500
We'll discuss it further later.

229
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,140
Let's go.

230
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,500
Governor...

231
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,940
Governor, you came.

232
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,900
An esteemed guest arrived,

233
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:00,980
but you didn't tell me?

234
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,380
Hurry and make tea.

235
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,820
Yes, Young Master.

236
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,740
Your presence graces my humble shop.

237
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,800
I should've welcomed you sooner.

238
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,220
No need for formalities.

239
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,100
I've taken a liking to your maid.

240
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,140
I'll borrow her for a day.

241
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,980
You may not know, Governor,

242
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,860
but Wanyue is my personal maid.

243
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,590
I rely on her due to my disability

244
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,900
and can't do without her.

245
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,500
Did I mishear, Zhang Hanyi?

246
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,860
Even your father wouldn't dare defy me.

247
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,340
Who do you think you are

248
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,460
to refuse me?

249
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:34,820
In Jiang City,

250
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,940
no one says no to me.

251
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,740
And no one can simply take her from me.

252
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,740
You protect this maid so fiercely.

253
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,700
Don't tell me you're fond of her.

254
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:46,740
Yes,

255
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,580
I care for her.

256
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,980
As long as you withdraw the request,

257
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,860
I'm willing to do anything.

258
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,140
I admire people with such loyalty.

259
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,180
Since you've said this much,

260
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,500
show me

261
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,780
how deep your feelings truly run.

262
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,780
How should I prove it?

263
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,820
I've heard the hearts
of devoted men weigh heavier.

264
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,380
Today, I'd like to see

265
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,740
if the rumors are true.

266
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,260
If you spare Wanyue,

267
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,860
I'll take my heart out right now.

268
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:22,820
Hmm.

269
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,540
I, Gu Liancheng,

270
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,460
will keep my word.

271
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:26,900
Do it.
