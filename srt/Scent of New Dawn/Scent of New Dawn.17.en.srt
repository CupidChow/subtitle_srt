=Episode 17=

18
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:11,380
Father,

19
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,900
Wanyue is from the Lin family.

20
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,060
Keeping her alive

21
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,300
will only bring disaster.

22
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,540
Why did you let her go?

23
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,060
If she must die,

24
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,180
let her die without a trace.

25
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,780
Eliminate the root,

26
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,500
and leave no evidence.

27
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,860
How could I make a move

28
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,300
in front of those four smart people?

29
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,060
They're on their way back now.

30
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,580
I've already arranged the driver.

31
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,700
He'll stop at the designated place.

32
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,540
Take the Green Gang members there.

33
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,660
Act quickly.

34
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,020
If she dares to go against me,

35
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,700
I'll let her die horribly.

36
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,100
Father.

37
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,380
Hurry.

38
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,220
Hurry.

39
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:29,740
Hello?

40
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,500
I'm Mu Lan, Wanyue's friend.

41
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,300
Get me the governor!

42
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,540
Hurry!

43
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:41,820
Why did we stop?

44
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,300
Hello?

45
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,740
Hello, Governor.

46
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,380
I...

47
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,460
Right now,

48
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,300
Mosquito Repellent

49
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,820
is already on sale.

50
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,020
Why did you get me here?

51
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,940
I want to discuss a collaboration.

52
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:41,900
Collaboration?

53
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,460
Didn't we already finalize our deal?

54
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,660
From the start,
my only target for collaboration

55
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,780
has been you.

56
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,060
But the other three

57
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,340
have all received favors
from your father.

58
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,900
Wouldn't working with them

59
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,100
be more secure?

60
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,700
Only foolish women

61
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,060
place their hopes on men

62
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,500
and sentimental ties.

63
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,900
Then why must it be me?

64
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,420
Don't tell me it's

65
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,180
because I'm a woman.

66
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,860
Maybe it's because

67
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,380
you're different.

68
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,190
You're a newcomer
to the Chamber of Commerce,

69
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,740
taking over your
late husband's position.

70
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,820
But they've been suppressing you.

71
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,700
If I were in your place,

72
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,780
I wouldn't accept that.

73
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,860
If you're willing to work with me,

74
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,380
I have a way for you

75
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,260
to devour

76
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,660
all three of them.

77
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,100
Or lose to all three?

78
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,620
That's also possible.

79
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,900
But

80
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,020
have you ever thought,

81
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,940
in this world,

82
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,300
in this era,

83
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,140
for us women to do business,

84
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,300
we must be better
at making money than men?

85
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,580
Only money

86
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,100
can give us security.

87
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,500
Once we succeed,

88
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,580
we'll have no enemies,

89
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,420
only friends.

90
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,060
Tell me more.

91
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:11,980
You guessed right.

92
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,820
None of those three
betrayed Zhang Wencai.

93
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,460
Luckily, you swapped in fake goods.

94
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,620
Now, all the Mosquito Repellent
in Jiang City is in your hands.

95
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:20,860
I told you,

96
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,500
working with us

97
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,620
is a guaranteed win.

98
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,060
Now, let's discuss

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,100
(Baoyuantang)
the next deal.

100
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:29,860
No problem.

101
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,820
But we have one condition.

102
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,340
After this stock,

103
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,020
all Mosquito Repellent

104
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:35,980
must use

105
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,700
Wanxiang's packaging.

106
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,890
(Reopening of Wanxiang Department Store)

107
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,270
Great sales for Mosquito Repellent!

108
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,780
Great sales for Mosquito Repellent!

109
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,760
Great sales for Mosquito Repellent!

110
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,210
Great sales for Mosquito Repellent!

111
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,590
Great sales for Mosquito Repellent!

112
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,300
Everyone, no need to panic.

113
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,740
Today,

114
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,460
I asked Qiao to gather you here

115
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,580
not to hold you accountable.

116
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,660
Well...

117
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,580
You don't resent us?

118
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,220
Resentment

119
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,780
is useless.

120
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,180
The world moves for profit.

121
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,260
Profit lasts

122
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,020
longer than emotions,

123
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,220
doesn't it?

124
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,900
So, are you still

125
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,900
willing to sell us Mosquito Repellent?

126
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,100
Business is meant to be shared.

127
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,250
Money is meant to be made together.

128
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,620
Isn't that the rule
of the Jiang City Chamber of Commerce?

129
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:30,900
Then tell us,

130
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,780
what do you want?

131
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,380
Wanxiang Department Store

132
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,820
wants to join the Chamber.

133
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,220
Join the Chamber?

134
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,260
Are you worthy?

135
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,140
The best-selling perfume this summer

136
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,980
is my Mosquito Repellent.

137
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,740
I've helped you all make money.

138
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,740
Now tell me,

139
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,860
am I worthy?

140
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,660
Young people

141
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,580
shouldn't be too greedy.

142
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,420
You only have one product.

143
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,940
Eighteen years ago,

144
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,860
didn't you also become the chairman

145
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,660
with just one product?

146
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,220
Besides,

147
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,500
the formula that helped you
become chairman

148
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,580
belonged to the Lin family.

149
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:33,900
Zhang Wencai,

150
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,940
you've taken what's ours

151
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,460
for long enough.

152
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,580
It's time to return it.

153
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,100
Everyone,

154
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,860
what do you say?

155
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:48,820
Nonsense!

156
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,420
This is outrageous!

157
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,380
Young Master,

158
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,500
we've applied the medicine for a while.

159
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,540
Today, I increased the dosage a bit

160
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,540
to test its effect.

161
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,860
How do you need me to cooperate?

162
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,020
Previously, you could only see
within one step's distance.

163
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,900
If you can see farther than before,

164
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,460
it means it's working.

165
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:32,780
Come,

166
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,140
open your eyes.

167
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,020
Can you see?

168
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:51,900
Not at all?

169
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,140
What about now?

170
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,020
What about now?

171
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,020
It's okay,

172
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,420
we'll take it step by step.

173
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,180
Can't even see

174
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:19,700
within one step?

175
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,220
I can see.

176
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,020
I could already see you

177
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,690
from where you first stood.

178
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:30,740
Really?

179
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,780
Then I'll walk farther to test it.

180
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:40,900
No matter

181
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,260
how far I can see,

182
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,020
I hope

183
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,700
you'll always stay within my reach.

184
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,380
Sorry,

185
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,670
the effect has worn off.

186
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,220
I can't see again.

187
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,580
It's okay.

188
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,900
If the effect wears off, it's okay.

189
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,660
Even if you can't see, it's okay.

190
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,300
Wanyue.

191
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,100
Why are you here?

192
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,620
