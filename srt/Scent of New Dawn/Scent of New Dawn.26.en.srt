18
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,740
Lead poisoning is not uncommon

19
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,860
among incense makers.

20
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,780
Making rouge and face powder
requires lead powder and mercury.

21
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,940
However, his severe condition

22
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,300
is likely related to high temperatures
and dehydration.

23
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,340
Is it serious?

24
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,700
With proper rest,

25
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,700
there may still be hope.

26
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,060
If he continues working
in high temperatures,

27
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,700
given his condition,

28
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,500
he won't have much time left.

29
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,300
Take the doctor out.

30
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,340
Hanyi,

31
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,580
you'd better not die so easily.

32
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,220
If you don't complete One Thought
before you die,

33
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,620
I'll kill Wanyue.

34
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,420
I'll complete it.

35
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,740
Hanyi,

36
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,900
your Wanyue has come to see you again.

37
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,220
Get some rest.

38
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,220
Why do you

39
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,580
look so pale?

40
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,340
I...

41
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,700
I'm fine.

42
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,620
Maybe I've just been too tired lately.

43
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,620
How about you?

44
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,340
Is everything going well?

45
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:00,780
Not yet.

46
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,500
Is it because I haven't
finished One Thought

47
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,420
so Sato

48
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,260
won't let you kill Zhang Wencai?

49
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,020
So that's how it is.

50
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,260
Don't worry.

51
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,140
I'll finish One Thought soon.

52
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,660
From now on,

53
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,120
don't come looking for me.

54
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,180
By the way,

55
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,300
happy birthday.

56
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,540
Don't let her know.

57
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,380
How's the maiden incense

58
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,020
coming along?

59
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,220
Ninety percent done.

60
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,420
Keep at it.

61
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,980
My patience is running out.

62
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:33,940
Master.

63
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,220
Master.

64
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,740
She's alone,

65
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,500
carrying this thing.

66
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,890
Are there others outside the manor?

67
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,340
We checked.

68
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,180
Only a driver and bodyguard

69
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,900
waiting in the car outside.

70
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,500
Surround it.

71
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,740
Quickly!

72
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:00,980
Master Zhang,

73
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,590
I've waited 18 years

74
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,260
for this day.

75
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,820
I don't know what you're plotting,

76
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,460
but rest assured,

77
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,300
I won't kill you.

78
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,180
Eighteen years ago, your biggest mistake

79
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,900
was not killing me.

80
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,220
Sato has ordered me

81
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,980
not to kill you.

82
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,140
But don't think

83
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,300
you'll walk out of here unscathed today.

84
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,300
Tell me,

85
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,300
why have you come to me?

86
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,100
Of course, to take your life.

87
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,180
Take my life?

88
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:29,700
Hmph.

89
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,620
If you really wanted to kill me,

90
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,090
you wouldn't have waited until today.

91
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,380
To put it plainly,

92
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,380
you and I are both Sato's dogs.

93
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,180
As dogs, we follow our master's will.

94
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,580
Don't think I don't know.

95
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,260
if I die,

96
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,180
you and Zhang Hanyi

97
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,500
won't survive either.

98
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,900
Do you really think

99
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,940
I'd betray the young master?

100
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,860
Selling you to Sato?

101
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,700
Sato is forcing me to make One Thought.

102
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,540
This is already set in stone.

103
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,740
I can't escape.

104
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,580
Rather than being caught by him,

105
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,900
it's better to go along with it.

106
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,060
Let's set a trap.

107
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,300
(Hello.)

108
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,850
(Is this the Japanese Chamber?)

109
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,300
(I want to speak with Sato.)

110
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,980
(Sato is already on his way
to intercept you.)

111
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,860
(Young Master,)

112
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,820
(we can't turn back now.)

113
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,460
(Wanyue,)

114
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,660
(trust me,)

115
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,100
(and trust yourself.)

116
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:24,940
Impossible.

117
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,620
You don't have the capability.

118
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,260
You didn't expect us

119
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,300
to deceive Sato right under his nose,
did you?

120
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:33,780
No.

121
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:34,980
Once you reach Sato,

122
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,420
you'll be under surveillance.

123
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,100
If something changes,

124
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,380
how will we communicate?

125
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,980
Remember Bach and Schumann?

126
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,620
(I once heard as a child,)

127
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,100
(the musician Bach)

128
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,380
(would hide his own name)

129
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,060
(in his compositions.)

130
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,780
(You mean)

131
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,100
(musical note cipher?)

132
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:54,620
(Exactly.)

133
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,300
(Each note corresponds to a letter.)

134
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,700
(If I deliberately play the wrong notes)

135
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,340
(in a piece,)

136
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,460
(these wrong notes)

137
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,460
(form a coded message.)

138
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,780
(Sato uses girls
as incense ingredients.)

139
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,940
(He may have his eye on you.)

140
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,060
(Avoid Sato's manor for now.)

141
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,740
(Be extremely careful.)

142
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,450
(This place is dangerous.
Don't come back.)

143
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,220
Don't kill me.

144
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,300
I can help you and Zhang Hanyi escape.

145
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,940
Sato won't find you.

146
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,580
Sato?

147
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,700
A dead man

148
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,860
can't threaten me.

149
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:28,900
Huh?

150
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,620
But if you fail to make One Thought,

151
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,100
and Sato tries to kill you?

152
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,100
Sato won't kill me so easily.

153
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,920
Instead, I might have a chance

154
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,660
to eliminate him.

155
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,900
Eliminate Sato?

156
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,740
How?

157
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,500
With poisoned incense.

158
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,860
You mean

159
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,540
poisoning One Thought?

160
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,260
Yes.

161
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,180
That's why you need...

162
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,020
A steam furnace.

163
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,940
(Cardamom's fragrance
transforms under high temperatures.)

164
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,820
(The incense master must evaluate
the changes in scent,)

165
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,540
(waiting for)

166
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,060
(the most perfect moment.)

167
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,700
(This is medicine for your eyes.)

168
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,990
(Smuggle the ingredients
for the poisoned incense)

169
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,140
(hidden within my eye medicine.)

170
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,260
(Once the time is right,)

171
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,260
(I'll mix it into One Thought.)

172
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,620
(But poison has a distinct smell.)

173
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:16,860
(If added to the incense,)

174
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,060
(Sato might notice.)

175
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,260
(Don't forget)

176
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,580
he's also a skilled incense maker

177
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:22,580
That's why

178
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,220
I need cardamom.

179
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,020
(When cardamom is heated,)

180
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,770
(it reaches a stage where its scent)

181
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,780
(resembles poison,)

182
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,500
(masking its true odor.)

183
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,140
What will it take for you to spare me?

184
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:42,820
Spare you?

185
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,540
Will that bring my parents back?

186
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,540
Killing me won't change anything.

187
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,260
The dead can't return.

188
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,020
For this day,

189
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,140
the young master and I
have endured so much.

190
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,220
For his "happy birthday",

191
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,900
I waited 18 years.

192
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,020
From now on,

193
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,500
don't come looking for me.

194
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,340
By the way,

195
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,100
happy birthday.

196
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,300
The signal phrase

197
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,740
will be "happy birthday."

198
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,140
When I say "happy birthday" to you,

199
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,340
it means

200
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,060
One Thought is almost complete,

201
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,260
and the plan begins.

202
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,620
The plan begins

203
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,900
to send you to your death.

204
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,060
The place is surrounded by my people.

205
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,820
Come with me

206
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,860
and you'll leave safely.

207
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,580
After you kill Zhang Wencai,

208
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,220
how will you escape?

209
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,100
Maybe

210
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,700
someone can help us.

211
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,020
Who?

212
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,300
One Thought is complete.

213
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,780
I want to see Sato.

214
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:36,740
Father,

215
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,460
mother,

216
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,420
Mu Lan,

217
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,860
did you all see this?

218
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,940
Young Master Zhang, good job.

219
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,060
Where is Sato?

220
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,060
Miss Wanyue,

221
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,460
I'll now take you to my place

222
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,300
to savor the incense.
