18
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,334
(Japanese Army Headquarters
in Jiang City)

19
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,260
Mr. Sato,

20
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,740
we had a deal.

21
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,740
I help you keep Zhang Hanyi here,

22
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,740
and you'll help me replace Zhang Wencai

23
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,380
as the chairwoman
of the Sino-Japanese Liaison Committee.

24
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,460
Miss Wanyue,

25
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,180
you're the most ruthless woman
I've ever met.

26
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,060
You can even betray the one you love.

27
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,580
To me,

28
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,820
everything has a price.

29
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,260
If the price is right, it can be sold,

30
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:41,940
even feelings.

31
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,260
You may appear ambitious on the surface,

32
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,900
but all of this is
for revenge, isn't it?

33
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,100
I know your past with Zhang Wencai,

34
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,740
so there's no need to deceive me.

35
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,380
That's right.

36
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,300
I know if I leave Jiang City,

37
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,500
I'll never bring Zhang Wencai down.

38
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,500
That's why

39
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,180
I called you.

40
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,540
Miss Wanyue,

41
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,020
I appreciate your honesty.

42
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,100
Go back and wait for news.

43
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,500
Since I've promised you,

44
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,540
I won't disappoint you.

45
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,100
Miss Wanyue.

46
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,220
You heard it all just now, right?

47
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,460
She ruthlessly betrayed you

48
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,980
and even spoke so righteously about it.

49
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,620
But don't be too upset.

50
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,620
I'll deal with her properly for you.

51
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,000
What are you going to do?

52
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,660
I'll teach her a lesson for you.

53
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,700
After all, I despise

54
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,100
betrayal the most.

55
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,140
Zhang Wencai?

56
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,420
Take her to my manor.

57
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,500
Sato,

58
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,500
let her go.

59
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,900
I don't need you to do that.

60
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:27,780
Hanyi,

61
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,780
why are you still so weak-willed?

62
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,300
A woman as heartless as her

63
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,500
should be eliminated.

64
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,380
Feels good?

65
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,860
Want some more?

66
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,340
Let her go.

67
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,140
Otherwise,

68
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,820
I'll never help you make incense.

69
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,260
She betrayed you so cruelly
and treated you like this,

70
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,700
yet you're still pleading for her?

71
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,540
Wake up, Hanyi.

72
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,100
A woman like her

73
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,100
isn't worth your sacrifice.

74
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,580
So what?

75
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:14,740
What do you know?

76
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,940
From the moment we met

77
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,260
eighteen years ago,

78
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,020
it's always been my own business.

79
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:20,900
I love her,

80
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,660
and it has nothing to do

81
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,900
with how she treats me.

82
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,460
It's so bright,

83
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,060
just like the day I first met her,

84
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,100
dazzling.

85
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,500
Hit him!

86
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,420
Hit him!

87
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,500
Why are you bullying me?

88
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,580
Back then,

89
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:51,900
What are you doing?

90
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,660
my father was
the Lin family's housekeeper.

91
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,220
Run!

92
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,060
It's Miss Lin!

93
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,380
He embezzled from the servants,

94
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,140
and many resented him.

95
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,260
I was implicated because of it.

96
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,820
I have pear candy.

97
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,700
Eat one,

98
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,100
and it won't hurt anymore.

99
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,740
That was the first time I tasted candy.

100
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,420
Only then did I realize

101
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,220
that life could be

102
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,820
this sweet.

103
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,460
After that,

104
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,060
I listened to her
play the piano every day,

105
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,700
watching her from afar,

106
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,460
like a person walking in the night

107
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,620
following the moon.

108
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,900
That was the happiest time of my life.

109
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,260
Until one day...

110
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,580
Miss!

111
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,100
A big fire burned down the Lin family.

112
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,900
I carried her out of the flames.

113
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,660
Ms. Xu took her away.

114
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,500
Miss!

115
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,780
At the time, I didn't know

116
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,180
this would be the last meeting

117
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,860
of the proud and radiant Miss Lin

118
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,500
and me.

119
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,620
When we met again,
everything had changed.

120
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,540
I had lost my sight.

121
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,590
The scent of pear blossoms.

122
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,420
She carried a deep grudge.

123
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,740
She said she'd help me claim everything
that belonged to me.

124
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,220
She was so smart,

125
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,340
yet she misjudged me.

126
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,020
If not for her,

127
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,460
I'd have scraped by.

128
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,140
How come?

129
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,900
But she came back.

130
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,860
From the moment I saw her again, I knew.

131
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,180
It'd been 18 years,

132
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,380
and she had finally returned.

133
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,380
I wanted to repay her kindness.

134
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,300
I also wanted to atone.

135
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,220
From that moment on,

136
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,380
I was prepared to be sacrificed by her.

137
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,020
I was willing to be
her final chess piece.

138
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,140
She could step on me
to exact her revenge.

139
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:00,860
Sato,

140
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,900
now you should understand

141
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,980
how much she means to me.

142
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,540
If you want me to help you make incense,

143
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,060
then don't touch her.

144
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,940
You need to fulfill

145
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,060
what you promised her.

146
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,100
Hanyi,

147
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,580
only someone as sincere as you

148
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,300
can create the finest incense.

149
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,100
Now, I'm even more convinced.

150
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,140
only you can recreate

151
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,380
"One Thought."

152
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,100
I promise you.

153
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:02,980
Miss Seiko.

154
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,620
Chairman Zhang,

155
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,780
stop torturing.

156
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,260
Sir Sato wants to see Wanyue.

157
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:14,820
Didn't he say

158
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,900
I could deal with her

159
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,220
however I pleased?

160
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,300
Sir Sato has his own reasons

161
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,580
for doing this.

162
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,340
Well...

163
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:26,660
Fine.

164
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,180
Letting her die so quickly would be too easy on her.

165
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,620
I'll leave her to you.

166
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,420
Also,

167
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,500
Miss Seiko,

168
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,700
please deliver
this invitation to Sir Sato.

169
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,390
Tomorrow, I'll be hosting
a banquet at my manor.

170
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,980
I hope Sir Sato will grace us
with his presence.

171
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,860
I've agreed to

172
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,590
(Letter of Appointment)
your request.

173
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,420
You'll replace Zhang Wencai
as chairwoman.

174
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,340
All of this

175
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,100
is for Hanyi's sake.

176
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,300
I want to see

177
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,940
Zhang Hanyi.

178
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,300
I want to see Zhang Hanyi.

179
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,660
It seems Hanyi doesn't
want to see you now.

180
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,620
Today,

181
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,820
I gave Wanyue authority.

182
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,900
You must keep an eye on her.

183
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,380
Don't let her push Zhang Wencai
to his death.

184
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,420
I need these two

185
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,020
to keep each other in check.

186
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:36,900
As for

187
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,220
how they'll fight,

188
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,380
or who wins and who loses,

189
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,500
