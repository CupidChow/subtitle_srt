18
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,100
The cash and inventory of the shop

together amount

20
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,700
to ten thousand silver coins.

21
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,260
Only ten thousand?

22
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,200
With such a small amount,

23
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,250
you dare to take on
a business worth 200 thousand?

24
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,090
This isn't even enough
to buy raw materials.

25
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,100
What I mean is,

26
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,780
this is far from 400 thousand.

27
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,140
Forget it.

28
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,860
I'll lend you the money.

29
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,580
Miss Gu, we appreciate your kindness.

30
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,180
Tomorrow,

31
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,700
I'll gather 400 thousand silver coins.

32
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,260
Rest assured.

33
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:46,620
Yes,

34
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,020
we can't use your money anymore.

35
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,980
You've already helped us enough.

00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,300
Liancheng,

38
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,380
lend it to me.

39
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,460
I promise I'll pay you back.

40
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,660
Four hundred thousand?

41
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,380
Even if I threw the coins
away one by one,

42
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,780
I wouldn't lend them to Zhang Hanyi.

43
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,660
What did Zhang Hanyi do to you?

44
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,620
Didn't he made Ruoshui for you?

45
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,100
Help me out, please.

46
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,180
Then beg me properly.

47
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:18,500
Liancheng,

48
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,940
you're the best brother in the world.

49
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,340
Please, I'm begging you.

50
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:22,900
Hey,

51
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,540
come here.

52
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,420
No way.

53
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,460
It feels good to be rich.

54
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,020
Gu Liancheng,

55
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,060
are you insane?

56
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,660
Fine, don't lend it to me.

57
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,580
Just wait and see.

58
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,380
I will.

59
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:51,420
Hey.

60
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,900
Are you running away from home?

61
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,620
Are you planning
to pawn these for money?

62
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,700
This is your favorite necklace
from France.

63
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,260
Wow.

64
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,940
You didn't even wear this jade one.

65
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,300
What a shame.

66
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,460
It's expensive, and quite valuable.

67
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,020
Anyway, they're your treasures.

68
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,380
I don't care.

69
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,300
None of your business.

70
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,140
Leaving now?

71
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,610
Do you know where the pawnshop is?

72
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,580
Need me to take you?

73
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,580
Get lost.

74
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,540
Miss,

75
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,100
where are you going so late alone?

76
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,380
That suitcase looks heavy.

77
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,980
Need a ride?

78
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,300
Not going the same way.

79
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,380
We're not the same.

80
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,100
What?

81
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,460
Going to the pawnshop?

82
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,660
I never run out of money.

83
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,690
We're indeed not the same.

84
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:47,740
Take care.

85
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,300
You're so heartless.

86
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,500
I gave you these as gifts for festivals,

87
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,140
and you're selling them?

88
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,180
Liancheng,

89
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,620
I knew you were the best.

90
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,100
Alright.

91
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,220
All these years,
I've raised such an ingrate.

92
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,540
Call me what you want.

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,300
The ingrate is going to work now.

94
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,500
Love you, Liancheng.

95
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,660
I'll get changed.

96
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,580
Take a look.

97
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,220
Be careful.

98
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,060
Don't trip.

99
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,460
Mr. Laurent Junior,

100
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,060
the formula was from my brother.

101
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,540
It was his formula

102
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,800
that caused rashes on your face.

103
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,620
It was his fault.

104
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,820
He instructed me to do it.

105
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,260
Look what you've done.

106
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,780
What has my face become now?

107
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,070
Take him away.

108
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:26,780
Stop!

109
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,900
Arresting someone just like that?

110
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,860
Is there no law anymore?

111
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,060
Miss Gu,

112
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,020
these one thousand bottles
are all toxic.

113
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,820
If I hadn't discovered it in time,

114
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,620
they'd be on the way to Nanjing by now.

115
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,340
The goods came from Zhang Qianli.

116
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,820
The money also went to Zhang Qianli.

117
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,060
The guilty party is clear.

118
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,460
What does it have to do with us?

119
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,900
Let's see who dares to accuse us.

120
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,100
But the formula was his.

121
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:49,680
That's right,

122
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,980
the formula was mine.

123
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:51,580
You see?

124
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,380
He admitted it.

125
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,580
The formula you had Xiaohu steal

126
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,980
was an incomplete one.

127
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,740
Although the scent was right,

128
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,990
the ingredients were different.

129
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,060
Because later,

130
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,260
I revised the formula.

131
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,940
And to snatch our business,

132
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,970
you stole the formula
and monopolized materials.

133
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,540
Now it's like

134
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,100
the pot calling the kettle black.

135
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,140
Did you hear that?

136
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,500
There's a saying in China,

137
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,700
"You're shooting yourself in the foot."

138
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,220
You went for wool and came back shorn.

139
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,500
You're the one who made a deal

140
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,780
with a scoundrel like Zhang Qianli.

141
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,460
You deserve the rashes on your face.

142
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,740
We're reasonable people.

143
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,490
The toxic perfume has nothing
to do with me,

144
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,700
but I'll take responsibility

145
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,900
for the breach of contract.

146
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,900
I've already prepared

147
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,490
four hundred thousand for the penalty.

148
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,300
Four hundred thousand?

149
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,660
Where did you get that much money?

150
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,420
Now

151
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,740
I'll give you a choice.

152
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,500
This bottle

153
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,340
is the real

154
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,580
Sophia perfume.

155
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,020
And this is

156
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,540
the 400 thousand penalty.

157
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,340
Do you want the money
or to work with us again?

158
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:55,580
The choice is yours.

159
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,880
Of course I'll take the perfume.

160
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,540
Offending the people in Nanjing

161
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,220
means

162
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,420
no one will survive.

163
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,860
You might as well test it first.

164
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,660
If you don't believe me,

165
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:16,620
take the money.

166
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,420
We'll settle this cleanly.

167
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,060
The scent is right.

168
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,900
But why does it have
a cooling sensation?

169
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,990
Your father asked me
to incorporate Chinese elements.

170
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,580
The so-called Chinese element

171
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,710
shouldn't just be reflected
in the scent.

172
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,580
Sophia perfume is classic

173
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,340
because its fragrance has been

174
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,620
perfected over time.

175
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,300
It's flawless,

176
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,940
with no room for error.

177
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,620
So I incorporated Chinese elements

178
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,780
into its effect.

179
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,660
What effect?

180
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,700
I added detoxifying properties.

181
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,140
If you don't believe me,

182
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,140
have a try.

183
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,380
In less than two days,

184
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,420
the rashes on your face will disappear.

185
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,460
In that case,

186
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,260
I'll trust you this once.

187
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,380
How much stock do you have?

188
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,620
If you agree to two conditions,

189
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,140
within three days,

190
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,700
I'll deliver one thousand bottles.

191
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,100
One thousand bottles?

192
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,900
Tell me.

193
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,980
What are your conditions?

194
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:25,900
First,

195
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,540
waive the penalty.

196
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,380
As long as you can deliver quickly,

197
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,300
I won't ask for the penalty.

198
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,700
What's the second condition?

199
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:34,420
Second,

200
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,940
because of the herbal ingredients

201
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,580
of this new Sophia perfume,

202
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,460
the costs also double.

203
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,820
The 200 thousand you promised us before

204
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:43,900
needs to be doubled.

205
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,500
That's crazy.

206
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,420
You're practically extorting me.

207
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,980
Mr. Laurent Junior, don't be anxious.

208
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,780
You're also a victim
of counterfeit goods.

209
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:54,740
Ultimately,

210
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,020
we all know

211
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,140
who's truly

212
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,620
at fault here.

213
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,820
A maid like you

214
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,900
has no right to speak.

215
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,660
So, I believe the 400 thousand

216
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,180
should be paid by Zhang Qianli.

217
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,500
What do you think?

218
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,220
Cut it out.

219
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,340
I won't pay a single cent.

220
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,140
Then let's see about that.

221
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,660
Chief,

222
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,620
Mr. Feng from Nanjing has called
to urge for the goods.

223
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,860
What should we do?

224
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,260
Mr. Feng?

225
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,740
Leave it to me.

226
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,220
Zhang Qianli,

227
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,180
for the sake of your father,

228
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,100
I'll give you some advice.

229
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,540
All the foreigners want is money.

230
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,500
Just give it to them.

231
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,420
Don't forget,

232
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,700
your position

233
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,620
was given to you by my father.

234
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,740
How dare you speak like that?

235
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:50,700
Take him away.

236
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,580
How dare you arrest me?

237
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,680
When my father comes back,

238
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,500
you'll regret it.

239
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,180
All I know is that

240
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,740
if Mr. Feng from Nanjing says the word,

241
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,580
your father

242
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,700
might not leave

243
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,140
Nanjing alive.

244
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,620
Take him away.

245
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,260
Wait.

246
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,500
We'll pay.

247
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,900
Release him.

248
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:16,660
Mother,

249
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,180
I've been tricked by them.

250
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,260
Stop talking.

251
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,820
I'll raise the money for you.

252
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,500
Go to the bank to prepare the money.

253
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,180
Yes.

254
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,580
You just wait.

255
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,740
Let's go, son.

256
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:44,940
Mr. Laurent Junior,

257
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,260
could you give us
those one thousand bottles

258
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,060
of toxic perfume?

259
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,540
They're all in my warehouse.

260
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,740
Take them

261
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,260
Thank you.

262
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:02,940
Let's go.

263
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:03,980
Okay.

264
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,420
Great, Young Master.

265
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,540
The business is back.

266
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,180
Cheers!

267
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:17,500
Cheers.

268
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,060
So you knew all along
Zhang Qianli's formula was fake.

269
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,420
That's why you weren't worried.

270
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,300
Actually,

271
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,420
it wasn't stolen.

272
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,020
We gave it to him willingly.

273
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,060
You did?

274
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:28,620
Yes.

275
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,180
Well,

276
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,100
would you mind

277
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,140
adding more utensils?

278
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,540
You dare to come here?

279
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:34,940
Hey.

280
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:35,540
Don't.

281
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,020
Wait.

282
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:36,580
Calm down.

283
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,620
Sit down.

284
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,380
Xiaohu has done great work this time.

285
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,620
Do as planned.

286
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:47,860
Yes, Young Master.

287
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,460
Well done.

288
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,140
Impressive.

289
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,980
You were a double agent all along?

290
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,140
Good work.

291
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,820
You acted so convincingly

292
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,860
you even fooled us.

293
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:58,900
This time,

294
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,340
we really have to thank Xiaohu.

295
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,900
No, I should thank you, Young Master.

296
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,860
If it weren't for you
saving me last time,

297
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,100
I wouldn't be here today.

298
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:06,940
You knew

299
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,100
Xiaohu was Zhang Qianli's spy,

300
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,580
why did you save him?

301
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,980
If I hadn't saved him,

302
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,100
his hand would've been sawed off.

303
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,020
Xiaohu isn't inherently bad.

304
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,380
He didn't deserve this.

305
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,100
Young Master,

306
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,580
thank you for saving me today.

307
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,660
Actually, I'm...

308
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,300
I'm...

309
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:22,820
I know.

310
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,140
I've always known.

311
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,120
Then why did you save me?

312
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:27,490
Saving someone doesn't require a reason.

313
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,100
Besides,

314
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,820
you were forced by Zhang Qianli.

315
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,700
Young Master,

316
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,180
if you still trust me,

317
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,860
let me stay by your side.

318
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,060
I'll do anything for you.

319
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,180
I owe you my life.

320
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:38,540
I'll give you a chance.

321
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:39,860
Stand up.

322
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,340
Now,

323
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,740
continue being a spy for Zhang Qianli.

324
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,340
Don't alarm him.

325
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,060
You'll be useful to us in the future.

326
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,860
But I don't understand.

327
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,940
Why did we involve

328
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,460
that scoundrel

329
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,220
Zhang Qianli?

330
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,980
Why did we make it so risky?

331
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:55,740
Yanran,

332
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,140
this business deal is huge.

333
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,340
Renting a factory

334
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,380
and buying materials

335
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,740
cost at least 80 thousand silver coins.

336
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,380
No matter what we do,

337
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,540
our shop wouldn't be enough.

338
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,100
So,

339
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,180
we thought of borrowing arrows
with thatched boats.

340
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,820
This perfume was made
per the formula I gave Zhang Qianli.

341
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,420
Using it

342
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,500
will cause rashes.

343
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,340
However,

344
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,260
just one drop of herbal essential oil

345
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,580
will instantly turn it into Sophia.

346
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,500
By then,

347
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,700
we'll take back
Zhang Qianli's toxic perfume

348
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,500
and add a drop to each one.

349
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,260
Oh, borrowing arrows with thatched boats.

350
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,020
We made Zhang Qianli
spend money and effort to do our work.

351
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,540
It feels so satisfying.

352
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,700
Wait,

353
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,540
didn't you have money?

354
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,140
I was going to ask,

355
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,100
where did you get

356
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,140
the 400 thousand penalty?

357
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:42,780
Xiaohu.

358
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:47,460
Here.

359
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,380
You're so bold.

360
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,820
You three schemed together,

361
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,260
without telling me and Xiaotao.

362
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,820
Don't you see us as part of the team?

363
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:58,990
You should be punished with drinks.

364
00:13:59,020 --> 00:13:59,340
Yes.

365
00:13:59,340 --> 00:13:59,700
Exactly.

366
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,580
All of you.

367
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,380
Drink.

368
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,140
We're sorry.

369
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,140
Actually,

370
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,740
we wanted to surprise you.

371
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,580
Now that we have the money,

372
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,500
we can

373
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,580
open a department store.

374
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,460
This deal was made possible
because of you.

375
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,420
So

376
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,340
Young Master and I
would like to invite you

377
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,300
to be our partner.

378
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,380
Really?

379
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,100
Really.

380
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,500
From now on,

381
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,260
you'll be our owner

382
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,900
Great.

383
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,780
Then I'm not mad anymore.

384
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:27,900
Thank you, Wanyue.

385
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,820
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

386
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,460
Thank you, Miss Gu.

387
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,020
Here,

388
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,540
cheers to all the owners!

389
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,100
Cheers!

390
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:36,900
- Here.
- Cheers!

391
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,940
(Zhang Manor)

392
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,500
Mother,

393
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,020
I think I'd better hide for a while.

394
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,980
Father will kill me when he returns.

395
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,420
This Zhang Hanyi

396
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,140
is openly going against us now.

397
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,740
Haven't you noticed?

398
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,740
Ever since that Wanyue arrived,

399
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,660
our family hasn't had peace.

400
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,300
Yes,

401
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,100
ever since she came,

402
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,220
Zhang Hanyi has changed completely.

403
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,220
It seems

404
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,020
Wanyue is the root of the problem.

405
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,500
They're relying on the Gu family's power

406
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,940
to be so arrogant.

407
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,100
Then let's stir up some discord.

408
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,700
I heard Gu Liancheng

409
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,820
wanted to buy Wanyue before.

410
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,300
