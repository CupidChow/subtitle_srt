00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,060
Mr. Sato.

19
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:23,820
Mr. Sato.

20
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,500
Oh, come on.

21
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,100
Sir.

22
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:29,900
Sir.

23
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:30,980
Whatever it is,

24
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:31,900
let's talk it over.

25
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:32,820
We're friends.

26
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,580
There's no need for violence.

27
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,780
You Chinese

28
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,540
killed us Japanese.

29
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,860
This is no small matter.

30
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,180
Mr. Feng,

31
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,420
do you understand?

32
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:43,740
Yes, I do.

33
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,100
Leave this matter

34
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,060
to me.

35
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,860
I'll ensure a satisfactory outcome.

36
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:48,700
How about that?

37
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,020
This is a serious matter.

38
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,070
I'll handle it personally.

39
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,420
Go find

40
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,460
the person.

41
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,500
Yes.

42
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,140
Sir.

43
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:57,940
This...

44
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,060
Who is it?

45
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,540
Don't you see I'm sleeping?

46
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,300
Qianli.

47
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,220
Qianli.

48
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,260
Father, mother.

49
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,700
Mr. Feng.

50
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,740
Mr. Sato,

51
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,220
why are you taking my son?

52
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,060
Your good son killed a member
of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce.

53
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,860
I didn't.

54
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,320
Why would I kill someone
from the Chamber?

55
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,260
I don't even know them.

56
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:31,980
Yes.

57
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,900
It must be a misunderstanding.

58
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,060
(Incident: Japanese merchant murdered)

59
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,460
It's him.

60
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,020
What else do you have to say?

61
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,180
Take him away.

62
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,100
Father, mother.

63
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:00,700
Help me!

64
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,140
Wait.

65
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,300
When did Jiang City's affairs
become the business of outsiders?

66
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,140
Gu Liancheng,

67
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,100
why are you here?

68
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,790
If I didn't come,

69
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,220
Jiang City would be sold by you.

70
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,300
What do you know?

71
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,940
I'm the one who saved Jiang City.

72
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,700
You knew his true identity all along,

73
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,580
but you let him bring troops here.

74
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,700
What Japanese Chamber?

75
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,060
It's a scam from the start.

76
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:23,660
Hey,

77
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,500
stop talking.

78
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,500
Sir Sato is here to investigate a case.

79
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:27,700
It's a private matter.

80
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,340
Let him take the man.

81
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,500
It'll settle it.

82
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,100
Let him take the man?

83
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:33,620
Yes.

84
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,540
Don't you know

85
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,540
what he wants to do?

86
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,580
You Chinese

87
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,220
killed us Japanese.

88
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,340
I can't even seek justice?

89
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,740
Jiang City has its own rules.

90
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,900
Even if Zhang Qianli deserves to die,
he should die in Jiang City.

91
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,410
It's none of you Japanese's business.

92
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,940
Then I'll let him die now.

93
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,660
No!

94
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,860
Put the gun down.

95
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,940
You put the gun down.

96
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,020
Put the gun down.

97
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,900
Gu Liancheng.

98
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,100
Put the gun down.

99
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,920
Ask him not to take the man,
I'll put it down.

100
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,580
Well,

101
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,060
Sir Sato,

102
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,100
how about this?

103
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,380
Let me take Zhang Qianli away.

104
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,460
I'll interrogate him.

105
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,020
Before there's any result,

106
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,380
all of your brothers
can stay in Jiang City.

107
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,420
I'll personally host you.

108
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,180
What do you think?

109
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:17,900
Impossible.

110
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,220
They're soldiers.

111
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,100
An army.

112
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,700
Letting them stay in Jiang City

113
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,450
is like inviting enemies into the house.

114
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,500
Mr. Feng,

115
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,020
there's a limit to how much
a traitor can do.

116
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,740
Shut up.

117
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,340
This is the decision from above.

118
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,260
It's a military order.

119
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,300
You have no say in it.

120
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,500
Mr. Feng,

121
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,700
just do as you said.

122
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,580
I hope you can give me
a satisfactory result.

123
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,860
Put the gun down.

124
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:46,580
Come on.

125
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,700
Put the gun down.

126
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,780
Let's go.

127
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,500
Someone.

128
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,300
Take him to the police station.

129
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:04,700
Qianli.

130
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:05,940
Father.

131
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,540
Qianli.

132
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:06,860
Father.

133
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,220
Help me, father.

134
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,660
Father.

135
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,300
Qianli.

136
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,460
Father.

137
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,340
Come with me.

138
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,660
I need to talk to you.

139
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,300
Is letting the Japanese into the city

140
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,560
really the decision from above?

141
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,500
If we don't fight now,

142
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,140
it'll become a Japanese stronghold.

143
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,020
My hometown, Fengtian,
was lost that way.

144
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,300
You want to fight.

145
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,460
You aren't afraid to die.

146
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,220
Ask the people here if they want that.

147
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,100
Gu Liancheng,

148
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,380
can't you consider the bigger picture?

149
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,740
I'll report

150
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,290
today's event to the higher-ups.

151
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,900
I won't let this slide.

152
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,140
Tolerance will only

153
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,860
lead to a repeat of Fengtian's tragedy.

154
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,180
Now the Japanese are
walking all over us.

155
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,020
No matter the cost,

156
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,420
we must retaliate.

157
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,700
Gu Liancheng,

158
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,500
it seems

159
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,660
you really don't understand

160
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,020
what it means to be a wise person
who recognizes the times.

161
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:02,780
How is it?

162
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,260
It's the ointment I had them
brought from France.

163
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:05,860
Isn't it good?

164
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,700
Thank you.

165
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,620
This time, the Zhang family
angered the Japanese.

166
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,700
They're finished.

167
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,580
From what you're saying,

168
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,300
the Japanese army
has already arrived in Jiang City?

169
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,380
Yes.

170
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,890
My brother reported to the higher-ups.

171
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,700
They told him to hold off.

172
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,540
It made him so angry

173
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,900
he couldn't sleep for days.

174
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,660
It seems the situation is
about to change again.

175
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,500
Life for the people of Jiang City

176
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,500
will be even harder.

177
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,580
If it's up to me,

178
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,500
we should just leave Jiang City.

179
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,900
But Jiang City is our home.

180
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,300
If we leave here,

181
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,020
where can we go?

182
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:45,700
It's fine.

183
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,540
We don't have to leave.

184
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,900
There'll be a way to live if we leave.

185
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,580
And a way to survive if we stay.

186
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,220
Wherever people are,

187
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,260
that's where home is.

188
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,460
Dear Bodhisattva,

189
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,300
please bless my son's safe return.

190
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,020
Bless my son to come back safely.

191
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,860
Dear Bodhisattva,

192
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,500
bless my son to return safely.

193
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,460
Dear Bodhisattva...

194
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:18,860
Master,

195
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,620
how's Qianli doing?

196
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:21,940
Huh?

197
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,420
What are you doing with the land deed,

198
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:24,860
huh?

199
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,180
Master.

200
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,060
Let go.

201
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,260
You have to promise me to help Qianli.

202
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,300
He is your own son, Master.

203
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,860
Ah, go away.

204
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,300
Master,

205
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,340
are you going to give up on Qianli?

206
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,620
Master, he's your own son.

207
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,940
Why do you think I want the land deed?

208
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,340
Am I running away?

209
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,060
Qianli is the hope of the Zhang family.

210
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,020
Master,

211
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,700
you must save our son.

212
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,220
Wanyue.

213
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,500
Qiao,

214
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,380
what are...

215
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,100
Open your hands.

216
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,300
What's wrong?

217
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,580
I heard you were discharged
from the hospital.

218
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,660
I need to brush off the bad luck on you.

219
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,700
Then good luck will start coming.

220
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,700
Bamboo has this effect?

221
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,100
I can't believe you're in business.

222
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,110
You don't even know this?

223
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,420
Above our heads, there are gods.

224
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,500
Ah, okay.

225
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,380
Hey,

226
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,940
where's Zhang Hanyi?

227
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,920
I'll be discharged today.

228
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,060
Zhang Hanyi went to pay.

229
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:29,660
Alright.

230
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,620
Just in time,

231
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,740
I have something to tell you.

232
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:32,700
Here.

233
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:35,980
Open it and have a look.

234
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:50,140
(Land Deed)

235
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,780
Zhang family's land deed?

236
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,300
Yes.

237
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,740
How did you get this?

238
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,020
Zhang Wencai sold the family property.

239
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:02,980
I bought it.

240
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,700
It's yours.

241
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,100
Hey,

242
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,340
take good care of it.

243
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,620
Don't let anyone snatch it away again.

244
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,900
Don't want it?

245
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,580
Give it to me then.

246
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,380
If I didn't know

247
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,380
Zhang Manor

248
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,220
is the old Lin Manor,

249
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,060
the place where you grew up,

250
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,900
I wouldn't have bought it for you.

251
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:33,900
Thank you.

252
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,700
Alright.

253
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,380
What are you crying for?

254
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,100
Do you really think I'm that selfless?

255
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,180
I'm doing this

256
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,900
because I want you

257
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,820
to repay me.

258
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,300
Alright,

259
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,740
that's for sure.

260
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,220
You just said

261
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,140
Zhang Wencai is selling
the family property?

262
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,220
Yes.

263
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,060
Why?

264
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,220
To raise money

265
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,540
to save his stupid son Zhang Qianli.

266
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:09,860
Father.

267
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:10,740
Father.

268
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:11,620
Qianli.

269
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,260
You finally came to save me.

270
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,220
I thought you didn't want me anymore.

271
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,780
How could I not want you?

272
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,460
You're my only hope.

273
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,260
Father.

274
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,220
Alright.

275
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,100
Come.

276
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:23,540
Come.

277
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:25,460
Come.

278
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,620
Zhang Wencai.

279
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,060
You

280
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,220
must keep your promise.

281
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,180
Let's go.

282
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:43,980
Open it.

283
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,060
Father.

284
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:52,980
Get in the car.

285
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:01,660
Qianli,

286
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,660
I've prepared everything.

287
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,900
Once we meet Sato,

288
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,860
hand him

289
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,820
this box of gold.

290
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,020
Apologize to him in person.

291
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,580
This matter

292
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,500
will be settled.

293
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,500
Father,

294
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,500
don't worry.

295
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,990
I'll make sure to perform well

296
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,300
and have Mr. Sato forgive me

297
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,380
and our Zhang family.

298
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,860
This box of gold

299
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,740
is all our wealth.

300
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,340
(Qianli,)

301
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,900
(you're the hope of the Zhang family.)

302
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,220
(Whether we can survive this crisis)

303
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,580
(rests on you.)

304
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,020
(Father,)

305
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,380
(don't worry.)

306
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,500
(I won't let you)

307
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,180
(or the Zhang family down.)

308
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,660
Mr. Sato,

309
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,460
I hope you can forgive the Zhang family.

310
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,980
This is a little something.

311
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:22,860
Qianli.

312
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,100
Sir Sato,

313
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,740
I, Zhang Wencai,

314
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,100
am absolutely loyal

315
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,350
to you and the Empire of Japan.

316
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,300
I'm willing to serve you.

317
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,580
You actually killed your own son

318
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,460
to prove your loyalty to me.

319
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,700
It was Qianli who made a big mistake

320
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,460
and made you unhappy.

321
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,020
He had to die.

322
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,900
This is his fate.

323
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,740
He deserved it.

324
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,100
There's an old saying

325
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,460
in China,

326
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,780
"Thunder strikes the dutiful,

327
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,420
wealth favors the ruthless."

328
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,420
Zhang Wencai,

329
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,020
you're a ruthless person.

330
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,220
