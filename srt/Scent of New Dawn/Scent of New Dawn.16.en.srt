Xiaotao.

Xiaotao.

20
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,300
Xiaotao.

21
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:16,700
Xiaotao.

22
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:17,940
Xiaotao.

23
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,300
Xiaotao, your hand.

24
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,500
Xiaotao, don't move.

25
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,100
Give it to me.

26
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:27,860
Don't save me.

27
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:28,190
Xiaotao.

28
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:28,900
Let me die.

29
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,860
Xiaotao, listen to me.

30
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,140
This is

31
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,780
from Xiaohu.

32
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,420
I beg you, open it and take a look.

33
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,140
Just open it first, okay?

34
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,700
This is what Xiaohu saved up.

35
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,260
(Land Title Deed)
It was Xiaohu's last wish.

36
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,740
He hoped you can carry his share

37
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,540
and live on.

38
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,140
Xiaohu.

39
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,020
We must work hard

40
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,340
diligently and earnestly.

41
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:10,670
(Once we save up enough money,)

42
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,580
(we'll buy a home of our own.)

43
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,420
(We'll never worry about
being homeless.)

44
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,220
(Xiaohu, what do you think?)

45
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,500
Alright.

46
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,820
I promise you.

47
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,550
In the future,

48
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,160
I'll make sure you live a good life.

49
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,780
(Land Title Deed)

50
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,740
Wanyue,

51
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,900
we're just ordinary people.

52
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,500
We just want to survive.

53
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,340
- It's alright.
- Why is it so hard?

54
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:35,980
It's okay.

55
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,380
Things will get better.

56
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,460
Let's take Xiaotao away first.

57
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,260
Alright.

58
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:44,980
Come on.

59
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:45,940
Get up.

60
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,460
Wait.

61
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,540
Someone's coming.

62
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,220
All this crying is so inauspicious.

63
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,620
Well,

64
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,940
Miss Wanyue, you're here.

65
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,260
Xiaotao,

66
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,180
in a moment,

67
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,780
just watch closely.

68
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,580
Mm.

69
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,180
It's time.

70
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,340
What...

71
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,580
What did you

72
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,340
just pour on me?

73
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,380
Syrup.

74
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,020
Sy...

75
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:57,780
Syrup?

76
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,820
It's so hot.

77
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,510
Want to taste it?

78
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,580
This is a misunderstanding.

79
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,650
Is this because of Xiaotao?

80
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,060
Xiaotao...

81
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,620
I'll marry her, isn't that enough?

82
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,220
Shut up!

83
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:08,980
Ah, no!

84
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,300
No!

85
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,180
No!

86
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:12,620
Xiao...

87
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,340
Xiaotao!

88
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,820
Tell her to stop!

89
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,100
Xiaohu is already dead.

90
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,500
Besides me, who else would want you?

91
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,420
Miss Wanyue.

92
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,140
Xiaotao,

93
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,900
you're the best.

94
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,620
I'll do it myself.

95
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,820
Young Master Zhang,

96
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,900
was Xiaojiu's service
satisfactory last night?

97
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,260
Sure.

98
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,380
Then the money...

99
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,660
Put it on the tab for now.

100
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,940
It's not like I won't pay.

101
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,340
You haven't paid for days now.

102
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,140
Murder!

103
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,900
Murder!

104
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:16,900
Ergou!

105
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,460
(A life for a life)

106
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,180
Xiaotao,

107
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,940
take the money for now.

108
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,220
Leave Jiang City for a while.

109
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,100
Stay out of trouble.

110
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,780
I can't take this, Wanyue.

111
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,700
I can't repay this favor.

112
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,700
You don't need to.

113
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,180
But I want you to remember

114
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,180
to never give up on yourself,

115
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,380
okay?

116
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,100
Alright, take care, Wanyue.

117
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:43,500
Let's go.

118
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:44,980
Wanyue,

119
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,100
what are you planning next?

120
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,180
The Governor's Manor has sent word.

121
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,700
The situation is unstable.

122
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,020
The governor is unable to help.

123
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,180
Now, if we want
to save Wanxiang Department Store,

124
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,580
We can only rely

125
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,500
on ourselves.

126
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,620
Young Master, do you remember

127
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,760
what the best-selling perfume

128
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,580
in Jiang City was 18 years ago?

129
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,050
Are you referring to Mosquito Repellent?

130
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:05,820
Exactly.

131
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,940
Because it was easy to carry,

132
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,660
It sold even better than mosquito coils.

133
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,460
If we can recreate Mosquito Repellent,

134
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,500
Wanxiang will come back to life.

135
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,060
But wasn't the formula for it

136
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,260
lost long ago?

137
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,060
What if I told you

138
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,580
I have the formula

139
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,500
for it in my hands?

140
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,340
Governor,

141
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,300
why exactly

142
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,340
did you summon us here?

143
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,380
I have a friend

144
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,500
who wants to meet you.

145
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,300
This is all I can do for you.

146
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:46,580
Thank you.

147
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,380
Many thanks.

148
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:47,980
Mm.

149
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,900
Everyone,

150
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,140
no need to be so on guard.

151
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:02,660
We're here

152
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,380
to make friends with you.

153
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,740
Make friends?

154
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:08,820
I'm sorry.

155
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,980
I'm not interested.

156
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,140
I'll take my leave first.

157
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,380
Goodbye, everyone.

158
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,740
Are you interested

159
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:15,720
in Mosquito Repellent,

160
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,340
everyone?

161
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,820
Mosquito Repellent?

162
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,580
You made it?

163
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,660
Don't joke around.

164
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,580
That formula

165
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,860
has been lost for 18 years.

166
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,060
You can check it for yourselves.

167
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,220
It really is the scent
of Mosquito Repellent.

168
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,340
So what if it is?

169
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,740
Business isn't just about quality.

170
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,500
It's also about

171
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,020
connections.

172
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,660
You don't understand.

173
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,540
Don't talk nonsense.

174
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,380
Connections

175
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,580
are determined by profits.

176
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,060
Think about it.

177
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,540
How much money

178
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,540
can Mosquito Repellent make for you?

179
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,740
(Back then, Zhang Wencai schemed
to seize the formula.)

180
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,900
(He even set fire to my home,
killing all my family.)

181
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,660
(But despite his efforts,)

182
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,420
(in the end, all he got
was merely our mosquito coil formula.)

183
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,000
For all these years,

184
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,780
Zhang Wencai has a monopoly
on mosquito coils

185
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,180
to control the Chamber of Commerce.

186
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,420
And our trump card

187
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,900
is Mosquito Repellent.

188
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,060
Only a more profitable product

189
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,340
can deliver a fatal blow

190
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,820
to Zhang Wencai.

191
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,380
If I sell it to you
at one silver coin per bottle,

192
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,290
and you sell it at double the price,

193
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,540
for every bottle sold,

194
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,300
you make one silver coin.

195
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,700
Sell a hundred bottles,

196
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,140
you earn a hundred.

197
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,860
Sell a thousand

198
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,540
you profit over a thousand.

199
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,340
Jiang City

200
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,380
has a population of over 200 thousand.

201
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,340
Of course,

202
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,660
we won't force you

203
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,420
to fall out with Master Zhang.

204
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,420
To show our sincerity,

205
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,620
the Mosquito Repellent we sell to you

206
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,140
won't have Wanxiang's label on it.

207
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:49,500
Everyone,

208
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,900
what do you think?

209
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,340
But the chairman
of the Chamber of Commerce

210
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,860
is Master Zhang.

211
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,660
What if

212
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,940
my last name is Lin?

213
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,380
Eighteen years ago,

214
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,180
the Lin family that made incense?

215
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:12,900
(Wanyue, maid of Zhang family)
Is there

216
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,740
(Lin Wanyue, of Lin family)
a second Lin family in Jiang City?

217
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,740
How arrogant of you?

218
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,220
She dares to claim
she's from the Lin family.

219
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,060
Oh wow.

220
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,780
From the Lin family?

221
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:26,580
I think

222
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,540
she's going to say

223
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,980
she's Lin Zhennan's daughter.

224
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,520
Back then, in that fire,

225
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,270
not a single member
of the Lin family survived.

226
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,420
I saw it with my own eyes.

227
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:35,780
I think

228
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,460
you're just using the Lin family

229
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,140
to make yourself look good.

230
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,700
The summer before
the Lin family's downfall,

231
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,420
a malaria outbreak occurred.

232
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,980
The market was sluggish.

233
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,020
Everyone here

234
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,780
was losing money.

235
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,380
The Lin family developed
the Mosquito Repellent

236
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,500
and gave it away for free

237
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,780
to help you all

238
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,060
through the crisis.

239
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,540
If I weren't from the Lin family,

240
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,980
how would I have the formula?

241
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,340
If I weren't Lin Zhennan's daughter,

242
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,300
how would I know

243
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,260
these events so clearly?

244
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,380
Well, there's...

245
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,780
there's no proof.

246
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,820
Even the servants

247
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,500
of the Lin family

248
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,020
would know these things, right?

249
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:16,860
Right, everyone?

250
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:17,860
Exactly.

251
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:19,740
Mr. Zheng,

252
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,940
I still remember back then

253
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,620
you lost everything.

254
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,860
And you lived

255
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,980
in our west guest room for a year.

256
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,140
To express your gratitude,

257
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,900
on my birthday,
you gifted me a longevity locket

258
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,180
engraved with my birth name,

259
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,660
Wangshu.

260
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:41,620
It's...

261
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,180
It's...

262
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,540
It's really you?

263
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,780
It's been 18 years.

264
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:46,700
Have you

265
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,940
only remembered the Zhang family

266
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,260
but forgotten

267
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,020
your benefactors?

268
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,460
I

269
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,420
am no ungrateful man.

270
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,540
You're Mr. Lin's daughter.

271
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,980
I'll support you.

272
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,340
Well,

273
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,300
everyone,

274
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,300
what do you think?

275
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,100
We all

276
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,540
will support you.

277
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,780
(Governor's Manor)

278
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,020
The Four Families have agreed
to purchase the Mosquito Repellent.

279
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,460
It'll officially go on sale tomorrow.

280
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,340
Wanxiang Department Store
will soon reopen.

281
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,540
That's great, Wanyue!

282
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,740
Would you be willing

283
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,180
to return to Wanxiang then?

284
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,620
Of course.

285
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,580
If my brother hadn't locked me up,

286
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,990
I'd have come looking for you already.

287
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,580
You didn't know,

288
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,700
I haven't been eating
or sleeping well these days.

289
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,900
It's great that you're fine.

290
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,580
Otherwise, I'd feel guilty for life.

291
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,260
What's troubling you so much,
Brother Gu?

292
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,580
Sorry, brother.

293
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,980
I haven't helped much recently.

294
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,580
You're joking.

295
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,280
You brought
the Four Families to us.

296
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,540
We're already very grateful.

297
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,780
That was nothing.

298
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,340
If I weren't dealing with some trouble,

299
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,280
I'd have taken care
of Zhang Wencai long ago.

300
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,500
Is the trouble you speak of

301
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,740
related to the Japanese?

302
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,900
Ugh, don't mention it.

303
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,540
Hanyi,

304
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,660
I have a favor to ask of you.

305
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,940
Please, go ahead.

306
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,220
If one day I can
no longer protect her,

307
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,580
can you take Yanran out of Jiang City?

308
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,580
I will,

309
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,940
but I hope that day never comes.

310
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,180
Hey,

311
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,980
I already said "if".

312
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,240
By the way,

313
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,340
don't tell Yanran

314
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,460
I want to send her away.

315
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,540
Brother Gu,

316
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,860
you haven't told her
about your situation yet?

317
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,590
Once the moment is missed,

318
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,140
some things

319
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,260
can never be said again.

320
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,220
Once you hesitate,

321
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,660
some matters

322
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,660
can never be undone.

323
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,340
This is the best choice for now.

324
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,460
Alright,

325
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,380
I promise you.

326
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:10,780
Thank you, brother.

327
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,420
I said I owed you my life.

328
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,500
Yet in the end,

329
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,740
I still need your help.

330
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,260
Bad news.

331
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,900
None of the four department stores
sold Mosquito Repellent.

332
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,500
I heard

333
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,340
all our stock

334
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,500
was sent to the Zhang Manor.

335
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,980
Is all the stock here?

336
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,820
Don't worry, Master Zhang.

337
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,420
Everything is here.

338
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,580
All four stores

339
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,900
didn't keep a single bottle.

340
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,180
I missed

341
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,180
this scent.

342
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,660
It's a shame.

343
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,540
This Mosquito Repellent

344
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,300
will never bear the Zhang name.

345
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,700
Well.

346
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,780
You traitors!

347
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,300
Heartless ingrates!

348
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,700
Do you have no conscience?

349
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,620
Conscience?

350
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,060
That I can keep

351
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,540
and sell for a good price, huh?

352
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,500
Wanyue.

353
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,140
Wanxiang Department Store

354
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:37,660
