1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,560
to hear about所以

2
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,120
eyes is my

3
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,400
oh

4
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:46,400
yeah

5
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,920
oh

6
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,720
oh

7
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,720
Korea is a country of alcohol.

8
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,720
You can buy alcohol 24 hours a day,

9
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,720
and you can drink alcohol anywhere.

10
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,720
Then who is this alcohol addict?

11
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:19,720
You might think he's a drunkard who can't even take care of himself,

12
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:25,720
but he's not.

13
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:53,720
There are many people who go to good jobs that others don't like and are recognized as the best with their best efforts.

14
00:01:53,720 --> 00:02:00,720
The core of alcohol addiction diagnosis is not social order or work ability.

15
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:18,720
If you lose the ability to control your own alcohol, you may already be an alcohol addict.

16
00:02:53,720 --> 00:03:20,720
When did you come?

17
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,720
What?

18
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,720
Why aren't you answering your phone?

19
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,720
Do you know how many times I called you yesterday?

20
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,720
I didn't know.

21
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:37,720
I was drinking with Miyeon.

22
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:43,720
Geumju.

23
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,720
Do you like alcohol that much?

24
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,720
Let me ask you one thing.

25
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,720
Is it alcohol or me?

26
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,720
Alcohol.

27
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,720
What?

28
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:07,720
I like alcohol more than you.

29
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:23,720
So let's pretend we didn't get married.

30
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,720
Hey, Ji-hyo.

31
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,720
No, I'm doing this again.

32
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,720
Mr. Kim, it's not lunch time yet, right?

33
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:41,720
I have to make some rice cakes for the employees.

34
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,720
What?

35
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:49,720
What do you mean?

36
00:04:49,720 --> 00:05:01,720
What?

37
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:11,720
What?

38
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:21,720
What?

39
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,720
No, no, what's this?

40
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,720
Geumju.

41
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,720
Geumju.

42
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:38,720
Where did you go with this?

43
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,720
Geumju.

44
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:51,720
Aren't you going to get up right now?

45
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,720
Mom.

46
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,720
What kind of day is it?

47
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,720
I can't contact you.

48
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,720
You said you wanted to go to the newlywed house.

49
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,720
You said you wanted to choose a refrigerator washing machine.

50
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,720
I told you a few times that I was coming today.

51
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,720
Hey, what kind of day is this?

52
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,720
I heard everything from Juyeop.

53
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,720
You said you liked alcohol more.

54
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,720
You said you didn't want to get married.

55
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,720
You're a bad guy.

56
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,720
You're going to go to the high school and work.

57
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,720
Oh, my God.

58
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,720
Oh, my God.

59
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,720
Hey, are you out of your mind?

60
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,720
You can drink when you're in a social life.

61
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,720
How can you marry a guy who doesn't understand that much?

62
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,720
What do you mean?

63
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,720
When we were dating, you said you liked alcohol.

64
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,720
But when I got the date, it changed.

65
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,720
I nagged a lot every day.

66
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,720
How can I live with a guy like that for the rest of my life?

67
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,720
I'll never live with him.

68
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,720
Is marriage a joke?

69
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,720
Go and apologize to him right now.

70
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,720
Go and beg him to stop drinking.

71
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,720
Oh, come on.

72
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,720
Why would I?

73
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,720
I'm not a drunk because of him.

74
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,720
Do you think I'm a woman who drinks because of a guy?

75
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,720
Oh, my God.

76
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,720
I think I'm going to fall asleep.

77
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,720
Oh, my God.

78
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,720
Oh, my God.

79
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,720
Are you okay?

80
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,720
Huh?

81
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,720
Are you okay?

82
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:17,720
Are you okay now?

83
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:27,720
Oh, my God.

84
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,720
Mr. Kim, I'll beg you to stop drinking.

85
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,720
Please give me some clothes.

86
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,720
You're old.

87
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,720
You don't answer.

88
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,720
You don't answer my calls.

89
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,720
Oh, my God.

90
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,720
Oh, my God.

91
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,720
Oh, my God.

92
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,720
Oh, my God.

93
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,720
Oh, my God.

94
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,720
You're here, Mr. Kim.

95
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,720
Oh, that's a good service.

96
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,720
What are you doing at home?

97
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,720
You haven't eaten anything all day.

98
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,720
I ordered my mom's favorite Neungi Baeksook.

99
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,720
You're gonna eat Neungi Baeksook?

100
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,720
Do you feel bad about your Neungi?

101
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,720
Stop it now.

102
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,720
Stop what?

103
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,720
You don't even answer my phone.

104
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,720
What are you gonna do?

105
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,720
Oh, really.

106
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,720
I told you not to call me.

107
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,720
I'm not getting married.

108
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,720
If you don't do it, it's over.

109
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,720
Marriage is not a pension reservation.

110
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,720
Do you know that you can cancel if you change your mind?

111
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,720
I can cancel a pension for a day if I change my mind.

112
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,720
It's a marriage to live together forever.

113
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,720
If you don't like it, you have to cancel it.

114
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,720
What are you good at?

115
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,720
I'm going to focus on work now.

116
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,720
Focus on work?

117
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,720
You said you were raised for 10 years.

118
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,720
What are you focusing on?

119
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,720
I applied for a job.

120
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,720
Hey, the company just called.

121
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,720
I'm sorry.

122
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,720
It just happened.

123
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,720
I don't know why a 15-year-old is so special.

124
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,720
When I get married, I have a hard time getting married.

125
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,720
That's why I wanted to break up.

126
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,720
I'll treat you to dinner sometime.

127
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,720
Okay?

128
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
Do I have to do that?

129
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,720
Then should I broadcast that my daughter is better at drinking and getting married?

130
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,720
Aren't you embarrassed?

131
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,720
Why should I be embarrassed?

132
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,720
Shut up.

133
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,720
I broke up this marriage.

134
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,720
So you should be careful.

135
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,720
So why did you drag me down here while I was trying to be careful?

136
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
Why?

137
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,720
Why?

138
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,720
Hey, the company just called.

139
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,720
Engineer Han Geumju.

140
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:40,720
According to the staff who will replace you during the 10-year long-term vacation, you will be unpaid.

141
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,720
Unpaid?

142
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,720
Oh, my.

143
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,720
You're getting married and unpaid.

144
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,720
You said the office is closed this month.

145
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,720
You said you've already given out the house that's been taken out of the deposit.

146
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,720
Just leave the girl who's gone to the wrong place.

147
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,720
Why do I have nowhere to go?

148
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,720
I can just stay in a place like a orphan until I leave the house.

149
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,720
Shut up.

150
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,720
Stop drinking and go up there with a new person.

151
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,720
I don't want to stop drinking.

152
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,720
Oh, then you should break up with your mom.

153
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,720
Let's break up with your parents and children.

154
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,720
What are you doing?

155
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,720
Aren't you going?

156
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:44,720
Okay.

157
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,720
Wow, I don't have to come anymore.

158
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,720
Really?

159
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:14,720
I'm all better?

160
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,720
No, not at all.

161
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,720
You didn't come out at all.

162
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,720
You got worse.

163
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,720
But why didn't you come out?

164
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,720
What's the point of coming here and getting treated for such a hard thing?

165
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,720
The patient doesn't take medicine, and the doctor only takes care of me.

166
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,720
I don't treat patients who don't listen.

167
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,720
I'm sorry.

168
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,720
I forgot.

169
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,720
I'm so busy.

170
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,720
What?

171
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,720
Did you work because I told you to rest at home?

172
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,720
Wow, this is too much.

173
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,720
Nurse Su.

174
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,720
Yes.

175
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,720
I'm not coming here anymore.

176
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,720
Please take care of yourself.

177
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,720
Why did you do that?

178
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,720
Why?

179
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,720
I'm so busy.

180
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,720
It's the summer vacation season these days, so everyone is busy.

181
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,720
How can I be the only one who's missing?

182
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,720
I wonder who would do it for me.

183
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,720
Doctor.

184
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,720
Me?

185
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,720
No way.

186
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,720
Our teacher is here.

187
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,720
Oh, yeah.

188
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,720
You said you'd work for me last time, and today you're going to be a good grandma.

189
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,720
You're so nice.

190
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,720
It's not easy to help others like this.

191
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,720
I'm not helping others, I'm helping myself.

192
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,720
What are you talking about?

193
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,720
No, the sick people get sicker when they work.

194
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,720
Then I'll sing, and then I have to go all the way to this place.

195
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,720
I don't want to suffer, so I'm helping myself.

196
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,720
Okay, okay.

197
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,720
Okay, so let's take a break.

198
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,720
I'm getting nervous.

199
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,720
Let's listen to a song from our doctor.

200
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,720
Sounds good.

201
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,720
I love it.

202
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,720
It's so hard to work, but what about singing?

203
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,720
Try it.

204
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,720
Sing, sing, sing.

205
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,720
I'm not going to do it.

206
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,720
Sing, sing, sing.

207
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,720
I'm walking on your side.

208
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,720
If you get tired of walking.

209
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,720
All right?

210
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,720
No, it's not like that.

211
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,720
I'll just sing.

212
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,720
Now, now, focus on work.

213
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,720
We have to get everything out of there today.

214
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,720
Let's hurry up.

215
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:47,720
Oh, my God.

216
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,720
Good job.

217
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,720
Come again.

218
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,720
I'm worried about Mr. Kim Jung-ja's rheumatic arthritis.

219
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,720
I'd like to change some medicine because Park Mal-soon's gastritis is gone.

220
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,720
Oh, Mr. Lee Jung-rae's osteoporosis is a little suspicious.

221
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,720
Stop.

222
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,720
You just finished work.

223
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,720
Take a breath.

224
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,720
Here, drink some water.

225
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,720
Breathe out.

226
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,720
Good job.

227
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,720
Thanks to you, I got a gift for something so precious.

228
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,720
That's nice.

229
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,720
How can you be so good at farming?

230
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,720
I helped you a lot when I lived with my grandmother.

231
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
Oh, right.

232
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,720
You said Bo-cheon is your grandmother's hometown, right?

233
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,720
Yes.

234
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,720
It's really pretty here.

235
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,720
It's healing just to look at it.

236
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,720
I'm so happy.

237
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:55,720
Right?

238
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,720
Come on.

239
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,720
Hurry up.

240
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:13,720
I'm on my way.

241
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:21,720
Cheers.

242
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,720
Who is this?

243
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,720
Isn't she the youngest daughter of our family?

244
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,720
Dad, it's been a while.

245
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,720
What's going on?

246
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,720
You said you were preparing for the wedding.

247
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,720
I know.

248
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,720
I didn't even call you on purpose not to care about it.

249
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
What are you doing?

250
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,720
It's a big day.

251
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,720
As soon as the guests left, I cleaned it up and started working.

252
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,720
I'm just going to have a drink before the twins get married.

253
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,720
It looks like the wind is blowing.

254
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,720
Oh, my youngest daughter's light is amazing.

255
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,720
It's a plum wine from last year.

256
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,720
It's amazing.

257
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,720
Welcome to the wedding.

258
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,720
Come on.

259
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:16,720
You're saying something like welcome.

260
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,720
It's all because of you.

261
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,720
It's all because of you.

262
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,720
When everyone else is eating black bean noodles,

263
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:30,720
You two started drinking and learning how to be good.

264
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,720
That's all?

265
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,720
It's basic to stay up all night.

266
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,720
Learn it now.

267
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,720
The most important thing in social life is drinking.

268
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,720
I even learned how to be a good girl.

269
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,720
That's why I became a patient of alcohol.

270
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,720
What are you talking about?

271
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,720
I got divorced because of alcohol.

272
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,720
What?

273
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,720
You got divorced because you drank a lot?

274
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,720
You're not supposed to die of ice.

275
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,720
I didn't get divorced. I got divorced.

276
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,720
I don't want to nag you because you drink a lot.

277
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,720
Your daughter got married because she didn't want to.

278
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,720
What?

279
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,720
Everyone, remember.

280
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,720
There's no alcohol in this house from now on.

281
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,720
I'm going to kill you.

282
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,720
If you're going to drink, you have to kill yourself.

283
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:37,720
I'm going to cut your life off.

284
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:43,720
Honey, I heard that you're drinking.

285
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,720
Get out.

286
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:51,720
Shall we?

287
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,720
I knew he would.

288
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,720
I didn't like him since he first said hello.

289
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,720
Why?

290
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,720
I took a little bit of alcohol and I was drunk.

291
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,720
I was in the living room.

292
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,720
Actually, I recognized it then.

293
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,720
It's hard to be a member of my family.

294
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,720
I know.

295
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,720
Oh, I'm going to die of alcohol.

296
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,720
I'm going to die, too.

297
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,720
I'm going.

298
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,720
Is your mom okay?

299
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,720
It's okay. You know your mom's personality.

300
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,720
You have to buy it right away because it's so hot.

301
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,720
Don't do that. It's okay.

302
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,720
I'm sorry.

303
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,720
Don't say that.

304
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,720
Yeah, I'm a social worker.

305
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,720
How can I live with a guy who nagging me to drink?

306
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,720
I did a hundred times better than I did.

307
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,720
You know how I feel.

308
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,720
Of course.

309
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,720
Hey, it's a marriage that breaks even if we like each other and die.

310
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,720
Look at me.

311
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,720
I'm a hundred times better than a divorcee.

312
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,720
What?

313
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,720
Divorce is not a flaw in the world these days.

314
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,720
So.

315
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,720
Divorce is not a flaw, but what's a divorcee?

316
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,720
It's completely the same.

317
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,720
Who's going to be a divorcee in the world these days?

318
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,720
Right?

319
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,720
That's right.

320
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,720
Oh, sister.

321
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,720
Huh?

322
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,720
Divorce?

323
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,720
Why all of a sudden?

324
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,720
Yeah.

325
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,720
I don't know how much my mother-in-law's seat is full.

326
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,720
What are you going to do?

327
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,720
I'm going to take it in my mouth.

328
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,720
It's obvious to get married after marriage, but how can I get married?

329
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,720
That's why I woke up.

330
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,720
You did a good job.

331
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,720
What kind of daughter is Geumju?

332
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,720
And who in the world is a married woman these days?

333
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,720
You did a good job.

334
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,720
What are you going to do?

335
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,720
I'm going to take it in my mouth.

336
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,720
I thought I'd be bullied if I was in Seoul.

337
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,720
You must have been on vacation.

338
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,720
I told you to come down.

339
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,720
Wow, how can you get married?

340
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,720
Brother, what's wrong?

341
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,720
Why, why, why?

342
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,720
Tell me.

343
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,720
Why are you doing this?

344
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,720
Do your best.

345
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,720
What do you mean, what do you mean?

346
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,720
Like me.

347
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,720
I can't stand it.

348
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,720
Why?

349
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,720
Why are you angry with me?

350
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:12,720
Wow, I think there's a different reason why you got married.

351
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,720
No, no, I'm not angry.

352
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,720
Oh, my God.

353
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,720
Did you take a picture of the heroine today?

354
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,720
Can I give it to you tomorrow?

355
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,720
You!

356
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,720
Do you know how many times?

357
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:37,720
Brother, if you're okay with it, why are you so sharp today?

358
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,720
What do I do?

359
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,720
What sharpness?

360
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,720
Do you know how many times?

361
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,720
I don't know either.

362
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,720
Let's not count that.

363
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,720
What do you want me to say?

364
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,720
Give it to me tomorrow.

365
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,720
Tomorrow.

366
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,720
Thank you, brother.

367
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,720
Yeah.

368
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,720
I should go now.

369
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,720
See you tomorrow.

370
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,720
Tomorrow.

371
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,720
All of a sudden.

372
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,720
Let's go.

373
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,720
No.

374
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,720
Oh, apron.

375
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,720
Help me.

376
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:19,720
Our...

377
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:29,720
What kind of video is this?

378
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:59,720
You've got all the stars.

379
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,720
Aunt!

380
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,720
Aunt!

381
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,720
Aunt!

382
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,720
Aunt!

383
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,720
Aunt!

384
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,720
Aunt!

385
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,720
Oh, yes, wait a minute.

386
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,720
How have you been?

387
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,720
How many minutes have passed?

388
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,720
Didn't you miss me?

389
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,720
I missed you.

390
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,720
I missed you a lot.

391
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,720
I missed you a lot.

392
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,720
I missed you, too.

393
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,720
Aunt, let's go outside and play.

394
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,720
I want to taste the spicy seafood noodles.

395
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,720
Shall we?

396
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,720
Okay, let's go.

397
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,720
Aunt!

398
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,720
No, no.

399
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,720
My pants are here.

400
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,720
Mom.

401
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,720
When did you grow up so much?

402
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,720
Our country's nephews.

403
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,720
Hey, Young-rong.

404
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,720
Sister.

405
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,720
Did you really break up and fix it?

406
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,720
Yeah, wait a minute.

407
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,720
Yeah.

408
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,720
I broke up the marriage.

409
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,720
Why?

410
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,720
You know.

411
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,720
He's nagging me for drinking.

412
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,720
He said, I'm the one who drinks.

413
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,720
So what did you say?

414
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,720
What do you mean?

415
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,720
Of course I said it was alcohol.

416
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,720
So let's not get married.

417
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,720
What are you talking about?

418
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,720
What?

419
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,720
Do you like it?

420
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,720
I like it.

421
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,720
I'm an alcoholic and I'm talking about your mouth.

422
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,720
Do you like it?

423
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,720
Mom, I'm not an alcoholic.

424
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,720
I'm a drunkard.

425
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,720
You have to beat that mouth first.

426
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,720
I'm sorry.

427
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,720
I thought I'd do this.

428
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,720
I thought someone else did something wrong.

429
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,720
That mouth.

430
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,720
You have to beat that mouth to drink.

431
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,720
What?

432
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,720
Oh, my God.

433
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,720
What are you talking about?

434
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,720
Oh, my God.

435
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,720
Mom, stop it.

436
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,720
It's been a while since I took a vacation.

437
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,720
Take a break.

438
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,720
Let go of me.

439
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,720
You.

440
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,720
Hey, you.

441
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,720
Oh, my God.

442
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,720
I was dragged down by the Buddha.

443
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,720
Annoying.

444
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,720
Oh, my God.

445
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,720
Are you really a drunkard?

446
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,720
Did you really break up because you liked alcohol?

447
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,720
I heard it.

448
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,720
Why are you sleeping?

449
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,720
I'll live on my own.

450
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,720
In a narrow, narrow Bocheon,

451
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,720
rumors spread faster than the smoke of the charcoal.

452
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,720
Here's the alcohol you like to get married.

453
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,720
Do you want to have a drink with the old man?

454
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,720
Bocheon's pride, which has been heard as a genius since childhood.

455
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,720
How did Bocheon's daughter become like that?

456
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,720
I'm upset.

457
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,720
You're not an old lady.

458
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,720
It was a snack that would be more delicious than an old man.

459
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,720
Geum-ju has always liked alcohol.

460
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,720
What's a little?

461
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,720
I told you it was good enough to break the marriage.

462
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,720
You're all wrong.

463
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,720
It became a snack that was easier to peel than onions.

464
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,720
Can't you marry a drunkard?

465
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,720
Yeah.

466
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,720
Stop.

467
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,720
You kids.

468
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,720
Aunt, it's not that you can't get married because you like alcohol.

469
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,720
It's that you don't get married because you like alcohol more.

470
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,720
There's a huge difference between the two.

471
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,720
The two are different.

472
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,720
You're good.

473
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,720
I'm going to teach the kids a good thing.

474
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,720
You're still a piece of junk.

475
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,720
What kind of rumors spread so fast?

476
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,720
Kim Beom-hee is originally a speaker of Bocheon.

477
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,720
Oh, my God.

478
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,720
Besides, I have a few group chat rooms.

479
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,720
If you uploaded it all, you can see that you know the new life that was born in the Bocheon Sea.

480
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,720
I just got caught by that lady.

481
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,720
No, I can get married.

482
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,720
What's so special about that?

483
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,720
It's because you like alcohol.

484
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,720
You know that I'm a total stranger in this industry.

485
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:44,720
If I didn't have alcohol, I would have tried hard to survive in a place where the sense of community was at its worst.

486
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,720
I thought drinking was an extension of work.

487
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,720
Then you nag me about alcohol.

488
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,720
How can I not get married?

489
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,720
Wow, that's a great excuse.

490
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,720
You used to like alcohol.

491
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,720
I know.

492
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,720
How lucky is it to work in a place where you're right for you?

493
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,720
I think she would have cheered for me by buying me a hangover drink instead of nagging me.

494
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,720
You're so good.

495
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,720
Hey, you've been dating for years, but you don't seem to have any regrets.

496
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,720
Regrets? What's that?

497
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,720
Is it the new name of the lucky owner?

498
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,720
But why doesn't he come to you?

499
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,720
Oh, I'm so tired.

500
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,720
Hey, how long are you going to do this with the car?

501
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,720
Yeah, isn't it too much?

502
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,720
Your friend came after a long time.

503
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,720
Oh, I'm sorry.

504
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,720
I was going to fix this for you today.

505
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,720
I looked at all the hands because it was a brake problem, but I couldn't find the problem.

506
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,720
Look, the warning light keeps on blinking.

507
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,720
I'm stressed out.

508
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,720
Can I see it?

509
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,720
Thank you.

510
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,720
Oh, I'm going to wear this skirt and work today.

511
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:00,720
I got it.

512
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,720
It's not working anymore.

513
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,720
I'm going to fix it.

514
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,720
Wow, I didn't even think it was a problem with the car.

515
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,720
As expected, Han Geumju.

516
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,720
Uncle, here you are.

517
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,720
Oh, I fixed it.

518
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,720
Okay.

519
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,720
What? Are you close to Cha Ju?

520
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,720
I'm close, too.

521
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,720
This is Euijun's car.

522
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,720
Euijun? Seo Euijun?

523
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,720
Didn't you know? Euijun came to the health center.

524
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,720
I think Seo Euijun is right.

525
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,720
What? Did you meet?

526
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,720
I just passed by.

527
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,720
I thought I saw it wrong.

528
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,720
But why is he in Bocheon right now?

529
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,720
We thought we saw it wrong at first.

530
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,720
A famous doctor in Seoul came to a health center in the countryside.

531
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,720
You know, there's a lot of medical absence in the countryside these days.

532
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,720
It's been over a year since the health center was closed.

533
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,720
Euijun just came to the village.

534
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,720
The village was a complete festival.

535
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,720
Even if the ancestor comes back to life, he won't be so excited.

536
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,720
Anyway, Euijun is currently in Bocheon.

537
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,720
The savior of the villagers.

538
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:28,720
Someone just came down with a big welcome.

539
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,720
What? Why me? What?

540
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,720
Oh, my God.

541
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,720
But Seo Euijun must have heard of me, too.

542
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,720
Why? Are you embarrassed?

543
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,720
Me?

544
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,720
Me?

545
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,720
It's so funny.

546
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,720
What do I have to be embarrassed about him?

547
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,720
Geumju, why are you so different from Euijun?

548
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,720
You two were really close before.

549
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,720
Hey, by any chance.

550
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,720
He's nagging at Dora.

551
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,720
Oh, my God. I don't know.

552
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,720
I don't want to talk to you.

553
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,720
I'm going.

554
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,720
Geumju, Euijun is coming soon.

555
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,720
Why don't you say hello?

556
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,720
Are you crazy? Why should I?

557
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,720
I have a lot to do, too.

558
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,720
Why didn't anyone tell me that Seo Euijun was in Bocheon?

559
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,720
That's because you can't just make plans.

560
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,720
Oh, I don't know.

561
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,720
Anyway, I bought you a bean paste stew.

562
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,720
Don't worry and hang up.

563
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,720
Hey, you.

564
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,720
What are you doing?

565
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,720
Why aren't you getting on?

566
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,720
You don't know if you see it?

567
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,720
Hey, hey.

568
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,720
Look where you're going.

569
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,720
It's okay. Go on your way.

570
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,720
I can't do that.

571
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,720
Hey, you're still...

572
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,720
My son.

573
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,720
I'm sorry.

574
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,720
I'm sorry.

575
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,720
I'm sorry.

576
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,720
I'm sorry.

577
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,720
You haven't heard my rumors yet.

578
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,720
Hey, why are you doing this?

579
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,720
I'm the one who fixes this in this neighborhood.

580
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,720
When I was young, I even appeared in the film,

581
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,720
Youngjae's discovery.

582
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,720
You did it?

583
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,720
I almost did.

584
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,720
I grew up too fast.

585
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,720
What?

586
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,720
Hey, hold on.

587
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,720
This is a three-minute cut.

588
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,720
Think of it as a quick cut.

589
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,720
Wait.

590
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,720
Huh?

591
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,720
You don't even know.

592
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,720
Why did you come down?

593
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,720
No.

594
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,720
You don't have to see it.

595
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,720
You don't have to make a mistake.

596
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,720
Oh, thank you.

597
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,720
I'm sorry.

598
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,720
Golden week?

599
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,720
It's been a while. Nice to meet you.

600
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,720
Nice to meet you?

601
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,720
I don't think we're supposed to be happy to see each other.

602
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,720
I heard about you.

603
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,720
I'm here to get married.

604
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,720
I don't want to nag you about alcohol.

605
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,720
Why?

606
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,720
What do you mean?

607
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,720
What?

608
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,720
I heard about it.

609
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,720
I heard you were getting married.

610
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,720
So I was going to congratulate you.

611
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,720
But you're the one who's getting married?

612
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,720
Because of alcohol?

613
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,720
Yeah.

614
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,720
But we're not talking about our lives.

615
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,720
We're not in a relationship.

616
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,720
I never asked.

617
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,720
I just said it on your own.

618
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,720
Anyway,

619
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,720
Let's not pretend to know each other even if we meet often.

620
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,720
Let's pretend we don't know each other.

621
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,720
Okay?

622
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,720
I think I'm going to die.

623
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,720
Don't die.

624
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,720
I don't want your help.

625
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,720
I don't want to help either.

626
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,720
You said to pretend you didn't know.

627
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,720
Oh, come on.

628
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,720
I don't care.

629
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,720
I erased it in my life anyway.

630
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,720
I'm an outcast.

631
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,720
I'm sorry.

632
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,720
Doctor?

633
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,720
I'll take you to the clinic after the physical therapy.

634
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,720
Okay.

635
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,720
Are you okay with your shoulders?

636
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,720
I'm fine.

637
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,720
You must be very upset.

638
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,720
You have two daughters.

639
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,720
The eldest daughter is divorced.

640
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,720
The second daughter is pregnant.

641
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,720
I know.

642
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,720
Who knew that would happen?

643
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,720
You're embarrassed.

644
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,720
It doesn't make sense to get married because of alcohol.

645
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,720
You're lying to me.

646
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,720
I'm not lying.

647
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,720
I'm excited.

648
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,720
I think you know how it feels to be upset because of your children.

649
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:55,720
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

650
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,720
Why is this the only thing I can do?

651
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,720
Eat this.

652
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,720
I'm full.

653
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,720
Really?

654
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,720
Go brush your teeth.

655
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,720
Okay.

656
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,720
Eat up.

657
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,720
I'm full too.

658
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,720
Why?

659
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,720
You're not eating anymore?

660
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,720
It's okay.

661
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,720
I'm full.

662
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,720
You're so cheesy.

663
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,720
I want a beer.

664
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,720
No.

665
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,720
You should drink soju with pork belly.

666
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,720
Look.

667
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,720
You should drink beer with pork belly.

668
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,720
You're all wrong.

669
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,720
You should drink soju with pork belly.

670
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,720
Shake the soju.

671
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,720
Three.

672
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,720
Beer.

673
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,720
Seven.

674
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,720
This is the cool part.

675
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,720
It's so cool.

676
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,720
It's good.

677
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,720
It's good?

678
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,720
It's good.

679
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,720
It's good.

680
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,720
Why?

681
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,720
It's a frog.

682
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,720
I ate the frog.

683
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,720
Here we go.

684
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,720
One shot.

685
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,720
One shot.

686
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,720
Why is he eating?

687
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,720
I want more alcohol because of you.

688
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,720
Cheers.

689
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,720
Cheers.

690
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,720
Cheers.

691
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,720
It's so good.

692
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,720
It's so good.

693
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,720
I'll pour more later.

694
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,720
Cheers.

695
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,720
Why don't you sleep at dawn?

696
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,720
I need to sleep.

697
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,720
I need to sleep.

698
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,720
You know, Gahee.

699
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,720
Why did you put it in the foam?

700
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,720
You should bite it.

701
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,720
I can't bite you.

702
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,720
You're so mean.

703
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,720
Why did you drag me down?

704
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,720
What are you talking about?

705
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,720
Stop trying to stop me.

706
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,720
I'm a human too.

707
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,720
What?

708
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,720
You don't think about others and live your life the way you want.

709
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,720
What do you mean?

710
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,720
Live my life the way I want?

711
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,720
Me?

712
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,720
No.

713
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,720
Think about the money you got hurt because of you.

714
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,720
Aren't you sorry?

715
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,720
No, I'm not sorry at all.

716
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,720
Not at all.

717
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,720
You bitch.

718
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,720
I was wrong.

719
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,720
I'm sorry.

720
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,720
We solved the problem.

721
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,720
You're so serious about the date.

722
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,720
I knew it.

723
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,720
If it wasn't for you, we wouldn't have solved it.

724
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,720
You're on a break from work, right?

725
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,720
Yes.

726
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,720
How about a drink?

727
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,720
Well...

728
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,720
Let's drink next time.

729
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,720
I'm going home right now.

730
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,720
I'll save you.

731
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,720
I'm sorry.

732
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,720
Don't worry.

733
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,720
I was going to break up with you and clean up.

734
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,720
I'm sorry.

735
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,720
No, I'll tell you to break up today.

736
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,720
Really?

737
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,720
Yeah, so don't cry.

738
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,720
You'll be surprised to hear it in your stomach.

739
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,720
Okay?

740
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,720
Don't cry.

741
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,720
I'm sorry.

742
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,720
Why aren't you picking up?

743
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,720
You're in the way of drinking.

744
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,720
Here.

745
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,720
Drink up.

746
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,720
Let's drink.

747
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,720
Drink?

748
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,720
It's me.

749
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,720
Drink.

750
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,720
So let's pretend we weren't married.

751
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,720
Hey, Han Geumju.

752
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,720
What are you talking about?

753
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,720
I'm telling you.

754
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,720
I broke up this marriage.

755
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,720
I dumped you.

756
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,720
Because you're...

757
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,720
a jerk who's worse than me at drinking.

758
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,720
I'm sorry.

759
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,720
Where did you go so early in the morning?

760
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,720
I don't like being home.

761
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,720
That's good.

762
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,720
Follow me.

763
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,720
What? Where are you going?

764
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,720
Wait.

765
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,720
Mom.

766
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,720
Where are you going?

767
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,720
Mom.

768
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,720
Do you want to go on a date with me?

769
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,720
What are you going to do?

770
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,720
I don't want to go.

771
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,720
I'm tired.

772
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,720
Where did she go?

773
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,720
Oh, my.

774
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,720
It's such a nice day.

775
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,720
Oh, my.

776
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,720
What did she think?

777
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,720
She's so good at drinking.

778
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,720
She's so good at bullying people.

779
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,720
Yes, ma'am.

780
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,720
I'll post the contract in the name of Han Geumju.

781
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,720
50,000 won.

782
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,720
I'll deposit 1 million won.

783
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,720
1 million won?

784
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,720
3,000,000 won.

785
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,720
3,000,000 won.

786
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,720
What are you doing?

787
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,720
Don't you know?

788
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,720
You're trying to get rid of alcohol

789
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,720
so that you don't even think about it.

790
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,720
Wait a minute.

791
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,720
Come here.

792
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,720
Why are you doing this?

793
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,720
I'm trying to get rid of alcohol.

794
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,720
I don't know. I don't have to quit drinking.

795
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,720
You're so out of your mind.

796
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,720
Move away.

797
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,720
I'll transfer the money right away.

798
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,720
Oh, my.

799
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,720
Hey, hey, hey.

800
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,720
Just get caught by Han Geumju.

801
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,720
Hey, you.

802
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,720
Don't you stand there?

803
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,720
You can't just stand there and leave.

804
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,720
Hey!

805
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,720
Stay there!

806
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,720
If you get caught, I'll kill you.

807
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,720
Hey, Geumju!

808
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,720
Oh, my.

809
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,720
Geumju!

810
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,720
Geumju!

811
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,720
Geumju!

812
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,720
I don't know.

813
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,720
I don't want to quit drinking.

814
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,720
I'm not going to quit.

815
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,720
So give up.

816
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,720
Hey.

817
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,720
Hey!

818
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,720
Oh, my.

819
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,720
Oh, my.

820
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,720
Oh, my.

821
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,720
Oh, my.

822
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,720
Oh, my.

823
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,720
Are you okay?

824
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,720
Oh, my.

825
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,720
Why are you coming out of there?

826
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,720
Oh, my.

827
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,720
Mother.

828
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,720
Thank you.

829
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,720
Oh, my.

830
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,720
Geumju.

831
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,720
You came down from that accident because of alcohol,

832
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,720
but you can't get a grip.

833
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,720
You said you were suffering from alcohol addiction.

834
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,720
Is there any good way?

835
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,720
I don't know why you two got so far away.

836
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,720
You were friends without two at one time.

837
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,720
Even if you thought about the past.

838
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:37,720
Alcohol problem is the beginning of the perception of yourself as a problem.

839
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,720
Wait and see.

840
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,720
Your mother will change even if you do this.

841
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,720
If you trust and wait, it will eventually change.

842
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,720
If I really trust and wait,

843
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,720
will it change?

844
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,720
Let's go.

845
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:07,720
It's hot.

846
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,720
It's hot.

847
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,720
It's hot.

848
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,720
It's good.

849
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,720
I'll give you a glass of makgeolli.

850
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,720
Right?

851
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,720
If you drink a glass of makgeolli before your mother comes,

852
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,720
you'll get a stroke.

853
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,720
If you get caught, you'll get a stroke.

854
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:25,720
Are you here?

855
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,720
Where's Geumju?

856
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,720
She'll be here in a minute.

857
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,720
Don't you know about the memorial service?

858
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,720
Maybe she's talking to her relatives.

859
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,720
Is that so?

860
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,720
I guess she's going crazy.

861
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,720
I think she'll go even crazier when she gets home.

862
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,720
I'm going to go.

863
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,720
Why are you already grilling the meat?

864
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,720
I just need to order new ones.

865
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,720
Eat it when it's cooked.

866
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,720
You eat meat raw.

867
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,720
Calm down.

868
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,720
You're so good at cooking.

869
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,720
Are you a beast?

870
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,720
You're crossing the line.

871
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,720
Don't cross the line.

872
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,720
Eat slowly.

873
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,720
Shut up.

874
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,720
You're crossing the line.

875
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:39,720
Why are you fighting over someone who doesn't want to come?

876
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,720
Did you call me to order a fight?

877
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,720
Who's fighting?

878
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,720
She's the one who's fighting.

879
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,720
You're the one who's fighting.

880
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,720
I'm not going to eat with you guys.

881
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,720
Okay, okay.

882
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,720
Sit down.

883
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,720
Let's enjoy the meal.

884
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,720
I promised you guys.

885
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,720
Geumju is coming, too.

886
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,720
What?

887
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,720
Does she know I'm here?

888
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,720
Of course she doesn't.

889
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:13,720
We planned a surprise for her.

890
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,720
What's going on?

891
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,720
What's going on?

892
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,720
Why did you guys do that?

893
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,720
Of course she did something wrong.

894
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,720
It's not like that.

895
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,720
Then you can go and solve it yourself.

896
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,720
Okay.

897
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,720
Geumju is always on the wrong side.

898
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,720
This way.

899
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,720
Look at her this time.

900
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,720
She's not even drinking.

901
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,720
How can she break the marriage?

902
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,720
Why is he talking about someone else?

903
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,720
You're dumbfounded, aren't you?

904
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,720
Yeah.

905
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:55,720
Why did you call me again?

906
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,720
If we meet again...

907
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,720
I thought you'd be a better person than you are now.

908
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,720
Geumju.

909
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,720
Geumju.

910
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,720
Geumju.

911
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,720
Geumju.

912
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,720
Geumju.

913
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,720
Geumju.

914
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,720
Geumju.

915
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:45,720
Geumju.

916
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,720
Geumju.

917
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:49,720
Geumju.

918
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,720
Geumju.

919
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,720
Geumju.

920
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,720
Geumju.

921
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,720
Geumju.

922
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,720
Geumju.

923
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,720
Geumju.

924
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:03,720
Geumju.

925
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,720
Geumju.

926
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,720
Geumju.

927
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,720
Geumju.

928
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,720
Geumju.

929
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,720
Geumju...

930
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,720
Was she really doing that?

931
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,720
Yes.

932
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,720
Geumju.

933
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,720
Go.

934
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,720
Go.

935
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,720
Go live with him.

936
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:26,920
I was going to clean up.

937
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,720
No, I'll tell her to break up with me today.

938
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:31,820
It's either alcohol or me.

939
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:33,620
Alcohol.

940
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:37,820
I can't be abandoned by someone else.

941
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:40,520
I have to abandon you first.

942
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,120
That way, I can at least break up with you.

943
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,020
I'm sorry.

944
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:43,020
No, it doesn't make sense to drink at the funeral.

945
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:44,020
It does.

946
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:46,620
No, it doesn't.

947
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:47,520
This is right.

948
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,020
Brother, you should say something, too.

949
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:51,220
Well...

950
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:52,920
You have nothing to say, right?

951
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,720
My daughter got married because of alcohol.

952
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,120
What?

953
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:57,920
She got married?

954
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:01,220
What do you mean?

955
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:02,920
She got married because she was nagging

956
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,120
about her favorite alcohol.

957
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,320
Isn't that amazing?

958
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:11,120
But who made Geumju such an amazing woman?

959
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:14,920
This family has taught me to drink

960
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:17,320
since I was young.

961
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:21,220
I'm sure you all have a say in this.

962
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:22,220
Don't you?

963
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,020
If you feel responsible,

964
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:26,820
don't talk about alcohol anymore.

965
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:35,620
I'll wait for you.

966
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:37,320
Geumju, I'll stop drinking

967
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,920
because you're not a girl with no thoughts.

968
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,920
I'll never drink again.

969
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,220
Hello?

970
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:44,920
Geumju?

971
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:45,920
Yes.

972
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:54,920
What? Why is she running away?

973
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,320
Uncle!

974
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,020
Geumju!

975
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,920
Did you come to see me?

976
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:11,920
Geumju.

977
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:13,620
Geumju?

978
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:20,920
What?

979
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:23,620
What?

980
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:25,220
She's really drunk.

981
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:28,520
How much did you like my drink?

982
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:31,920
I wanted to buy more

983
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,820
after seeing all this.

984
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:37,120
Wait.

985
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,020
Come here.

986
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:39,120
Have a drink.

987
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,120
Grandpa, have a drink.

988
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,520
Don't get mad at my mom.

989
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,820
What?

990
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:46,620
Stop it.

991
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:49,420
Let go of me.

992
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:51,820
My grandpa is a priest.

993
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:53,720
How can he be so drunk?

994
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,520
Give it to me.

995
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,620
He's nodding.

996
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:58,520
You're crazy.

997
00:53:58,520 --> 00:53:59,720
Give it to me.

998
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:00,920
Let go.

999
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,020
Let go.

1000
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:03,620
Let go.

1001
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:04,920
What's wrong with you?

1002
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,220
Let go.

1003
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:07,720
Let go!

1004
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,320
Geumju.

1005
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,820
You...

1006
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:25,120
You're not a person who can change

1007
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:27,320
even if you trust and wait.

1008
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,320
I told you, right?

1009
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,320
Give up your life and drink.

1010
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:32,420
What?

1011
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:34,220
I'll pour it for you.

1012
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:36,320
You can pour it for me too.

1013
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:39,820
Pour it as much as you want.

1014
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,520
What?

1015
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,120
Are you okay?

1016
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,520
I'm not okay.

1017
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,620
I'm not okay!

1018
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:04,520
You crazy bitch!

1019
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:12,520
Let go!

1020
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,520
Let go!

1021
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,520
Let go!

1022
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,520
Let go!

1023
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,520
Let go!

1024
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,520
Let go!

1025
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,520
Let go!

1026
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,520
Let go!

1027
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,520
Let go!

1028
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,520
Let go!

1029
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:43,820
Are you-

1030
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,920
Are you talking back at me?

1031
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,220
Doha dir.

1032
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,220
Who the hell are you?

1033
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:04,620
Where are you?

1034
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,120
What happened?

1035
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,120
What happened, you bastard?

1036
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,120
Hey, Han Geumju.

1037
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:26,120
I really need to quit drinking.

1038
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,120
Hey, Lee Seowon.

1039
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,120
This is a three-minute cut.

1040
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:37,120
Think of it as a instant cut and wait.

1041
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:47,120
Why isn't it working?

1042
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:51,120
Hey, you said it was a three-minute cut.

1043
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:53,120
Think of it as an instant curry.

1044
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:57,120
I'm going to the market right now and make curry myself.

1045
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,120
I'm done with the dishes.

1046
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:02,120
It's time to sleep tight.

1047
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,120
Hang on a second.

1048
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:06,120
Now I get it.

1049
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:10,120
Why Youngjae wasn't cast in the discovery team.

1050
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,120
What's Youngjae?

1051
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:16,120
Hey, I'm Bocheon Youngjae.

1052
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:18,120
Are you laughing at me?

1053
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:20,120
Are you ignoring me?

1054
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:23,120
Did you stop?

1055
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:28,120
You're not Bocheon Youngjae, you're Bocheon Younggu.

1056
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,120
What?

1057
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,120
Look at your face.

1058
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:39,120
Look at me.

1059
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:45,120
Look.

1060
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:55,120
No.

1061
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,120
Hey, let's go.

1062
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:11,120
I heard the scooter battery is running out.

1063
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:17,120
No, I'm going to name it Bocheon Youngjae.

1064
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:18,120
It's almost done.

1065
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:28,120
Just a minute.

1066
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:38,120
Oh, it's working.

1067
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:43,120
Hey, I'm going to find you a new scooter.

1068
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,120
You're not Bocheon Youngjae, you're a gangster.

1069
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:55,120
What?

1070
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:57,120
You should have driven properly.

1071
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:59,120
Okay, so hold on tight.

1072
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:01,120
Hurry up and go.

1073
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,120
What's your purpose?

1074
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,120
It's because you're heavy.

1075
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,120
What are you doing?

1076
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:16,120
I'm going to see you.

1077
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:42,120
From today on, the man who drinks with my family is the end of the deal with me.

1078
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,120
I can't believe I can't drink at home.

1079
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,120
Does it make sense to be banned from the neighborhood?

1080
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:49,120
Is this something to be done so suddenly?

1081
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:50,120
No.

1082
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,120
Everyone's helping you in the joint.

1083
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:55,120
Geumju, let's do it.

1084
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:56,120
Let's pay for the loss.

1085
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:57,120
What?

1086
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:59,120
I think something bad happened.

1087
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:01,120
I think it's going to be very urgent.

1088
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:04,120
Hey, Geumju.

1089
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:06,120
Hey, wake up.

1090
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:16,120
Brother, look at Geumju.
