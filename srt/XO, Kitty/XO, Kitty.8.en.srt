1
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:47,464
<i>After so much K-drama,
things could not be more perfect.</i>

2
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,924
I could kiss you forever.

3
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:54,137
- Same.
<i>- So, why don't I feel perfect?</i>

4
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,220
But...

5
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,517
We should probably talk.

6
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:04,397
We've been talking for years.
Now we finally get to not talk.

7
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,481
True.

8
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:12,572
But I still have so many questions.

9
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:15,366
When did you know you wanted me back?

10
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,118
How did Yuri find out?

11
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:20,914
- Were you in love with me this whole time?
- Yes, the whole time.

12
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:24,834
Then why be with Yuri in the first place?

13
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:27,878
Because...

14
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,757
I made a mistake.

15
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,840
Dae...

16
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,302
I want to be your girlfriend again.

17
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,096
For real. In person.

18
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:41,142
But... how do I know I can trust you?

19
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,770
Okay, time to go.

20
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,523
Bus leaves in 20.

21
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,777
- God.
- Dude, the class trip is camping

22
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:55,698
In tents... in nature for two days.

23
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,660
I know. That's why I packed light.

24
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,421
You and Kitty still good?

25
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:15,135
Not really. She wants to go over
everything that happened with Yuri.

26
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,304
No, don't. It's a trap.

27
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,807
They say they want
all the details to move on.

28
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,183
Then they obsess about them.

29
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,602
- Is that how Madison is?
- Madison?

30
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:28,106
No, she's totally uncomplicated.

31
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,524
Quite great, actually.

32
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:37,198
We need to deal with our baggage,
but we just keep making out.

33
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:41,452
What? You mean a straight man
doesn't want to talk about his feelings?

34
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,372
He always talked about his feelings
when we were long distance.

35
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:47,584
It feels different in person.
He's less communicative.

36
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:52,589
Okay, well, do you plan
on communicating your crush on Yuri?

37
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,799
It's not a crush. It was just one dream.

38
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,009
Okay.

39
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,345
Thank you.

40
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:05,894
Uh, I want to be respectful
of the situation.

41
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,442
It's okay. She's over me.

42
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,525
Over you?

43
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,571
Dae, she freaked out
and threw a smoothie at you a week ago.

44
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:19,198
We can't be all PDA in front of her.

45
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:22,994
And we can't be DA alone either?

46
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,704
Not until we talk about it.

47
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,125
No way.

48
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:33,379
It's a sign.
We're the perfect travel companions.

49
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,174
We are. I'll even let you
have the window seat.

50
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,468
Ah, actually,
you can have the window seat.

51
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,595
- I prefer aisle, actually.
- Oh, you do?

52
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:43,389
Because I actually need the aisle.
Long legs.

53
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:47,143
I get claustrophobic If I'm at the window.
I get panic attacks.

54
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,227
Okay.

55
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:55,652
<i>A week ago, my grandmother's rose garden
was destroyed by a flood.</i>

56
00:03:55,735 --> 00:04:00,531
<i>But now, my grandmother and her village
have a chance to get their garden back.</i>

57
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,911
<i>Thank you, Madison Miller
and all the students at KISS.</i>

58
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,537
<i>I'll see you this weekend.</i>

59
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:08,998
<i>Ocean Park out.</i>

60
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,584
- Oh, my God.
- He said your name.

61
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,879
I know. And we owe it all to Min Ho
and his famous mom.

62
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,090
Whoa!

63
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,468
Ocean Park played her mysterious stepson

64
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:22,512
on <i>A Song of an Enchanted Tiger Amulet,</i>

65
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,847
and Principal Lim agreed
to cancel the ski weekend

66
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,225
so we could go
to his grandma's village instead!

67
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:33,523
Principal Lim wants to keep my dad happy
so she'll agree to anything I want.

68
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,150
You know?
- Of course.

69
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,462
It's the only reason
I got into this school in the first place.

70
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:42,532
- Your mom is very good at pulling strings.
- Yeah, usually for evil.

71
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,701
Did you see? That was so cool.

72
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,123
Hey, I'm going to sit with Alex.

73
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:51,707
Oh.

74
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,419
Yeah. I'll see you there then.

75
00:04:58,965 --> 00:04:59,965
Hello there.

76
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,635
Don't you wanna sit with your boyfriend?

77
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,888
No, because he does not want to talk
about what I want to talk about.

78
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,057
And you are the only other person
I can talk to

79
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,393
about the other thing
I want to talk about.

80
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,437
The "adopt a baby" elephant in the room?

81
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,107
I'm still trying to figure it out
in my mind.

82
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,235
I'm starting to think that Lee
didn't even know Jina was pregnant.

83
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,445
Yeah, I agree.

84
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:24,073
And so that means
I have to talk to Jina first.

85
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,160
And probably upend her life.

86
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:30,830
And you're certain that Yuri
doesn't know about any of this?

87
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,498
Yes, I'm certain.

88
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,335
Yuri still thinks that both of our moms
were in love with Lee

89
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:38,880
- and that's what made them not friends.
- And how are you?

90
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,508
How are you feeling
about Jina and your mom?

91
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:46,054
I'm feeling amazing about my mom.

92
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,557
I came here to learn more about her.

93
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,852
Like, if I stood in the places
that she stood,

94
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:55,354
I could maybe capture her essence.

95
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:59,776
And, I mean, none of this
is what I expected to learn, obviously.

96
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:05,823
But I'm just so in awe
of what a good friend my mom was.

97
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,827
And letting Jina use her name
at the hospital was a big deal.

98
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,956
If your mother is as kind and loyal
as she seems...

99
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:17,043
you do have her essence.

100
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:28,179
I thought that my mom kept this
because she wanted to find you one day.

101
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:32,475
But she kept this
because she knew deep down

102
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,686
that Jina would want to find you one day.

103
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,190
Here.

104
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:46,822
Thanks, Kitty.

105
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,554
Hey, get up. Trade places with me.

106
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,688
You don't look happy.

107
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,357
Isn't everything going well with you two?

108
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,485
No. She doesn't seem to trust me.

109
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,779
I think she knows
I'm not telling the full story.

110
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:30,783
And since I can't tell her,
I just keep kissing her instead.

111
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,744
Which makes her think
I'm a totally different person than I am.

112
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:36,873
Avoidant men are the worst.

113
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,712
What about you?
You seem like you're doing better.

114
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:43,795
Mm.

115
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:47,049
Yeah. My mom's terrified
of what I might do next,

116
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:50,136
now that I know she's the one
who sent Juliana away.

117
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,325
And I got a big payout
for selling our breakup to the tabloids.

118
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,808
I got an extra 500
for throwing the smoothie.

119
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,769
Now I have enough to pay
for my flight to Iceland.

120
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,270
That's great.

121
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,818
You don't mind that your followers
are glomming onto someone else now?

122
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,321
Doesn't bother me.

123
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:12,200
I don't need them anymore
now that I have real friends.

124
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,372
At least things
are working out for one of us.

125
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,457
No...

126
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,794
I'm going to help you too.

127
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:26,796
How?

128
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:29,424
Not sure.

129
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:43,064
We are in the forest.
It's extremely dangerous.

130
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:45,441
There's a lot of wildlife around here.

131
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:49,862
Um, also, could everyone tell me
who they would like to room with?

132
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:53,115
Oh, Kitty and I will room together.

133
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,534
We will?

134
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:03,125
Hey. Don't get all buddy-buddy and tell
Yuri that I'm her brother. You promise?

135
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,503
I promise. We are not buddies.

136
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,713
If anything,
she plans to murder me in there.

137
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:16,722
Okay. So we've got our first pair.
Anyone else?

138
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:20,518
You two? You go, boys. Three, off you go.

139
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,942
Ew... nature.

140
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:32,196
Anyway,
together we'll make the most of it.

141
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,160
You gonna cut off all my hair in my sleep
or something? Is that your plan?

142
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,412
What?

143
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:42,248
No. There are no hard feelings.

144
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:45,501
That's what Dae said too,
which makes no sense.

145
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,587
I had hard feelings when he picked you.

146
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,838
Very hard.

147
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,590
- And you're meaner than me.
- Kitty...

148
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,174
None of this adds up.

149
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,679
When I first found out you were dating,
I thought you were in a fake relationship.

150
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,098
Do not look at me like I'm paranoid.

151
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:02,977
There's a thing with my sister, Lara Jean,
and her boyfriend, Peter Kavinsky, but...

152
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,731
Anyway. Then when I finally made peace
with the fact that you guys were for real,

153
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,274
- Dae wants me back.
- Kitty.

154
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:11,611
But this new version of him
does not want to talk to me.

155
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,530
I am just so sick of feeling
like I don't know the whole story.

156
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,698
Kitty!

157
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:21,787
Wow, you are just so likable and sincere.

158
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:23,497
It's annoying.

159
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:27,501
And... it's making it really hard
for me to lie to you.

160
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,213
Lie? What are you lying to me about?

161
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,301
You were right all along.

162
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,678
It was a fake relationship.

163
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,096
I knew it.

164
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,687
Why would you and Dae do that to me?

165
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,982
What excuse could you possibly have?

166
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,159
I'm gay.

167
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,958
And with the family I have,
I'm not allowed to be.

168
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,506
Oh.

169
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,479
I thought you said you were camping?

170
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,062
Yeah, but there's no Wi-Fi in our tents.

171
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:29,438
Oh.

172
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,565
Tell Ocean I say hi.

173
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,692
I could tell
he'd turn out pretty successful.

174
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:37,446
Pretty successful?
He has 20 million followers, Mom!

175
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,240
Oh, really?

176
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,992
<i>- Okay, so tell me everything.</i>
- I've decided...

177
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:45,746
to give Madison a chance.
I'm gonna try dating her.

178
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,373
She worships me.

179
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:50,584
That's when she was chasing after you.
Now that she's caught you...

180
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,379
Don't worry.
I've got the upper hand here, not her.

181
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,092
Oh!

182
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,846
The ten of cups!

183
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,976
You know what that means, right?

184
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:12,440
Love is in the air!

185
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:21,115
Are you freaked out that I'm gay?

186
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:25,202
No. I'm freaked out that...

187
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:30,082
last week you were the enemy
who stole my boyfriend,

188
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,668
and then a second ago
you were the girl I pitied

189
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,295
because I stole him back.

190
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,130
And now...

191
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,465
What?

192
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,011
I relate to you.

193
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,345
Really?

194
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,979
You did all of this for love.

195
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:53,897
I get love.

196
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,486
So, I guess now I'm...

197
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,030
rooting for you.

198
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:07,995
But... I'm also mad at both you and Dae.

199
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,706
You dragged me into this
and let me get hurt.

200
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:12,583
He was only trying to help me.

201
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:17,546
You know he's a good person
and he loves you.

202
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,050
Well, it doesn't feel great that he can
lie to someone he loves that easily.

203
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,885
It wasn't easy for him.

204
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,596
I pushed him into it
and trapped him there.

205
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,642
You can hate me forever, but forgive him.

206
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,065
I want to forgive him.

207
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,527
I still love him,
but I don't know how to forgive him yet.

208
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,406
I'm sorry that your mom
banished your girlfriend.

209
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:48,077
That's heartbreaking.

210
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,039
Yeah.

211
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,506
And you know what the worst part is?

212
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,675
I have no way to reach her in England.

213
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,678
What if she thinks I forgot about her?

214
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:10,474
My sister, Margot, lives in England now.
In London.

215
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,310
How nice for her.

216
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:17,940
No, I'm saying, like,
what if she could somehow find Juliana?

217
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,484
- You know what school she goes to, right?
- Yeah.

218
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,319
I feel like a grand gesture like that

219
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,905
would make it feel
like no time has passed.

220
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,031
I'll talk to Margot.

221
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,119
Your sister would track down
some girl she doesn't know

222
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,079
just because you asked her to?

223
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:36,458
In the Song Covey household,
I'm kind of known for my persuasiveness.

224
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,128
Well, it's probably
not what Margot calls it.

225
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,589
And you'd do that for me?

226
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,385
Of course.

227
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,429
I'm a matchmaker.

228
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:55,269
Also, I really took it for granted
that I have an amazing family

229
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:56,979
who supports me no matter what.

230
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,190
It must really suck.

231
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,025
Not...

232
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,402
having that.

233
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,115
It does.

234
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,744
Thanks, Kitty.

235
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,878
Yuri told me that she told you everything

236
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:25,090
- and you weren't mad.
- Not mad at her.

237
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:28,719
She's not the person that I used to trust
with my entire heart and soul.

238
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,598
I really wanted to tell you, but...

239
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,684
How could I? It wasn't my secret to tell.

240
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,768
Of course.

241
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:40,022
But I'm still upset.
You could have told me something.

242
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,440
Can you...

243
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,152
tell me what to do?

244
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,864
The Dae I used to know
would have figured that out for himself.

245
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,828
Everyone, gather round.

246
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:55,912
Let's go.

247
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,291
Today, our job

248
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:03,671
is to get this garden to look
as beautiful as it was before the flood.

249
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,589
As a reward,

250
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:09,218
you will get the priceless knowledge

251
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,553
that you have helped heal a community.

252
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,304
Neat.

253
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:19,269
Um, you will also get an extra hour
before curfew tonight.

254
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,813
- Okay, sick.
- Yes.

255
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:24,108
Yeah? Great. Let's get cleaning, shall we?

256
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,568
Um, cool. I've got some rakes here.

257
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,652
Here we go.

258
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,824
Thank you very much.

259
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,117
Great. That's a lot.

260
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,576
That's... Oh, my gosh.

261
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:37,829
Hey, Florian.

262
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:40,791
Hello?

263
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:41,874
What?

264
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,794
Sexy lumberjack here.

265
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:48,007
You've been on your phone this whole time.

266
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,260
I know. I just need to answer
this one text. It's important.

267
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,680
You seem to have
a lot of important texts recently.

268
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,142
Wait.

269
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,065
Hello, Momma.

270
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:10,529
My grades are fine,
there is really no need for this!

271
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:14,116
It's Dad. Hang on.

272
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,869
Yes, Dad?

273
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,582
Dad, I know. She just called...

274
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,627
I don't want to move to Paris...

275
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:29,798
There is zero reason for her
to send me to Yiayia and Pappous.

276
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,759
Because, Dad, I can't...

277
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:33,634
Whoa.

278
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,847
Did you just hang up
on both of your parents?

279
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,017
If I did that to my dad,
he would be all...

280
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:43,936
Florian.

281
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,024
My life is a mess.

282
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,236
Except for you, it's... It's a mess.

283
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,072
What's going on?

284
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:56,450
My parents are fighting
over custody and child support

285
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,452
and trying to make me choose sides.

286
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:02,581
And my grades are slipping
and my parents won't tolerate that.

287
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:06,043
Now my mom is threatening
to make me come back to Greece

288
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:09,922
to live with her
and my Greek Orthodox grandparents

289
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,381
who don't know I'm gay.

290
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,551
And obviously can't know I'm gay. So...

291
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,574
Yuri! My sister texted.

292
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,451
She found her.

293
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,912
Juliana's gonna call me later
so you can talk to her.

294
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,622
Oh, my God. You are amazing.

295
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:46,333
Matchmaking skills. Still got them.

296
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,128
See, sometimes all you need
is a grand gesture.

297
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,849
- Oh, my God. It's Ocean Park!
- He's here!

298
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,121
No, it's me, Madison Miller.
I'm here to help your grandma.

299
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,124
Madison, my number one fan.

300
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,459
I went to your New York show,
Istanbul, Tokyo.

301
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,254
You seemed a little bit off during Dubai
but still amazing!

302
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:33,838
Thank you.

303
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,552
Hi. My mother, Dami,
says, "Hello," Mr. Park.

304
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,595
Dami.

305
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,348
Your mother is an incredible woman.

306
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,560
Did she ever tell you about the time
I ran into her at Sundance?

307
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:47,519
Uh...

308
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,688
She kept me warm on a very cold night.

309
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:51,398
Excuse me?

310
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:52,691
Let's take a selfie.

311
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,411
Hey. Will you help me?

312
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,206
I really have to nail this.

313
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,049
Where are you taking me?

314
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,134
It's a surprise.

315
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,679
Put on some lip gloss.

316
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,266
And let's do something fun with your hair.

317
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,728
Okay.

318
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,953
Oh, my God! Spider! It's crawling!

319
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,955
That is generally what they do. Yes.

320
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,043
It left. It just went out the window.

321
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,253
You're good.

322
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:57,506
You saved me.

323
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,052
You okay?

324
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:04,845
Yeah, for sure.

325
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,058
You know, I'm not gonna
put the moves on you.

326
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:09,850
I know.

327
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,062
Knock, knock.

328
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,816
Your date's here.

329
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,777
He's my date. Of course he's my date.

330
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:20,945
Hi.

331
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,698
You look beautiful.

332
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,199
Hi.

333
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,451
Thank you.

334
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,624

Yeah. I'll let you know when we get there.

Two stairs.

And... we're here.

344
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:37,355
No one has ever done
something this nice for me before.

345
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:41,359
I wish I could
go right back to the welcome party.

346
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:48,241
Right back to when I first saw you
standing there in that dress.

347
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:50,534
So...

348
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,705
I could kiss you.

349
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,085
Feed a girl dinner first, then we'll see.

350
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:00,753
Okay.

351
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:16,977
Hi.

352
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:22,317
Where have you been?
Why didn't you text me back?

353
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,528
- I was with Ocean Park...
- Whoa.

354
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:26,279
You stood me up for him?

355
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,363
Let me finish.

356
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:30,909
I was with Ocean Park's grandmother.
She invited me to dinner at her <i>hanok.</i>

357
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:34,663
Ocean Park wasn't even there,
and I'm not some groupie.

358
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:39,209
You expect me to believe
that you stood me up for a grandma?

359
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:41,211
Yes, I do.

360
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,713
And if you don't,
then you really don't get me at all.

361
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,759
Fine. You stood me up for grandma.
That's worse.

362
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:48,969
Why do you even care?

363
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:51,513
It's not like this is serious.
I'm not your girlfriend.

364
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,139
Right?

365
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,686
I thought we were
on the same page about that.

366
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,397
It's the whole reason
I liked you in the first place.

367
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,860
Um...

368
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,866
I don't get it.
You were obsessed with me.

369
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:13,952
Yeah, I do that.

370
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:17,706
I get all caught up in the chase,
but then... meh.

371
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:19,957
Sorry.

372
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,462
I'm still into hooking up, though.

373
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:29,009
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I think I want more.

374
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,263
I might be ready for a relationship.

375
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:34,431
Oh...

376
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:41,104
It was you who helped me realize that
in our week together.

377
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,441
I'll always be grateful to you.

378
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,614
Goodbye, Madison Miller.

379
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,620
Okay, then.
I'll see you tomorrow on the bus.

380
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:57,704
Mm-hm.

381
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,251
Okay. I...

382
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:08,089
know that you're worried
that I'm not the same guy

383
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:09,925
that you thought I was.

384
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,929
I was worried, but...

385
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,138
Let me finish.

386
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,228
I'm not.

387
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,691
I'm not the same guy.

388
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,276
You're not the same girl.

389
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:30,570
How could we be?

390
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:37,953
When we first met, we were just kids,
and it's been four years.

391
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,706
- Can you believe that?
- No, I know.

392
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:51,258
That whole time,
you were the only person I thought about.

393
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:53,634
Me too.

394
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:01,101
You've never had a crush on anybody else?

395
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,060
Not once?

396
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:04,561
I...

397
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:11,444
- I did once for, like, 5 minutes.
- Who?

398
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,156
- Mihee, in ninth grade.
- Oh.

399
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:18,493
I don't know why,
but, like, she started wearing...

400
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:22,372
glitter eyeshadow,
and it meant nothing. I...

401
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:25,542
You do not need to defend yourself.
I get it.

402
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:27,459
Okay.

403
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:32,882
I think maybe crushes
are just a natural part of growing up.

404
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,051
Yeah.

405
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,928
But...

406
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:47,605
When you were looking for someone
to kiss at Min Ho's party,

407
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:51,443
it felt like my stomach
was being ripped out.

408
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:55,613
And that's way more
than just a silly crush.

409
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,911
I think that's...

410
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,165
love.

411
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:15,842
I love you, Kitty.

412
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:19,971
I always have.

413
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,351
I love you too.

414
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:51,543
Hey.

415
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:55,423
- So?
- It was perfect.

416
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,301
I'm so happy for you.

417
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,012
And Dae.

418
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,014
It's Juliana.

419
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:11,523
You found me?

420
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:15,026
I mean, I was hoping that you would.
I just can't believe it.

421
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:15,944
Oh, my God.

422
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,363
I am so sorry it took me this long.

423
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:21,282
- I miss your face.
- I miss your everything.

424
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,244
You got to thank this Kitty girl from me,
whoever she is.

425
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:25,370
I will.

426
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:30,291
Oh, you look amazing.

427
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,045
<i>Yuri deserves
all the happiness in the world.</i>

428
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,463
<i>Just like me and Dae.</i>

429
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,425
<i>Everything is as it should be.</i>

430
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:39,676
Are you happy?

431
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:40,760
<i>I miss you.</i>

432
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:42,846
I miss you.

433
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:49,060
And I love you so, so much.

434
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:54,357
<i>Then why does it feel
like my stomach is being ripped out?</i>
