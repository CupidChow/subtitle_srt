<i>What is happening?</i>

5
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,533
Q! I have something to tell you.

6
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,117
- Get up!
- Q!

7
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,495
Did you drink my collagen water?

8
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,080
Or was it you?

9
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,331
What? No.

10
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:43,835
My collagen water
is meant to keep my skin dewy.

11
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:46,838
Not rehydrate people
who can't handle their liquor.

12
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,757
My God, why are you screaming?

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,884
It's the middle of the night
and I'm still drunk.

14
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,677
No, it's not. It's 8:00 in the morning.

15
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,345
And thanks to some idiot,

16
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:57,682
my party dynasty has come
to an untimely end, so,

17
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,476
yeah, I am in a mood.

18
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,604
Are you in a mood to make me coffee?

19
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:04,481
Yes, but I will deeply resent you.

20
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:07,317
- I can live with that.
- Okay, Q, can I ask you something?

21
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,070
Yes, I drank his collagen water.

22
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,071
Not that.

23
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:14,699
Then no, I'm too tired for your questions.
You kept me up all night.

24
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,911
- I could hear you through the wall.
- I was loud? How?

25
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,038
Was I talking in my sleep?

26
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:22,832
Because people say all kinds
of crazy things in their sleep.

27
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:27,128
Like this one time,
I asked LJ to make me a BLT with mayo,

28
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,671
but I hate mayo.

29
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,924
No, no, you were not talking.

30
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,842
You were snoring.

31
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:36,179
Because I was drunk
and drunk people do tons of things

32
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:40,767
they don't normally do, like snore.
And have really weird dreams.

33
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,145
You had a sex dream. Was it about Dae?

34
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,438
- No.
- Oh, not Dae.

35
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,899
No. I didn't say that I had a sex dream.

36
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:50,485
Okay. You didn't have to. Spill.

37
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,696
It doesn't even matter,
dreams don't mean anything.

38
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,449
She's right. They don't mean anything.

39
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,369
You can have a sex dream about
someone you're repulsed by in real life.

40
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,371
Yes, exactly. Thank you, Min Ho.

41
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:04,290
Min Ho could have a sex dream
about, like, me.

42
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,169
- You had a sex dream about Kitty.
- No, I didn't.

43
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:11,381
If I did have a sex dream about Kitty,
it'd be a sex nightmare.

44
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,925
- Oh, my God.
- I'm not hearing a denial.

45
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:16,094
It doesn't matter,
dreams don't mean anything.

46
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,721
- Exactly, I hate mayo.
- And I hate Kitty!

47
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,889
Thank you.

48
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,767
Sex dreams mean something.

49
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,662
Resident advisor.

50
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,396
- Uh...
- Using master key.

51
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:34,404
Well, I hope last night was worth it

52
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,823
because you're all in big trouble.

53
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,167
Saturday detention?

54
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,168
Come on.

55
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,753
You and your friends are lucky
that's the extent of it.

56
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,922
Do you know how embarrassing
this is for me?

57
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,006
For the school?

58
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:55,633
Have you checked your phone?

59
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:10,148
What? I wasn't even drinking last night.

60
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,609
That doesn't matter.
The narrative is out there.

61
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:16,863
And it's not just the school.
This puts your father's business at risk,

62
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:20,575
after we worked so hard
to rehabilitate the family image.

63
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,831
We need to arrange a photo-op
for you and Dae.

64
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,917
Maybe church tomorrow?

65
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:33,087
Oh. It's unwise of you
to have an attitude about this

66
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,256
if you want your credit card back.

67
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,552
I'm sorry, you're right.

68
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,804
I'll do whatever you want.

69
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,934
So, what does this mean for Iceland?

70
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:51,231
You have some nerve
even asking me about that right now.

71
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,992
What now?

72
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,393
Hey, I'm not having a
great morning. Can we talk after...?

73
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,752
Let's break up.

74
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:16,381
Dae, I'm sorry about the necklace.
But right now is really not the...

75
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,549
Whatever! It has nothing to do with me.

76
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,678
We both still need this.
I need to see Juliana. And you...

77
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,721
No, I'm fine. I've saved some money,

78
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,057
and I don't want to lose Kitty
because of you.

79
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,392
Why?

80
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,603
Why did you take it?

81
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,063
Because I was jealous.

82
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,276
- What?
- Because I thought I might lose you.

83
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:39,904
During Chuseok,
I felt like we became real friends.

84
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,864
But when I saw Kitty's necklace,

85
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,866
I thought you might want
to go back to her.

86
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,327
- Then you'd be done with me.
- Friends?

87
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:51,666
- Is that something a real friend would do?
- I know. I made a mistake.

88
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,836
And I'll make it right, okay?

89
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,796
I'll see you in detention.

90
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,549
I'm dying, come here!

91
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,095
Yes, just leave the food on the bed!

92
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:13,271
Hi, I'm looking for Kitty...
your roommate?

93
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:16,024
Oh, yeah, she's not here.

94
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,693
Hasn't been here in weeks.

95
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,945
I have no idea where she's been sleeping.

96
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,118
I do.

97
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,751
Ugh. This sucks.

98
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,502
I wanted to work out and then chill.

99
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,338
Then work out again.

100
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,340
- I was going to study anyway.
- Really?

101
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,217
Yeah, finals are coming up,

102
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,763
and with my scholarship
I need to keep my grades up.

103
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,931
I need to study too.

104
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,059
Nerds.

105
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:54,729
Hey, some of us have divorcing parents
ready for any slip-up

106
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:56,355
to demand us moving home.

107
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,693
And adorable little distractions
we keep making out with

108
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,362
when we should be finishing our papers.

109
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,947
Indeed, Florian.

110
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,910
Your paper on the war-inspired poetry
of Chinua Achebe was superb.

111
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,286
Really?

112
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:12,663
If only you hadn't turned it in
a day late.

113
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,582
Phones, gentleman.

114
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:23,549
Flo, are you falling behind because of me?

115
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,804
A little,
but don't worry about Professor Lee.

116
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,723
- I'm his fave.
- Attention, students.

117
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:35,311
Your precious digital appendages
will be returned when detention is over.

118
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,230
Eight hours from now.

119
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,401
You have your friend, Ms. Song Covey
to thank for that.

120
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,403
That's right.

121
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:47,198
She was kind enough
to alert me to last night's shenanigans.

122
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,284
It was you?

123
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,413
This could be fun, though.

124
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,792
Like <i>The Breakfast Club</i>, right?

125
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,006
Hey, babe.

126
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,468
Last night was memorable.

127
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,473
Why are you even in here?

128
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,183
You didn't get caught at the party.

129
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,268
Hmm.

130
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,146
How did you not get caught?

131
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,709
Please, I've snuck out of every window
of every boarding school

132
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:21,899
from here to Antarctica.

133
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,277
Ms. Miller,
this is not a time for socializing.

134
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:27,947
Hey, did you talk to Yuri?

135
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,200
Yuri? Why would I talk to Yuri?
I really barely know her.

136
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,745
I don't want to talk to Yuri
or do anything else with her.

137
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,384
Hey - you - that necklace...

138
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:52,221
Weren't you going to return it to Kitty?
Why are you wearing it?

139
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,824
What are you going to do about it?

140
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,850
- What?
- You can't break up with me.

141
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:59,228
Or I'll tell on Kitty for living with you
in the boys' dorm.

142
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,689
And that would get her expelled
from school.

143
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,274
- Yuri Han...
- No, I get it.

144
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:06,652
You, Min Ho, Q,
all saving sweet innocent Kitty

145
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,988
from the big bad Yuri.

146
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,990
You only said you're my friend

147
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:13,409
because you wanted something from me.

148
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,329
- Yuri. I'm sorry...
- For what? For not telling me?

149
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:19,207
For making me feel bad?
Or getting caught lying?

150
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,336
Why do you have my necklace?

151
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,440
- You gave it to her?
- No, I didn't.

152
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,509
- She stole it before I even got it.
- Dae. Ladies.

153
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,052
Take your seats, please.

154
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,056
Professor Lee, I need to discuss...

155
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:38,935
Where did you get my necklace?

156
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,354
What? That's my necklace.

157
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,356
It was my mom's.

158
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,274
Oh.

159
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,194
My mistake.

160
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,072
Now I can see that it's not mine.

161
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,534
Will you excuse me?

162
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:57,286
<i>First, she pretends
she doesn't know mom</i>

163
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,497
<i>and now she thinks mom's necklace is hers?</i>

164
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,541
All of you, in your seats.

165
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,083
Now.

166
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:15,972
Are you all right?

167
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,223
Of course.

168
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,308
I recognize that necklace.

169
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,186
You and Eve Song got them together.

170
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,274
Why didn't you tell me
Kitty was Eve's daughter?

171
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,444
Why would I have?

172
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,154
Does it matter?

173
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,220
Should not have had that coffee.

174
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:41,891
Attention, students.

175
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:47,188
Apparently, I am needed
in the gymnasium briefly.

176
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,773
He has to poop.

177
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:49,982
Definitely.

178
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,694
Madison Miller,
you've proven yourself trustworthy.

179
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,488
You are in charge while I'm gone.

180
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:58,491
Please make sure
everyone is quietly studying.

181
00:10:58,574 --> 00:10:59,992
Yes, sir.

182
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,954
You heard him. Eyes down.

183
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,461
Kidding. Do whatever.

184
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:13,130
But be careful, if you're going to vape,
crack a window.

185
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,927
You, keep watch by the door
and warn us when Lee's coming back.

186
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:24,016
What? Haven't any of you
ever gotten stuck in a Saturday detention

187
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,477
and kept the party going
when your teacher leaves the room?

188
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,147
Oh, y'all are so cute.

189
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:33,317
Okay. Poker game will start
in the World History Section,

190
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,820
make-outs move in back by the rare books.

191
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,488
I like an organized chaos.

192
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:38,572
Go.

193
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,248
Come with me to the yearbooks.

194
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,249
Why?

195
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:49,332
Please?

196
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,840
You, me, rare books.

197
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,549
Let's go.

198
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:58,676
Wait, what?

199
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:04,348
Look, I know you've been living with Dae
and you know I stole your mom's necklace,

200
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,308
but can we please put a pin in our drama?

201
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:10,813
I need to know why my mom loses her shit
whenever anything about your mom comes up.

202
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,523
Yeah, I do too.

203
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,568
That first day
I introduced myself to your mom,

204
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,486
she acted like she barely knew my mom,

205
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,739
but if you look at the photo album,
there are so many photos of them together.

206
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,284
And, did you know they were roommates?

207
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,618
- They were?
- Yes.

208
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,745
Did she say something weird happened
between them?

209
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,331
No, just that they weren't close.

210
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,625
But maybe she was lying about that.

211
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:38,048
And that's why we need to find
more photos of our moms.

212
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,092
I need to know what she's hiding.

213
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,844
To understand her better?

214
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:45,014
No, to destroy her.

215
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,100
Damn, that's terrifying.

216
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,810
But I'm in.

217
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,898
Okay, we need to find 1993.

218
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,163
That's the only year
that's missing.

219
00:12:57,234 --> 00:13:00,112
Maybe someone just put it back
in the wrong spot?

220
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,490
Or maybe my mom got rid of it.

221
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,201
This morning was so weird.

222
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,578
She thought that my necklace was hers.

223
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:11,248
Maybe they both had one
and wore them like friendship necklaces.

224
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,709
Then something happened
to make them not friends.

225
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:17,671
Yes, like... Professor Lee.

226
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,590
Maybe he came between them.

227
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,468
Random, but I'm listening.

228
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,094
I love love triangles.

229
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,430
Uh, what are you two doing here?

230
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:29,975
We were gonna go make out.

231
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:31,769
We're official.

232
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,229
I proposed.

233
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,897
But this seems fun too.

234
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:39,151
I saw some very intense body language
between your mom and Lee this morning.

235
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,612
- They did go to KISS at the same time.
- Yeah, I know.

236
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,113
It all makes sense.

237
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:47,159
Jina was in love with Lee,
but Lee ended up choosing Eve in the end.

238
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,285
Tragic.

239
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,121
Why are we assuming he chose Eve?

240
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:54,583
Maybe he chose my mom
and Eve was the tragic one.

241
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:58,337
Regardless, we need to find this yearbook.

242
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,548
My mom might have one in her office.

243
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,511
I know she's stuck in a board meeting
right now.

244
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:06,136
The sooner I find what her secret is,
the sooner I can use it against her.

245
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,764
So are you with me or what?

246
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:10,765
I'm with you.

247
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,896
Check the shelves, I'll check her desk.

248
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,980
Okay.

249
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,710
Oh, my God, here's my file.

250
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,984
I can't believe this.

251
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,030
She has my mom's obituary.

252
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:08,573
Look.

253
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:16,332
Wow, I guess my mom's
an even better liar than I am.

254
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,752
She's hiding something big.

255
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,419
But what?

256
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,130
I have an idea.

257
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:30,429
He's coming.

258
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,431
Oh, assume your positions.

259
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,395
Shh!

260
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,571
Thank you, Ms. Miller.

261
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,823
It looks like
you kept everything under control.

262
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:50,908
My pleasure.

263
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,080
Lunch time. Write down your orders.

264
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,873
Get them back to me
as quickly as possible.

265
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:01,919
Feel free to stretch your legs,
your arms, whatever needs stretching.

266
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,798
We have one hour and one hour only.

267
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:12,113
- What do you wanna eat?
- I don't know.

268
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,722
How can I think about food right now?

269
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,892
I'm going crazy worrying
about what Yuri and Kitty are up to.

270
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,104
Whatever it is,
it's not your business, dude.

271
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,898
Kitty wants to learn about her mom.

272
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,150
She didn't just come here to stalk you.

273
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,046
You're right.
I'll guess I'll just order their lunch.

274
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,071
All right.

275
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,331
Mm-mm. No, she likes the tuna gimbap
without mayo.

276
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,169
What, are you an expert on Kitty?

277
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,047
Yeah, I'm living with her,
thanks to someone.

278
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:52,094
I also wish I didn't know this much
about the girl who ruined my party.

279
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,139
I know what
you're gonna order.

280
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,683
What? No, you don't.

281
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,309
We've never shared a meal.

282
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,396
The bulgogi gimbap, extra kimchi.

283
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,818
Students, roll call before lunch.

284
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,531
Hey, they're not here yet.
He's going to catch them.

285
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,825
I got this.

286
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,876
No, you cannot have your phone back.

287
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,045
I don't need a phone.

288
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,172
I'm in the library.

289
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,716
I am surrounded by knowledge

290
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,427
and I couldn't help
but notice you're reading<i> Gilgamesh.</i>

291
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,723
I'm obsessed with Sumerian epic poetry.

292
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,144
And you have
the Benjamin Foster translation.

293
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,021
I... I die.

294
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,522
- Florian.
- Yes?

295
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,316
You never cease to amaze.

296
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,778
I have a wonderful picture book
depicting the original,

297
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,529
ancient cuneiform tablets.

298
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,074
I would love to see that.

299
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:59,912
Well, I would never hold back
on sharing a book with a keen student.

300
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:04,166
I'll go get it.
It's just in my home office.

301
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,419
Ms. Miller, you're in charge.

302
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:08,837
Oh.

303
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,881
Thank you so much, Professor Lee.

304
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,681
So we're official, boyfriend.

305
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,725
You're so cute I could vomit.

306
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,357
Oh.

307
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,402
Um, hello?

308
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,613
Q, can you hear me?

309
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:35,614
Kitty?

310
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:36,532
Where are you?

311
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,368
I'm on Professor Lee's
landline in his house.

312
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,245
Thank God he did not take your watch.

313
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,247
Wait, did you memorize my number?

314
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,541
Lee was in the same class as our moms

315
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,085
so he might have the yearbook
we're trying to find.

316
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,294
Kitty.

317
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,463
I'll be back soon. Cover for us.

318
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:56,926
What?

319
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,430
The cuneiform.

320
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,141
- What? Right.
- He went home.

Oh, my God, it's Lee.

325
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,527

That was my mom's favorite song.

333
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,241
My mom loves that song too.

334
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,121
Look. Look.

335
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,336
It's 1993.

336
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,299
There they are...

337
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,593
wearing the necklaces.

338
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,971
- Like BFFs.
- Mm-hm.

339
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,438
At least your mom looks cute.

340
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:35,359
My mom looks like
she just gained the junior 30.

341
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,655

You're supposed to call me out now.

00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:45,826
I get it.

344
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,288
You do?

345
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,668
I should have
given it to you this morning.

346
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,129
Or never taken it in the first place.

347
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,455
We should get back to the library
before Professor Lee.

348
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,915
Yes, I know a shortcut.

349
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,547

359

Students, roll call.

360
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,555
- Kon.

361
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,974

362
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,698
- Min Ho.

363
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,228
- David.

364
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,147

365
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,983

366
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,693
- Leo.
- I'm here.

367
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,028
Do something.

368
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:44,821
- Jiyung.
- Here.

369
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:45,905
Watch this.

370
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,033
Professor Lee?

371
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,204
I have an emergency.

372
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:53,913
Yes?

373
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:56,875
Well, it's personal.

374
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:14,267
Ms. Miller would like to inquire
if any of the girls here...

375
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:17,104
Any of the women... Women here,

376
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,524
have any lady supplies she can borrow.

377
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,526
- Have.
- I've got tampons.

378
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:23,609
I have pads.

379
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,403
Amaze-balls.

380
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:28,823
Thank you.

381
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,742
Amaze-balls.

382
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,205
Amaze-balls. Thank you.

383
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:54,558
Why did you take the necklace?

384
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,397
Because I'm an idiot.

385
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,234
But I'm not going to be anymore.

386
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:10,115
Hey, can I borrow your Apple watch?

387
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:12,200
I have a really important
phone call to make.

388
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,202
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

389
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,299
Gasp!

390
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,345
Your sex dream was about Yuri, wasn't it?

391
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:37,684
Mm-hm.

392
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,353
Look who's the matchmaker now.

393
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:45,233
- It's me.
- I know.

394
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,568
Okay. Yeah.

395
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:56,536
I hope this day
has allowed all of you to understand

396
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,580
the consequences of your actions.

397
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:03,585
Underage drinking is a serious offense,
it is never a good decision,

398
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:05,128
understand?

399
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,264
Weird day.

400
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,182
You think?

401
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:23,104
I'm glad you're okay.
I was really worried about you last night,

402
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:27,442
as your teacher and as your half-brother.

403
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:31,571
Yeah, about that.
I have something to show you.

404
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:39,246
Look, this is May 1993.

405
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:45,669
And that's my mom,
clearly not pregnant, but Jina...

406
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:47,671
Oh, my God.

407
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,881
Principal Lim.

408
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,926
Principal Lim...

409
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,220
could be my mother.

410
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,907
Hey, the paparazzi's here.

411
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:16,825
I know.

412
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:17,909
I called them.

413
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,327
With Q's Apple watch.

414
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:20,869
Why?

415
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,039
You will see.

416
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:26,626
What's going on?

417
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,258
I'm so sick of this.

418
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,302
You're obviously still in love with Kitty.

419
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:37,721
Don't even try to deny it.

420
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:45,937
Sorry.

421
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,021
