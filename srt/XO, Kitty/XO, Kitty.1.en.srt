Dae? Dae? Hello?

6
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:30,780
Can you hear me?

7
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:36,119
<i>Summer in Portland,
everybody's got their person.</i>

8
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,621
<i>I'm still trying to get a hold of mine.</i>

9
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:43,084
<i>It's not easy since he's 16 time zones
and 5,000 miles away.</i>

10
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:47,922
<i>- Kitty, are you there? Kitty?</i>
- Hi.

11
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,048
<i>Hi.</i>

12
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,633
- I can hear you.
<i>- Finally.</i>

13
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,094
<i>- My reception is so bad here.</i>
- This is so hard.

14
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,554
<i>I wish I was there.</i>

15
00:00:54,637 --> 00:01:00,268
If I was not enjoying this pool floaty,
I would be at home in my comfort socks.

16
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:01,686
Missing you.

17
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,397
<i>I hate we're so far away from each other.</i>

18
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:09,944
I hate it too. Are we ever
gonna see each other again?

19
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,613
<i>- Kitty?</i>
- Dae?

20
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:15,158
I said, are we ever gonna see
each other again? Hello?

21
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:20,205
<i>Yes, we will.
I'd give anything to be with you now.</i>

22
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,921
I gotta go. I will call you later. Bye.

23
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:31,508
Hello. This is she.

24
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,135
Oh, my God.

25
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,094
Yes.

26
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,391
Twenty-four hours. I understand.

27
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,228
Yes. I officially accept.

28
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,898
Thank you so much.

29
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,819
Yes!

30
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:57,492
Kitty and Dae, love against all odds.

31
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,288
What's this about, Kitty?

32
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:05,083
There'll be time for questions at the end.

33
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,797
I know when two people
are meant for each other.

34
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,424
<i>- It's a feeling I get.</i>
- Hi.

35
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:17,303
<i>I felt it for Lara Jean and Peter.
I felt it for you two.</i>

36
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,222
Hi.

37
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,807
<i>And I feel it for me and Dae.</i>

38
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,103
<i>♪ No one else, you and me

39
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,688

40
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:27,814
Destiny.

41
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:31,067
<i>Remember when I went to Grandma
and Grandpa's to help clean the attic?</i>

42
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,904
<i>Well, I found all this stuff of Mom's
and I realized that she went to Korea</i>

43
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,407
<i>for boarding school
in her junior year of high school.</i>

44
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,034
Grandma told me
she got this cool scholarship

45
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:43,037
for Koreans living abroad
to help them learn about their culture.

46
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,957
- That sounds lovely.
- The best. She told me all about it.

47
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,667
No one told me about it.

48
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,337
My whole life I've had to rely on
other people to tell me about Mom.

49
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:55,008
- Kitty, I mean, I was...
- Honey, you're interrupting her flow.

50
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,175
Keep going.

51
00:02:56,259 --> 00:03:00,805
So, there I was, trying to make sense
of all these little pieces of Mom's life.

52
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,599
<i>Who's this dude?</i>

53
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,062
<i>Love songs?</i>

54
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,398
<i>I thought Dad was your first love.</i>

55
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,989
<i>And then suddenly something clicked.</i>

56
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:21,451
The school Mom went to,
the Korean Independent School of Seoul,

57
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:27,165
one of the top international schools
in the world, is the same one Dae goes to!

58
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:30,335
Wow! That's a coincidence.

59
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:33,004
It's more than that, Dad. This is fate.

60
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:40,845
I applied to KISS and I got in.
I got the same scholarship as Mom!

61
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:41,929
Ah!

62
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,185
So this would be...

63
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:55,610
your junior year of college.

64
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,488
Of high school. Just like Mom.

65
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:02,909
High school?
Honey, classes start next week.

66
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:06,621
It's crazy timing-wise,
but a spot just opened up today.

67
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,706
- Which, again, fate.
- What...?

68
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:13,544
Dad, I missed out on getting to know Mom.

69
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,297
And I miss Dae all the time.

70
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:21,177
And I miss LJ and Margot but they're busy
because they're off doing their own thing.

71
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,888
That's different. They went to college.

72
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,432
No, it's not that different to me.

73
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:30,228
'Cause I'm the only one left here at home.

74
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,771
With you two, of course.

75
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:35,858
Who I absolutely love
spending so much time with.

76
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:39,612
But I'm ready to stop missing everybody.

77
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,532
I'm ready to start
experiencing new things.

78
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,786
- I want my own adventure.
- I get that.

79
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,789
But boarding school,
that's not like going on our vacation.

80
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:51,708
We had a travel agent doing everything...

81
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,626
I know. But I'll have Dae.

82
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:58,506
And he'll be my guide
and my translator and my person.

83
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:01,676
- Uh, I don't know.
- Honey, wait...

84
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:06,389
I think it's great that she wants to know
more about her mom and her culture.

85
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,851
I spent a summer in India with my cousins
when I was about Kitty's age

86
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,312
and it was life-changing.

87
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:18,359
When did you get to be so big?
You're supposed to be 9 years old forever.

88
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,153
Dad, focus.

89
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,406
This is important.

90
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,577
No part of Mom
has ever belonged to just me.

91
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:33,166
This could be my chance
to get to know her in my way.

92
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:41,382
I feel like if I find this piece of her,
I'll find a piece of myself.

93
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,764
Your mom would be so proud of you.

94
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:53,686
So I can go?

95
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:55,395
You can go.

96
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,900
I can? I can? Oh, my God, thank you!
Thank you! I love you!

97
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:04,989
- Ah, she's gonna have a great time.
- She will have a great time.

98
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:10,703
Did I just let my youngest daughter go
to Korea to have sex with her boyfriend?

99
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,706
No! No.

100
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:17,835
Maybe.

101
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,632
Katherine Song Covey.

102
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,885
"Kitty" to my friends,
and I'm on my way to Seoul, Korea.

103
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,137
Yes. I see that in the system.

104
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,724
<i>"Dear Lara Jean and Margot,</i>

105
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:35,269
<i>I can't believe 'Operation K.I.S.S.'
is actually happening.</i>

106
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,232
<i>Margot, I know you still don't believe me,
but this is not all about a boy.</i>

107
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,902
<i>This is for me. XO, Kitty."</i>

108
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:44,946
Whoa.

109
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,506
Excuse me.

110
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,011
Wait, do you go to KISS?

111
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,472
I'm going to KISS.

112
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,225
No English.

113
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,855
Okay, rude.

114
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,567
<i>"Hi, me again.</i>

115
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,862
<i>Okay, so maybe I'm partially going
to Korea for Dae.</i>

116
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,655
<i>Good guys are hard to find.</i>

117
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:31,826
<i>Oh, by the way, I decided to surprise him.
He has no idea I'm coming.</i>

118
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:35,580
<i>I'm gonna show up at the welcome party
and boom, first kiss.</i>

119
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:38,374
<i>Pretty soon, these lips
will no longer be virgin.</i>

120
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,293
<i>XO, Kitty."</i>

121
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,900
Thanks!

122
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,158
Wait, that's my bus!

123
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,410
Oh!

124
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,184
Sorry.

125
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,328
Hi, excuse me.

126
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,830
Um...

127
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,626
Korean Independent School of Seoul.

128
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,132
Hi. Do you...?

129
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:44,250
I heard your dad
opened a new hotel in Dubai.

130
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,544
Love this for me.

131
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:49,213
Oh, I feel like your dad
won't approve of this.

132
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:51,507
What?

133
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,801
I just don't want
to get in trouble with Mr. Han.

134
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,388
What you really don't want is
to get in trouble with his only daughter.

135
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,224
Of... of course, Yuri.

136
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,479
Ring all of this up for me.

137
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,574
Wow! Yuri Han! That's Yuri Han!

138
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,608
Are you okay?

139
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,152
Are you okay? Do you need help?

140
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,406
Can I get a ride?

141
00:10:58,866 --> 00:10:59,742
Okay.

142
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,453
Put her bags in the car,
please. She's coming with us.

143
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:04,789
Thank you.

144
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:09,251
Why do foreigners always look
the wrong way before crossing the street?

145
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:16,926
- Where can we take you?
- Korean Independent School of Seoul.

146
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,053
- No way.
- Do you know it?

147
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,222
- That's where we're headed.
- Shut up.

148
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:22,681
I go there too.

149
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,162
Please take us to school.

150
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,481
So, are your parents diplomats?

151
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:31,399
No.

152
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,609
- Business execs?
- I came by myself.

153
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:37,571
Oh. There are a ton of American kids
at KISS, so you'll feel totally at home.

154
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:41,450
- Half the school's foreign.
- Well, I'm actually half Korean.

155
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,161
Really? Do you have family here?

156
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,205
No, just my boyfriend.

157
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:50,167
We met in Seoul a few years ago.
I can't wait to surprise him.

158
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,795
Wait, he has no clue that you moved here?

159
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:56,090
No, this is my plan:
I'll find him at the welcome party,

160
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,175
tap him on the shoulder
and say, "Excuse me,

161
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,927
but have you seen my boyfriend?"

162
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:04,640
And then we'll kiss
for the very first time and it'll be fire.

163
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:07,143
I don't know anyone
who'd do something like that.

164
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,562
Well, now you do. I'm Kitty.

165
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:10,896
Yuri.

166
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,148
What about you?

167
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,233
Are you seeing anybody?

168
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,782
If not, I can help. I'm a matchmaker.

169
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,495
I've been hanging out with somebody
this summer, but it's not serious.

170
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:29,206
- Why?
- Because it can't be.

171
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,625
- Why?
- Because it's complicated.

172
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,502
What makes it so complicated?

173
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,838
Are you like this
with every new person you meet?

174
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,673
Just the ones I find interesting.

175
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,134
Lucky me.

184

- Thank you. Thanks again for the ride.
- Sure.

185
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,216
Good luck with everything.

186
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,396
First quarter tuition payments
were due two weeks ago.

187
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,649
I know.
I have almost all of it now, really.

188
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,025
Dae.

189
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:41,320
We have this conversation
every quarter, don't we?

190
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:42,655
I know.

191
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:46,951
I know you're always
looking out for me too.

192
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,453
But you know how things are -

193
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,389
if you give me just a little more time,
I can sort this out.

194
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:55,793
You know I want to help.
But we have a waitlist this term.

195
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,546
Isn't there anything you can do? Please.

196
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,721
I can give you until tonight.

197
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,475
If you can't pay by then,
your enrollment will be canceled.

198
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,895
Thank you. Thank you so much.
You're the best.

199
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,339
Oh, Professor.

200
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:48,971
Uh, do you need a TA?
Because, lucky for you, I'm available.

201
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,142
Uh, Professor...

202
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:11,285
Oh! I am so sorry. Totally my bad.
Are you okay?

203
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:12,745
I'm okay.

204
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,125
Damn. I better work on my Korean.

205
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,711
Hi, I'm new.

206
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,713
Welcome to KISS. Your name?

207
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:25,299
Katherine Song Covey,
"Kitty" to my friends.

208
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,801
- Will you be living in the dorms?
- Yes.

209
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:30,970
Ah.

210
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,474
Here it is. It was in the wrong file.

211
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,769
- Fill out these forms.
- Thank you.

212
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,490
- You wanted to see me?
- Sit down, Yuri.

213
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,200
Not even the first day of school

214
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,827
and I'm already called
into the principal's office.

215
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,120
Yuri...

216
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,915
I know this look.

217
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:03,045
This isn't even a student-principal talk.
This is a mother-daughter talk.

218
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,756
- Yes, and it's serious.
- What did I do now?

219
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,717
Juliana's parents called me this morning.

220
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,803
Okay.

221
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,807
Apparently their housekeeper
saw you and Juliana...

222
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,935
embracing last week.

223
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,312
Embracing.

224
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,023
That's seriously what she said?

225
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:26,735
I was hugging my friend goodbye,
it wasn't romantic.

226
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,946
That's not what the housekeeper says.

227
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,699
You'd believe the housekeeper
over your own daughter?

228
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:35,703
Not normally, but you've been
sneaking around all summer.

229
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,747
Something is up with you.

230
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,792
How would you even know?
You and Daddy have barely been home.

231
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:45,170
You're so busy expanding
this "Han Hotel Empire."

232
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:49,508
This merger with the Miller Hospitality
is all you guys care about.

233
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,635
Madison Miller's attending KISS this year.

234
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:55,681
The last thing I need is rumors running
around this school about you and Juliana.

235
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:59,268
So, Yuri, tell me the truth.

236
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,021
What's going on with you two?

237
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:09,445
Fine. I was sneaking around
with someone this summer

238
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:13,615
and Juliana was just helping
by covering for me.

239
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:15,868
Who is it?

240
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:19,496
It's someone you and Daddy
won't approve of.

241
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:23,417
Will you please call Juliana's parents
and explain this is a misunderstanding?

242
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,720
I have to meet some families
down at the welcome table.

243
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:40,434
But as soon as I'm done,
I'll reach out to Juliana's parents.

244
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,144
And, Yuri...

245
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,814
I want to meet your mystery boy.

246
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,659
Jina.

247
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:14,134
<i>Jina. Is that...? I think it is!</i>

248
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,929
<i>I could actually get to meet Mom's friend.</i>

249
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:23,352
Hi. By any chance
were you a student here in the '90s?

250
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,271
Yes, I was. Class of '94.

251
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:30,025
And now I'm head of the school.
Principal Lim. Welcome.

252
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,152
Kitty Song Covey, new student.

253
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,030
I think my mom might have been here
at the same time as you.

254
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,699
- Oh.
- Her name was Eve Song.

255
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:39,992
Huh.

256
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,371
That doesn't ring a bell.

257
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,206
This is you, right?

258
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,666
You look amazing.

259
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:48,377
Barely aged.
Korean skincare really is the best.

260
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:53,340
Oh. Would you excuse me?
I see someone I need to speak with.

261
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,219
<i>Is it me or was that weird?</i>

262
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,100

<i>Hey, kitten. Everything going okay?</i>

279
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,205
<i>You all settled into your room?</i>

280
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:09,833
Yeah, I don't know where
my roommates are but their stuff's here.

281
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,210
I'm sure they'll love you.

282
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,338
I think I met somebody
from Mom's photo album today.

283
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:17,174
But she acted like
she didn't remember who Mom was.

284
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:20,510
- Well, it was a long time ago.
<i>- Yeah, I guess.</i>

285
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:24,556
I just can't believe I'm gonna be meeting
other people who knew Mom.

286
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,936
Well, think about it. You'll be walking on
the same paths to class that she did,

287
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,812
studying in the same library.

288
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:35,150
<i>You might even be in the very same
dorm room that she was in right now.</i>

289
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,527
I just got chills.

290
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,155
Ah, that's probably
'cause you'll see Dae soon.

291
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,240
Ha-ha.

292
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,743
True. I do have butterflies right now.

293
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:48,205
I'm going to see him
in approximately 184 minutes.

294
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:51,458
At the welcome party.

295
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,044
Well, have a great time and remember...

296
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:57,506
I'm not having another talk
about contraceptives with you.

297
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:00,634
Dae and I haven't even kissed. Yet.

298
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:01,969
I was gonna say,

299
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:07,015
remember, the only way to get over jet lag
is to stay awake as long as possible.

300
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,142
<i>Yes, staying awake. Got it.</i>

301
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,687
<i>- I love you.</i>
- Love you too.

302
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,691
Okay, stay awake.

303
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:24,449
I'm staying awake. I am so awake.

Don't feel bad.
He loves to pull this move on people.

323
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,489
He did it to me the first time we met.

324
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:49,367
Goddamn it, Q, this is bespoke.

325
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:52,120
Shut up about the clothes.

340
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,796
Are you kidding me?
You're blowing my mind right now.

341
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:46,550
- What are you doing here?
- I transferred to KISS.

342
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:51,513
I got a scholarship and everything.
We get to spend the entire year together.

343
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:58,270
<i>Now we kiss.</i>

344
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:04,901
Uh, wait, Kitty.
I need to tell you something.

345
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,865
- Kitty?
<i>- Is her arm on his arm?</i>

346
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,158
You look amazing.

347
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:14,077
<i>Why is her arm on his arm?</i>

348
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:15,996
This is Dae.

349
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:21,334
The person you
were telling me about in the car?

350
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:24,254
Yeah, my boyfriend.

351
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,263
Excuse me.

352
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,771
Sorry. This can't be happening.

353
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:58,997
<i>I fell for a guy
who was a total liar.</i>

354
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,208
I still care about you.
You are my best friend.

355
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,834
That's a fake relationship.

356
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,756
You flew across the world for Dae
without telling him.

357
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,342
- What's going on?
- Dae's been cheating on you.

358
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:15,430
- Please get out of my life.
- I don't wanna be next to you either.

359
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,600
<i>Be careful
who you share your secrets with.</i>

360
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,352
Our moms knew each other at KISS.

361
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:28,944
- Tell me who they'd like to room with.
- Kitty and I will room together.

362
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,028
We will?

363
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:34,783
What are you doing?

364
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,077
