1
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,040
Dae, what is this?

2
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,124
What?

3
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,294
Where did you get...?

4
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:47,839
When did you start dating Han Yuri?

5
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:49,132
Did Kitty dump you?

6
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,884
What happened? Tell me.

7
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,553
Don't worry about it.

8
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:54,636
Oh, Dae Heon.

9
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:57,098
I was going to drive you to campus,

10
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,225
but I need to go see
President Han right now.

11
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,144
- Okay.
- Dad,

12
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:04,022
that's not what's important right now.

13
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:06,191
Dae is going viral right now.

14
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,317
Hmm?

15
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,071
"Dae Heon Kim, humble boyfriend
of hotel heiress Yuri Han,

16
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,865
saves tarnished corporate image
of Han Hotel Group."

17
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:16,868
"Acquisition of Miller Hospitality
back on track."

18
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:21,581
Hey, are you doing all right?
Is there something I should know?

19
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,708
Don't worry.

20
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,627
- Everything will be fine.
- All right.

21
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,670
I'm going now.

22
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,051
Watch out for cars.

23
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,511
- Okay.
- Have a good day.

24
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,263
Dae.

25
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,099
Can we play before leaving?

26
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,768
No, we're already late.

27
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:42,851
Go get ready.

28
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:44,645
Fine.

29
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,123
- Have you packed your schoolbag?
- Yeah!

30
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,440
Good job.

31
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,364
Bora...

32
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,035
what happened to your sneakers?

33
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,997
I'm probably going through
a growth spurt. It's okay.

34
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,251
How is this okay?

35
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:13,633
It's going to look weird, but...

36
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,845
Hold your foot up.

37
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:23,768
You can wear this for a while.

38
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,729
Nobody would notice this.

39
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:30,859
It's fine. I already get
made fun of in school, anyway.

40
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:32,902
What?!

41
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:33,987
Let's go.

42
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,638
I'd move the barrette up a little higher.

43
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:02,973
Thanks.

44
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,603
Come in, come in.

45
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,648
Okay, that can go there.

46
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:13,735
And that one here, please.

47
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,530
- What are you doing here?
- You hired movers?

48
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,283
- Kitty, you're still here.
- Yes, she is.

49
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,244
I'm going to call Campus Police
and have her forcefully removed.

50
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:27,332
- Do not call Campus Police.
- Dae, we need to talk. Now.

51
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,505
- All right, where to begin?
- I'm late. I need to change.

52
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,633
I saw you on TV this morning.

53
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,135
That was quite the performance.

54
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:42,805
- I'm sure you have questions.
- Yeah, for starters, I...

55
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:44,849
What...?

56
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:46,893
Um...

57
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:54,817
Uh, for starters, I'd like to know
why you chased me down in pajamas,

58
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,195
begged me not to leave,
and then almost kissed me.

59
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,948
- Kitty.
- And I would've kissed you back,

60
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,491
if you hadn't been kidnapped

61
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,494
by your other girlfriend's family,
by the way.

62
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,912
I can explain.

63
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,163
Great.

64
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,332
Why don't we start with the lies?

65
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,084
Lies? Plural?

66
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,378
You have two girlfriends, right?

67
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,296
Or is that a double-double lie?

68
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,800
And why would you pretend
to be rich all these years?

69
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,636
- What else are you lying about?
- I never lied.

70
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:24,222
Oh, but you FaceTimed me from a fancy car

71
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,975
and just left out the fact
that your dad is the chauffeur?

72
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,021
Do you not know me well enough
to know I wouldn't care about that?

73
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:42,865
I was embarrassed.

74
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,246
Here's this beautiful girl
on a fancy family vacation,

75
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,457
and she's interested in me.

76
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,796
And about Yuri...

77
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,716
Hey, so we gotta go now,
or we're gonna be late.

78
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,304
I'm leaving this open.

79
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,308
Dae, now.

80
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,853
I'll find you later where we can be alone,

81
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,522
and I promise

82
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,232
I can explain everything.

83
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,945
Looking forward to that.

84
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,755
Are you texting Dae?

85
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,548
Yes.

86
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:43,176
- Ask him if he signed the NDA yet.
- No.

87
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,470
It's already weird enough.

88
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:49,182
You and Daddy made this
a whole business thing.

89
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:50,932
Fine.

90
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,103
Are you almost ready to go?

91
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,521
Just give me a minute.

92
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,453
Okay, open up.

93
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:15,291
Oh, my God.

94
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,336
You're so talented, it's painful.

95
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,507
- Could've been better. I could've blended.
- Are you kidding me?

96
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,468
This song is dope. What is it?

97
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,804
It's the DJ I was telling you about.

98
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,889
Oh, the one that's DJing on New Year's?

99
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:34,519
Mm-hm. So we can go
see him together in Iceland.

100
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:38,523
Mm... Us dancing together
under the northern lights?

101
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,650
- Mm-hm.
- Can't wait.

102
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,359
Me too.

103
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,505
Yuri! We're gonna be late.

104
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,883
Coming!

105
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:24,110
Dae Heon Kim. Did you sign the NDA?

106
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,529
Behind us, be careful. Paparazzi.

107
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,741
My mom is having me tailed right now.

108
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,414
This was easier than I thought.

109
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,625
All right. Let's go.

110
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,045
Smile.

111
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,926
Kitty's figured out too much.
I have to tell her the truth.

112
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,637
- You can't.
- I know, but I have a conscience.

113
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:55,808
I might be fake dating you and lying
to the press, but I have integrity.

114
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,603
No, Dae Heon Kim,
you literally can't tell her.

115
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,313
Or do you want to get sued?

116
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:04,233
Whatever. Just answer me this,

117
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,860
who is "Baby"?

118
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:10,072
- None of your business.
- Fine.

119
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,051
Don't tell me if you don't want to.
I'll just tell your dad's lawyer about it.

120
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,075
Check your phone.

121
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,127
It's Juliana.

122
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,718
I'm with Juliana.

123
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:34,931
What does that mean?

124
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,231
You're with Juliana?

125
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,653
She was supposed to be
at the welcome party.

126
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:49,946
But she didn't come.

127
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,281
All her social media's been deleted.

128
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,200
And her phone's been disconnected too.

129
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,579
I think her parents sent her away
because of me.

130
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,792
I might never see her again.

131
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,259
Hop on.

132
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,683
What are you doing?

133
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,644
We can't be late
on our first day of school.

134
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,398
Trust me, and hop on.

135
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:37,742
Thank you.

136
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,999
- It has to be fake.
- Huh?

137
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,043
Don't you think?
When people are performative like that?

138
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,213
I'm Kitty Song Covey.
It's nice to meet you.

139
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,757
Hey, you're the Portland Stalker.

140
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:57,013
<i>It's fine. It's just Day 1.</i>

141
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,806
<i>I'm gonna listen to Mom's favorite song...</i>

142
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,603
<i>...and focus on the fact
that she went here,</i>

143
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,605
<i>and forget about boy drama.</i>

144
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,065
<i>Today is gonna be great.</i>

145
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:12,695
<i>♪ Welcome to your life ♪</i>

146
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:16,532
<i>♪ There's no turning back ♪</i>

147
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,827
<i>♪ Even while we sleep... ♪</i>

148
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,203
Thanks for earlier.

149
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,288
No problem.

150
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:28,044
I know I can't stop you from telling Kitty
that we're in a fake relationship.

151
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,505
But she has to keep the secret.

152
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,258
I get it, and so will Kitty.

153
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:37,887
She's never told anyone
any of my secrets before.

154
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:42,266
But she can't know about the real reason
why we're faking this either.

155
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,894
I know. That will never happen.

156
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:49,607
If she asks about the real reason,
I'll make something else up.

157
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,901
Ugh, this is stressing me out.

158
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:56,447
Oh! Did you finish my summer homework
for Professor Lee's class?

159
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:01,202
You know this is part of
me paying your tuition, right?

160
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,248
No offense,
but I hope we get to break up soon.

161
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,376
You and me both, kid.

162
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:13,546
Oh!

163
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,008
Ow! What the hell?

164
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:21,931
- Juliana? Oh, my God, you're here.
- Hi.

165
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,140
Just for a second.

166
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,768
Listen,
my parents are sending me to Oakham.

167
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,189
- No.
- I know. At least it's not a nunnery.

168
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,649
This is all my fault.

169
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:34,652
- I should have been more careful.
- Stop. No, no, no. It's not.

170
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:38,531
What am I supposed to do here without you?
Everything here sucks.

171
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:42,201
You still have me,
even if we can't talk for a while.

172
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:46,372
But we didn't get to do
the things we planned,

173
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,624
New Year's Eve, northern lights,

174
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,043
holding hands in public places.

175
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,295
We were finally gonna get to be ourselves.

176
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:57,007
And we still can,
because you are a genius.

177
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,677
Using Dae to distract our parents?

178
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,471
That press made its way
to my mom's favorite morning show,

179
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,723
and she's already shipping it too.

180
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,852
- That's only a temporary fix.
- That's all we need.

181
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,396
Stay the fake, shiny "it couple"

182
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,773
so my parents forget about the rumors,

183
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,401
and then I'll be with you,

184
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:19,113
kissing you at midnight in Iceland.

185
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,574
- How?
- No idea.

186
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,243
But if you promise me
that you'll be there,

187
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,662
I promise you I'll be there too.

188
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,632
Go. This is your first day.

189
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,218
You can't be late,
because Principal Lim will flay you.

190
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:45,890
Go.

191
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,649
I spotted it immediately.

192
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,152
The phrasing,
the traditional sentence structure.

193
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:02,656
Yuri is usually more colloquial.

194
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,826
Can you prove her tutor wrote it?

195
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,581
Well... no.

196
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,752
Then this discussion is over.

197
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,853
- What?
- You have the face of a lost person.

198
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:36,524
- I'm looking for Literature.
- Sure. Up there to the right.

199
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,607
Great. Thank you.

200
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,864
Professor Lee, Professor Lee.

201
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,741
It's so nice to see you.

202
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,451
You're in my third period class?

203
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,079
No, we've actually met.

204
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,914
At the faculty luncheon?

205
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,834
- I'm a new teacher here.
- Right.

206
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:00,673
Great.

207
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,467
Many students come to me
with a lack of exposure to anything

208
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,678
but the basics of the Western canon.

209
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,808
We have to get lunch together.

210
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,020
Expect that to change here.

211
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,107
I'll see you all tomorrow.

212
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,736
Dae, you and Yuri are adorable.

213
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,655
Do you guys have other classes together?

214
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,824
Um, I'm not sure.

215
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:33,289
He knew my school schedule
when I was thousands of miles away.

216
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,624
Fakey McFakersons.

217
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,167
Dae, wait!

218
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,213
Miss Song Covey, before you go.

219
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,048
After looking over your test scores,

220
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,676
I've forwarded your name
to the tutoring office.

221
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,513
Oh, great. I used to tutor kids
back at Adler High in Portland.

222
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:53,100
- I started taking AP classes as a soph...
- Not to be a tutor.

223
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:54,768
To be tutored.

224
00:14:56,395 --> 00:15:01,150
You're well below the level of your peers,
and the work only gets more challenging.

225
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,485
Oh.

226
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:09,116
Report to the library after school.
They'll you assign a tutor.

227
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,119
- I'm sure that there...
- You can go.

228
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,689
Is the Portland Stalker
half or just white?

229
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,487
Oh, my God. She got a cupcake on her tray.

230
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,572
Didn't she get enough last night?

231
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,583
Hey! What's up, guys?

232
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,963
- Hey, you're the Portland...
- Portland Stalker, yeah.

233
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,757
I earned a serial killer name on Day 1.

234
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,845
I really shouldn't be talking to you.

235
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,847
I gotta stay on Team Dae.

236
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:17,685
Does Team Dae know that he and I
have been together for years,

237
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:21,480
and this whole Yuri thing
is weird and probably fake?

238
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,315
Weird, yes. But fake?

239
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,317
Come on, life ain't a K-drama.

240
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,426
You saw the heat crackling
between us this morning, right?

241
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,553
We were seconds away from kissing.

242
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:55,305
Maybe he's torn and confused.

243
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,475
He's not confused. He's miserable.

244
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,899
I know what I'm talking about, trust me.

245
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:09,361
My sister, Lara Jean, was in a fake
relationship with her boyfriend, Peter.

246
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:13,449
Kind of my fault, then it turned real,
and they're still together.

247
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,535
But that's not gonna happen
with Yuri and Dae.

248
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,619
I know.

249
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,289
I'm a matchmaker.

250
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,213
- Okay, I still don't...
- You like him.

251
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,091
Florian?

252
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,926
No, no.

253
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,470
He was just yawning,

254
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,889
then you yawned,
and yawns are contagious, so...

255
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,432
He's an elitist.

256
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,268
He thinks not liking Marvel movies
is a personality.

257
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:42,811
Sure.

258
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,814
Well, you're hot, he's hot,
let's move on it.

259
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:50,986
Sorry. God, I forgot I wasn't in Portland,

260
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,447
and I should not assume that you're gay,

261
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,075
or that you're out, or assume anything.

262
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,118
I am out.

263
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:02,164
Don't get me wrong, compared to the US,

264
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,792
Seoul isn't exactly gay-friendly...

265
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:09,213
but I have family in Iran
and the Philippines,

266
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:13,550
so I basically spend every vacation
in Hetero Cosplay Summer Camp.

267
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:18,097
And besides, even if I was interested,

268
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,182
Florian wouldn't be.

269
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:24,061
He hates athletes,
and my thighs are tree trunks.

270
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,771
Come on, let me help you.

271
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,357
Thank you, but no thank you.

272
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,234
- I'll see you guys later.
- Peace, man.

273
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,114
Are you smiling?
Smile properly.

274
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,448
- I said, smile.
- Ow!

275
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,703
Smile.

276
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:47,376
I've gotta go.

277
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,097
What did I do now?

278
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:05,060
Professor Lee suspects
Dae wrote your summer reading essay.

279
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,354
He's my tutor. He just helped.

280
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,189
I want your credit card.

281
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,900
What does this have to do
with my credit card?

282
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,944
No money, no access to trouble.

283
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,238
We've let you run wild for too long.

284
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,240
Jetting off to the DJ festivals,

285
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:21,118
your face in the tabloids
that Juliana employs.

286
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,578
Juliana's gone.

287
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:35,591
Whatever. Just tell me what I need to do
to get my credit card back.

288
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,427
What's so important
that you need to buy this minute?

289
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:40,636
Nothing.

290
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:44,516
Just...

291
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:48,395
You promised I could go
to that New Year's festival in Iceland.

292
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:53,567
We can revisit Iceland
when and if your behavior improves.

293
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,820
So if this festival
is that important to you,

294
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,822
don't mess up.

295
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:04,870
Yuri...

296
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,835
this is for your well-being too.

297
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,484
<i>Dae!</i>

298
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:40,906
Bora! What was the shoe brand you said
all your friends at school had?

299
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,491
<i>FILA Disruptors.</i>

300
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:44,534
I'll buy them for you.

301
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,578
I make a lot of money now.

302
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,373
<i>Really? You're the best.</i>

303
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:52,084
I'll call you again soon. Bye.

304
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,418
<i>Bye.</i>

305
00:20:58,298 --> 00:20:59,298
Yes!

306
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:10,435
- Congrats, Kitty. Right on time.
- Thank you.

307
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,813
I'm starting to figure this place out.

308
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,948
Can you please get out of my life?

309
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,784
Trust me, I don't wanna be
next to you either.

310
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,452
You need to go home.

311
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,162
Dae has made his position clear.

312
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,833
The longer you stay,
the more pathetic you look.

313
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,670
No pimply-faced playboy
tells me about my relationship.

314
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:39,256
I haven't had a blocked pore
in four years.

315
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:42,718
Oh, well, it looks like
one's coming in right here.

316
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,555
Are you supposed to be in this class?

317
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,851
Professor Finnerty,
I want a new lab partner.

318
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:53,478
Portland Stalker is in remedial classes.

319
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:56,981
No.

320
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:00,527
That's not true, and don't you dare
call me that name again.

321
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,155
You mean "Portland Stalker"?

322
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,075
That's the unfortunate thing
about nicknames.

323
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,535
They tend to stick.

324
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,080
I suppose that's true...

325
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:13,915
Poopy Baby.

326
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,338
- What did you just call me?
- You heard me.

327
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,845
It's him.

328
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:30,432
Okay, okay. That's fine.

329
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,727
Everybody can pick
their own lab partners, but quickly.

330
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,562
Chemistry doesn't do itself.

331
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:38,981
Hi there.

332
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,861
Hey, Eunice.

333
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,447
Min Ho just said
he wants you to be his new lab partner.

334
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:51,286
- Um, what are you doing?
- My thing.

335
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:56,665
Hello.

336
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,259
Hi. It's Florian, right?

337
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,928
<i>Oui. </i>Hi.

338
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:10,388
I should probably apologize in advance.

339
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,557
It seems as if
the American educational system

340
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,643
isn't as exceptional
as I was led to believe.

341
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,521
I totally understand if you decide
to do all the labs for us.

342
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:22,109
I would never forgive myself
if you failed this class because of me.

343
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,154
What anguish.

344
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:33,328
Anyone sitting here?

345
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:37,749
- Hi.
- Hey.

346
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:43,296
Now this is chemistry.

347
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:45,464
What's up?

348
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,730
Hi. I'm here for tutoring.

349
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,190
Katherine Song Covey.

350
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,609
Yes. Wait right here.

351
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,165
<i>I bet Mom stood here.</i>

352
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,131
<i>So much history.</i>

353
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:30,969
<i>Mom.</i>

354
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:36,057
<i>You found your place here, Mom.</i>

355
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,559
<i>Hopefully, I will too.</i>

356
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:43,231
<i>I wonder if one of these debate dudes
could have been your mystery boyfriend.</i>

357
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,315
Katherine?

358
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:47,068
This is your tutor, Dae.

359
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,739
Dae, this is Katherine,
a student from America.

360
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:53,616
Hello.

361
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:55,534
Hi.

362
00:24:56,453 --> 00:25:00,290
<i>♪ Mommy, Daddy, cheer up! ♪</i>

363
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,500
<i>♪ Mommy, Daddy, I love you! ♪</i>

364
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,378
Oh, my God. Min Ho is the Poopy Baby?

365
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,797
Yeah, Kitty let it slip in chem.

366
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,341
How does she know?

367
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:11,718
I guess Dae told her.

368
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:18,850
I gotta go.

369
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,228
Yuri!

370
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,898
Can you go over this part again?

371
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,483
- I don't really get it.
- Yeah.

372
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:30,445
If you want to do this,
you can't go right over to here.

373
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:33,448
- You should always do 30.
- Right.

374
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,701
Finally, she left.

375
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:39,829
- There's so much I want to say.
- Me too.

376
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:43,375
If it makes it any easier,
I know what you were trying to tell me.

377
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,585
- Okay, great, because...
- Dae, there you are.

378
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,462
Have you heard?

379
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:49,339
Someone outed Min Ho as the Poopy Baby,

380
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:51,758
- and now it's all over school.
- What?

381
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:54,261
He told a close friend
he thought he could trust,

382
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,972
and that person blabbed
to the whole school.

383
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:03,561
I guess you got to be careful
who you share your secrets with.

384
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:06,690
Bye, baby.

385
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,151
NDA.

386
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:16,241
Well, that was something.

387
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:20,787
I mean, your girlfriend is intense.

388
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,707
I can't believe you told Min Ho
about Poopy Baby.

389
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,584
Sorry, but Min Ho was being such a jerk,

390
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:29,337
and if it was a big secret,
you shouldn't have told me.

391
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:33,675
Yeah, I definitely shouldn't have.

392
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,052
Dae, I'm sorry.

393
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,431
This isn't gonna work.

394
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,349
What?

395
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,311
What isn't gonna work?

396
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:45,437
Me and you.

397
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:48,565
I'm sorry.

398
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:54,195
Why'd you tell me to stay this morning
if you were gonna break up with me?

399
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,114
Because I still care about you.

400
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,950
You are my best friend.

401
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:06,916
I'll stop by the tutoring office tomorrow
and tell them to assign a new tutor.

402
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,335
- But, Dae...
- I'm sorry.

403
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,128
I really am.

404
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,547
But I'm with Yuri now.

405
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:17,385
But it isn't real, right?

406
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,057
It is real.

407
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,958
<i>He was wearing it this whole time?</i>

408
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:53,338
<i>He kept this close to his heart.</i>

409
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,383
<i>So why is he breaking mine now?</i>

410
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,358
Sorry.

411
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,652
I thought you were Dae.

412
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:18,279
Yeah, I heard.

413
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:21,907
You doing okay?

414
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:23,867
Nope.

415
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:27,080
But I'm not going to cry,

416
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:30,291
because I cannot have
puffy eyes for this photo.

417
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,627
It's a Covey family tradition
that my mom started,

418
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,254
and I'm here for her.

419
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,300
Here, I'll take it.

420
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,593
Thanks.

421
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:49,519
So Florian followed me on Instagram today.

422
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,438
- Really?
- Oh, shoot.

423
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,235
This fell out.

424
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,448
Aw, baby bracelet.

425
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:05,535
- I didn't know you were born in Korea.
- I wasn't.

426
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,290
That's my mom's name.

427
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:11,875
In Korean.

428
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,586
August 12th, 1993.

429
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,007
Oh, my God.

430
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:20,841
What?

431
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,344
Oh, my God!

432
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,054
Oh, my God, Kitty, what?

433
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,389
I think...

434
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:30,727
I think my mom had a baby here.
