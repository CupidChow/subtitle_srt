1
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:18,685
I have feelings for somebody else.

2
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:20,352
I knew it.

3
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,355
I'm gonna kill him.

4
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:30,988
Whoa.

5
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:34,868
Dae, stop! Wait!

6
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:36,745
You call yourself my friend?

7
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:38,931
- What are you talking about?
- Don't pretend like you don't know!

8
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:41,541
What are you doing? Let go.

9
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:44,210
Dae, stop.
Stop it, it's not Min Ho.

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,630
This has nothing to do with him.

11
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,180
Sorry. I thought you two...

12
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:56,598
And I think...

13
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,642
you two were better off as pen pals.

14
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,897
Deep down, she probably thinks so too.

15
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,226
What did he say?

16
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,401
Nothing.

17
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,822
Dae, I'm sorry.

18
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:16,159
I didn't think that I could feel
something for somebody else.

19
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,243
So don't.

20
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:18,912
I tried,

21
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:20,704
Dae.

22
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,083
I really, really tried.

23
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,002
Who is it?

24
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,424
It's Yuri.

25
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,177
Yuri?

26
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:40,558
- How could it be Yuri?
- I don't know.

27
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,142
It just...

28
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,145
Just happened.

29
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,440
I... When? When did you start liking her?

30
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,695
The night of Min Ho's party.

31
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:53,779
That long ago?

32
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,033
Then why did you even
get back together with me?

33
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:01,121
How could I not?
Dae, I came here to be with you.

34
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,414
- But now you suddenly like girls.
- No.

35
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,670
I guess, but I like boys too.

36
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:11,840
It's a lot to understand. I know that. I...

37
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:15,343
- I'm barely understanding it myself...
- Kitty, stop. Just...

38
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,347
I can't do this right now.

39
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,269
No, I can't do this ever.

40
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,073
You're my son?

41
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,491
Yes.

42
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,289
- How?
- Daniel, I'm sorry.

43
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,959
I didn't tell you
because I didn't wanna hold you back.

44
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:52,463
You had that opportunity
to study music in the States and I...

45
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,469
I didn't want you to give up
your whole future because of me.

46
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,889
Give up what? Being a rock star?

47
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,600
Like that was ever gonna happen.

48
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,728
I heard you sing. You're really good.

49
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,271
You are really good.

50
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:14,569
I hope you can believe that
I only ever wanted the best for you.

51
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,783
Alex.

52
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,203
Can you and I go somewhere and talk?

53
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,708
I'd like that. Yeah.

54
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:29,791
Wait.

55
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,586
Can we all talk?

56
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:35,131
- I am too angry to talk to you right now.
- I know.

57
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:37,467
Even more reason to talk.

58
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,639
Please, Daniel.

59
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:10,208
<i>- Honey, are you okay?</i>
- No.

60
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:15,338
I'll get on the next flight.
Where's my passport? Tree, get up.

61
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:18,258
No, Dad, it's not an emergency.
Don't wake up Trina.

62
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,343
Tree, go back to sleep.

63
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,682
What's wrong, honey?

64
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,684
<i>I got in a fight with Dae.</i>

65
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:34,023
Because I have feelings
for my friend Yuri, who's a girl.

66
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,609
Oh. Oh, thank God.

67
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:43,324
Thank God I'm bi? Or pan? Or fluid?

68
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:48,079
Whatever pan or fluid is,
thank God you're safe and healthy.

69
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:52,166
I'm safe and I'm healthy but...

70
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,544
I'm also sad, Dad.

71
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,463
And I'm really, really confused.

72
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:01,134
<i>Well, that sounds about right
for a 17-year-old</i>

73
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:04,137
<i>abroad for her junior year of high school.</i>

74
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,472
I'm sorry to hear you so down, Kitten,

75
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,183
but you're one of
the strongest people I know.

76
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,686
Well, I don't feel very strong right now.

77
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:13,104
<i>Well, you are.</i>

78
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,355
Just like your mom.

79
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:18,609
And sadness and confusion,
that's just part of growing up.

80
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,070
You certainly sound like you're growing.

81
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,157
I might also be failing all of my classes.

82
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,908
All of them?

83
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,286
Okay. All right, that's...

84
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,288
Look, besides school work,

85
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:33,791
is there anything else important
that you learned there?

86
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,339
I learned that mom
had infinite love to give.

87
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,966
<i>Her time here might have been short,</i>

88
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,595
but she made a really big impact
on people's lives.

89
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,929
<i>You went to find her.</i>

90
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:50,016
You found yourself.
You did what you wanted to do.

91
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,060
Honey, I'm proud of you.

92
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,561
Thanks, Dad.

93
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,029
Hey.

94
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,617
Why the big suitcase?

95
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,411
It's only winter break,
you can leave some stuff here.

96
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,997
Just expecting the worst.

97
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:16,751
Look, I know things seem bad right now
but tomorrow will be better.

98
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:19,087
You're gonna pass your finals,
you'll talk to Dae.

99
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,464
You'll work it out.

100
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,926
The thing is, I don't even know
how I want it to work out.

101
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,013
I hate that I hurt him.

102
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:34,310
But I have feelings for Yuri
and they're not going away.

103
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,773
She is still ignoring all of my texts.

104
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,486
Maybe I don't know anything about love.

105
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:50,159
Hey, remember when you came here
and your lips were still virgin?

106
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:54,664
Never touched another person's
or even had a sip of soju.

107
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:58,876
Coming to Korea
has opened me up in a lot of ways.

108
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,672
- If I fail out now...
- You won't.

109
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,717
Because I need my matchmaker here.

110
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,973
I'm retiring. Too old for this shit.

111
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:15,226
All right, enough of that.
Let's go make you some night-night tea.

112
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,018
Extra honey.

113
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:21,023
Well, at least I made one good match here.

114
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,358
You and Florian.

115
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,819
Yeah, about that.

116
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:27,405
I thought Florian
might have been cheating on me.

117
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,950
It turns out he was just cheating.

118
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,410
What are you talking about?

119
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:37,290
He got so caught up in our relationship
that he fell behind in his studies.

120
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:38,541
Been there.

121
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,585
Except it's more complicated than that.

122
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:44,922
His mom wants him to go back to Greece
and his dad wants him in France.

123
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:50,511
- They're fighting over him in the divorce.
- Okay. Not been there. Wow.

124
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:53,181
And he begged them to stay here
and they agreed,

125
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,893
so long as he kept his grades up,
but because of me...

126
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,896
he kind of forgot to study.

127
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,232
So he met up
with an old KISS student and...

128
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,277
bought some tests off of him.

129
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,447
Wait, Florian cheated on finals?

130
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,742
I mean, it's kind of romantic.
Don't you think?

131
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,620
He did it to stay here, with me.

132
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,371
I don't know if that's romantic.

133
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:20,583
It's kind of rude, especially when
everyone else is studying so hard.

134
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,751
Okay. Judgey.

135
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,794
I mean, I don't love it, but...

136
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,588
- I love him.
- Just saying.

137
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,174
- It feels yucky that he did that.
- Okay, hold on.

138
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:32,094
Dae and Yuri lied to you and made you feel
crazy for months and you forgave them.

139
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,972
So why are you all high and mighty
about not forgiving Florian

140
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,682
when all he did was cheat on tests?

141
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,602
- Which doesn't hurt anybody.
- Honestly, it shows bad character.

142
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,103
I don't want you to get hurt.

143
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,606
So, you're being hypocritical
about morality for my sake?

144
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:44,732
Yes, because I care.

145
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,318
You don't deserve this night-night tea.

146
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,049
What are you doing?

147
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,801
Watching you sleep.

148
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,095
It's creepy.

149
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:16,305
It's not, it's maternal.

150
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:20,393
You saying that word is also creepy.

151
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:25,565
I used to watch you sleep
all the time when you were a baby.

152
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,024
Why?

153
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:30,736
To make sure you were breathing
and comfortable and safe.

154
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,281
I never stopped
wanting those things for you.

155
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:37,159
I just went about
watching over you in the wrong way.

156
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:43,457
I don't wanna look back on my life
when I'm 50 and be filled with regrets.

157
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,459
I am not 50.

158
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,216
I don't regret having a baby.

159
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,013
I regret how I handled it afterwards.

160
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:02,852
I called Alex and invited him
to spend some time with us this holiday.

161
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:08,482
And also, I contacted Juliana's parents.

162
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,693
We discussed the...

163
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,613
You can say it out loud.

164
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,323
Your relationship.

165
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:20,244
And came to the conclusion
that we want our daughters to be happy.

166
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,539
As much as teenagers can be happy.

167
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:27,335
Juliana is on her way back here.

168
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:31,589
- Her flight arrives this evening.
- Oh, my God! Thank you.

169
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,133
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

170
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,304
Oh, wait. What about dad?
What will he say?

171
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:39,387
I don't know.

172
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,016
And frankly, I'm tired of caring.

173
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,394
You deserve to be happy too, Mom.

174
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:01,118
The grades are up! The grades are up!

175
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:11,962
You took the top spot.

176
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:13,964
Oh, my God, I'm staying.

177
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,802
You took Dae's spot.

178
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:23,974
- Uh, I really didn't mean to, Q.
- No, but you did.

179
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:28,062
Dae's my best friend.
This is really messed up.

180
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,148
Q! What does it say?!

181
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,236
You passed!
You're staying another semester.

182
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,365
- Wait, I'm still mad at you.
- Yeah, I'm still mad at you too.

183
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,663
- What is she doing here?
- Does she live in this dorm?

184
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,249
Katherine Song Covey.

185
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,377
What are you doing here
this early in the morning?

186
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,171
Are you wearing pajamas?

187
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,267
Hello. Hi.

188
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:12,440
I'm not really sure what you're saying
but if I could just say this one thing,

189
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,483
I have been living in the boys' dorm.

190
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,568
Okay, I admit it.

191
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,903
But the roommate that you put me with,

192
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,739
she had a 24-hour webcam
going at all times

193
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:24,493
and she put her tissues everywhere.

194
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,579
One time it was even on my pillow.

195
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,540
- Ooh.
- Thank you.

196
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,210
So furthermore,
if I'm going to get in trouble...

197
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,294
Kitty.

198
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:37,465
This is not about you getting in trouble.

199
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:41,302
It's about you getting expelled.

200
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,556
Expelled? But...

201
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,309
But I passed all of my classes.

202
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:49,977
We know.

203
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:54,148
But with your specific scholarship,
there are clear rules about conduct,

204
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,611
and by living in the boys' dorms,
you broke the rules.

205
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:04,283
I'm sorry,
but you will not be asked back to KISS.

206
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,171
This is my last meal.

207
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,341
You're getting kicked out,
you're not on death row.

208
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:23,844
And I don't know how you can eat something
that spicy this early in the day.

209
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,930
Madison, focus.

210
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,848
Everyone else is mad at me right now.

211
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,100
So, Madison, this is all on you.

212
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:34,647
You need to be my hype man
and convince me that I can fight this.

213
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,730
Okay.

214
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,192
That I can plead my case

215
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,945
and prove to the people at the school
that I belong here.

216
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,028
You do.

217
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,990
That I deserve another chance!

218
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:53,082
They say go big or go home, right?
I might be doing both.

219
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,833
Oh.

220
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,841
Professors, fellow students...

221
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,594
Principal Lim.

222
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,305
Whoo!

223
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,476
KISS has meant more to me

224
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,647
than I could ever express
standing on top of this table.

225
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,403
But I'm gonna try.

226
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,784
It's where I learned about my mom.

227
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,037
I found her favorite tree.

228
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:37,376
She loved it even when it wasn't in bloom
because somehow...

229
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,838
she always saw the beauty in things.

230
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,965
Even when they weren't at their best.

231
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,844
I learned that she could play guitar.

232
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,720
And...

233
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:57,896
Hey.

234
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,025
Do you want to get down from there?

235
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,994
I might have been raised by white people

236
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:17,166
but I do know that it's frowned upon
to put your feet where you eat in Korea.

237
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,378
This is a plot twist.

238
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,339
Now I'm the one who's leaving.

239
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,508
I can't believe
that you lived in that dorm

240
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,844
right under my nose the whole time.

241
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,263
Professor Lee was right.

242
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,140
I do suck at being an authority figure.

243
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,768
You're good at other stuff.

244
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,355
I'm really gonna miss you.

245
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,232
I mean, there's always KakaoTalk.

246
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,694
Yeah, but no calls from nightclubs.

247
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,489
At least until you're 21.

248
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,323
Fair.

249
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,918
- Did you use my buckwheat hand cream?
- No.

250
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:10,010
- Did you take my anti-aging serum?
- No. Get out.

251
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,183
- Did you take his serum?
- No.

252
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:19,061
But I did use his buckwheat hand cream.

253
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,150
I'm really sorry.

254
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,152
About before.

255
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,530
I'm really sorry too.

256
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,324
What Florian did was so messed up.

257
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,496
And now I have to figure out
what to do about it.

258
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:43,460
It's hard to just turn your feelings off
for someone you care about.

259
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:45,628
I get it.

260
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:54,054
I can't believe
you're really not coming back.

261
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:56,472
I know.

262
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,603
I'm gonna miss you most of all, roomie.

263
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,524
Stop trying to make me cry, you witch.

264
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,322
Well, I'm out.

265
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,491
Cheers, dude.
I'll see you after the break.

266
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,660
Bye, Kitty. Be good.

267
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,833
Maybe he doesn't realize
I'm not coming back.

268
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,460
He knows, he's just...

269
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,086
Min Ho.

270
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,987
I liked your speech in the cafeteria.

271
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,655
- You did?
- Yes.

272
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,116
Then why did you walk out?

273
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,869
I'm the head of the school.

274
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,371
I can't let anyone see me cry.

275
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,751
You're so much like your mother.

276
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,754
She never backed down
when she believed in something.

277
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,967
- Thank you.
- I have something for you.

278
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:17,346
Your mom sent this to me
after she got back home

279
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,889
and I never responded.

280
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,850
I wish I had.

281
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:38,242
I have something for you too.
If you want it.

282
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,787
Oh, my tape.

283
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,205
Oh!

284
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:50,462
Daniel, Professor Lee,
made this for me after our first date.

285
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,549
I downloaded all the songs
when I thought it was for my mom

286
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:57,052
and Daniel has some
very cool taste in music.

287
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,891
This wasn't meant to make you sad.

288
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,937
No, it's nostalgia.

289
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,189
Sad and happy all at once.

290
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,527
Daniel was my first love.

291
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,738
And no matter how much time passes...

292
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,492
that stays the same.

293
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,870
I think I can understand that.

294
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,643
So you didn't get first...

295
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,730
but second's pretty good, right?

296
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:52,357
No, it's not, at all.

297
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:57,654
If I'm not first in class,
I lose my room and board scholarship.

298
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,198
I'm so sorry.

299
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:01,950
Oh, Kitty.

300
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,327
Kitty...

301
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,751
She passed.

302
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:11,835
Mm-hm.

303
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,086
She can stay.

304
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,840
I can't imagine this place
without her now.

305
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,182
I need to tell her everything
that I was too mad to tell her yesterday.

306
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,185
I'm gonna fight for her.

307
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,564
Right, so about that...

308
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,155
I promise she did
wanna say goodbye in person

309
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,032
but then she had to go to the airport.

310
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,493
She left this for you.

311
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,792
I'll, uh, give you some alone time.

312
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,865
<i>- Dae Heon?</i>
- Dad? I need your help.

313
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,632
I don't think we'll make it in time.

314
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,759
We should just give up.

315
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,470
The Kims don't give up.

316
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,807
Hold tight!

317
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:03,697

328
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:02,089
I don't regret anything
with the two of us.

329
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,425
I don't regret coming here.

330
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:08,595
I don't regret the last few years.

331
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:11,056
It was all worth it.

332
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:17,895
Dae.

333
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,481
For me...

334
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,693
you were the perfect first boyfriend.

335
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:27,655
Were?

336
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,873
Whatever happens in the future...

337
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:43,046
you will always be the first girl I loved.

338
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,468

343
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:35,640
Kitty.

344
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:38,935
I can't believe you're here.
What are you doing here?

345
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:45,567
Maybe it's a coincidence
or maybe it's fate, but you're here.

346
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:50,113
And I may never see you again
so I need to tell you this to your face.

347
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:57,245
Before I came to KISS, I thought I knew
everything there was to know about love.

348
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:01,458
But, then I met you.

349
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:03,710
Yuri!

350
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,756
Juliana!

351
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,258
You're here.

352
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,561
I missed you.

353
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:22,771
Oh, my God.

354
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:24,606
Oh!

355
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,275
Kitty was just here.

356
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,819
Yeah. I saw her. She left.

357
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:34,950
- Oh, I wanted to introduce you guys.
- Yuri, I'm not here to meet Kitty.

358
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,244
- I'm here for you.
- I know.

359
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,955
I've been waiting
for this moment for months.

360
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,374
I can't believe you're finally here.

361
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:46,503
But I do need
to make a phone call to my mom.

362
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:47,629
Real quick.

363
00:25:56,638 --> 00:26:00,350
Oh, Mom. Yeah. Juliana's here.

364
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,811
Everything's fine except...

365
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,563
I don't think you should expel Kitty.

366
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,900
Are you expelling the boys too?

367
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,737
<i>My time at KISS definitely
wasn't what I thought it would be.</i>

368
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,406
<i>It was so much more.</i>

369
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,992
<i>I made so many new friends.</i>

370
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,328
<i>Friends that I know
I'll keep a whole lifetime.</i>

371
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:24,499
<i>I learned, I grew up, I expanded.</i>

372
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:26,793
<i>My world got so much bigger.</i>

373
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,714
<i>Because of you. And because of Simon.</i>

374
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,133
Simon?

375
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,135
Who's Simon?

376
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,721
So I was right.

377
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:40,640
Mom had another first love
that wasn't Dad?

378
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,401
- What are you doing here?
- On this plane?

379
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,321
Or in coach?

380
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:56,698
Both.

381
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,160
I'm on this plane
because I'm going to see my mom in L.A.

382
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,621
I'm in coach because...

383
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,876
I thought maybe you could use a friend.

384
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,131
And I thought you didn't even
care enough to say goodbye.

385
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,759
Um, who said I cared?

386
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,431
Oh, um...

387
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,517
Did you make up with Dae?

388
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:26,852
Yes.

389
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:32,525
We made up, but we also broke up.

390
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,320
I'm okay.

391
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:41,618
I mean, we were only pen pals.

392
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:50,502
I'm always gonna care about him,
but it was time.

393
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:55,464
Yeah?

394
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:57,841
Yeah.

395
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,016
Kitty, I need to tell you something.

396
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,268
Is that my pores
are finally better

397
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,952
because I've stolen your cleansing balm?

398
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,020
Kitty.

399
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,567
I think I fell in love with you.

400
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,072
A little bit.

401
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:21,782
Or...

402
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,700
a lot.
