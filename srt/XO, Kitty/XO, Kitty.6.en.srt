1
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:26,443
God. Min Ho, can you at least
put a shirt on when I'm eating?

2
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:30,113
Hey, it's not my fault
you can't handle this.

3
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:44,711
You're right.

4
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,464
I can't handle it.

5
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:50,925
I'm right?

6
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,811
You're too bloody hot.

7
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,949
<i>♪ I'll change your mind, ay ♪</i>

8
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,328
<i>♪ You'll not waste my time ♪</i>

9
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,704
<i>♪ Yeah... ♪</i>

10
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:27,962
Oh, my God.

11
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,725
Alex! Wait!

12
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:44,646
Are you okay?

13
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:48,149
I was worried that something bad might
have happened since the text silence.

14
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:52,320
No. Yeah, it's all good.
Just had a lot going on, you know?

15
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,322
Iguana's run loose in the Italians' dorm,

16
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:57,742
and I'm afraid it's gonna get turned
into a belt if I don't find it soon.

17
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,745
Plus, a lot of midterm prep.
I hope you've been studying.

18
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:04,582
I have, but I've also been busy
trying to figure out

19
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,335
what my mom ever saw in Korean Snape.

20
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:10,380
Kitty, you really need
to focus on studying.

21
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,216
- And Professor Snape was good in the end.
- Right.

22
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:16,344
But what if we go talk to him, right?

23
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:19,764
- Get to know him and figure him out.
- Not now.

24
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:23,309
Why? His house is literally right here.
We can go together.

25
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,520
It's the whole reason
you came here to teach.

26
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:28,148
I came here to learn about him,
to get to know him,

27
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,025
to see if I want a relationship with him.

28
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:35,780
I love my dad. The dad who raised me.
I don't need to rush into this.

29
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:37,782
I get it.

30
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:42,162
But I know some people that you'll
definitely wanna have a relationship with.

31
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:46,749
My sisters. Our sisters.
I was thinking we could FaceTime them.

32
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,960
Margot might be frosty at first,
but when she...

33
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:52,172
Kitty, we can't just
upend everyone's lives.

34
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,549
- What if we're wrong?
- Well, what if we're right?

35
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:57,302
- Then we'll be enhancing everyone's lives.
- Stop.

36
00:02:57,385 --> 00:03:00,972
I know you're just trying to help,
but not everyone's on your timetable.

37
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:07,520
I have tests to organize,
and you have tests to study for.

38
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:17,655
<i>Don't give up. This is for Mom.
You haven't lost the battle yet.</i>

39
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,410
I just wanted to talk to him,

40
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:25,747
and then Alex said
that not everybody's on my timetable.

41
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,207
So now I'm just wondering
about Professor Lee and...

42
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:32,211
How about, instead of fixating
on all this Alex drama,

43
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:36,507
we concentrate on what you are gonna wear
to Min Ho's Madness Party?

44
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,509
- I'm not going.
- What?

45
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,637
Why? It's the event of the year.

46
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,931
Because Dae and Yuri
will probably be there.

47
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,933
Yuri will be there. She's DJing.

48
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,810
But Dae never goes to these things
so you don't have to worry.

49
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,855
I'm not worried.
I don't care to spend time with somebody

50
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,857
who can't acknowledge
a meaningful gesture.

51
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,025
Here we go.

52
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:56,319
He didn't even say "thank you"
for the necklace.

53
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,196
Not even an emoji.

54
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:01,574
That necklace was my mom's.
I gave it to Dae when his mom died.

55
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,911
Okay. While I would love to sit here
and talk about this again,

56
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,122
I'd rather shove scissors in my ears.

57
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,207
Yeah.

58
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,960
Seriously, this whole week,
all I've been hearing is,

59
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:16,339
"Dae, necklace, Yuri, Alex,
necklace, Alex, Yuri, Dae, necklace."

60
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:20,760
You're like a robot that's malfunctioning,
stuck on a loop.

61
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:25,348
And you came here to have
new experiences and live your life.

62
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,475
You know what Min Ho's Madness Party is?

63
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,311
A new experience.

64
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:35,733
Ugh. God, I can't believe I was just
about to stay in on a Friday night,

65
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,235
pouting about a boy.

66
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,904
- Yeah.
- Oh, no.

67
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,031
I'm turning into LJ.

68
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,950
Sure.

69
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,540
Okay, but tonight we're gonna
go out into the great big world

70
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,125
and be a new kind of Kitty.

71
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,711
New kind of Kitty who...?

72
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,505
Who'll find someone to kiss?

73
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,509
Well, I always thought
Dae would be my first kiss,

74
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:04,345
and now he's the only boy
in the world who can't be.

75
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,557
I know, I know,
but think of all the possibilities.

76
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,728
Seriously.
Use that matchmaker skill on yourself.

77
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:12,812
Switch it up.

78
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,439
Okay.

79
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,484
I could kiss somebody tonight.

80
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,780
Yeah! I will kiss somebody tonight.

81
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,115
Yes, girl.

82
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,377
Wow. Aren't you meeting Dae tonight?

83
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,713
Yeah. I'm heading out now.

84
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:44,135
Dinner, probably a movie.
Don't worry, I won't be back crazy late.

85
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,721
I never worry when you're with Dae.

86
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:49,474
You two really
bring out the best in each other.

87
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,809
- Mom.
- Your grades are up.

88
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,020
You're not getting into any trouble.

89
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,272
I'm proud of you.

90
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,901
But most of all...

91
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,488
I'm happy you're happy.

92
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,157
Have a good time.

93
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:18,992
Is something wrong?

94
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,882
My mom seems to think I'm very happy.

95
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,010
Even though this is
the worst I've ever felt.

96
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,597
Things are working out as planned, but...

97
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,974
She doesn't know you very well.

98
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:39,690
Ugh, it'll be weird DJing without Juliana
for the first time today.

99
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,443
I'll cheer you on.

100
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:48,032
And you have to do the same for me.
I've never been to one of these before.

101
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,576
A "rager" -type place.

102
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:57,834
That's what Altan calls it.
I wouldn't know, I've never raged before.

103
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,670
Don't worry. They're not much.

104
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,486
This place is so big.

105
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,281
And so loud!

106
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,241
Yes, that's the point!

107
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,618
Loosen up for once, Dae.

108
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,204
I rented the whole place out for us.

109
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,499
My rules, my guest list.

110
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,709
Really?

111
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,673
I mean, how did she get in?

112
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,646
<i>♪ Walk in like a boss

No, no, no. Oh, my eyes!
It's like looking directly into the sun.

127
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,732
- Oh, my God.
- You look so good.

128
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:50,571
Are you wearing athleisure?
To<i> the</i> event of the year?

129
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:54,158
I need to go over the dress code
with the doorman.

130
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,548
I told you
everyone was gonna lose their mind.

131
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,136
Dae is here.

132
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:21,561
<i>Oh, God. Why does he look so good?</i>

133
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,230
<i>Why is he walking towards me?</i>

134
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,942
<i>Why do I still care so much?</i>

135
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,112
<i>He even smells good from here.</i>

136
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,950
Nope. I am here to meet a new boy to kiss.

137
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,120
What are you doing?

138
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:43,082
I'm getting ready to get this whole
"meeting new people" thing started.

139
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:46,836
Never actually had alcohol before,
but liquid courage, right?

140
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,422
There's actually no alcohol in these.

141
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:50,715
Mocktails only.

142
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:54,552
Underage drinking in Korea, huge no-no.
People get canceled for that.

143
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,178
Well, lucky for us...

144
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,055
I'm French.

145
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,433
Thank you.

146
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,730
To new experiences.

147
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:06,856
Let's do this.

148
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,986
Kitty, you look amazing...

149
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,069
Sorry.

150
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,952
<i>Too frowny.</i>

151
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,496
<i>Not my speed.</i>

152
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:25,458
<i>Hmm, maybe?</i>

153
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:34,133
Hi. I see your eyeballs.
You are boy shopping.

154
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,844
- I love this vibe for you.
- I'm having the best time.

155
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,928
Me too.

156
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,692
This is exactly what I needed.

157
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,265
Like an escape from family drama

158
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:44,185
- and stupid school pressure...
- Stupid school, yes.

159
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:47,146
It's like, why is school
so hard all of a sudden?

160
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,272
- I have no idea.
- Here.

161
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,399
- Mm-hm.
- Thank you.

162
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,860
So pretty.

163
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,361
Thank you.

164
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,498
- No. No.
- No, no, no.

165
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,042
- Oh, no? Okay. Okay.
- No, no. Let's go.

166
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,377
- Immediately.
- He's weird.

167
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:22,889
<i>He's cute.</i>

168
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,437
<i>And he's taken.</i>

169
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,272
<i>I used to be taken.</i>

170
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:37,238
<i>And I found out he's a cheating,
lying A-hole who can't even say thank you.</i>

171
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,328
Kitty, wait.

172
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,037
Thank you.

173
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,167
Thanks again.

174
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:53,671
Man who knows how to say "thank you."
I like it.

175
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,257
I'm Geon.

176
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:57,883
Kitty.

177
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,093
Nice to meet you.

178
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:10,062
It's an honor.
The hottest girl in here is talking to me.

179
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,524
You think the Portland Stalker
is attractive?

180
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,526
Don't call yourself that.

181
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,445
It's actually kind of growing on me.

182
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,700
Hey, I don't like to judge
until I've properly met someone.

183
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:26,620
Now that I have,
I'm certain those rumors were all lies.

184
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,581
Oh, tell me more.

185
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,002
There's no way
any guy leaves you for Yuri.

186
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:34,837
Oh, well...

187
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,256
Seriously, she's not even pretty.

188
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,342
And her nose is a little... not little.

189
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,469
That's not nice.

190
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,722
Girls like Yuri are just overcompensating.
But you?

191
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,851
You're gorgeous and smart.

192
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:52,438
You think talking bad about Yuri
scores you points with me?

193
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:53,521
Well...

194
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:58,152
that don't impress me much.

195
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:04,033
Seriously?
Is Shania Twain just not a thing here?

196
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,953
God, where is Q when you need him?
Whatever!

197
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,955
Yuri and I may not be friends,

198
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,124
but who are you
to talk about her like that?

199
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,503
Women are not just here
for your judging pleasure.

200
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:19,507
Also, FYI, I have seen Yuri up close

201
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,927
and I can confidently tell you
her nose is annoyingly perfect.

202
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:25,970
Jerk.

203
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,184
I was just saying I'm on your side.

204
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:42,363
<i>L-O-V-E, guys. It's "love."</i>

205
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:48,452
All I ask for is one night to myself
to work on my own love life,

206
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,580
but no, here I am, on the clock.

207
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,084
Sorry, are you talking to me?

208
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,794
To both of you.

209
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,048
You have what each other needs.
Talk amongst yourselves.

210
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,426
You do have what I need.

I know you've never been
to a party like this before, but...

230
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:12,995
Come on.

231
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,288
I...

232
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:15,706
Get over here!

233
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:19,667
Okay, dance!

234
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,587
No, I'm out.

235
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,171
Watch me.

236
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,550
No. I'm never gonna do that.

237
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,260
You're at a party.

238
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,012
Like this.

239
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,848
Yeah, that's it.

240
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,231
Whoa. Yeah, yeah, yeah!

241
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,401
Whoa. What is this?

242
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,739
What is this? How are you so good?

243
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,370
Why are you smiling so much?

244
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,414
Because I like you.

245
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,251
No. Don't be like that.

246
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,296
No, no, not like that.

247
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,967
I just meant thanks for bringing me here

248
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,136
and helping me have fun
and take my mind off things.

249
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,180
That's why I like you.

250
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:15,723
As a friend.

251
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,642
Okay.

252
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,024
Kitty!

253
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,240
Kitty! Kitty!

254
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,202
<i>Do not show weakness.
Give him bitch face.</i>

255
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,329
- Hey.
- Hey.

256
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,289
- How are we doing?
- Amazing.

257
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,624
I made some matches.

258
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,127
And now
I'm going to perform the ultimate trick

259
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:48,340
and match myself with somebody
who knows how to say "thank you."

260
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,550
- What?
- Okay.

261
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,802
- Time we slow you down and get some water.
- Yes.

262
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:54,138
No. No. I've only had 13.

263
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,431
Thirteen drinks?

264
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,515
Sips.

265
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,517
Thirteen sips.

266
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,437
Not that it's any of your business.

267
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,190
I wanna dance. Let's dance.

268
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,859
- No. Enough.
- Let's dance.

269
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,153
Okay, Florian and I,
we're gonna go take a lap.

270
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:12,614
- I wanna dance. Dance right now.
- Kitty.

271
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,366
Can you give us a second?

272
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,579
Not everyone's on Kitty time.

273
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,707
You sound like Alex.

274
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,879
<i>Huh, calling Alex
is a really good idea right now.</i>

275
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:27,963
<i>Am I drunk?</i>

276
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,591
- Drink some water!
<i>- No, this is a good idea.</i>

277
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,346
Hello?

278
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:40,184
Hey, I just need to say this.

279
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:44,271
I'm sorry for meddling

280
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:48,317
and pushing and pestering.

281
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,071
I was just...
I was so excited to have a brother.

282
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:54,740
Brother.

283
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,784
"Bro-ther."

284
00:17:57,534 --> 00:18:00,788
It is such a funny word
when you say it so many times.

285
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:04,374
<i>The point is,
I'm getting over Dae tonight.</i>

286
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,043
<i>Am I hurt? Yes.</i>

287
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:09,880
<i>But just like my mom
got over the mystery man and found my dad,</i>

288
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,381
<i>I can do this.</i>

289
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:12,465
Kitty?

290
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,134
Are you okay?

291
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,887
I just wanted to apologize.

292
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:20,224
Beer?
This is not one of my London parties.

293
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:23,602
We are in Seoul,
meaning no underage drinking.

294
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:24,812
Give me that.

295
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:28,649
Kitty, are you at a party with alcohol?

296
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,400
I plead the Fifth!

297
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:33,445
We're not in the United States.
There is no Fifth.

298
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:37,157
<i>And it's way past your curfew,
and you're struggling with your grades.</i>

299
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:40,828
<i>- You could get in real trouble.</i>
- I cannot hear you very well.

300
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,663
Rubik rocks!

301
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,414
<i>Did he just say Rubik?</i>

302
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,166
Kitty? Hello?

303
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,251
<i>Alex?</i>

304
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,169
- Alex!
<i>- Kitty?</i>

305
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,004
<i>- Kitty!</i>
- Yeah, no, I cannot hear you.

306
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,924
I am going to text you instead.

307
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,007
Goodbye.

308
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:03,725
"You are awesome. My mom would agree.

309
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,311
And Eve Song knows who's awesome.

310
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,439
Apart from Professor Lee.

311
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:14,069
Now I need to go back to the party.

312
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:15,821
Bye...

313
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,072
yee."

314
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,784
I rhymed.

315
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:24,704
Hey there.

316
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,687
We have a problem.

317
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,648
Please don't make my night any worse.
I already have a headache.

318
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,193
There's a party. I don't know where.

319
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,493
I do.

320
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,706
A dinner and a movie, my ass.

321
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:13,086
I wanted to thank you
for helping me reflect

322
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,423
on how I talk about others,
especially women.

323
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,008
Thank you.

324
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,719
The fact that you're actually
thanking me for something

325
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:23,222
is a welcome change in my life.

326
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:26,849
Cheers.

327
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,310
Cheers.

328
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:32,731
Mm.

329
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,278
<i>I wanna kiss someone.</i>

330
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,739
<i>I'm ready to kiss someone.</i>

331
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,699
<i>I'm gonna kiss someone.</i>

332
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:43,783
Nope.

333
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:47,371
Remember how gross he seemed
before you were drunk?

334
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:54,211
Yeah, well, he hasn't changed that much
in the past hour.

335
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,463
Whatever.

336
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:05,013
You can do much better. Trust me.

337
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:10,560
Okay, snacks. Stat.

338
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,145
Eat this.

339
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,399
Drink...

340
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,734
this.

341
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,904
And then come watch my set.

342
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,366
<i>It's like she cares about me.</i>

343
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:29,079
<i>Am I really that drunk,
or is Yuri Han a good person?</i>

344
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:39,464
Everybody!

345
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,343
Everybody!

346
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,181
Everybody, get back to your dorms!

347
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,475
Alex. Thank God you're here.

348
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,645
- Help me stop these barbarians.
- You don't think I'm trying?

349
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:58,567
Last year, an idol's family was ruined
because of an underage drinking scandal.

350
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,069
I refuse to put my mother through that.

351
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,873
I'll take the left side,
you take the right.

352
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:03,904
Okay.

353
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:07,533
Yup.

354
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,121
Hey, guys.

355
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:16,585
Sorry to interrupt. Q, do you know
what I've done to upset Kitty?

356
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,755
You mean,
besides having another girlfriend

357
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,507
when she literally flew
across the world to be with you?

358
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,800
Yes, besides that.

359
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:27,346
It just feels like she suddenly
hates me more than ever and...

360
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,849
I really don't know what I did.

361
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:34,936
Dae, I really don't wanna
get involved in all this.

362
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,856
Dude, just give me a clue.

363
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:41,068
Come on, just help the poor kid out.

364
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:42,651
Yeah.

365
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,543
The necklace, Dae, the necklace.

366
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,130
<i>Titanic?</i>

367
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:04,882
What?

368
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,525
Kitty's heartbroken you didn't thank her

369
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,554
or even acknowledge
that she gave the necklace back to you.

370
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,516
Gave it back to me?

371
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:15,769
Yeah. On Chuseok.

372
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,646
It was delivered by messenger.

373
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:21,983
Welcome to the stage, Yuri!

374
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,992
On Chuseok.

375
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:43,130
Please collect your belongings
and make your way back to campus!

376
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,757
Please tell me you're not here as a guest,

377
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,844
but as a concerned teacher
trying to put an end to this mayhem.

378
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,721
That. Definitely that.

379
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:54,641
Uh, but don't worry,
I've almost got it shut down.

380
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,017
No, you don't.

381
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,853
They don't respect you.

382
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,940
Everyone, stop what you're doing!

383
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:06,987
We need to find the speakers
and unplug them.

384
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,238
Uh...

385
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,160
Get off the table.

386
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,021
I see the speakers.

387
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,314

394
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,234

395
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:30,904

396
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:32,822
Kitty.

397
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:36,368
- I think Yuri took the necklace.
- I know Yuri makes you breathless.

398
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:39,913
- No, I said...
- I get it now. You're in love with Yuri.

399
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:43,416
It broke my heart, but I don't blame you.

400
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,836
Okay. Everyone! Everyone! Every...

401
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,513
Hey, you.

402
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,143
It's okay to not want that.

403
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:06,189

it'd be nothing serious, just fun.

- I'm a little busy right now!
- Are you the one who took my necklace?

408
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,098
The one Kitty sent me on Chuseok.

409
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:46,313
For a minute I got it twisted.

410
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:49,482
I actually thought we were friends.

411
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,148
Your set last night was epic.

412
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,733
Thanks.

413
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,699
So, what are we gonna do
about all this tension?

414
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,911
Of hating each other?

415
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:46,164
I think that's wearing off.

416
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,043
No.

417
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,673
