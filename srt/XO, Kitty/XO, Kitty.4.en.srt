1
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:25,900
I'm very sorry
you were not assigned a proper dormitory.

2
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:27,110
That's okay.

3
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,612
Oversights like this
don't often happen at KISS.

4
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:33,074
I understand as a new student
it can be scary to speak up,

5
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:37,829
which is why Min Ho kindly alerted us
to your egregious rooming mishap.

6
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:40,707
Yes, he is so selfless.

7
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,710
I'm sure you and your assigned roommate
will become fast friends.

8
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:44,961
You can go.

9
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,129
Thank you.

10
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,262
What the...?

11
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,520
You can leave the food on the bed.

12
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,063
What?

13
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:07,150
You can leave the food on the bed.

14
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:11,613
I'm not food delivery.
I'm your new roommate.

15
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:12,781
Says who?

16
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,908
Says Professor Lee.

17
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,869
Well, you weren't here
at the start of classes,

18
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:22,207
so I don't want to hear anything
about "my side, your side."

19
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,836
Okay, well, it's kind of looking like
all your side right now.

20
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,549
Left! Left, left, left!

21
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:33,718
Ah!

22
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,303
Is that recording?

23
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:36,888
Oh! Oh!

24
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:39,015
It's working! It's working!

25
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,719
You can sleep when you're dead,
Miss Covey.

26
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,643
Please, you have to help me.

27
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:27,147
I understand that the living situation
may be a little bit difficult.

28
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:31,234
Professor Finnerty, have you ever seen
a Jenga tower of pizza boxes?

29
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:35,446
Have you ever smelled
a Jenga tower of pizza boxes?

30
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,116
- Actually...
- You are our resident advisor.

31
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,909
Isn't there anything you can do?

32
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,579
Sorry, Kitty, but the girls' dorm is full.

33
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:46,249
I can't sleep. I can't study.

34
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:49,002
I can't get the mozzarella
out of the carpet.

35
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,129
And I'll fail all of my classes.

36
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,131
There's always the library.

37
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:56,801
I believe you can make it work.

38
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,679
You've already survived
your first week of junior year.

39
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:05,977
I'm here if you need me.
And let's look at the bright side.

40
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,813
This living situation,
it could be a lot worse.

41
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:09,939
How?

42
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,066
Could be blue cheese.

43
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:17,739
I don't know.

44
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,824
It's a lot of bulging eyes
and rotting flesh.

45
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,993
Kitty, what? This is a classic.

46
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:25,747
You know who you should be
watching this with? Florian.

47
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,916
You guys are vibing!

48
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:32,045
I don't know. I mean,
I've been with plenty of guys before...

49
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:36,424
but I've never liked anyone this much.
It's making me nervous.

50
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,761
What if we get a group together tomorrow
for a binge party?

51
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:42,263
We'll invite Florian,
he'll get hooked on the show,

52
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,347
and you,

53
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:47,518
and start watching more episodes,
with fewer people, at night time.

54
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,272
- Just take it one step at a time.
- Yeah. Right.

55
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:55,193
Like how you flew across the world for Dae
without telling him.

56
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,946
Hey, if I hadn't, I wouldn't have met you.

57
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:02,492
And I wouldn't have discovered
I have a half-sibling somewhere in Korea.

58
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,785
You got me there.

59
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:09,123
What sucks is that
I can't tell Dae about any of this

60
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,501
because Yuri is always around.

61
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,379
I miss my best friend.

62
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:20,760
Well, I might know one place Dae will be
that Yuri definitely won't.

63
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,222
Nature. That girl's not outdoorsy,

64
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:27,475
and you're talking to the president
of KISS's Outdoors Club.

65
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,227
First hike is tomorrow.

66
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:36,148
You're hanging out today, right?

67
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,945
How about face masks and hot wings?

68
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,617
I really don't remember giving permission
to the Portland Stalker

69
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,577
to use my custom blend products.

70
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,181
She doesn't live here.
She doesn't even have a skincare routine!

71
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,665
Sorry, man. Gotta go.

72
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,042
We'll chat when I'm not busy.

73
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,836
Thanks! Great talk!

74
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,642
You're always busy. You're never around.

75
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,063
<i>My darling boy!</i>

76
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,649
Hi, Mom! You doing good?

77
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,860
<i>Yeah. Just about to head to set.</i>

78
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,403
Miss you.

79
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,905
<i>But since you're more important...</i>

80
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,240
<i>Should I tell them to wait?</i>

81
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,702
Mm. It's okay.

82
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,913
Let's just talk next time.

83
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,166
<i>Okay. Kisses!</i>

84
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:35,585
Mm.

85
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:51,934
Okay, so I'm off to the hike,
I'll just catch you later.

86
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,023
Q, wait.

87
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,150
Dae is coming to this hike, right?

88
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,485
Uh, yeah.

89
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:03,071
Maybe I'll come too.
I never get to talk to that guy.

90
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,947
What? No!

91
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,824
I mean, no.

92
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,243
Q, look at me.

93
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,578
I am looking at you.

94
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,914
- What are you not telling me?
- Nothing.

95
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,916
Dae is coming on the hike.

96
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,459
And?

97
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,504
And so is Kitty.

98
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,589
Not cool, bro.

99
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,174
Hey, there is no crime

100
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:26,010
in two of my friends
participating in my favorite club.

101
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:32,934
Know what?

102
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,024
Hey, guess what I found out.

103
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,528
All right, people, welcome
to KISS's Outdoors Club.

104
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,279
First rule of Outdoors Club:

105
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,657
please talk about Outdoors Club.

106
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,033
That would be very helpful

107
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,869
because we did lose
a few members this summer.

108
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,913
Lyme disease.

109
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,708
All right, let's get started
with some stretches.

110
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,710
- Sorry I'm late.
- Oh, hey.

111
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,632
<i>The plan is working.
Me and Dae, platonic.</i>

112
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,346
Kitty, what are you doing here?

113
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:14,600
I was hoping we could still talk.
As friends.

114
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,520
- Of course.
- Hey, my mom went here to KISS.

115
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,105
- Really?
- And apparently,

116
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:21,274
the same time as Yuri's mom,
and it's crazy...

117
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,650
What about my mom?

118
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,694
Sorry, guys, I'm late. Sorry.

119
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:29,282
Do I really have to hear from
Min Ho that you're hanging out with Kitty?

120
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,577
People are looking, so smile.

121
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,622
It's not like that.
We were talking as friends.

122
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:41,043
Whatever. I would like my fake boyfriend
to start acting like a real boyfriend.

123
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,127
Okay?

124
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,840
Okay.
I am well aware you were talking about me.

125
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,931
All right, who's ready to go on a hike?

126
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,476
Min Ho! What are you doing here?

127
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,312
What? Can't hang with my best friends?

128
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:03,941
- Hey.
- Uh...

129
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,778
I don't think we've met. I'm Madison.

130
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,489
Min Ho.

131
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:10,448
I know.

132
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,742
We can talk on the hike. Let's go.

133
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,538
- So you come here often?
- Not really.

134
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,415
Make sure you stay hydrated.

135
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,293
I hope you guys used the bathroom,
because there are none.

136
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:30,384
You guys are making great time!
Let's keep up the pace, people.

137
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:34,138
Worms, worms, worms!

138
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,640
We're in nature. Embrace it.

139
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:38,601
Is it on me? I thought
the worm followed me! Where is it?

140
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,520
Dae, as I was saying...

141
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,897
- Yeah, continue.
- When my mom was here,

142
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,460
I think it's possible that...

143
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,287
Are you good?

144
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,831
- I'm good.
- Are you sure?

145
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:04,502
In the Outdoors Club, the only thing
we take more seriously than endurance

146
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:05,586
is safety!

147
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:10,341
Aw, don't worry, Kitty. It wasn't as bad
as when you fell into the cupcakes.

148
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:13,177
Hmm. I'm more worried about you
and those worms.

149
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,221
- They were very big.
- Sure.

150
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,306
At least I know
how to watch where I'm going.

151
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,809
I could beat you up this mountain
with my eyes closed.

152
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:23,062
You couldn't beat me with eyes open,
even with a head start.

153
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,064
Yeah? Wanna bet?

154
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,820
Just make sure you stick together!

155
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,364
Why did you come?

156
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,866
Because I'm looking out for you.
That's why I called Yuri.

157
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,660
Let me deal with it on my own!

158
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,081
So much drama.

159
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,459
<i>♪ Got me thinking, God I swear ♪</i>

160
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,920
<i>♪ Why I always take it there ♪</i>

161
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,298
<i>♪ Gonna lose it, don't you dare ♪</i>

162
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:53,175
<i>♪ I can't take me anywhere, no ♪</i>

163
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,012
<i>♪ Don't freak
You don't gotta cause a big scene ♪</i>

164
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,227
This is killing me.

165
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,986
I wonder if my mom ever stood here.

166
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:17,158
She loved hiking.
She used to take my sisters all the time.

167
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,037
At least that's what they told me.

168
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,893
My mom would take me
to the department store

169
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,252
and forget me there.

170
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,298
She'd send the nanny back to get me.

171
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:38,012
You know that our moms
knew each other at KISS?

172
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,474
Crazy, right?

173
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,475
Yeah.

174
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,436
Crazy.

175
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:56,822
- Kitty, can you take our photo?
- What?

176
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,300
Ugh. Let's take it later.

177
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,660
- Hey, just one photo.
- I don't want to. Later...

178
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,787
One photo! Let's just take one, okay?

179
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,498
- Please, just once.
- We have to take it right now?

180
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,832
Make a heart!

181
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,710
- No, I'm not doing it.
- Can we please not fight?

182
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,194
Let's take it just this once, okay?

183
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,453
Hurry up.

184
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:21,055
- Come on, we gotta do stuff like this...
- We did it. Okay, fine, stop.

185
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,973
It's the same hospital.

186
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,683
Did you take it?

187
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:28,020
See for yourself. Gotta go, bye!

188
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,772
- Kitty!
- Where are you going?

189
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:33,025
I'll tell you later. Have fun
tonight. I'll be with you in spirit!

190
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,286
Sorry! Excuse me!

191
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:46,831
Excuse me!

192
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,843
Ooh! Yum.

193
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,011
Focus, Kitty! Focus!

194
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:04,764
Oh, my God.

195
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,235
Excuse me.

196
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,039
Hello.

197
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:32,123
I'm looking for information
on somebody who was a patient here.

198
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,377
A current patient?

199
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:36,172
No. In 1993.

200
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:40,217
Sorry, all past records
are strictly confidential.

201
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:41,885
Okay.

202
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,154
<i>Wait, did he just...?</i>

203
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,201
<i>Oh, my God, she likes him back.</i>

204
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,580
<i>Kitty, you know what to do.</i>

205
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:12,415
Hello.

206
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,877
These are from him.

207
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:19,006
Oh, man, he likes me!

208
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:22,885
<i>I still got it.</i>

209
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,767
Do you know how long
I've dreamt of this moment?

210
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:30,684
Me too.

211
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,312
I'm just gonna leave these here.

212
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,198
<i>Okay, this is in Korean.</i>

213
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:45,699
<i>I can figure this out.</i>

214
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,785
<i>Records, records...</i>

215
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,537
<i>No, nothing on records.</i>

216
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,039
<i>Maybe this is it?</i>

217
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,290
<i>Yes.</i>

218
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:01,840
<i>This is real.</i>

219
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,968
<i>I have a brother.</i>

220
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,644
Who are you?

221
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,355
What are you doing here?

222
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,816
Hello!

223
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,317
Security!

224
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,823
Do I get a phone call?

225
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,369
I present to you...

226
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:31,537
<i>The Devil's Daughter.</i>

227
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,123
It's a lot to take in, so no talking.

228
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:54,560
Hey, my mom is in this.
She plays the king's second daughter.

229
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,354
Oh, yeah? Does she still act?

230
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:00,316
Oh, yeah, she's absolutely
smashing it right now in L.A.

231
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,695
She's up for a role
as a mermaid in the mafia.

232
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:05,863
I'd watch that.

233
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:06,946
Mm.

234
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,616
Scooch over.

235
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,578
- Hey.
- Hey.

236
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,166
Oh, I could give you guys
the behind-the-scenes dirt on this.

237
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,001
- Okay. I love dirt.
- Yeah?

238
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,084
Yeah.

239
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,683
You'll be working here from now on.

240
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,016
Thank you, President Han.
This opportunity is a real dream for me.

241
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,518
- You can use this desk.
- Yes.

242
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,605
Also, the reporters will be here
in an hour

243
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,732
to take the "coffee break" photos.
Be ready.

244
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:42,858
Yes, I will.

245
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,528
Oh, President Han?

246
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:50,407
Should I do something in the meantime?
Proof contracts or read up on zoning laws?

247
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,034
Just stay there, quietly.

248
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,370
It took that guy 20 takes to nail that.

249
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,621
Oh, cool.

250
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,457
Oh, hey, look! It's my mom.

251
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,752
Oh, wow.

252
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,504
Dude, she's gorgeous.

253
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,674
I know.
Thank God I got her bone structure.

254
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:51,760
Didn't your mom and dad
have that messy divorce?

255
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,847
The whole mess was exaggerated
to sell magazines.

256
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,017
But, yeah, they did get divorced.

257
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,478
Yeah, my parents
are going through it right now.

258
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:05,482
It's just...
I can't concentrate on anything.

259
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:08,235
Like, it's really, really sad.

260
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,739
I'm so sorry. I didn't know
you were going through that.

261
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,740
Yeah.

262
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,497
See that guy?
Total douchebag in real life.

263
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,542
My mom cannot wait
to stab him to death in the finale.

264
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,376
Spoiler alert!

265
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,921
Great. Now we know how it ends.

266
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,634
I should be studying
in the library right now, anyway.

267
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:36,055
My parents can be
pretty hard about grades.

268
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,514
Thank you for the show.

269
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,016
Ow.

270
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,105
Q?

271
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,110
Maybe just me and you next time?

272
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,885
Thank you for saving me from the hospital.

273
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:18,138
- What were you doing there anyway?
- It's a long story.

274
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,725
Well, lucky I was there
to sweet-talk the guards.

275
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:25,896
Yes, so your Korean
was almost as bad as mine.

276
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,564
Hey, don't judge.

277
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,024
You had a head start.

278
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:30,566
Head start?

279
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:34,029
Well, one of your parents
is Korean, right?

280
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:37,074
- Mine are both white.
- Really?

281
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,784
Yeah. I'm adopted.

282
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:39,868
Oh.

283
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,661
Cool.

284
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:46,250
Yeah, it is pretty cool.
I was adopted by some amazing people.

285
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,920
- Have you ever met your birth parents?
- No.

286
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:54,424
Are you curious?
I feel like I would be curious.

287
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,469
You certainly are a very curious person.

288
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:03,767
- Have you always known you were adopted?
- Uh, yeah. It was kind of obvious.

289
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,269
Right. Duh.

290
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:09,189
Do you ever see people on the street
and think, like,

291
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,733
"Oh, gosh, that person
has the same shaped ears as me,

292
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,236
maybe they're my mom,"
or, "They could be my dad,"

293
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,738
or, "We could have the same shaped ears"?

294
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:18,782
We kind of do.

295
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,491
Huh.

296
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,246
You ask a lot of questions,
and I'm not an ear expert.

297
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,250
Adopted by Australians.

298
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,210
Twenty-nine-ish.

299
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,754
When's your birthday?

300
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,216
I think it's gonna rain soon.

301
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,343
Uh, we should hurry.

302
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,763
- I think the subway's this way. Yup.
- Okay.

303
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,077
You're here.

304
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,291
How was your day?

305
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,420
It sucked.

306
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,049
It sucked.

307
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,761
What happened earlier...

308
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:24,972
Uh...

309
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,557
I'm sorry.

310
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,978
Things are crazy these days.

311
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:31,688
I know.

312
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,691
That's why I'm trying to help you.

313
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,653
Why are you keeping secrets from me?

314
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:41,114
You didn't even tell me
you were dating Yuri all summer.

315
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:46,328
And why did you tell Kitty
about Poopy Baby?

316
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,041
Are you really my friend?

317
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,294
I'm such garbage.

318
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,090
Well, at least you know that.

319
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:03,469
<i>Overwatch?</i>

320
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,933
Fine. Let's order hot wings first.
And do face masks.

321
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,185
- You place the order!
- You place the order!

322
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,353
Ah...

323
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:17,526
Is Q here?
I have eight minutes until curfew.

324
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,695
- Yeah, in his room.
- Okay.

325
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:21,904
Come in.

326
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:28,620
Hey. You still have
feelings for her, right?

327
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:32,874
Mm.

328
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:40,632
If I can be honest, I saw something today.
On the Internet. Randomly! Accidentally!

329
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:43,927
Tell me.

330
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:47,556
And when I was at the hospital,
look what I found.

331
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,641
Adopted by Australian parents,

332
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,059
just like Professor Finnerty,

333
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,728
and born around the same time.

334
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,439
- He could be my half-brother.
- Okay, what?

335
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,024
The facts add up!

336
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,400
I don't know, Kitty.

337
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,235
This could just be a huge coincidence.

338
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,738
A lot of Korean kids
are adopted by Australians.

339
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,990
But why else would he be at KISS?

340
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,950
He's probably also looking for answers.

341
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:11,621
Answers we can find together
as brother and sister.

342
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,331
Whoa.

343
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:16,251
I think you need
a little bit more evidence.

344
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,004
You'll be dropping
a lot of information on him,

345
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,757
including the fact
that his birth mom is, well...

346
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,301
not alive.

347
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,096
Yeah, you may be right.

348
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:34,770
But I just get the feeling that
my mom kept that bracelet for a reason.

349
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,522
I think she wanted
to find the baby one day.

350
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,821
We need to show you something.

351
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,368
What?

352
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:54,247
My roommate put me
on some weird website as I was sleeping?

353
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,708
- My God.
- I don't see the appeal.

354
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,795
Yet you somehow found the site.

355
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,004
Kitty, you should move.

356
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,423
You can't live with that girl anymore.

357
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:06,551
Yeah, I agree with Dae.
This is kind of sketchy.

358
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:09,763
I tried to move. There are no other rooms.

359
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:14,059
Uh, how about a hotel?
My driver could take you right now.

360
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:16,645
Can't afford that for an entire semester.

361
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,564
I'm sure Dae can hook you up
with a discount at Han Hotels.

362
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,066
Shut up, Min Ho.

363
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:23,235
All right. Just trying to help.

364
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,904
Okay, I have an idea.

365
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,698
Kitty should live here.

366
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,617
With who? Dae?

367
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,700
- No!
- No!

368
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,079
Okay, just listen to me for a second.

369
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,288
You and I switch rooms.

370
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,958
Kitty can bunk with me. You bunk with Dae.

371
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,502
I mean, what do you guys think?

372
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,296
<i>Okay, I can handle this.</i>

373
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,465
<i>I think.</i>

374
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,233
<i>♪ Yeah, let's go... ♪</i>
