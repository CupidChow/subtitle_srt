1
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,771
A reason, a season or a lifetime.

2
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,649
What are you talking about?

3
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:28,445
Every relationship fits into one of those
categories. I read it in a magazine.

4
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,530
The point is, Madison and I are over.

5
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:34,075
And looking back,
I believe I was with her for a reason.

6
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,285
Long legs?

7
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:38,747
No, she showed me
I'm ready for something real.

8
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:40,414
Wow.

9
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,044
Only you could come out of getting dumped
somehow feeling better about yourself.

10
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,131
How are things with Florian?

11
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:52,302
He's going through some stuff,
but I'm here for him.

12
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,971
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

13
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,434
You look so beautiful today.

14
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:01,561
- I'll make the coffee.
- I'll grab the mugs.

15
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:04,105
It's too early to be this cheery.

16
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:09,277
I am this cheery, not only because I have
the most perfect boyfriend in the world,

17
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:13,281
but it has come to my attention that
I am failing almost all of my classes.

18
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:16,451
So if I don't do amazing on the finals,
I will flunk out of school.

19
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,205
And that brings you cheer because...?

20
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:23,166
If I dwell on the fact that
I was considered super-smart at home

21
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,293
and here I can barely keep up,
I will start sobbing.

22
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,087
We have a week before finals.

23
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,256
We're gonna make study plans,
and everyone will help you.

24
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,510
- I'm very busy, so...
- Everyone.

25
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:37,847
Guys, Kitty and I are finally together.

26
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,183
I'm not gonna let her
fail out of this school now.

27
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,143
Well, I'm in.

28
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,145
- I'll help with chem.
- Thank you.

29
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,397
She definitely needs
to work on her Korean.

30
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:47,941
What did you call me?

31
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,024
Exactly.

32
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,402
I'll take the other subjects.

33
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:54,322
Dae has been top of our class,
like, every semester,

34
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:56,074
so you're in good hands.

35
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:58,326
Or I'll fail out,
have to leave my true love,

36
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:02,205
and disgrace my mother's legacy,
which is even greater than I thought.

37
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,288
So...

38
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:05,875
no pressure.

39
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,729
Oh, Professor Finnerty.

40
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,732
Principal Lim. Hello.

41
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:30,942
What a coincidence.

42
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:33,319
Actually, I followed you here.

43
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,196
I was hoping we could talk.

44
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,322
Oh...

45
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:42,203
If you're here to beg me to do a solo
at the end of the term talent show,

46
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,080
it's off the table for teachers. Okay?

47
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,164
No, I...

48
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,041
Um...

49
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,920
There's no graceful way to say this.

50
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,508
I am your son.

51
00:02:57,468 --> 00:03:00,179
Not that you asked or anything.

52
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:04,350
But don't worry, I grew up happy.

53
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:07,395
I was adopted by amazing people.

54
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,564
I love my parents.

55
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:10,690
What?

56
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,030
Why would you think I'm your mother?

57
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,866
Well, I was curious,

58
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:23,870
so a few years ago,
I did one of those ancestry tests

59
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,164
and that led me to a nephew of Lee's.

60
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,041
And it took some time,

61
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:31,669
but I figured that Lee
must be my biological father.

62
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,214
So you came to teach at KISS.

63
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,841
To meet him?

64
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,885
Yes.

65
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,392
Lee doesn't know.

66
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:48,770
I figured.

67
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,480
No one knows, but me and...

68
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:55,526
Kitty Song Covey.

69
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,657
She told you I was your mother?

70
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,618
Yes, but she...

71
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,329
It doesn't matter.

72
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:10,500
She, um, also gave me this.

73
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:38,903
Good, you're home.

74
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:42,699
The Millers are flying in and attending
the end-of-semester talent show.

75
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,575
Apparently Madison is dancing.

76
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,036
Oh.

77
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,455
- Yeah. Twice.
- Mm.

78
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,667
It's such a relief Madison
is doing so well at KISS.

79
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:57,046
It shows the Millers that we surround
ourselves with the highest quality.

80
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,464
Dear...

81
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,843
We have to use this opportunity
to finalize the acquisition.

82
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:04,470
For that to happen,
everything needs to go smoothly.

83
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,554
Yuri's Dad.

84
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:07,890
I need to talk.

85
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:10,226
Oh, sure.

86
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,477
Sit. Talk to me.

87
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:17,817
It's...

88
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,611
something from my past.

89
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:23,781
Is Yuri home?

90
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,453
I don't hear any unbearable music,
so I guess not.

91
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,963
To be honest, I have a son.

92
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,091
When I was 16...

93
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,762
I used my American friend's name...

94
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:50,683
at the hospital to cover it up.

95
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,812
I didn't think he'd ever find me.

96
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,737
But today, he did.

97
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:17,794
Did he want money?

98
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,506
No.

99
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,805
He wants to get to know me.

100
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,393
And to know what kind of person
his birth father is.

101
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,940
- Pay the boy to go away.
- But...

102
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,942
This cannot be revealed to the public!

103
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,527
Ever.

104
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,118
I know that.

105
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,630
What are you talking about?

106
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,790
Mom, you have a son?

107
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,962
Yuri, wait!

108
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:02,546
Yuri!

109
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,510
I have a brother I've never met,

110
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,679
that you were never gonna tell me about.

111
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,973
Professor Lee is the dad, isn't he?

112
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,225
What are you doing?

113
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,477
Who is my brother?

114
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,063
- That's not your concern.
- Why?

115
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:22,307
Because you're gonna pay your son off,
like he's nothing but a problem to solve?

116
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,443
And for what?

117
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,487
To keep this miserable family
looking perfect from the outside?

118
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,322
You were never supposed to know
any of this.

119
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,492
Just like I wasn't supposed to know
you shipped Juliana away.

120
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:34,662
- Yuri, that was for your own good.
- No, it wasn't.

121
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:36,622
It's because you're ashamed.

122
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,833
And all my life, I thought it was of me,

123
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,002
but really, you're ashamed of yourself.

124
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,462
You're young and spoiled.

125
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:45,923
So were you when you had a baby.
How's that secret working out for you now?

126
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,592
I had to keep it a secret.

127
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,218
You think that was easy for me?

128
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,220
I was a pregnant teenager,

129
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,556
that would have destroyed
<i>halmeoni </i>and <i>hal-abeoji.</i>

130
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:57,810
I had to do what was best
for my family then,

131
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,104
and I am doing
what is best for my family now.

132
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,731
Well, your best sucks.

133
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,445
I love Juliana.

134
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,198
Do you understand?

135
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,411
And you sent her away
to protect your image.

136
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,206
You care about that
more than you care about me

137
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,333
or your son, who wants to get to know you.

138
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:25,379
It's more complicated than that,
and it's in the past.

139
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,132
It's not in the past.

140
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,467
He's here.

141
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:33,721
And, Mom, I'm right here.

142
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,473
In the present.

143
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,060
I'm gay.

144
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,855
Full stop. End of discussion.

145
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,275
But you and Dae...

146
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:49,654
You liked him, didn't you?
You can find another boy you like.

147
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,697
I never liked him.

148
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,741
The whole thing was fake.

149
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:59,080
I have to live a fake life
just so you'll keep on loving me.

150
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,958
And I'm done doing that.

151
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:21,018
All right, so,
what are the three natural laws

152
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,813
that statistical thermodynamics postulate?

153
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,774
- No natural laws. That's a trick question.
- Exactly.

154
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,110
Okay, moving on to chemical compounds.

155
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:33,364
You'd think I'd be good at chemistry.
It's basically matchmaking.

156
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:36,826
Yeah. Except, you know,
people aren't chemicals.

157
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,286
Yeah.

158
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,332
Once bonded, they don't stay
united in fixed proportions.

159
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,711
Okay. What's happening?

160
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,879
Oh, nothing.

161
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,756
No, I'm happy with Dae

162
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,426
'cause I wanted to be with him
for so long, and now I am.

163
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,469
- So no more dreams about...?
- No.

164
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,721
No, I'm with Dae.

165
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,348
Fully, completely, 100%.

166
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,310
And we're not pushing down
an immense crush on Yuri?

167
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,395
No, no, I'm just avoiding her

168
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:07,940
because Alex and me promised
not to say anything about, you know.

169
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:11,611
So just being cautious
so I don't blurt it out by mistake.

170
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,112
Right, right.

171
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:16,032
Yuri was just shiny
and caught my attention,

172
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,742
but I'm not a raccoon.

173
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,286
I can choose to look away from the shine.

174
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,374
Uh...

175
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,458
Coming!

176
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,298
Yuri.

177
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,260
Yuri, what's up?

178
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,220
I just came out to my mom.

179
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:41,599
I'm gay.

180
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,726
Oh, my God, welcome.

181
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:47,188
Oh! I feel amazing.

182
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,441
Scared, but free.

183
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,070
And I'm moving in with you guys.

184
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:56,988
Uh...

185
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,743
So, yeah, I have a secret brother.

186
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,370
Can you believe this?

187
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:05,039
I cannot, no.

188
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,499
Are you okay?

189
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:09,460
Do you know who he is?

190
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:13,172
No, I asked her directly
if Professor Lee was the father,

191
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,799
and she wouldn't tell me anything.

192
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,717
That's brave of you to ask.

193
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:21,389
She just wants to shove my brother aside,
just like she did with Juliana.

194
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,058
That sucks.

195
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,185
I am furious with her.

196
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,771
But I am excited about him.

197
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,564
I've always wanted a sibling.

198
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:34,443
I just wish there was a way
I could find him on my own.

199
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,655
<i>You promised not to tell.
You promised not to tell.</i>

200
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,908
Maybe he'll find you one day.

201
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:41,992
I hope so.

202
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,790
- Yuri, I really wanna be a good friend...
- You are a good friend.

203
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,375
Hm...

204
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:54,922
You know that day we found the yearbook
and saw the photo of our moms,

205
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,675
and my mom was wearing a tight shirt,
and your mom was...?

206
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:58,759
Oh, my God, yes.

207
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:02,096
She was wearing that big-ass tent
to hide her pregnancy.

208
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,015
It's all piecing together now.

209
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,351
And your mom probably knew.

210
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,939
Yeah. I bet they were really good friends.

211
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,733
We're the next generation.

212
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,038
Timeline of the later Three Kingdoms.

213
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:31,208
890 to 936.

214
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,711
- The first political state?
- Gojoseon.

215
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,421
- Gojoseon.
- Gojoseon.

216
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,924
What is happening?

217
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,008
I moved in.

218
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,052
What? Why?

219
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:44,930
Are you a throuple now?

220
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:46,765
- No.
- No.

221
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,642
I'm gay.

222
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,688
I came out to my mom.
I moved out of the penthouse.

223
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:54,106
Scared. Excited.

224
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,358
Wait, you've been gay this whole time?

225
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,860
It's not a choice.

226
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,111
I know. I mean...

227
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,655
So you and Dae,

228
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,450
you were in a fake relationship?

229
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,910
Kitty was right?

230
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,746
I told you I know matchmaking.

231
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,289
You're not mad at Dae?

232
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:14,168
He lied, and lied, and lied.

233
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:17,588
- I was mad, but then I forgave him.
- Wow.

234
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,216
You're as trusting as my dad's third wife.

235
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,885
Hey, Kitty and I are good.

236
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:24,970
Leave it alone.

237
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,054
I'm not good.

238
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,974
You lied to me too, a lot.

239
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:32,186
I wouldn't do that to a friend
or someone I care about.

240
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:34,855
I just wouldn't.

241
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,239
<i>Damn, never seen
that side of Min Ho before.</i>

242
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,033
Finals. Makes everyone crazy.

243
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,467
I can't take it anymore.

244
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,177
Just leave me here to die.

245
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,430
- It's only three more days. You can do it.
- I need a break.

246
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,683
I cannot digest one more fact,
or I'll puke.

247
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,726
All right, that's enough.
Let's go. Come on.

248
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,688
Let's get your blood pumping.
Let's do some jumping jacks. Okay?

249
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,773
- Yeah!
- A glass of cold water does the trick.

250
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:20,109
I'm happy to dump some over your head.

251
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,611
- I know what we need.
- Please don't say Adderall.

252
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,573
No, have you seen me
and Eunice on that stuff?

253
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,908
I would never. What we need is music.

254
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:31,161
We all need coffee. Who's coming with me?

255
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,171
Why'd you come
if you were going to be like this?

256
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,255
Like what?

257
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,300
I'm mad at you right now.

258
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:49,555
Listen, I'm sorry I lied to you,
but this has nothing to do with you.

259
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:53,058
I just mean,
how could you do that to Kitty?

260
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,936
Why are you so concerned about Kitty?

261
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,152
Hey.

262
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,238
Isn't that Florian?

263
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,783
I think it is.

264
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:15,623
Q said Florian's been acting
all distracted lately.

265
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,499
Do you think Biceps is why?

266
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,145
Should we send the photo?

267
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,940
No, we don't know what it is for sure yet.

268
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,069
Maybe I'll never move back home.

269
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:46,654
I'll figure it out,

270
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,447
<i>but I'm staying with Kitty for now.</i>

271
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,241
- Can she hear us?
<i>- Nope.</i>

272
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,869
She's blasting a study mix I made for her.

273
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,120
<i>Oh!</i>

274
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,039
You made a mix for her?

275
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,666
<i>Yeah, she's a friend.</i>

276
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,585
<i>Don't worry.</i>

277
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:05,881
It's a Don't Fail Out of School mix,
not a I'm Hot for You mix.

278
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,551
Well, you talk about her a lot,

279
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,679
<i>and now you're living with her, so...</i>

280
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:15,641
She's just a friend, I promise.

281
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,018
<i>That's what you used to say about me.</i>

282
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,353
Stop it.

283
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,357
Besides, she's totally straight.

284
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,997
If you've done well all semester,
you should have no issues with the final.

285
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:39,915
It is fair.

286
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,876
Hard, but fair.

287
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,170
Yes?

288
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:49,341
What if you have not
done well all semester?

289
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,719
- Probable doom.
- Okay.

290
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,013
But I'm not unreasonable.

291
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,099
Any student of mine
who chooses to participate

292
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,767
in the end-of-term talent show,

293
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,812
will get a ten-point boost
on their lowest grade.

294
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,274
Oh, good.
I just learned a new TikTok dance.

295
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:08,193
- I can juggle.
- No, no.

296
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:12,948
You must perform a traditional
Korean art form with dignity.

297
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:21,623
Hey, my mom made me take
fan dance lessons forever.

298
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,875
I can teach you.

299
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,794
- Dancing with you? Yeah, great.
- Mm-hm.

300
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,225
I love the smell
of finals in the morning.

301
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,021
Probably because you're a star athlete

302
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,273
and you know you're gonna
pass all your classes.

303
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:47,815
Probably.

304
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,235
Hey, guys. Sit with us.

305
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:54,989
Hey, guys.

306
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,574
Hello.

307
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:01,288
So, Florian, how's studying going?

308
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,917
Did you stay in all night?
Nose in the books?

309
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,544
Yeah, all night.

310
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,505
- Interesting, yeah.
- Interesting.

311
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:13,884
We needed a break,
so we went for a coffee run.

312
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,348
Well, better get back to it.

313
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,809
- See you later.
- Bye.

314
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,185
Bye!

315
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,816
What is going on with you guys?
Why are you acting so weird?

316
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,578
We didn't know how to tell you. Sorry.

317
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,628
Thank you.

318
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:55,008
So the idea of this is the fans,

319
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:58,470
the Hanbok we wear,
the choreography, the music

320
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:03,016
all come together to create the image
of butterflies and flowers in spring.

321
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,060
It's gorgeous.

322
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,357
It's like this.

323
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,068
Open, close.

324
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:25,164
<i>I don't know if I can keep
hiding all these secrets from Yuri</i>

325
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,583
<i>and stay this close to her.</i>

326
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,381
What?

327
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,718
I'm nervous.

328
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,471
Whatever.
It's only the whole school watching.

329
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,809
Come on, it can't be any worse
than when you fell into the cupcakes.

330
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,146
Kitty...

331
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:54,067
you are the girl
that flew halfway across the world

332
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,611
to go after what she wants.

333
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,363
What could possibly make you nervous?

334
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,824
You.

335
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,119
Me? Why would I make you nervous?

336
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,834
- Oh, do you want to get that?
- Um, it's okay.

337
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:14,129
I'll call later.
You're more important to me right now.

338
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,340
I need you to get this dance down.

339
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,260
You need that extra credit.
I can't lose you now.

340
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,137
I can't lose you either.

341
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,278
Kitty, what are you...?

342
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,242
We're late, sorry.

343
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,678
- Why are you looking at me?
- Why do you think?

344
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,805
Are you sure
it's okay to wear this hanbok?

345
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:50,082
Babe, in this context, yes.

346
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,190
Are you cheating on me?

347
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,316
What?

348
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,361
No.

349
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:25,242
- Min Ho and Dae think you are.
- Well, Min Ho and Dae are wrong.

350
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,619
You're lying. They saw you.

351
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,794
I was hoping you'd have
some kind of explanation.

352
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,838
I... I do.

353
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,676
I love you.

354
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,388
What?

355
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,807
Q, I love you.

356
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,519
- That's not an explanation.
- Listen.

357
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:55,439
I love you so much that

358
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:58,984
I've let other parts of my life fall away,

359
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,236
like doing homework.

360
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:05,699
And I love you so much that
I can't picture not being here with you.

361
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,455
I love you too.

362
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:15,959
And I wanna believe you,
but you need to tell me what's going on.

363
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,467
I'm cheating...

364
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,136
but not on you.

365
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:35,603
Kitty!

366
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,358
I'll see you tonight.
Don't forget your fans.

367
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,194
- I won't.
- Okay.

368
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,030
Is everything all right?

369
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:49,951
Yeah, just pre-performance nerves

370
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,245
and worrying about if I passed.

371
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,039
Are you sure that's it?

372
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:55,962
Mm-hm.

373
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,251
Do you hear that?

374
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,921
It sounds like it's coming
from the chemistry lab.

375
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,966
I need to go talk to Alex,
but I'll meet up with you later.

376
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,516
I know that hold music.

377
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,476
Are you leaving?

378
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:21,483
Yeah. I'm, um, leaving tonight.

379
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,735
But you're gonna miss the talent show.

380
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,988
I think it's best if I skip it
and leave quietly.

381
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:31,535
Oh. But you're gonna be back
next semester, right?

382
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,410
No.

383
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,792
I came to Korea
to learn about my biological parents.

384
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:40,751
And I did.

385
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:45,215
My father doesn't know that I exist,

386
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:48,009
and I don't wanna upend his life.

387
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:51,054
My mother asked for some time to process

388
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,431
and has ignored me ever since.

389
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:57,435
Makes a guy feel unwanted.

390
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,480
I'm so sorry, Alex.

391
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,316
What about Yuri?

392
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,193
She's not like Jina.

393
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,362
She wants a relationship with you.

394
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,366
So Yuri knows who I am?

395
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:14,202
No, but she knows
that she has a half-brother,

396
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,580
and she's really excited to meet him.

397
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:19,457
I wasn't the one
who told her that or anything.

398
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,293
It was really hard, trust me,

399
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,503
but I've learned not to meddle.

400
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,631
You've learned a lot of things, Kitty.

401
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:33,889
I passed.

402
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,976
One down, six to go.

403
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,105
Just think about it. Okay?

404
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:43,731
For Yuri.

405
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:00,248
Mr. and Mrs. Miller, hello.

406
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,083
- How nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

407
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,794
Yes, I like to mix business with pleasure.

408
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,213
A real time saver.

409
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,924
Maybe we can close up
this business tonight.

410
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,259
- Agreed.
- Drinks first.

411
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,178
And then we should go find Madison.

412
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:17,390
I mean, come on, can we have fun,
please, just for, like, five seconds?

413
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:22,276
You know your daughter
hasn't been sleeping at home, right?

414
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,022
Of course, I know.

415
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:25,774
Tell her to return home immediately.

416
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:29,069
And I trust...
you took care of that other problem.

417
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:30,152
Problem?

418
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,530
I never said it was a problem.

419
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:42,290
Do you know how hard I work
to maintain our perfect family image?

420
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:47,629
But I don't know
who I'm putting in all this effort for.

421
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:50,215
Yuri, you, me.

422
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,636
Not a single one of us is happy.

423
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,930
So you're saying you're unhappy?

424
00:25:58,014 --> 00:25:59,432
You are spoiled.

425
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:03,395
I said the same thing to Yuri.

426
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,272
That she was spoiled.

427
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,944
I was wrong to say it.

428
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:15,991
I'm going to find my daughter.

429
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:47,522
Oh, the fan dance is up next.

430
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:51,984
Come on.

431
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:55,363
I cheated on the finals.

432
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:59,326
So I wouldn't fail out
and have to go live in Greece.

433
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:06,916
It's not like I gave you mouth sores.

434
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,501
I'm an athlete.

435
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:13,506
I believe in good sportsmanship
and that cheating is wrong.

436
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,342
I'm not hurting anybody.

437
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,513
I'm just helping myself.

438
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:56,466
Fireworks. For my second performance.

439
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,260
K-Pop! Thank you.

440
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,640
- Hey.
- Hey.

441
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:06,267
Oh, you tied your bow wrong.
Can I just...?

442
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:17,445
Um, before, at rehearsal...

443
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:19,781
- I...
- Yuri!

444
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:21,825
I want you to come back home.

445
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,285
I'll talk to Alex.

446
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,162
I'll make sure you can get to know him.

447
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,331
Alex? Alex, who?

448
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:31,626
Oh, I just assumed that Kitty...

449
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:33,920
Wait, Alex is my brother?

450
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:35,422
Our teacher, Alex?

451
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,049
And you knew?

452
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,428
Yuri, I can explain.

453
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,122
How could you not tell me?

454
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,542
I thought Alex was my brother

455
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,878
and that my mom
was the one who was pregnant.

456
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:18,047
It wasn't until we snuck out
of detention that day

457
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:21,301
- and went to Lee's house...
- Wait, you've known since detention?

458
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,855
How could you hide this from me?

459
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,233
- It wasn't my place to...
- To be honest?

460
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:38,860
Guys, I'm trying to focus.

461
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:42,030
- I wasn't not honest, I just...
- Lied by omission.

462
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,991
You lied all semester
about being with Dae on purpose,

463
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:47,410
and I got past it, and now we're friends.

464
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,078
We were friends.

465
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,502
Oh, no!

466
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:57,961
Fire!

467
00:29:58,505 --> 00:29:59,631
No!

468
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:03,927
Oh, no. Oh, no.

469
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,284
I got you. Stop squirming.

470
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,002
It's all out. You're good.

471
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,086
Thank you.

472
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,141
Are you okay?

473
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,227
I'm okay. Min Ho helped.

474
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,105
I would have helped her.

475
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,607
- I got here first.
- I'm here now.

476
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:08,157
What was all the drama on stage?

477
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:11,828
Um... I'm not sure.

478
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,726
Pull yourself together!

479
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:44,694
I'm going to find the Millers.

He didn't leave.

483
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,726
Daniel, follow me.

484
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:19,896
- Why?
- Mom, what are you doing?

485
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,230
I have no idea.

486
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,360
What's going on with you?

487
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,822
You can always tell me anything, Kitty.

488
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,537
Okay.

489
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,584
I've really been trying not to...

490
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,253
but...

491
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:47,924
Just say it.

492
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,345
I have feelings for somebody else.

493
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,103
I knew it.

494
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,524
I saw the way he looked at you.

495
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:08,152
I'm gonna kill him.
