1
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:25,442
- I am so sorry.
- Oh, my fault.

2
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:29,446
Good morning, pal.

3
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,822
Good morning.

4
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:34,492
You're wearing your comfort socks.

5
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,496
What's up? Are you feeling stressed out?

6
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:42,417
Yes. I mean, no.

7
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:48,298
It feels weird that you know this
about me when we're just...

8
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,424
Friends.

9
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:51,593
I was gonna say roommates.

10
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,053
Friendly roommates.

11
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,724
Yeah, it's weird for me too.

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,775
Maybe too weird.

13
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,235
What does that mean?

14
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:13,114
It means being friends
might not work for me.

15
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:20,872
Kitty, I...

16
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:22,373
You should answer her.

17
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:24,751
I have to go. I'm meeting Q.

18
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,389
Don't worry, okay?

19
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:42,393
I'm sure you and Dae will figure out
how to be cohabitating exes.

20
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,353
Or not.

21
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,688
But let's just stop talking about Dae.

22
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,149
Okay. You're the one who brought him up.

23
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,484
Look.

24
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,363
I can't even pretend to read Hangul
until I finish this coffee.

25
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,366
It says, "We do not release information
about private adoptions."

26
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:59,452
Which is the only thing
I know how to read in Korean.

27
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:03,540
Ugh. Can we drop this Alex thing?
Go back to talking about you and Dae.

28
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:07,710
It's not an Alex thing.
I know in my gut that Alex is my brother.

29
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,213
- Okay.
- Or I'm pretty sure.

30
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,508
But maybe you should talk
to your for-sure siblings about this.

31
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:17,053
Yes, I want to, but I can't.

32
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,848
Not yet. Alex needs to know first.

33
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:24,227
Also, there is that miniscule chance
that I am not right.

34
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,188
Just ask him. Rip the Band-Aid off.

35
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,233
Most of the school will be gone
for Chuseok,

36
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,735
so this would be
the perfect weekend to corner him.

37
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,821
Sure. And say what exactly?

38
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,490
You'll figure it out.

39
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:40,869
And we're late.

40
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:43,288
- We are? Like super late?
- Very late.

41
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,123
- Professor Lee will kill me.
- I know.

42
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:53,548
Chuseok is the Korean celebration
of the good harvest.

43
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:59,512
And it's a time to thank our ancestors
for bringing us prosperity

44
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,765
and to pay respect to those we have lost.

45
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,476
We do that by going home.

46
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,522
It is a very special holiday in our house,

47
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,984
because family is the most precious thing
in the world.

48
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,778
And we do not take it for granted.

49
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:20,199
Enjoy your break, everyone,
have a good Chuseok.

50
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,743
Thank you.

51
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:26,039
My grandparents told me
about Chuseok, but I've never had one.

52
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:29,918
- It's like Korean Thanksgiving?
- Yeah, minus the genocide.

53
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,045
<i>Is she actually talking to me?</i>

54
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,339
It's pretty much the same.

55
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:38,051
You go home, eat your ass off,
and argue with the relatives.

56
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,761
I don't have any relatives here.

57
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:42,263
Maybe you should use the time to study.

58
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,723
I have been studying.

59
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,350
Really.

60
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,770
I think I'm in shock.

61
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,691
Your shock worries me.

62
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,819
Your aggressive perkiness
may have charmed your American teachers

63
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:01,407
into giving you good grades,
but here you'll need to put in more work.

64
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:09,832
<i>My grades suck. Living with
my ex sucks. Why am I even here?</i>

65
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,210
<i>Because of Mom.</i>

66
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:15,338
<i>- And to find myself. Because of family.</i>
- Eyes on the road, Kitty!

67
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:19,634
Happy Chuseok. Chuseok?

68
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,803
Che... Chuseok.

69
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,889
- How's it going?
- Bad.

70
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:29,227
Bad. Bad and bad.

71
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,853
I failed my Lit test.

72
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:34,565
I have never gotten below an A-minus
in my entire life.

73
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,235
I've failed at many things in my life.

74
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,028
I've failed my driver's test.

75
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,990
I failed a philosophy test.
I failed a drug test.

76
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,368
Just kidding.

77
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,496
Failing is part of learning.

78
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,081
You're gonna be okay.

79
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,419
Thanks. Do you have any plans for Chuseok?

80
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,172
- No, no family in Seoul.
- Yeah, me neither.

81
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,801
We should have dinner.

82
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,096
I mean, you should come to the dinner.

83
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:09,559
That I'm planning on campus
for all of us expats.

84
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,853
Like a Friendsgiving.

85
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,188
Oh, sweet. I'll be there.

86
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,567
He's gonna be there. Cool.

87
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:22,947
You may have failed this,
but you just aced being a great person.

88
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:27,201
Thinking of others who have nowhere to go,
cooking a massive feast...

89
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:30,830
Cooking.

90
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,416
Okay.

91
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,423
Okay.

92
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,469
<i>There's more than one type of soy sauce?</i>

93
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,770
You're seriously everywhere.

94
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,272
You're like my own <i>sasaeng.</i>

95
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,107
What's a <i>sasaeng?</i>

96
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,152
You, my very own obsessed fan.

97
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,154
What are you even doing
in a grocery store?

98
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,740
Shouldn't you be on a yacht
being rich and annoying?

99
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:10,078
Hmm. My dad is doing that with
wife number three with her new fillers.

100
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:13,831
I have decided to stay here
as a favor to all the women

101
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,709
who want a piece of me this Chuseok.

102
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,337
Strawberries and chocolate?
I'm going to be sick.

103
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:24,550
- I'm sure Lulu will appreciate this.
- Who's Lulu? Another one of your Min-hos?

104
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,552
Cute.

105
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:30,056
She's only the fastest rising pop star
in the country.

106
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,478
We've been flirting
since her trainee days.

107
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,022
She's on break from tour for the holiday.

108
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,816
Even K-Pop stops for Chuseok.

109
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,359
Okay.

110
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,989
Do you even know what to do with this?

111
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,784
Hey, I am admittedly
entering new territory,

112
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,495
but with the help of TikTok
and a positive attitude,

113
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,163
I'll manage just fine.

114
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,625
If not, I've won awards
for my mashed potatoes.

115
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,920
No, no, no. As a Korean national,

116
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:05,758
I cannot in good conscience let you
desecrate my native cuisine like this.

117
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,093
Hey, what?

118
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,430
Do you want to poison your classmates?
Or do you want my help?

119
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:15,184
Fine, but I'm still
making the mashed potatoes.

120
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,145
I have an entire system.

121
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,938
- Don't mess it up.
- Just follow me.

122
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:28,739
Come on.

123
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,495
Who works on Chuseok?

124
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,289
Well,

125
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,812
what am I supposed to do
when I have 300 international hotels?

126
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,793
Do you think
the Millers are taking Chuseok off?

127
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,546
The hotels would be fine without you
for three days.

128
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,299
You would be fine without me
for three days too.

129
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:53,598
I was hoping this year our family
could spend quality time together.

130
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,186
It's been so long since the three of us
have spent time together.

131
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,539
That's why we're here together right now.
Isn't that enough?

132
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,064
You think this is enough?

133
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:06,277
Wow, looking great. If only my classmates
could see this side of our perfect family.

134
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,862
Yuri Han.

135
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,574
How dare you disrespect your mother.

136
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,618
I'm sorry.

137
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,037
It's fine.

138
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,879
Tell us about you. Anything new going on?

139
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,798
Not really.

140
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,388
Oh, right.

141
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:42,772
Kitty says you and her mom
went to KISS together and knew each other?

142
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:49,487
Really? We were roommates,
but we weren't close.

143
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,322
You lived on campus?
But before, you said...

144
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:55,368
It was just for a year.
Why are you suddenly so curious?

145
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,913
You're the one who said
we should spend quality time together!

146
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:03,251
Oh, by quality time,
did you mean that I sit here silently?

147
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,669
Yuri Han.

148
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,420
That's enough.

149
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:13,261
You know what? You're right.
It's enough for me too.

150
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:46,168
You are angelic in the morning.

151
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:51,507
- Who is this from?
- My mother. Gifts are my love language.

152
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,717
- That tracks.
- Mm-hm.

153
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,843
Whoa, Pepero.

154
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:58,222
She sent it from Los Angeles
since she couldn't be here.

155
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,267
We usually spend Chuseok together.

156
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,396
- That sucks. So she'll be alone?
- No. John Cho is having a thing.

157
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,983
Oh, Lulu, about time.

158
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:13,362
Don't touch anything.

159
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,864
Got a method.

160
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:27,418
You know, you are the last person
that I would expect to know how to cook.

161
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:29,545
Or do anything remotely helpful.

162
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:33,007
There are these tiny microscopic moments

163
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,343
when I can see
why Dae is friends with you.

164
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,595
There's an actual person in there.

165
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:43,684
Don't try to get me on your side.
I'm famously anti-Kitty,

166
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,520
no matter how hard Dae works to sway me.

167
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,982
Hey, have you heard from him today?
Is he okay?

168
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,611
Chuseok, family, and ancestor stuff.

169
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:58,658
No, I haven't. It's definitely
a difficult holiday for him.

170
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,326
Yeah.

171
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:03,663
And you?

172
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,625
Me, what?

173
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,753
You must be thinking about your mom too.

174
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,797
A lot this week.

175
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,800
Yeah, I am.

176
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:20,262
But in a good way.
I can feel her all around me here.

177
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,309
- Thanks, Min Ho.
- You're welcome.

178
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,278
I should reach out to Dae,
even though it's super awkward

179
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,739
and I don't know what to say
or how to say it,

180
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:42,368
but I feel like this stuff
trumps other stuff.

181
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,286
Agree.

182
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:49,959
Gifts are always appreciated on Chuseok,
even from ex-pen pals.

183
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,544
Pass me the <i>gochugaru.</i>

184
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:01,011
<i>What do you give the boy
who cheated on you and broke your heart,</i>

185
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:04,890
<i>but then let you live with him
and now he wants to be your friend?</i>

186
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,142
<i>Hmm.</i>

187
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,859
Only a little soy sauce!

188
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:18,320
I know! You tell me every time.

189
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,867
- Dae! What is this?
- Oh, I was gonna get this out later.

190
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:24,785
Surprise.

191
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,412
The pears that Mom loved.

192
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,373
Aren't these expensive?

193
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:32,251
You bought these full price
at the department store?

194
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,086
They sell these cheaper in the market!

195
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,797
I just wanted to get the ones
that Mom liked.

196
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,383
We haven't had them since she passed away.

197
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,428
She's not even here to enjoy them.
This is a waste of money!

198
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,472
I was just trying to do something nice.

199
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:48,517
When you make money,
save it for when you really need it.

200
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,231
Who is it?

201
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,154
Yuri Han.

202
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,114
Surprise! Happy Chuseok!

203
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,493
You should have told me
Miss Yuri was coming over.

204
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,078
Dae didn't know I was coming either.

205
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,498
I just stopped by because I missed him.

206
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,166
Oh, oh, okay.

207
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,086
Come in.

208
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,780
What are you doing here?

209
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:25,387
I needed to escape
and had nowhere else to go.

210
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,224
Juliana's gone
and you're kind of all I've got.

211
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:31,393
I even stopped by
and got Sulwahsoo for your mom.

212
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,353
What?

213
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,480
Yeah, she must go crazy for this.

214
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:36,524
My mom died three years ago.

215
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,820
- I didn't know.
- Of course not.

216
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:02,550
Confirmed Lulu
will be at the premises at 8 p.m.

217
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,594
I'm sure she will love the chocolate.

218
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,472
The chocolate was actually
for someone else.

219
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,977
Hey, don't judge!

220
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,730
Not all people need to be
star-crossed lovers to be compatible.

221
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,858
Like, hot people, for example.

222
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:23,237
We can and want to play the field.

223
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:27,032
That's because you haven't found
your perfect match.

224
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,617
I've found many, many matches.

225
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:33,122
I'm just saying, I've seen the magic
when people find the one.

226
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:35,791
Mm-mm.

227
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,919
My parents both thought
they found the one.

228
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:43,299
They were the "it" couple.
Beautiful, young starlet. <i>Chaebol</i> heir.

229
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,802
The tabloids literally
called them the perfect match.

230
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,637
Look at them now.

231
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:50,973
I'm sorry.

232
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:56,812
Here! Try... this.

233
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,529
Okay.

234
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,741
It must be weird to have people
know all about your family.

235
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:12,870
They think they know, they don't really.
That's my point.

236
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:19,293
There's really only one thing
that matters at the end of the day.

237
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:20,711
Which is what?

238
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,339
The truth.

239
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,260
Yeah. You're right.

240
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,347
Finally, some appreciation.

241
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,065
<i>Tonight, I'm telling Alex the truth.</i>

242
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,277
- Well, this escalated.
- Mm-hm.

243
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,529
Wow.

244
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,115
- People are calling this Chin-gu-seok.
- What?

245
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,535
It's a pun on <i>chinggu,</i>
which means "friend," and Chuseok.

246
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,037
You started a new tradition.

247
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,121
Aw.

248
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:00,417
Oh, no. No, no, why is Professor Lee here?

249
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,211
Because he's sad and alone.

250
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,381
He hates me and it's mutual.

251
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,509
Don't worry.
It's not like you have to sit with him.

252
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,553
Min Ho.

253
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,638
Hey.

254
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,475
- Hello, Madison.
- I wasn't expecting you to be here.

255
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,144
Oh, my God. You cooked.

256
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,147
Yes. But I'm not staying long.
Got a date tonight.

257
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:26,026
- Mm. Who's the lucky girl?
- Lulu. Maybe you've heard of her?

258
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,988
Um, yeah. Aren't you nervous?

259
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,407
Why would I be?

260
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:35,119
Because her fans are very picky
about who she chooses to spend time with.

261
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,954
I mean, if they don't like you...

262
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,211
He's so <i>meosisseoyo.</i>

263
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,880
I don't know what that means,
but I probably disagree.

264
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:47,964
Yeah.

265
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:50,675
Kitty.

266
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,928
This is amazing.

267
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,431
Welcome! I hope you're hungry.

268
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:59,810
Professor Lee, I'm so glad
you didn't fail to make it.

269
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,812
Yes. Well, I wasn't planning on coming,

270
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:04,815
but a group of students this big
requires faculty supervision.

271
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:07,067
- Actually...
- You don't count.

272
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,739
Wait!

273
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:17,494
Um, I think Min Ho wanted
to sit with Professor Lee, actually.

274
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:22,624
- I need you to sit with Lee.
- That sounds like a you problem.

275
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,918
Min Ho. Where are you sitting?

276
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,713
Uh, with Lee.

277
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,717
Uh, Alex.

278
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:33,761
Thank you.

279
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,598
- Okay.
- How about a toast, Kitty?

280
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,142
Okay.

281
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,023
Thank you so much for coming, everybody.

282
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,358
This is my first Chuseok,

283
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:51,111
and from what I gather
you are not supposed to do it alone.

284
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:55,240
Maybe your family is thousands
of miles away, like mine,

285
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:59,745
or maybe you don't really have family,
or maybe you just really like school,

286
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:00,662
no judgment.

287
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:06,210
Whatever the reason, I'm grateful
we all have somewhere to be today

288
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,088
and for this chance
to honor all our ancestors.

289
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,716
So, here's a toast.

290
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,678
To all of those who came before us.

291
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:21,141
Thanks, Mom, wherever you are.

292
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:24,061
Without you I wouldn't be here,

293
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:27,272
literally on this Earth, or here at KISS

294
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,567
and there is nowhere else
I would rather be in this moment.

295
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:33,946
Cheers.

296
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,115
Cheers!

297
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,334
This was truly the best meal ever.

298
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:51,463
Yuri, you really eat a lot.
I was surprised.

299
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,802
Oh, oh, no. You take out a little dollop.

300
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,763
Let's put some back.

301
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,682
Like this...

302
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:04,977
Put a little on your skin.

303
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,645
Pat, pat, pat.

304
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:16,780
Oh, I love pears.
I haven't had them in so long.

305
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,157
Have some!

306
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,119
Dae bought them!
Because Mom liked them too!

307
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,245
Mm-hm.

308
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,247
You're a good son.

309
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,127
Of course.

310
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,129
He's a very good son.

311
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,950
- Can you pass the japchae?
- Of course.

312
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,058
Thank you.

313
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,895
This may be my first Chuseok,

314
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,522
but I'm making a promise to myself
it will not be the last.

315
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:54,776
Hmm. Same. I mean, it's funny how we had
to travel halfway across the world

316
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,195
to learn about our roots.

317
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,363
I totally relate to you.

318
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,324
I mean, to the situation.

319
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:04,161
Even though I'm half Korean,
sometimes I feel like I'm zero.

320
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:06,788
My dad tries, but it's not the same.

321
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,123
And your mom?

322
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,419
Mom passed away when I was little.

323
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:16,089
There's a lot that she never got
to teach me and my sisters

324
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:20,761
and a lot that I never got to ask her.

325
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,512
Kitty, I'm sorry.

326
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,974
I'm sure she'd be really proud of you.

327
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:27,850
I am.

328
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:31,772
And I'm grateful that
we both bumbled our way into KISS.

329
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:36,026
Yeah, what made you teach here anyway?

330
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:39,238
Did you just throw a dart
at a map of Korea?

331
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,324
Not exactly.

332
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,661
I knew someone who went here.

333
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,038
- Sort of.
- I'm off...

334
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,457
to fulfill my destiny.

335
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,334
Can't wait to read about it tomorrow.

336
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:58,048
- Oh, wait, you're leaving?
- Hello, hot date with a pop star?

337
00:20:58,632 --> 00:20:59,925
Later, <i>sasaeng.</i>

338
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:06,932
<i>Ugh. Min Ho made me
miss my chance to talk to Alex.</i>

339
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,767
- Do you have any hobbies?
- I do.

340
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,478
<i>But I am not giving up on tonight.</i>

341
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,647
I don't really want to talk about them.

342
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,065
- That's fine.
- Mm-hm.

343
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:29,037
I know I'm no Kitty,
but I think I won them over.

344
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,580
Yeah, you did.

345
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,751
I haven't heard from Kitty at all today.

346
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,171
Maybe it's for the best.

347
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,843
Thanks for coming.

348
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,847
This was honestly
the best Chuseok I've ever had.

349
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,558
Happy Chuseok, pretend girlfriend.

350
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,102
Happy Chuseok, pretend boyfriend.

351
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:55,897
See you.

352
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:58,859
Bye.

353
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,995
This is Dae Heon Kim's house, right?

354
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,331
Yes. I can bring it in for him.

355
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,586
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

356
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:30,515
<i>"Dae, I'm here for you always,
no matter what.</i>

357
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:34,102
<i>No one knows me better than you,
stress socks and all.</i>

358
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,771
<i>XO. Kitty."</i>

359
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,823
No, no, no.

360
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,743
It's happening!

361
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,747
Have you tried them yet? Kitty made them.

362
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,958
They're good. It's my dad's recipe.

363
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:43,046
- The secret ingredient is goat cheese.
- No, thank you.

364
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,383
I'm in the lactose-intolerant majority.

365
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,468
It's a commonality among East Asians.

366
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:53,390
- I'll have more of Min Ho's japchae.
- Oh, I didn't know.

367
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:55,225
Because you lack attention to detail.

368
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,770
If you paid more attention,
your grades wouldn't be suffering.

369
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:04,776
To be fair, my body got used to cheese.
It was in everything where I grew up.

370
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,236
How quaint.

371
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,116
Have you spent much time abroad?

372
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:16,121
- I did my undergrad in the United States.
- Nice, where?

373
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:18,540
- The New England Conservatory.
- Really?

374
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,125
You studied music?

375
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:25,964
It was youthful hubris.
It's not a practical career.

376
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:32,387
Should not have chosen to teach
at an international school.

377
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:36,975
Western teenagers
tend to forget their manners.

378
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:40,937
So why did you then? Choose to work here?

379
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:43,940
It's my alma mater.

380
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,737
Indoor voices.

381
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:50,614
Please.

382
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:55,785
<i>Could Professor Lee be any meaner?
Why is Alex even talking to him?</i>

383
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,247
This is exactly why I never had children.

384
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,002
Excuse me.

385
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:14,888
Oh, God.

386
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:17,682
Min Ho!

387
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,979
Min Ho, where are you?

388
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:26,399
What the hell did you put
in those potatoes?

389
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:31,696
A lot of lactose. Milk, cheese...

390
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,781
God.

391
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,910
Poopy Baby, is that you?

392
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:37,993
Shut up.

393
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:44,376
That's Lulu. You have to get rid of her.
She can't see me like this.

394
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,753
If her fans find out, I'm done for.

395
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,965
Do something. You owe me, Covey.

396
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,008
- Okay, okay.
- Oh, oh.

397
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,469
But don't ruin this for me.
Keep her interested.

398
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:57,597
- How?
- I don't know. You're the matchmaker.

399
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,143
Minny. I'm here!

400
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,813
Hey, Min Ho's running behind.

401
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:10,360
- Who are you?
- I'm Min Ho's 6:00.

402
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:12,279
That jerk double-booked me?

403
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:15,031
You didn't think you'd keep him
all to yourself, did you?

404
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:18,618
He's the hottest guy in school.

405
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:22,872
He's just so sexy and the way that he...

406
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,083
Never mind.

407
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,877
Let me just say that he's ruined me

408
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:31,923
for other boys and men.

409
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,218
That's intriguing.

410
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:38,471
But I refuse to be sloppy seconds.

411
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:42,183
You tell Min Ho I'll be back
at 6:00 tomorrow night.

412
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,853
He better clear the rest of his schedule.

413
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:50,233
When he has a night with me,
he won't be seeing anyone else after.

414
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:52,401
Okay.

415
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,831
You're a genius!
I could hug you right now.

416
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:06,291
Please don't.

417
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,461
Bye!

418
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,189
I'm sorry.

419
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,525
I thought Dad would stay with you.

420
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:36,029
Really? I didn't.

421
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:38,948
It's fine.

422
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,663
If you want...

423
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,125
I'm available for some quality time now.

424
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,420
I'm tired.

425
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,757
And you should get some sleep.

426
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:09,479
Alex, wait, wait.

427
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:13,691
Uh, tonight didn't really go
the way that I planned it.

428
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:16,277
There was something
that I wanted to talk to you about.

429
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,029
Something important.

430
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:30,250
I had suspected for a while,
but everything tonight just confirmed it.

431
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:33,169
- I think I know what you'll say.
- You do?

432
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,427
You haven't been very subtle.

433
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,428
Oh.

434
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:42,846
I know what you know.

435
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,931
- Professor Lee is my father.
- You're my...

436
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:56,317
That's why you came to teach here.

437
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,571
He doesn't know
and I don't want him to know.

438
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:10,540
My mom? Our mom and Lee?

439
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:14,794
<i>Our </i>mom?
