1
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,900
(Fragrance of the First Flower)

2
00:00:47,169 --> 00:00:48,170
Good morning.

3
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:49,629
Morning.

4
00:00:49,796 --> 00:00:50,797
Sleep well?

5
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,135
Have some more sleep.
Xiao-Zhe is still sleeping.

6
00:00:55,302 --> 00:00:56,386
No, I'm fine.

7
00:00:57,262 --> 00:00:58,472
I'm gonna make breakfast.

8
00:00:59,681 --> 00:01:01,266
Why? It's still early.

9
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,060
Did you have a good dream?

10
00:01:25,165 --> 00:01:26,166
Honey,

11
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:28,877
I like the sparkling water
you recently bought home.

12
00:01:30,587 --> 00:01:31,963
By the way,

13
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,174
the bride-cake is almost expired.

14
00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:35,509
I'm gonna eat them up.

15
00:01:40,972 --> 00:01:41,973
Are you going out?

16
00:01:44,434 --> 00:01:45,435
I have a yoga class.

17
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,561
I've told you.

18
00:01:46,686 --> 00:01:47,646
Yeah.

19
00:01:48,271 --> 00:01:49,564
Taking a break is fine.

20
00:01:51,358 --> 00:01:52,734
I know you've been busy...

21
00:01:52,901 --> 00:01:56,530
but there's no more lunch boxes
for Xiao-Zhe in the fridge.

22
00:02:03,703 --> 00:02:04,788
I forgot.

23
00:02:05,831 --> 00:02:06,832
Sorry.

24
00:02:08,124 --> 00:02:10,001
I'm not blaming you.

25
00:02:10,585 --> 00:02:11,920
It happens.

26
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,216
How about I give you the recipe?

27
00:02:16,466 --> 00:02:17,926
You two can cook together.

28
00:02:18,844 --> 00:02:19,845
Me?

29
00:02:20,637 --> 00:02:21,972
I don't even know how to cook.

30
00:02:32,732 --> 00:02:35,026
I marked the dishes Xiao-Zhe can eat.

31
00:02:35,443 --> 00:02:36,695
You can order delivery from them.

32
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,071
See you later.

33
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,781
Okay.

34
00:02:40,156 --> 00:02:41,157
Bye.

35
00:03:10,562 --> 00:03:12,188
- Hey.
- Hey.

36
00:03:16,902 --> 00:03:17,903
I think...

37
00:03:18,028 --> 00:03:20,363
it's about to rain.

38
00:03:22,616 --> 00:03:24,326
Maybe the sun will come up soon.

39
00:03:24,576 --> 00:03:25,869
Why don't we go to a movie first?

40
00:03:30,957 --> 00:03:31,958
What's wrong?

41
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,671
Is Xiao-Zhe all right?

42
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,798
He's fine.

43
00:03:39,925 --> 00:03:41,009
Something about your husband?

44
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:47,682
We're going out to have fun.

45
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:49,434
If you're not in the mood today,

46
00:03:49,601 --> 00:03:51,227
maybe we shouldn't go?

47
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,231
I'm fine.

48
00:03:55,607 --> 00:03:56,608
Let's go.

49
00:03:56,775 --> 00:03:57,567
Hey.

50
00:03:58,777 --> 00:04:00,820
Every time you say you're fine,

51
00:04:01,071 --> 00:04:02,364
you don't look fine.

52
00:04:23,343 --> 00:04:24,886
Pay attention to your hands.

53
00:04:36,064 --> 00:04:37,816
Watch your hands!

54
00:04:38,858 --> 00:04:39,859
What are you laughing at?

55
00:04:40,026 --> 00:04:41,027
Nothing.

56
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,320
Show me how you did it.

57
00:04:46,741 --> 00:04:47,993
What are you doing?

58
00:04:49,244 --> 00:04:50,245
- Stop laughing.
- All right.

59
00:04:50,412 --> 00:04:52,747
I mean it. Your hands. Like this.

60
00:04:53,248 --> 00:04:54,249
And your finger pulps.

61
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:56,376
Okay?

62
00:04:56,543 --> 00:04:58,294
- Come on, be serious.
- Fine.

63
00:05:02,716 --> 00:05:05,468
One, two... what?

64
00:05:06,094 --> 00:05:07,971
You count so slow.

65
00:05:09,764 --> 00:05:13,685
One, two, three, four...

66
00:05:13,852 --> 00:05:17,397
five, six, seven, eight...

67
00:05:18,732 --> 00:05:20,984
nine, ten.

68
00:05:22,318 --> 00:05:23,319
Your turn.

69
00:05:28,575 --> 00:05:29,576
Okay?

70
00:05:32,037 --> 00:05:39,127
One, two, three, four...

71
00:05:40,837 --> 00:05:48,261
five, six, seven, eight...

72
00:05:48,428 --> 00:05:50,638
- I think I will take the exam in July.
- Nine...

73
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,641
- My dad wants me to go to med school.
- Ten.

74
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,101
In Taipei?

75
00:05:56,936 --> 00:05:58,104
Taipei...

76
00:05:58,646 --> 00:06:00,106
I don't think I can get into NTU or TMU.

77
00:06:00,273 --> 00:06:03,359
I will probably go to KMU or CSMU.

78
00:06:04,861 --> 00:06:06,404
You stay in Taipei.

79
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,782
It is not up to me.

80
00:06:08,948 --> 00:06:10,950
Only apply for those schools in Taipei.

81
00:06:11,993 --> 00:06:13,828
No way.

82
00:06:13,995 --> 00:06:15,747
I'll be damned if my parents know that.

83
00:06:19,751 --> 00:06:20,835
So cold tonight.

84
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:22,712
Do you want my jacket?

85
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:23,880
You keep it.

86
00:06:24,047 --> 00:06:25,173
You sure?

87
00:06:26,674 --> 00:06:27,801
Well...

88
00:06:32,597 --> 00:06:33,890
It's too late.

89
00:06:34,891 --> 00:06:36,476
Just a while.

90
00:06:40,313 --> 00:06:41,397
A while?

91
00:06:42,398 --> 00:06:43,441
Just for a while then.

92
00:07:09,425 --> 00:07:10,510
It's been a while.

93
00:07:11,344 --> 00:07:12,887
A bit longer.

94
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,293
Come on, I am stinky.

95
00:07:45,753 --> 00:07:46,754
You smell great.

96
00:07:57,223 --> 00:07:58,766
I really need to go home.

97
00:08:01,895 --> 00:08:02,854
All right.

98
00:08:24,292 --> 00:08:25,376
It's so boring.

99
00:08:26,461 --> 00:08:27,503
Let's go home.

100
00:08:28,254 --> 00:08:29,297
Get off!

101
00:08:33,051 --> 00:08:34,052
Hop on!

102
00:08:34,761 --> 00:08:36,262
Hurry up!

103
00:08:42,435 --> 00:08:43,436
Faster!

104
00:08:48,316 --> 00:08:49,317
Watch out!

105
00:08:49,484 --> 00:08:50,235
Look out!

106
00:09:16,803 --> 00:09:17,804
- Are you okay? - Don't touch me.

107
00:09:25,895 --> 00:09:26,854
Let me help you.

108
00:09:27,021 --> 00:09:29,065
I said I'm fine.
Just leave me alone.

109
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,316
I am Miss Yang
from the Counseling Office.

110
00:10:12,358 --> 00:10:15,945
The reason why I need to talk to you
is because we received a report...

111
00:10:16,154 --> 00:10:19,907
about a suspicious man
who did something inappropriate

112
00:10:20,074 --> 00:10:21,951
to some girls in our school.

113
00:10:22,452 --> 00:10:25,246
So we asked teachers to look into it.

114
00:10:25,913 --> 00:10:26,914
Ting-Ting.

115
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:30,460
This is what you wrote
in your contact book, isn't it?

116
00:10:33,421 --> 00:10:34,422
Yes.

117
00:10:35,631 --> 00:10:38,509
Would you tell me again...

118
00:10:38,718 --> 00:10:40,720
what exactly happened that night?

119
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:52,565
You two were together, right?

120
00:11:00,198 --> 00:11:04,952
What were you two girls doing
out there that late?

121
00:11:07,372 --> 00:11:08,915
Why didn't you go home?

122
00:11:15,129 --> 00:11:16,589
Would you tell me?

123
00:11:23,971 --> 00:11:26,849
It's dangerous out there that late.
Are you aware of that?

124
00:11:33,147 --> 00:11:35,692
Write down the details about that night.

125
00:11:37,026 --> 00:11:38,653
I'll try my best to help you.

126
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,152
Stop following me.

127
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:22,864
I'm worried about you.

128
00:12:23,448 --> 00:12:24,449
You don't have to.

129
00:12:24,615 --> 00:12:26,409
Mind your own business.

130
00:12:28,161 --> 00:12:29,412
I can take care of you.

131
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:31,664
Are you taking the elevator?
I'll walk with you.

132
00:12:32,081 --> 00:12:33,458
I don't need you to be with me.

133
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:36,669
My dad asked me to quit volleyball.

134
00:12:36,836 --> 00:12:40,756
From now on, we'll go home separately.
You don't need to take me home anymore.

135
00:12:43,551 --> 00:12:44,552
What?

136
00:12:45,344 --> 00:12:46,721
I can explain it to your Dad.

137
00:12:46,888 --> 00:12:48,055
What are you gonna say?

138
00:12:50,057 --> 00:12:52,852
I promise I'll get you home safely
so you don't need to quit volleyball.

139
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:54,854
What exactly did you write
on the contact book?

140
00:12:55,021 --> 00:12:56,439
Nothing.

141
00:12:56,606 --> 00:12:58,858
I just don't want others to get harmed.
That's all.

142
00:12:59,025 --> 00:13:01,611
Others won't be like us
being out there that late.

143
00:13:02,195 --> 00:13:03,821
It's only an accident.

144
00:13:03,988 --> 00:13:05,156
It's not an accident.

145
00:13:08,367 --> 00:13:09,619
It's because we're too close.

146
00:13:12,371 --> 00:13:13,789
Why can't we be close?

147
00:13:18,377 --> 00:13:19,921
Because it is strange.

148
00:13:23,174 --> 00:13:24,300
From now on,

149
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:26,052
I will go back home by myself.

150
00:13:26,219 --> 00:13:27,261
I don't need your ride.

151
00:13:28,554 --> 00:13:29,764
Why are you saying that?

152
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:33,643
Why are you being so mad?

153
00:13:34,101 --> 00:13:35,061
I'm not.

154
00:13:39,106 --> 00:13:40,691
Why are you ignoring me?

155
00:13:41,943 --> 00:13:43,694
Because we're not okay.

156
00:13:45,905 --> 00:13:46,906
What are you talking about?

157
00:13:47,073 --> 00:13:48,908
We're disgusting.

158
00:14:37,957 --> 00:14:39,000
Everyone!

159
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,501
Look at the camera.

160
00:14:41,252 --> 00:14:42,253
Where's Yi-Ming?

161
00:14:42,712 --> 00:14:43,879
We told her to come, right?

162
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,007
There she is!

163
00:14:46,173 --> 00:14:47,174
Yi-Ming.

164
00:14:47,341 --> 00:14:48,801
Come on, hurry up!

165
00:14:49,719 --> 00:14:51,762
Run!

166
00:14:53,931 --> 00:14:55,224
Captain Yi-Ming.

167
00:14:55,766 --> 00:14:56,976
Stand here in the middle.

168
00:14:58,561 --> 00:15:00,354
Everyone says "Cheese"!

169
00:15:00,688 --> 00:15:02,189
Count down from ten.

170
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:23,210
Ting-Ting.

171
00:15:30,301 --> 00:15:31,385
So...

172
00:15:32,637 --> 00:15:34,889
No happy graduation for me?

173
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:39,560
Congratulations.

174
00:15:45,816 --> 00:15:48,569
Study hard and practice hard.

175
00:15:49,236 --> 00:15:51,656
I will come back to watch your games

176
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:54,742
like the senior sisters used to do.

177
00:15:57,244 --> 00:15:58,663
You will be back?

178
00:15:59,455 --> 00:16:00,873
If I'm still in Taiwan then.

179
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:03,376
You...

180
00:16:04,794 --> 00:16:06,045
You are going abroad?

181
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,131
Yeah...

182
00:16:09,423 --> 00:16:13,719
My dad wants me to go on exchange
to Canada in my sophomore year.

183
00:16:14,512 --> 00:16:16,847
So, I will probably just stay there.

184
00:16:19,892 --> 00:16:21,185
Let's take pictures

185
00:16:22,978 --> 00:16:23,938
as mementos.

186
00:16:24,689 --> 00:16:25,898
One for you and one for me.

187
00:16:26,482 --> 00:16:27,817
Let me get someone here.

188
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,336
I think it's fine.

189
00:16:47,545 --> 00:16:48,546
Thank you.
