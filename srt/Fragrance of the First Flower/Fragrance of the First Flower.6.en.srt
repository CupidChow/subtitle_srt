1
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,900
(Fragrance of the First Flower)

2
00:00:41,913 --> 00:00:44,416
Miss Huang, we're on the way.

3
00:00:51,047 --> 00:00:52,174
I see.

4
00:00:53,258 --> 00:00:55,093
I will ask her then.

5
00:00:55,761 --> 00:00:56,762
Thanks.

6
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,104
- Hello?
- Where are you?

7
00:01:06,313 --> 00:01:08,315
I didn't see you at the entrance.

8
00:01:09,024 --> 00:01:10,567
I'm at the entrance.

9
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:13,653
I called you right when I walked out.

10
00:01:14,112 --> 00:01:15,864
A guy asked me to leave.

11
00:01:16,114 --> 00:01:17,657
So I couldn't park there.

12
00:01:18,658 --> 00:01:19,659
I told you

13
00:01:19,785 --> 00:01:20,952
call me when you get off work

14
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,370
and meet me at the entrance.

15
00:01:22,913 --> 00:01:24,039
So where are you now?

16
00:01:24,539 --> 00:01:26,541
The main entrance of the building.

17
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:28,001
Fine, just stay there.

18
00:01:28,168 --> 00:01:29,628
Otherwise we'd be late for Xiao-Zhe.

19
00:01:31,713 --> 00:01:33,840
We don't need to pick up Xiao-Zhe.

20
00:01:34,007 --> 00:01:35,008
Why?

21
00:02:07,332 --> 00:02:08,416
Stay in the car.

22
00:02:12,671 --> 00:02:13,672
Hey, Xiao-Zhe.

23
00:02:15,715 --> 00:02:16,842
Thanks for picking him up.

24
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,599
Let's go home, Xiao-Zhe.
Say goodbye.

25
00:02:27,936 --> 00:02:28,937
I'll clarify it to Miss Huang

26
00:02:29,104 --> 00:02:30,105
that you're not part of our family.

27
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,648
So she won't call you afterwards.

28
00:02:32,524 --> 00:02:33,525
Fine with me.

29
00:02:59,634 --> 00:03:00,635
Honey.

30
00:03:01,595 --> 00:03:02,596
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:03,263 --> 00:03:05,098
I was not familiar with the area
near your office.

32
00:03:05,265 --> 00:03:06,433
So I got rushed.

33
00:03:08,602 --> 00:03:09,686
That's fine.

34
00:03:15,483 --> 00:03:17,694
Our son is so cute, right?

35
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:19,154
Xiao-Zhe, let me join you.

36
00:03:19,446 --> 00:03:20,447
No.

37
00:03:22,574 --> 00:03:23,867
He is always cute.

38
00:03:24,117 --> 00:03:25,660
Of course. He's our son.

39
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,126
Are you sure
you're transferring back to Taipei?

40
00:03:33,668 --> 00:03:34,669
Yeah.

41
00:03:35,211 --> 00:03:36,630
Did you tell your Mom?

42
00:03:36,796 --> 00:03:38,089
I did. I said I got a promotion.

43
00:03:38,256 --> 00:03:39,507
She sounded very happy.

44
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,010
You don’t' need to lie to her.

45
00:03:49,684 --> 00:03:51,061
How can I tell her the truth?

46
00:04:01,071 --> 00:04:02,197
I mean,

47
00:04:03,698 --> 00:04:04,783
I think you should talk to me

48
00:04:05,367 --> 00:04:07,160
before you make decisions.

49
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:10,413
Talk about what?

50
00:04:14,542 --> 00:04:15,585
Forget it.

51
00:04:15,752 --> 00:04:17,087
You already decided.

52
00:04:18,672 --> 00:04:20,048
I had to.

53
00:04:20,507 --> 00:04:22,258
What else would happen if I wait?

54
00:04:29,307 --> 00:04:30,433
I'm finished.

55
00:04:32,435 --> 00:04:33,436
I'll do the dishes.

56
00:04:33,603 --> 00:04:35,021
That's fine. I can do it.

57
00:04:36,606 --> 00:04:38,191
I said let me do it.

58
00:04:38,608 --> 00:04:40,485
This is my house. I have the say.

59
00:04:41,361 --> 00:04:42,612
Do you have to be so loud?

60
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:43,780
Yes.

61
00:04:43,947 --> 00:04:45,156
And we have to talk now.

62
00:04:58,628 --> 00:05:01,506
Please do not act like that
in front of Xiao-Zhe.

63
00:05:01,965 --> 00:05:02,966
Act like what?

64
00:05:05,301 --> 00:05:07,220
I don't get it.

65
00:05:07,804 --> 00:05:10,015
You always talk about Xiao-Zhe. Everything, anytime.

66
00:05:10,473 --> 00:05:11,474
So what?

67
00:05:11,641 --> 00:05:12,684
You care about him that much?

68
00:05:13,643 --> 00:05:15,395
Of course I care about him.

69
00:05:15,562 --> 00:05:17,605
Okay, if you do, How could you do such thing?

70
00:05:19,774 --> 00:05:21,192
In love with a woman?

71
00:05:21,443 --> 00:05:22,736
Is it good for him?

72
00:05:26,031 --> 00:05:27,032
Fine.

73
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,575
You wanna talk?

74
00:05:28,742 --> 00:05:29,993
Let's talk now.

75
00:05:31,703 --> 00:05:32,746
Talk.

76
00:05:34,748 --> 00:05:35,749
Talk to me.

77
00:05:35,915 --> 00:05:36,708
What?

78
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,251
Talk to me!

79
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:39,419
Talk about what?

80
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:40,837
You like her. You want to be with her.

81
00:05:41,004 --> 00:05:41,755
All right.

82
00:05:42,005 --> 00:05:43,214
Is she better than me?

83
00:05:44,132 --> 00:05:45,425
Does she earn as much as I do?

84
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:47,761
Is her job stable?

85
00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:50,221
Can she take care of you and Xiao-Zhe?

86
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:52,557
Does she have a car and a house?

87
00:05:54,726 --> 00:05:55,727
Yes or no?

88
00:05:55,894 --> 00:05:57,353
Does she have a car and a house?

89
00:05:57,854 --> 00:05:59,064
Come on, she has nothing.

90
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,774
She knows me.

91
00:06:27,258 --> 00:06:28,718
I have worked tirelessly

92
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,555
for the past ten years.

93
00:06:34,015 --> 00:06:35,517
For our home.

94
00:06:37,811 --> 00:06:39,938
Now you're telling me she knows you.

95
00:06:50,782 --> 00:06:51,825
Go.

96
00:06:57,872 --> 00:06:58,873
Go.

97
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:09,217
What are you doing?

98
00:07:09,384 --> 00:07:10,635
What are you doing?

99
00:07:13,972 --> 00:07:14,973
Go.

100
00:07:15,515 --> 00:07:16,516
Go!

101
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,221
Ting-Ting's Mom.

102
00:09:20,265 --> 00:09:21,683
Oh, hi! Yi-Ming!

103
00:09:22,267 --> 00:09:24,435
Long time no see.

104
00:09:24,602 --> 00:09:25,853
You're as pretty as ever.

105
00:09:26,062 --> 00:09:27,063
Thank you.

106
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,648
You came here to see Ting-Ting?

107
00:09:29,065 --> 00:09:30,775
She doesn't live here anymore.

108
00:09:31,484 --> 00:09:32,777
She doesn't live here?

109
00:09:33,444 --> 00:09:35,321
She lives at her boyfriend's.

110
00:09:37,156 --> 00:09:38,199
She should have got married

111
00:09:38,366 --> 00:09:39,450
at her age.

112
00:09:41,369 --> 00:09:42,912
You're married, aren't you?

113
00:09:45,206 --> 00:09:46,291
That's good.

114
00:09:46,457 --> 00:09:49,085
Better than Ting-Ting.

115
00:09:49,252 --> 00:09:50,878
A 30-year-old woman
still acting like a kid.

116
00:09:51,212 --> 00:09:53,131
Always changing her jobs

117
00:09:53,298 --> 00:09:55,341
and boyfriends.

118
00:09:57,468 --> 00:09:58,469
Come in and have some tea?

119
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,972
No, thanks. I've got to go.

120
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:02,765
I'm going out too.
Let me walk you out there.

121
00:10:02,974 --> 00:10:03,975
Just a second.

122
00:10:04,142 --> 00:10:05,143
Okay.

123
00:10:06,394 --> 00:10:07,979
It's been such a long time.

124
00:10:09,439 --> 00:10:10,732
How are you?

125
00:10:33,046 --> 00:10:34,380
Go get the door.

126
00:10:34,922 --> 00:10:35,923
You go.

127
00:10:36,174 --> 00:10:37,175
Must be your friends.

128
00:10:37,425 --> 00:10:38,885
Come at this hour? No.

129
00:10:39,552 --> 00:10:41,346
My friends wouldn't come so late.

130
00:10:46,934 --> 00:10:47,935
Who is it?

131
00:10:52,857 --> 00:10:54,192
Be right back.

132
00:11:09,207 --> 00:11:10,208
Yi-Ming.

133
00:11:17,673 --> 00:11:19,550
Yi-Ming, can we talk?

134
00:11:26,391 --> 00:11:27,392
Yi-Ming!

135
00:11:27,767 --> 00:11:29,310
Stop following me!

136
00:11:31,187 --> 00:11:32,188
Yi-Ming Jiang!

137
00:11:32,313 --> 00:11:33,856
What the hell do you want?

138
00:11:43,616 --> 00:11:45,701
You think it's fun?

139
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:47,203
Did you plan all this?

140
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,372
Are you trying to get back at me?

141
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,668
What are you talking about?

142
00:11:56,045 --> 00:11:58,631
I did everything just for you.
Don’t you feel it?

143
00:11:59,924 --> 00:12:02,009
What exactly am I to you?

144
00:12:04,345 --> 00:12:06,305
I just need a simple answer.

145
00:12:07,682 --> 00:12:09,809
I want to know
everything we had was real,

146
00:12:09,976 --> 00:12:11,394
not my imagination.

147
00:12:13,646 --> 00:12:14,981
I like you.

148
00:12:16,357 --> 00:12:18,276
Would you dare to say so?

149
00:12:20,111 --> 00:12:22,488
You don't know what I'm going through.

150
00:12:23,698 --> 00:12:25,450
I have my kid...

151
00:12:25,867 --> 00:12:27,827
and my family.

152
00:12:27,994 --> 00:12:28,995
So what?

153
00:12:29,162 --> 00:12:30,621
Who do you think you are?

154
00:12:30,788 --> 00:12:32,790
You came to break up my family...

155
00:12:33,499 --> 00:12:34,750
but you have a boyfriend.

156
00:12:34,917 --> 00:12:36,043
Who are you to judge me?

157
00:12:37,378 --> 00:12:39,547
It's you who told me to date other guys.

158
00:12:40,673 --> 00:12:43,301
It's you who thought
that we're disgusting.

159
00:12:43,468 --> 00:12:44,469
That was in high school!

160
00:12:44,635 --> 00:12:45,636
Yi-Ming Jiang.

161
00:12:47,763 --> 00:12:49,432
Do you know how selfish you are?

162
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,227
I like you for who you are.

163
00:12:53,853 --> 00:12:55,396
I give you everything you want.

164
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,483
But every time, you chose to leave me...

165
00:13:00,359 --> 00:13:02,820
because you can't be true to yourself.

166
00:13:06,491 --> 00:13:07,533
You know...

167
00:13:09,494 --> 00:13:12,538
You know what I hate myself so much because I like girls.

168
00:13:14,499 --> 00:13:17,460
I've been thinking
if you weren't my first crush,

169
00:13:17,752 --> 00:13:19,629
maybe I would be more confident.

170
00:13:32,725 --> 00:13:34,060
I like you.

171
00:13:36,771 --> 00:13:39,982
When I met you again,
I knew I never forgot you.

172
00:13:41,901 --> 00:13:44,195
I can do anything for you.

173
00:13:45,446 --> 00:13:47,281
I can break up with my boyfriend...

174
00:13:48,074 --> 00:13:49,867
if that's what you want.

175
00:14:10,221 --> 00:14:12,598
I never know what I really want.

176
00:14:16,894 --> 00:14:18,437
So I envy you.

177
00:14:20,523 --> 00:14:22,024
You have a free spirit.

178
00:14:22,775 --> 00:14:24,068
So pure.

179
00:14:24,694 --> 00:14:26,112
Every time when I'm with you,

180
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,613
I can be myself.

181
00:14:30,616 --> 00:14:33,202
I feel supported
even when I make mistakes.

182
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,083
I'm happy to be with you.

183
00:14:40,501 --> 00:14:43,045
I see Xiao-Zhe happy too.

184
00:14:43,296 --> 00:14:45,715
The happiness is real.

185
00:14:50,678 --> 00:14:52,054
I cherish...

186
00:14:53,055 --> 00:14:57,268
every moment of us, very, very much.

187
00:14:58,102 --> 00:15:01,939
Because it might be one last time.

188
00:15:32,928 --> 00:15:34,180
I'm sorry.

189
00:15:45,024 --> 00:15:46,400
