1
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,900
(Fragrance of the First Flower)

2
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:24,062
Good job, guys.

3
00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:27,023
We're going to a hot pot restaurant.

4
00:00:32,863 --> 00:00:34,740
- Why are you here?
- See you in a bit.

5
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,243
I saw the event on PTT BBS.

6
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:39,411
You are on PTT BBS?

7
00:00:39,578 --> 00:00:40,954
I'm about to be a college student.

8
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:44,082
Surprise!

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,001
Thank you.

10
00:00:47,836 --> 00:00:49,713
I didn't know you dance.

11
00:00:50,213 --> 00:00:51,214
Don't laugh at me.

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,841
You did great.

13
00:00:54,342 --> 00:00:55,343
Everyone,

14
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:56,720
put the props back by ten.

15
00:00:56,887 --> 00:00:58,138
The building will be closed.

16
00:00:58,305 --> 00:00:59,806
Then head out to the hot pot restaurant.

17
00:01:00,098 --> 00:01:01,391
Okay!

18
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:03,685
Are you going with them?

19
00:01:03,894 --> 00:01:05,896
Yeah. It's an after party.

20
00:01:07,898 --> 00:01:09,608
Can I go with you?

21
00:01:10,901 --> 00:01:13,653
But the tables might be full.

22
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,447
And it will be a bit late.

23
00:01:17,949 --> 00:01:20,494
Or I can wait and take you home later?

24
00:01:22,037 --> 00:01:23,580
I'm not living with my parents.

25
00:01:23,789 --> 00:01:25,373
I share an apartment with my friend.

26
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:28,627
My dad thought I live at the dorm.

27
00:01:31,296 --> 00:01:33,089
So where do you live now?

28
00:01:33,256 --> 00:01:34,257
- Yi-Ming.
- I...

29
00:01:35,342 --> 00:01:36,343
Shall we go?

30
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,178
- Sure. Just one second. - Okay. Let me take these.

31
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,641
I'll go get my bike.

32
00:01:42,808 --> 00:01:43,767
Okay.

33
00:01:51,608 --> 00:01:52,901
Is he "your friend"?

34
00:01:55,529 --> 00:01:56,530
Boyfriend?

35
00:02:01,576 --> 00:02:03,161
Seriously? So soon?

36
00:02:10,377 --> 00:02:11,378
Ting-Ting.

37
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,547
What?

38
00:02:14,798 --> 00:02:15,841
Ting-Ting.

39
00:02:17,634 --> 00:02:18,635
Hey.

40
00:02:19,886 --> 00:02:21,096
What's wrong with you?

41
00:02:21,471 --> 00:02:22,556
What's the matter?

42
00:02:26,143 --> 00:02:27,143
Nothing.

43
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,105
Can you tell me?

44
00:02:34,359 --> 00:02:35,360
You should go.

45
00:02:42,784 --> 00:02:43,827
You sure?

46
00:02:49,374 --> 00:02:50,876
Why did you choose him?

47
00:02:53,378 --> 00:02:54,838
What do you mean?

48
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,507
You don't even like him.

49
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,968
I... I do.

50
00:03:01,136 --> 00:03:02,596
You like him very much?

51
00:03:04,472 --> 00:03:07,851
It's common to date someone in college.

52
00:03:08,268 --> 00:03:09,436
Everyone does that.

53
00:03:09,603 --> 00:03:12,063
You are not like everyone else.
You could have been more special.

54
00:03:13,481 --> 00:03:16,860
Every girl I meet has a boyfriend.

55
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:23,742
Then what about me?

56
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,086
You will also meet someone
who likes you...

57
00:03:35,253 --> 00:03:36,254
and you like him, too.

58
00:03:36,421 --> 00:03:37,422
He will be there with you.

59
00:03:40,717 --> 00:03:42,344
You'll be fine.

60
00:03:57,108 --> 00:03:58,652
I really have got to go.

61
00:04:00,487 --> 00:04:01,655
It's a bit late.

62
00:04:10,038 --> 00:04:11,039
I think,

63
00:04:12,415 --> 00:04:15,126
there are some differences
between friendship and romantic love.

64
00:04:19,255 --> 00:04:20,257
Sorry.

65
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:22,342
Bye.

66
00:04:37,524 --> 00:04:38,608
Why took so long?

67
00:04:39,275 --> 00:04:40,360
Why took so long?

68
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:42,028
Nothing.

69
00:04:42,195 --> 00:04:43,196
Who's she?

70
00:04:43,613 --> 00:04:44,614
My junior schoolmate in high school.

71
00:04:44,781 --> 00:04:45,740
She's in high school?

72
00:04:45,907 --> 00:04:46,908
What?

73
00:04:47,075 --> 00:04:49,160
A-De wants her number. Not me.

74
00:04:49,327 --> 00:04:51,037
- Stop it.
- I said it's not me.

75
00:04:51,204 --> 00:04:52,247
- Fine. Let's go.
- Go.

76
00:04:52,414 --> 00:04:53,415
Hold tight.

77
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:47,886
Something on your mind?

78
00:05:49,471 --> 00:05:50,638
Nothing.

79
00:05:52,891 --> 00:05:54,350
I think there's something.

80
00:05:55,977 --> 00:05:56,978
I'm fine. I promise.

81
00:05:57,854 --> 00:05:59,689
There's no need to pretend
in front of me.

82
00:06:00,023 --> 00:06:01,066
You can tell me anything.

83
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:06,905
How about we get away with Xiao-Zhe?

84
00:06:07,614 --> 00:06:08,823
Please don't say that.

85
00:06:09,616 --> 00:06:11,659
You don't have to get stuck here.

86
00:06:12,118 --> 00:06:13,119
But...

87
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,662
this is my home.

88
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,043
Is this a home that you really want?

89
00:06:21,503 --> 00:06:23,254
You said you'd like to get married
and have kids.

90
00:06:23,463 --> 00:06:24,714
You did everything.

91
00:06:25,924 --> 00:06:27,217
But are you happy?

92
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:31,638
Are you sure you know
what you really want?

93
00:06:38,144 --> 00:06:39,395
I am here for you.

94
00:06:55,078 --> 00:06:56,079
Yi-Ming.

95
00:07:03,336 --> 00:07:04,337
Sweetie.

96
00:07:04,546 --> 00:07:06,005
Where were you going?

97
00:07:06,673 --> 00:07:08,508
Just bought some stuff.

98
00:07:09,634 --> 00:07:10,635
Hi.

99
00:07:25,525 --> 00:07:26,526
Here is some fruit.

100
00:07:28,736 --> 00:07:30,572
Have some.

101
00:07:30,989 --> 00:07:32,323
Ting-Ting, what a coincidence!

102
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,658
You two went to the same high school.

103
00:07:34,576 --> 00:07:35,577
Yeah.

104
00:07:35,743 --> 00:07:37,745
On that day, I found
your wife looked familiar to me.

105
00:07:37,912 --> 00:07:39,831
So I looked up my high school yearbook

106
00:07:39,998 --> 00:07:41,791
and realized we were schoolmates.

107
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:43,960
Have some fruit.

108
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,461
Okay.

109
00:07:47,714 --> 00:07:48,965
Or have some drinks.

110
00:07:49,132 --> 00:07:51,634
Honey, I really like the sparkling water
you recently bought.

111
00:07:51,801 --> 00:07:53,678
I drank a lot.
So I went to get some more.

112
00:07:54,929 --> 00:07:55,930
Ting-Ting, do you wanna try it?

113
00:07:56,681 --> 00:07:57,932
Sure. It's my favorite.

114
00:07:59,058 --> 00:08:00,059
Here you go.

115
00:08:02,061 --> 00:08:03,062
I'm good.

116
00:08:08,735 --> 00:08:09,777
Right, I remember there're some...

117
00:08:09,944 --> 00:08:13,531
Honey, where is the box that
you always kept every time we moved?

118
00:08:13,698 --> 00:08:15,033
Your collection of mementos.

119
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,244
Maybe we can find some photos
you took back in high school.

120
00:08:18,536 --> 00:08:20,163
Let's check it out.

121
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:24,000
Really? I thought she threw them away.

122
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:25,335
No. They are precious to her.

123
00:08:25,501 --> 00:08:27,420
She insisted keeping them when we moved.

124
00:08:31,758 --> 00:08:32,759
Where is it?

125
00:08:32,926 --> 00:08:37,138
I think it's time for Xiao-Zhe to go to bed.

126
00:08:37,764 --> 00:08:39,682
Why don't you take him to bed?

127
00:08:40,516 --> 00:08:42,393
- Yeah, it's quite late.
- And I think...

128
00:08:42,644 --> 00:08:43,853
Ting-Ting should go home.

129
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,024
Honey, how about...
you two catch up tonight?

130
00:08:48,191 --> 00:08:50,068
I'll take the couch.

131
00:08:50,235 --> 00:08:51,486
That's fine. Let me walk you downstairs.

132
00:08:51,903 --> 00:08:52,904
Let's go.

133
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,160
Go.

134
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:04,290
Bye.

135
00:09:04,999 --> 00:09:06,000
Thanks.

136
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:07,168
Bye.

137
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,611
Honey.

138
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:18,197
So Ting-Ting was your schoolmate?

139
00:10:22,744 --> 00:10:24,746
Did she change a lot?

140
00:10:24,912 --> 00:10:26,998
How could you not recognize her?

141
00:10:32,378 --> 00:10:35,882
I mean, I followed her Instagram.

142
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:39,927
I saw a photo of her with Jia-Xin
at the wedding.

143
00:10:40,094 --> 00:10:42,430
You didn't see her then?

144
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:48,436
Nothing.

145
00:10:48,603 --> 00:10:50,855
Just chatting.

146
00:11:01,616 --> 00:11:02,617
Baby.

147
00:11:05,119 --> 00:11:06,579
Can we talk?

148
00:11:07,288 --> 00:11:09,082
Sure. Talk about what?

149
00:11:22,303 --> 00:11:23,596
I know

150
00:11:23,971 --> 00:11:28,434
we made a decision
after Xiao-Zhe was born.

151
00:11:29,018 --> 00:11:30,770
You stay in Hsinchu for your job.

152
00:11:31,062 --> 00:11:34,232
I stay in Taipei
for Xiao-Zhe and my Dad.

153
00:11:40,321 --> 00:11:43,032
- What's wrong with that? - No, it's just...

154
00:11:47,495 --> 00:11:50,206
- Are you tired?
- No. I just...

155
00:11:50,373 --> 00:11:54,877
We haven't talked about
Xiao-Zhe seriously.

156
00:11:56,462 --> 00:11:58,548
So I was just wondering...

157
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:02,635
maybe you should spend
more time on him.

158
00:12:02,802 --> 00:12:05,263
I understand you wanna
relax after work...

159
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,098
play video games...

160
00:12:07,473 --> 00:12:08,474
that's fine.

161
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:10,059
You work very hard.

162
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:16,482
But... it just...

163
00:12:17,233 --> 00:12:19,193
Every time I told you about these,

164
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,820
you seemed indifferent.

165
00:12:21,195 --> 00:12:24,240
Sometimes you'd buy him toys,

166
00:12:24,532 --> 00:12:26,159
but what he really needs is...

167
00:12:26,325 --> 00:12:28,244
- Fine. Honey.
- Just...

168
00:12:28,828 --> 00:12:32,331
I know it's hard for you.

169
00:12:32,498 --> 00:12:35,168
It must be stressful
to take care of Xiao-Zhe.

170
00:12:35,334 --> 00:12:37,837
- No, I...
- But, listen.

171
00:12:38,004 --> 00:12:40,423
You've brought it up several times.

172
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,801
The school is the real problem.

173
00:12:43,968 --> 00:12:47,221
- No, the school...
- The problems will go away with time.

174
00:12:47,388 --> 00:12:48,764
Xiao-Zhe will grow up.

175
00:12:48,931 --> 00:12:51,476
Everything will be fine.
We will be fine, too.

176
00:12:51,642 --> 00:12:53,519
Nothing wrong with the school.

177
00:12:53,686 --> 00:12:55,730
We need to face the fact that

178
00:12:55,897 --> 00:12:58,941
Xiao-Zhe is a little bit different.

179
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:02,028
He needs more of your company...

180
00:13:02,195 --> 00:13:05,114
not the toys you bought
when you came back.

181
00:13:05,281 --> 00:13:06,616
It's not a bad thing.

182
00:13:06,782 --> 00:13:08,993
Listen. How's that?

183
00:13:11,287 --> 00:13:12,872
I transfer back to Taipei.

184
00:13:13,414 --> 00:13:15,041
I'm not asking you to do that.

185
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:16,542
You won't say that I'm not home...

186
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:19,337
You can't transfer back.
That's not what I meant.

187
00:13:19,504 --> 00:13:20,880
Your Mom won't agree.

188
00:13:21,047 --> 00:13:24,258
You're always like that
when we talk about this.

189
00:13:24,425 --> 00:13:27,094
We're not on the same page.

190
00:13:27,512 --> 00:13:28,554
Then how about this?

191
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,181
Now.

192
00:13:30,473 --> 00:13:32,850
Write down everything
you'd like me to do.

193
00:13:33,017 --> 00:13:34,685
Like Xiao-Zhe's recipe.

194
00:13:34,852 --> 00:13:36,687
Make a list.

195
00:13:37,146 --> 00:13:39,732
One, two, three, four...

196
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:40,900
check them off when I'm done.

197
00:13:41,025 --> 00:13:42,818
If I can't make it, let's talk then.

198
00:13:42,985 --> 00:13:46,447
- Would that work? - Raising a child is not cooking.

199
00:13:46,656 --> 00:13:47,657
But the thing is...

200
00:13:47,823 --> 00:13:51,077
- You need to understand him.
- So I said I can transfer.

201
00:13:51,244 --> 00:13:53,204
- I'm not asking you to do that.
- And you don't want it.

202
00:13:53,371 --> 00:13:54,705
You're contradicting yourself,

203
00:13:54,872 --> 00:13:56,249
and repeat yourself.

204
00:13:56,457 --> 00:13:58,876
- I want you to be with Xiao-Zhe...
- But if you transfer...

205
00:13:59,043 --> 00:14:00,294
I have no idea what you're saying.

206
00:14:00,461 --> 00:14:04,131
I'm in love with someone!
Do you get it?

207
00:14:12,765 --> 00:14:14,183
What are you talking about?

208
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,772
What do you mean by that?

209
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:25,570
- You said you're busy for Xiao-Zhe?
- I'm busy.

210
00:14:25,736 --> 00:14:27,071
You have time to see someone?

211
00:14:27,238 --> 00:14:29,198
- I need to work and pick up Xiao-Zhe...
- Who is he?

212
00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:31,367
- It doesn't matter.
- How come it doesn't matter?

213
00:14:31,576 --> 00:14:32,910
It's the only thing that matters.

214
00:14:33,369 --> 00:14:34,870
I don't care about anything else.

215
00:14:35,037 --> 00:14:36,622
- All I know is you fall in love with...
- It doesn't matter.

216
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:38,291
That's not the point.

217
00:14:38,499 --> 00:14:41,877
You dared to tell me you cheated.
Just tell me who he is.

218
00:14:42,044 --> 00:14:43,045
Just let it go.

219
00:14:43,212 --> 00:14:44,338
You have to tell me.

220
00:14:44,505 --> 00:14:45,631
Ting-Ting!

221
00:14:52,471 --> 00:14:55,641
Ting-Ting?
The girl who was in our house?

222
00:14:56,976 --> 00:14:58,519
Are you kidding me?

223
00:14:59,145 --> 00:15:00,563
Are you crazy?

224
00:15:01,731 --> 00:15:03,232
She is a woman.

225
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:04,942
Come on.

226
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:08,529
You knew each other back in high school.

227
00:15:08,738 --> 00:15:10,364
You may have mutual interests.

228
00:15:10,531 --> 00:15:14,285
But come on, that's friendship,
not romantic love.

229
00:15:14,952 --> 00:15:17,204
Not the romantic relationship like us.

230
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,914
Do you get it now?

231
00:15:19,498 --> 00:15:20,708
That's ridiculous.

232
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,586
Come up with a better excuse
if you want a divorce.

233
00:15:24,837 --> 00:15:26,547
You're being ridiculous!
