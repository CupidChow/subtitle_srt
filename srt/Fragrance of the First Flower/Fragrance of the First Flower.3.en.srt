1
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,900
(Fragrance of the First Flower)

2
00:00:37,284 --> 00:00:38,827
No cheating.

3
00:00:40,203 --> 00:00:41,663
I'm not cheating.

4
00:00:41,872 --> 00:00:43,123
What are you doing then?

5
00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:47,294
Fine, teach me.

6
00:00:51,757 --> 00:00:52,883
Which one?

7
00:01:01,183 --> 00:01:03,268
The formula is wrong.

8
00:01:03,727 --> 00:01:05,687
It's too hard for me.

9
00:01:23,497 --> 00:01:24,498
Hang on.

10
00:01:25,081 --> 00:01:26,082
See?

11
00:01:26,249 --> 00:01:27,375
I told you it's hard.

12
00:01:41,556 --> 00:01:43,767
It'll also be in your review test.

13
00:01:45,143 --> 00:01:46,812
It's freshmen level.

14
00:01:48,271 --> 00:01:49,773
You're in your senior year.

15
00:01:50,732 --> 00:01:51,942
You should know how to solve it,
shouldn't you?

16
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,318
You're annoying.

17
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,070
- You've forgotten it all.
- Shut up.

18
00:01:55,237 --> 00:01:58,573
So you and I are in the same level...
Not a big deal.

19
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:02,244
- What? - No cheating!

20
00:02:02,494 --> 00:02:03,620
I just need to review.

21
00:02:03,912 --> 00:02:05,038
You can't review now.

22
00:02:05,205 --> 00:02:07,749
This is not an exam.

23
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:09,584
You did the same thing as me.
No way.

24
00:02:10,001 --> 00:02:12,170
I just need to check a formula.

25
00:02:12,337 --> 00:02:13,338
No way!

26
00:02:13,505 --> 00:02:15,507
- Don't be annoying!
- No means no!

27
00:02:15,674 --> 00:02:16,758
Stop it.

28
00:02:28,687 --> 00:02:29,688
Do it yourself.

29
00:02:32,315 --> 00:02:33,441
Give me your pen.

30
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:36,987
Sit up.

31
00:02:39,406 --> 00:02:41,324
Your head is heavy.

32
00:02:51,626 --> 00:02:52,627
How about this one?

33
00:02:52,836 --> 00:02:53,837
Not bad.

34
00:02:54,004 --> 00:02:55,005
Nice.

35
00:02:55,171 --> 00:02:56,548
Even better with this.

36
00:03:02,262 --> 00:03:04,014
Too warm for now.

37
00:03:07,183 --> 00:03:09,144
Your Mom has a ton of clothes.

38
00:03:09,477 --> 00:03:12,063
Yeah, she loves shopping.

39
00:03:26,578 --> 00:03:27,579
Sorry.

40
00:03:49,601 --> 00:03:50,810
Why are you standing there?

41
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:53,939
Nothing.

42
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,526
Don't watch me. That's weird.

43
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,403
It's not a big deal.

44
00:04:01,738 --> 00:04:03,615
No... you turn back.

45
00:04:05,241 --> 00:04:06,701
You can watch mine, too.

46
00:04:08,995 --> 00:04:09,996
It's nothing.

47
00:04:12,749 --> 00:04:13,792
See.

48
00:04:23,885 --> 00:04:24,886
Have you...

49
00:04:25,387 --> 00:04:27,055
touched anyone before?

50
00:04:29,808 --> 00:04:31,142
Of course not.

51
00:04:32,102 --> 00:04:34,062
You're a senior, aren't you?

52
00:04:35,897 --> 00:04:37,983
So what?

53
00:04:39,484 --> 00:04:41,069
You should know better.

54
00:04:42,237 --> 00:04:43,488
No, I don’t.

55
00:05:59,105 --> 00:06:00,565
Your home is beautiful.

56
00:06:02,442 --> 00:06:03,485
Is it?

57
00:06:05,195 --> 00:06:06,571
You think so?

58
00:06:06,905 --> 00:06:08,114
Yeah, it's beautiful.

59
00:06:09,491 --> 00:06:11,117
Your Dad must make lots of money.

60
00:06:11,284 --> 00:06:14,120
My Mom doesn't think it's enough.

61
00:06:14,954 --> 00:06:16,706
Why do they need so much money?

62
00:06:16,998 --> 00:06:17,999
I don't know.

63
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:19,918
I guess, for them,

64
00:06:20,085 --> 00:06:22,337
working is easier than parenting.

65
00:06:24,964 --> 00:06:26,674
Do you want a lot of money?

66
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,635
No.

67
00:06:30,595 --> 00:06:31,596
What?

68
00:06:32,472 --> 00:06:34,974
I believe that means a lot.

69
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,476
No, it doesn't.

70
00:06:37,602 --> 00:06:40,355
Anyway, I'll work hard to make money.

71
00:06:40,814 --> 00:06:42,524
What for?

72
00:06:42,941 --> 00:06:43,983
For you.

73
00:06:45,068 --> 00:06:46,861
For me?

74
00:06:52,242 --> 00:06:54,953
What's your ideal house in the future?

75
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,333
I don't know.

76
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,168
But I think,

77
00:07:03,086 --> 00:07:05,463
it'd be great to have bar stools.

78
00:07:06,756 --> 00:07:11,136
You know, in the movies,
the fancy bar stools by the window.

79
00:07:15,974 --> 00:07:16,975
What?

80
00:07:17,142 --> 00:07:18,143
What?

81
00:07:19,185 --> 00:07:20,770
Then, in our house,

82
00:07:21,187 --> 00:07:23,064
we'll have bar stools by the window.

83
00:07:23,565 --> 00:07:24,774
What color?

84
00:07:26,192 --> 00:07:29,320
I didn't mean roommates.

85
00:07:29,696 --> 00:07:31,823
I mean, after I get married, I will...

86
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:36,161
have a house with my husband and kids.

87
00:07:47,922 --> 00:07:52,385
We don't necessarily need to get married
to have a home.

88
00:07:53,636 --> 00:07:55,346
You don't wanna get married?

89
00:08:05,398 --> 00:08:06,608
Cheers.

90
00:08:07,525 --> 00:08:09,694
No. It's bitter.

91
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:25,960
Why do you want to get married
and have kids?

92
00:08:28,755 --> 00:08:30,882
Then what should we do after growing up?

93
00:08:42,644 --> 00:08:44,729
Let's bring cars here.

94
00:08:45,813 --> 00:08:48,233
It's cars' home.

95
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,401
Their home.

96
00:08:50,568 --> 00:08:52,737
Cars have to go home.

97
00:08:54,197 --> 00:08:55,865
Cars have to go home.

98
00:09:12,257 --> 00:09:13,258
It's ready.

99
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:14,300
It's ready?

100
00:09:17,011 --> 00:09:18,429
I'm gonna take this.

101
00:09:18,596 --> 00:09:20,098
It's mine.

102
00:09:21,224 --> 00:09:23,184
Why did you pour it into sugar?

103
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:25,436
It's all dissolved.

104
00:09:27,939 --> 00:09:29,482
- Here you go.
- It's for me?

105
00:09:29,607 --> 00:09:30,817
- Yummy.
- Thank you.

106
00:09:31,609 --> 00:09:33,319
You made this?

107
00:09:33,987 --> 00:09:36,906
- We don't need eggs now.
- Xiao-Zhe's mother, can we have a word?

108
00:09:37,073 --> 00:09:38,074
Yeah, sure.

109
00:10:57,528 --> 00:10:59,447
Let me get you a pajama.

110
00:11:05,703 --> 00:11:06,704
Thanks.

111
00:11:06,871 --> 00:11:07,872
And towel.

112
00:11:16,923 --> 00:11:17,924
Ting-Ting.

113
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,051
I'll show you the bathroom.

114
00:11:25,973 --> 00:11:28,309
The green one is shampoo,
and the black one is body wash.

115
00:11:29,102 --> 00:11:30,186
Toothpaste.

116
00:11:31,062 --> 00:11:32,063
This one.

117
00:11:32,188 --> 00:11:33,606
Help yourself.

118
00:11:33,815 --> 00:11:35,692
It's skin cream after cleansing.

119
00:11:41,114 --> 00:11:42,615
Let me know if you need anything else.

120
00:11:59,674 --> 00:12:00,633
Hey.

121
00:12:03,428 --> 00:12:05,513
Thank you for being with us.

122
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:09,600
Why?

123
00:12:09,767 --> 00:12:10,768
It's nothing.

124
00:12:13,396 --> 00:12:14,939
Would your mom be worried

125
00:12:15,148 --> 00:12:16,774
if you're not home overnight?

126
00:12:17,692 --> 00:12:19,026
She won't care about that.

127
00:12:19,986 --> 00:12:23,614
I'm happy being with you and Xiao-Zhe.

128
00:12:31,706 --> 00:12:33,249
You sure you're not getting married?

129
00:12:35,168 --> 00:12:36,377
For what?

130
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:42,425
You'd be taken care of when you get old.

131
00:12:47,638 --> 00:12:49,056
Are you worried about me?

132
00:12:52,477 --> 00:12:54,854
I mean it.

133
00:12:56,564 --> 00:12:58,566
Think about it?

134
00:13:16,876 --> 00:13:18,794
You didn't change much.

135
00:13:22,256 --> 00:13:23,299
Neither did you.

136
00:13:24,467 --> 00:13:27,345
You're still good-looking.

137
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:33,392
Have you had short hair before?

138
00:13:34,477 --> 00:13:35,311
Yes.

139
00:13:35,728 --> 00:13:37,021
About...

140
00:13:38,147 --> 00:13:39,273
this short.

141
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,744
Have you touched any other girl?

142
00:13:56,082 --> 00:13:57,083
You?

143
00:13:59,669 --> 00:14:00,962
Yeah, some girls.

144
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:04,006
Some? How many?

145
00:14:06,217 --> 00:14:07,593
So you only date guys?

146
00:14:09,428 --> 00:14:10,846
Do you also date men?

147
00:14:12,682 --> 00:14:15,309
Yeah, sometimes.

148
00:14:16,435 --> 00:14:19,355
Sometimes? You're a pro.

149
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:25,611
So what's the difference
between men and women?

150
00:14:27,572 --> 00:14:30,032
Quite different.

151
00:14:31,576 --> 00:14:33,369
What do you mean?

152
00:14:36,622 --> 00:14:38,082
You wanna know?

153
00:14:43,254 --> 00:14:44,297
Good night.

154
00:14:45,172 --> 00:14:46,382
I'm going to sleep.

155
00:14:46,591 --> 00:14:47,592
Good night.
