1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,900
(Fragrance of the First Flower)

2
00:00:39,953 --> 00:00:40,954
Thank you.

3
00:00:41,621 --> 00:00:42,789
Welcome.

4
00:00:43,373 --> 00:00:44,374
- Hi.
- Hi.

5
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:46,376
It's a red envelope for the bride...

6
00:00:46,752 --> 00:00:48,837
We take red envelopes for both brides.

7
00:00:49,045 --> 00:00:50,338
- Both brides?
- Yes.

8
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:59,014
I think I'm mistaken.

9
00:00:59,222 --> 00:01:00,223
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

10
00:01:00,432 --> 00:01:01,475
- No worries.
- I'm so sorry.

11
00:01:01,683 --> 00:01:03,685
Yi-Ming! This way!

12
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:05,812
- So embarrassing.
- I got to the wrong side.

13
00:01:06,021 --> 00:01:07,147
- That's another wedding.
- Oh my...

14
00:01:07,397 --> 00:01:09,191
- Are you tired?
- A little bit.

15
00:01:09,357 --> 00:01:10,358
Your husband?

16
00:01:10,525 --> 00:01:11,943
He's in Taipei on weekends, isn't he?

17
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:14,321
He is home with Xiao-Zhe.

18
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,239
He should do that more often.

19
00:01:16,531 --> 00:01:17,741
You have been overloading.

20
00:01:18,074 --> 00:01:20,076
He would help sometimes.

21
00:01:22,454 --> 00:01:23,580
How's Xiao-Zhe?

22
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:25,040
He is good.

23
00:01:25,207 --> 00:01:26,249
Getting better.

24
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,501
That's great.

25
00:01:28,251 --> 00:01:29,503
Good for you, too.

26
00:01:51,858 --> 00:01:55,529
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to
Guo-Hau and Ya-Ting's wedding.

27
00:01:55,695 --> 00:01:57,864
They've been together
for more than ten years.

28
00:01:58,073 --> 00:01:59,074
Are you okay?

29
00:01:59,241 --> 00:02:00,242
It's fine, never mind.

30
00:02:01,743 --> 00:02:04,037
Let's welcome the bride and groom.

31
00:02:04,204 --> 00:02:06,164
I'd go to the restroom.

32
00:02:16,466 --> 00:02:19,594
Thank you everyone for coming
to Elizabeth and Annabelle's wedding.

33
00:02:19,928 --> 00:02:22,305
I'd like to know about their first time.

34
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:25,475
So, well, tell us...

35
00:02:25,976 --> 00:02:28,603
how you felt about each other
the first time you met.

36
00:02:29,187 --> 00:02:32,482
The first time we met was...
like this moment right now.

37
00:02:32,649 --> 00:02:34,526
Nervous and exciting.

38
00:02:34,985 --> 00:02:36,611
Use a kind of flower to describe?

39
00:02:36,903 --> 00:02:38,321
Burning Lily.

40
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:41,032
Why Burning Lily?

41
00:02:41,157 --> 00:02:42,576
Because lilies symbolize

42
00:02:42,868 --> 00:02:45,495
the purity in a lesbian relationship.

43
00:02:45,662 --> 00:02:46,580
And she's also the one

44
00:02:46,746 --> 00:02:48,498
who would set me on fire.

45
00:02:48,915 --> 00:02:50,208
Congratulations on your marriage.

46
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,127
May your love continue to grow.

47
00:03:07,893 --> 00:03:08,894
Long time no see.

48
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,061
You also came.

49
00:03:10,228 --> 00:03:11,521
Let's go talk to them.

50
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:14,190
Hi.

51
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:15,442
Hi.

52
00:03:16,234 --> 00:03:17,402
It's been a long time.

53
00:03:17,611 --> 00:03:19,029
It's really been a while.

54
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:24,826
It seems cool.

55
00:03:26,912 --> 00:03:29,414
Have you been to any wedding like this?

56
00:03:29,956 --> 00:03:30,957
You mean...

57
00:03:31,249 --> 00:03:31,833
Well...

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,377
two grooms or two brides.

59
00:03:36,254 --> 00:03:37,339
No.

60
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:40,675
Me either.

61
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,221
I think there'll be more in the future.

62
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,806
Yeah.

63
00:03:50,685 --> 00:03:53,480
How are you getting home?

64
00:04:22,676 --> 00:04:25,053
We haven't seen each other for how long?

65
00:04:27,013 --> 00:04:29,891
The last time we met was probably

66
00:04:31,476 --> 00:04:34,145
when the coach had an operation.

67
00:04:35,855 --> 00:04:37,857
That really was a long time ago.

68
00:04:38,274 --> 00:04:39,275
Yeah.

69
00:04:40,026 --> 00:04:42,195
Maybe we met a few times after that.

70
00:04:42,404 --> 00:04:43,822
I don't really remember.

71
00:04:51,037 --> 00:04:52,414
How's everything going?

72
00:04:53,581 --> 00:04:54,624
Good.

73
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,293
And you?

74
00:04:56,751 --> 00:04:57,836
Busy?

75
00:04:59,337 --> 00:05:02,924
My boy, and my job...
Nothing special.

76
00:05:05,343 --> 00:05:07,929
The way you talk feels a bit upset.

77
00:05:08,138 --> 00:05:09,264
It's not like you.

78
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,516
Really? I'm fine.

79
00:05:11,725 --> 00:05:13,059
I'm good.

80
00:05:17,814 --> 00:05:20,817
Since you're married and have kids,

81
00:05:20,984 --> 00:05:22,819
and have a good husband I think...

82
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,116
You must be happy?

83
00:06:04,235 --> 00:06:05,236
Hello?

84
00:06:05,695 --> 00:06:06,696
It's me.

85
00:06:08,656 --> 00:06:09,616
I know.

86
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,327
You forgot your bride-cake.

87
00:06:17,957 --> 00:06:18,958
Well, then...

88
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,002
you've got two cakes to eat.

89
00:06:22,378 --> 00:06:24,172
Too much for me.

90
00:06:25,924 --> 00:06:26,925
Maybe...

91
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:29,427
I can give it to you at some point?

92
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,721
Okay.

93
00:06:34,307 --> 00:06:36,017
Let me know when.

94
00:06:36,184 --> 00:06:38,061
This is my number.

95
00:06:39,854 --> 00:06:40,855
I know.

96
00:06:41,022 --> 00:06:42,607
You didn't change your number.

97
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:44,567
Not sure if you still remember.

98
00:06:47,445 --> 00:06:48,363
Bye-bye.

99
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:01,876
Jia-Xin.

100
00:07:03,211 --> 00:07:04,212
Nice ball.

101
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,395
Keep it up.

102
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:38,454
It's mine.

103
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,881
One, two, three.

104
00:08:21,664 --> 00:08:22,665
Thanks.

105
00:08:22,957 --> 00:08:24,542
Can I join the volleyball team?

106
00:08:26,294 --> 00:08:27,962
You are a freshman, aren't you?

107
00:08:28,755 --> 00:08:29,756
Yes.

108
00:08:29,964 --> 00:08:31,466
Have you ever played volleyball?

109
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:33,051
Not really.

110
00:08:33,218 --> 00:08:34,886
We've already got some newcomers.

111
00:08:35,053 --> 00:08:36,888
I'm not sure
if the coach wants more...

112
00:08:37,055 --> 00:08:38,139
I'd like to give it a try.

113
00:08:42,018 --> 00:08:43,102
Okay, then...

114
00:08:43,311 --> 00:08:45,355
Come to join us at six.

115
00:08:45,688 --> 00:08:48,274
Get here earlier to warm up.

116
00:08:48,566 --> 00:08:50,526
We practice
on Mondays and Thursdays.

117
00:08:50,818 --> 00:08:52,946
And Wednesdays, sometimes.

118
00:08:53,488 --> 00:08:54,405
Okay.

119
00:08:54,697 --> 00:08:56,199
Do you need to go to a cram school?

120
00:08:58,243 --> 00:08:59,244
No.

121
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:02,914
If you just think it's fun,
I would say...

122
00:09:03,081 --> 00:09:04,707
I'm serious.

123
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,126
I'm very serious.

124
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:11,589
Can you give me the ball?

125
00:09:15,593 --> 00:09:16,761
Miss Yi-Ming.

126
00:09:17,553 --> 00:09:19,555
I will look up to you.

127
00:09:23,726 --> 00:09:24,936
What's your name?

128
00:09:26,771 --> 00:09:28,106
Ting-Ting Jhong.

129
00:09:40,785 --> 00:09:42,870
- Also born in November?
- Yeah.

130
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:45,498
I didn't know
you guys are Scorpios.

131
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,626
Do we look like Scorpios?

132
00:09:48,793 --> 00:09:50,044
I don't think so.

133
00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:52,714
It sounds like a compliment.

134
00:09:53,214 --> 00:09:54,215
Bye, Miss Yi-Ming.

135
00:09:54,382 --> 00:09:55,383
Bye, Miss Yi-Ming.

136
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,676
Bye, Miss Yi-Ming.

137
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,220
Ting-Ting,
we're gonna go that way.

138
00:09:59,429 --> 00:10:00,847
- Bye.
- Bye.

139
00:10:21,034 --> 00:10:22,201
Miss Yi-Ming.

140
00:10:23,369 --> 00:10:25,038
Are you gonna walk home?

141
00:10:25,705 --> 00:10:26,706
Yeah.

142
00:10:27,457 --> 00:10:29,459
Is it far?
I can give you a ride.

143
00:10:30,501 --> 00:10:32,003
No, I'm fine.

144
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:34,130
Okay. Then...

145
00:10:34,422 --> 00:10:35,673
Goodbye, Miss Yi-Ming.

146
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:49,937
Miss Yi-Ming.

147
00:10:50,313 --> 00:10:51,773
Let me give you a ride.

148
00:11:00,281 --> 00:11:02,408
You'd really like to say
"No, I'm fine."

149
00:11:03,117 --> 00:11:04,118
Really?

150
00:11:04,285 --> 00:11:05,286
Yes.

151
00:11:05,453 --> 00:11:08,581
Every time you say “No, I'm fine,”
actually you're not.

152
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:11,876
What do you mean?

153
00:11:13,252 --> 00:11:15,421
Doesn't you Dad
usually drive you home?

154
00:11:17,507 --> 00:11:20,051
I got bad scores on the exams.

155
00:11:20,301 --> 00:11:23,679
My Dad was unhappy with the team
so he asked me to walk home.

156
00:11:24,305 --> 00:11:25,598
I see.

157
00:11:26,766 --> 00:11:29,060
Don't worry.
I can take you home.

158
00:11:30,561 --> 00:11:31,687
No, I'm fine.

159
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,481
No, I'm super fine.

160
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,818
Don't copy my words.

161
00:11:37,485 --> 00:11:38,694
I didn't.

162
00:11:41,489 --> 00:11:42,490
But...

163
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:44,325
Do I smell bad?

164
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:46,035
No. I smell worse.

165
00:11:46,285 --> 00:11:47,578
I sweat a lot.

166
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,622
Glad I won't smell that.

167
00:12:00,758 --> 00:12:02,051
Did Xizo-Zhe go to bed?

168
00:12:02,718 --> 00:12:03,719
Yes.

169
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,890
You didn't go to your Mom's?

170
00:12:08,224 --> 00:12:09,225
No.

171
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:14,063
Did Xiao-Zhe eat anything bad?

172
00:12:14,439 --> 00:12:15,440
No.

173
00:12:16,941 --> 00:12:18,776
Why didn't you go to see your Mom?

174
00:12:19,402 --> 00:12:21,863
I just forgot.
We can go there tomorrow.

175
00:12:23,114 --> 00:12:25,658
Aren't we going hiking tomorrow?

176
00:12:27,952 --> 00:12:29,537
Are we going?

177
00:12:31,622 --> 00:12:33,708
I thought we're just saying.

178
00:12:36,127 --> 00:12:38,796
Did you tell your Mom you didn't go?

179
00:12:39,338 --> 00:12:41,007
No. Why?

180
00:12:41,549 --> 00:12:42,842
Give me your phone.

181
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:44,760
What?

182
00:12:51,893 --> 00:12:53,603
Why are you calling Mom?

183
00:13:02,361 --> 00:13:03,362
Mom.

184
00:13:05,823 --> 00:13:07,116
Are you going to sleep?

185
00:13:07,909 --> 00:13:08,910
I'm sorry.

186
00:13:09,118 --> 00:13:10,536
We didn't go for dinner.

187
00:13:10,745 --> 00:13:11,954
I forgot to tell you.

188
00:13:12,538 --> 00:13:14,290
Yes, we've already eaten.

189
00:13:14,457 --> 00:13:15,750
