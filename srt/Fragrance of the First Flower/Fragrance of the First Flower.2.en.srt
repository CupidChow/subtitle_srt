1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,900
(Fragrance of the First Flower)

2
00:00:33,405 --> 00:00:34,406
Honey,

3
00:00:34,865 --> 00:00:37,284
where is my blue jumper?

4
00:00:37,534 --> 00:00:39,369
The one we bought in Japan.

5
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:40,954
It's not in the drawer.

6
00:00:41,163 --> 00:00:42,956
Right under the TV set.

7
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:45,709
The TV set?

8
00:00:49,504 --> 00:00:50,964
No. I didn't see it.

9
00:00:51,173 --> 00:00:52,299
Where did you put it?

10
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:02,851
When did you move it here?

11
00:01:03,268 --> 00:01:05,145
It was there all the time.

12
00:01:24,748 --> 00:01:26,792
Do you have enough clothes at home?

13
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:27,834
Don't worry.

14
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:29,002
There are some in the drawer.

15
00:01:31,546 --> 00:01:32,547
Xiao-Zhe.

16
00:01:33,048 --> 00:01:34,299
Stop playing with the food.

17
00:01:34,758 --> 00:01:36,384
Use the spoon, not your hands. Okay?

18
00:01:36,843 --> 00:01:39,304
That's fine. Just let him be.

19
00:01:41,097 --> 00:01:42,307
Did you eat?

20
00:01:45,352 --> 00:01:46,561
How many did you eat?

21
00:01:47,312 --> 00:01:48,313
None.

22
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,693
How's your mom?

23
00:01:54,611 --> 00:01:55,612
As usual.

24
00:01:55,821 --> 00:01:57,197
Selling the red bean cakes.

25
00:01:57,489 --> 00:01:59,491
I told her to retire. She didn't listen.

26
00:01:59,783 --> 00:02:02,077
She didn't even raise the price.

27
00:02:02,285 --> 00:02:05,121
Same price for fifteen years?

28
00:02:06,164 --> 00:02:08,667
That's your Mom.

29
00:02:10,836 --> 00:02:12,879
She often asked me about you.

30
00:02:14,548 --> 00:02:15,632
Really?

31
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:19,177
I didn't know what to say.

32
00:02:21,388 --> 00:02:23,849
I didn't go back there after I moved.

33
00:02:25,058 --> 00:02:26,560
I will go visit her sometime.

34
00:02:29,855 --> 00:02:32,899
I think she'd be surprised...

35
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:35,527
because I told her you went abroad.

36
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:37,362
Abroad?

37
00:02:38,405 --> 00:02:40,115
I remember you said
you'd be going abroad

38
00:02:40,282 --> 00:02:43,201
when we went to see the coach.

39
00:02:44,161 --> 00:02:46,663
When we went to see the coach...

40
00:02:47,873 --> 00:02:49,124
Did I mention it then?

41
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:53,628
I heard that from other seniors.

42
00:02:55,338 --> 00:02:56,798
I didn't go eventually.

43
00:02:58,466 --> 00:02:59,467
Why not?

44
00:03:01,011 --> 00:03:04,973
My husband's application got rejected.

45
00:03:05,515 --> 00:03:09,311
We thought we could wait
until the next year.

46
00:03:09,728 --> 00:03:12,272
But both of our parents suggested

47
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:15,525
we should get married
before we went abroad.

48
00:03:15,817 --> 00:03:17,736
It's better to get married first.

49
00:03:18,194 --> 00:03:19,362
Thanks.

50
00:03:20,113 --> 00:03:22,032
So, we got married.

51
00:03:22,324 --> 00:03:23,950
After we got married,

52
00:03:24,993 --> 00:03:26,161
I got pregnant.

53
00:03:26,995 --> 00:03:27,996
And now...

54
00:03:28,163 --> 00:03:29,331
here I am.

55
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,337
Let me pick up the phone.

56
00:03:38,798 --> 00:03:39,966
Hello, Miss Huang.

57
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,801
Yes.

58
00:03:43,803 --> 00:03:44,888
How come?

59
00:03:47,182 --> 00:03:50,518
I see. I'll take him to the doctor soon.

60
00:03:51,645 --> 00:03:52,896
Thank you.

61
00:03:53,146 --> 00:03:54,147
Okay. Bye-bye.

62
00:03:55,398 --> 00:03:56,399
Is everything okay?

63
00:03:56,566 --> 00:03:57,984
My son got sick.

64
00:03:59,444 --> 00:04:00,612
I need to make another call.

65
00:04:00,904 --> 00:04:02,322
Sure. Take your time.

66
00:04:07,285 --> 00:04:08,411
Hello, Ann?

67
00:04:08,703 --> 00:04:11,998
I'm wondering if we could
move the meeting...

68
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:13,708
The documents?

69
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,753
I sent them out and cced her last week.

70
00:04:17,545 --> 00:04:18,546
I did.

71
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:22,300
Revise now?

72
00:04:23,093 --> 00:04:24,386
You mean... now?

73
00:04:24,886 --> 00:04:25,887
No...

74
00:04:26,054 --> 00:04:27,806
It's fine. You can tell me.

75
00:04:28,014 --> 00:04:29,224
Yeah, you just tell me... what?

76
00:04:29,516 --> 00:04:30,517
Which one?

77
00:04:30,684 --> 00:04:31,685
On page three.

78
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,770
Page three and nine.

79
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:36,648
Move it from page three to nine?

80
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,733
What else?

81
00:04:40,902 --> 00:04:41,903
Thanks.

82
00:04:44,864 --> 00:04:46,116
I'll give it to you as soon as I can.

83
00:04:49,077 --> 00:04:50,787
Is there anything I can do to help?

84
00:04:54,249 --> 00:04:55,375
No, I'm fine.

85
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,601
Let me go help her.

86
00:05:13,852 --> 00:05:14,853
One second.

87
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,814
Excuse me. Please go this way.

88
00:05:18,148 --> 00:05:19,232
Thanks. Sorry about that.

89
00:05:24,821 --> 00:05:26,072
Still lining up the cars?

90
00:05:27,157 --> 00:05:28,241
This one?

91
00:05:29,242 --> 00:05:30,243
Let me get you this.

92
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,661
- Okay. You get me this.
- Sorry.

93
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,455
Mommy should come earlier.

94
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,165
Still hurts?

95
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,169
Eat a light diet and drink water.

96
00:05:39,627 --> 00:05:42,297
Doctor said if the diarrhea stops,
there's no need for a return visit.

97
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:44,758
Thanks for your help.

98
00:05:45,592 --> 00:05:47,218
Let me take him home now.

99
00:05:48,678 --> 00:05:49,971
Pick up your toys.

100
00:05:50,513 --> 00:05:51,598
But I'm still...

101
00:05:51,765 --> 00:05:52,766
Hurry up.

102
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,643
There's no rush for me.

103
00:05:58,605 --> 00:06:00,315
Would you like to come for dinner?

104
00:06:02,692 --> 00:06:03,693
Sure.

105
00:06:10,492 --> 00:06:11,701
You want this car here?

106
00:06:12,202 --> 00:06:13,203
How about this one?

107
00:06:13,369 --> 00:06:15,205
- Let me get you this.
- Ok...

108
00:06:21,503 --> 00:06:24,047
Let me do this, you can sit down.

109
00:06:24,297 --> 00:06:25,757
It's faster.

110
00:06:37,644 --> 00:06:38,853
How many vegetables do you need?

111
00:06:39,145 --> 00:06:41,022
Come on, make yourself at home.

112
00:06:42,524 --> 00:06:43,525
All right.

113
00:06:43,691 --> 00:06:45,151
Let me know if you need a hand.

114
00:07:29,863 --> 00:07:31,948
Let's eat. My son is asleep.

115
00:07:32,991 --> 00:07:34,242
We don't wait for your husband?

116
00:07:35,743 --> 00:07:38,538
No, he works in Hsinchu.
He only comes back on weekends.

117
00:07:40,206 --> 00:07:41,791
So, most of the time,
you're all by yourself?

118
00:07:42,584 --> 00:07:43,710
My son is with me.

119
00:07:45,587 --> 00:07:47,005
He is adorable.

120
00:07:49,215 --> 00:07:50,884
Wow, what a meal.

121
00:07:53,803 --> 00:07:55,513
Nothing special.

122
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,187
- Delicious.
- Delicious?

123
00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:03,897
Nice.

124
00:08:06,816 --> 00:08:08,484
When I took Xiao-Zhe to the clinic,

125
00:08:08,902 --> 00:08:10,528
the doctor thought I was his mother.

126
00:08:10,778 --> 00:08:13,531
So, he asked me about his conditions.

127
00:08:15,408 --> 00:08:17,660
It's totally fine
if you don't want to talk much.

128
00:08:18,828 --> 00:08:22,498
Xiao-Zhe has high-functioning autism.

129
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:24,417
He is just like normal children,

130
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:26,085
but he doesn't know how to...

131
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:27,629
get along with others.

132
00:08:27,837 --> 00:08:30,506
Sometimes,
he does certain things repeatedly.

133
00:08:32,467 --> 00:08:33,843
He is going to the elementary school.

134
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,304
The teachers think it's good for him
to be in a regular class.

135
00:08:36,846 --> 00:08:37,847
That's great.

136
00:08:38,473 --> 00:08:39,474
Congrats.

137
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,268
Let me get you some soup.

138
00:08:42,602 --> 00:08:44,020
Thanks.

139
00:08:53,488 --> 00:08:55,531
It's the first time I eat a meal you cooked.

140
00:08:56,449 --> 00:08:58,326
We didn't need to cook in high school.

141
00:08:58,868 --> 00:09:00,787
Of course you didn't.
You're the apple of your parents' eyes.

142
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:03,915
Anyway, an apple becomes a mom now.

143
00:09:10,213 --> 00:09:12,423
Why don't you have bar stools
in your house?

144
00:09:13,007 --> 00:09:14,133
What bar stools?

145
00:09:15,009 --> 00:09:16,010
Don't you remember...

146
00:09:16,678 --> 00:09:18,638
fancy bar stools?

147
00:09:34,904 --> 00:09:35,905
Have some soup.

148
00:09:36,114 --> 00:09:37,115
Thanks.

149
00:09:38,366 --> 00:09:39,659
Looks great.

150
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,459
It's very good.

151
00:09:57,218 --> 00:09:58,344
Hurry up, we're late.

152
00:09:58,511 --> 00:09:59,512
Okay.

153
00:10:10,606 --> 00:10:13,192
The game's started.
Turn right upstairs. Thanks.

154
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:14,360
- Thanks. - Thanks.

155
00:10:18,114 --> 00:10:19,073
Hurry.

156
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,241
Hurry up.

157
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:29,625
Honey,

158
00:10:30,418 --> 00:10:31,919
I think Xiao-Zhe...

159
00:10:32,712 --> 00:10:33,713
What's wrong?

160
00:10:34,213 --> 00:10:36,257
Too loud for him.

161
00:10:37,467 --> 00:10:39,594
He'd be fine. We brought his earplugs.

162
00:10:40,887 --> 00:10:43,097
How about I take him to the park?

163
00:10:43,806 --> 00:10:44,807
Why?

164
00:10:44,974 --> 00:10:46,309
We've come so far to get here.

165
00:10:46,476 --> 00:10:47,810
You're going to the park?

166
00:10:47,977 --> 00:10:48,978
I don't want that.

167
00:10:49,145 --> 00:10:51,147
It's not a big deal. You can stay here.

168
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,276
All of us should stay here.

169
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:58,488
I mean... I can take him to the park

170
00:10:58,654 --> 00:10:59,864
and come back later.

171
00:11:00,448 --> 00:11:02,116
Why are you so stubborn?

172
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,827
I bought the best earplugs for him.

173
00:11:05,119 --> 00:11:07,080
Maybe Xiao-Zhe is fine with the noise.

174
00:11:07,413 --> 00:11:09,374
Maybe he likes watching the game.

175
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:11,417
Listen,

176
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:13,252
he is going to elementary school
in a regular class.

177
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:18,049
His classmates would talk about
all the places they've been to.

178
00:11:18,257 --> 00:11:21,427
If you don't let him go out because
you worry he's afraid of the noise,

179
00:11:21,594 --> 00:11:23,513
he'd never fit in with his peers.

180
00:11:23,846 --> 00:11:25,598
He might be left out because of that.

181
00:11:25,932 --> 00:11:26,974
Let's go.

182
00:11:27,475 --> 00:11:28,476
All right.

183
00:11:30,436 --> 00:11:31,437
Where is Xiao-Zhe?

184
00:11:31,604 --> 00:11:32,563
Xiao-Zhe?

185
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:33,731
- Xiao-Zhe?
- Xiao-Zhe?

186
00:11:34,232 --> 00:11:35,692
- Xiao-Zhe?
- Xiao-Zhe?

187
00:11:36,609 --> 00:11:38,069
- Xiao-Zhe?
- Xiao-Zhe?

188
00:11:38,236 --> 00:11:39,237
Xiao-Zhe?

189
00:11:48,704 --> 00:11:49,705
Excuse me,

190
00:11:49,872 --> 00:11:53,000
did you see a boy about this tall?

191
00:11:57,463 --> 00:11:59,298
He's in red with curly hair.

192
00:11:59,507 --> 00:12:01,592
I didn't see him.
You need to ask the help desk.

193
00:12:03,553 --> 00:12:05,471
It's not yours. Give it back.

194
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,764
Let me get it back for you.

195
00:12:08,266 --> 00:12:09,267
Xiao-Zhe?

196
00:12:10,143 --> 00:12:11,144
Xiao-Zhe?

197
00:12:12,353 --> 00:12:13,354
Hello?

198
00:12:14,647 --> 00:12:15,648
You found him?

199
00:12:17,066 --> 00:12:18,067
Where are you?

200
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,653
Okay, I'm going downstairs.

201
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:27,118
It's your pompom. Thanks.

202
00:12:27,535 --> 00:12:28,536
Never mind.

203
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,581
Honey!

204
00:12:31,789 --> 00:12:32,790
Here!

205
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:40,006
Xiao-Zhe is here.

206
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:44,260
She is my wife.

207
00:12:45,344 --> 00:12:46,679
Ting-Ting did us a big favor.

208
00:12:46,888 --> 00:12:49,098
Otherwise, we couldn't find Xiao-Zhe.

209
00:12:50,975 --> 00:12:52,268
Hi. Thank you.

210
00:12:55,146 --> 00:12:57,023
No problem. Your son is adorable.

211
00:12:57,315 --> 00:12:58,649
He can have this pompom.

212
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,984
Is that okay?

213
00:13:00,401 --> 00:13:02,778
We should treat you to dinner sometime.

214
00:13:07,158 --> 00:13:08,159
No worries.

215
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:10,536
Just come to watch the games.

216
00:13:10,745 --> 00:13:11,829
Here you go.

217
00:13:12,788 --> 00:13:14,040
Thank you.

218
00:13:14,415 --> 00:13:15,416
Thanks.

219
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:16,501
I'm heading back.

220
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:17,752
Bye-bye.

221
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:18,920
Bye-bye.

222
00:13:19,795 --> 00:13:20,796
Bye.

223
00:13:21,297 --> 00:13:22,298
I was hiding.

224
00:13:22,465 --> 00:13:24,091
Why were you hiding?

225
00:13:24,842 --> 00:13:26,594
Did you get nervous?

226
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,055
Did you know we couldn't find you?

227
00:13:30,473 --> 00:13:32,517
Where did you go?

228
00:13:33,434 --> 00:13:34,644
Where should this one go?

229
00:13:35,102 --> 00:13:36,521
Let's put the cars back.

230
00:13:36,854 --> 00:13:38,189
It's Dad's car.

231
00:13:38,356 --> 00:13:39,357
Yes.

232
00:13:39,524 --> 00:13:42,109
Goodbye. Dad's car.

233
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:43,486
It's time to bed.

234
00:13:47,156 --> 00:13:49,367
- Line up the cars.
- Yes.

235
00:13:49,617 --> 00:13:50,868
Good night, cars.

236
00:13:53,329 --> 00:13:54,330
Good night.

237
00:13:56,123 --> 00:13:57,124
Is that all?

238
00:13:57,667 --> 00:13:59,544
- One more here.
- One more here.

239
00:14:00,545 --> 00:14:01,796
Dad's car.

240
00:14:02,171 --> 00:14:03,172
Bye-bye.

241
00:14:06,092 --> 00:14:07,093
Okay.

242
00:14:07,552 --> 00:14:08,553
Close your eyes.

243
00:14:10,555 --> 00:14:11,597
Hug.

244
00:14:11,764 --> 00:14:12,848
Hug.

245
00:14:16,978 --> 00:14:17,979
Honey.

246
00:14:18,604 --> 00:14:21,023
The cheerleader girl Ting-Ting...

247
00:14:21,357 --> 00:14:22,900
she is popular on the internet.

248
00:14:24,068 --> 00:14:25,570
People talk a lot about her.

249
00:14:27,113 --> 00:14:28,155
She seems nice and kind.

250
00:14:28,489 --> 00:14:30,283
She went to some charity events.

251
00:14:31,033 --> 00:14:32,285
- Really?
- Yes.

252
00:14:34,412 --> 00:14:35,413
But, to me,

253
00:14:35,913 --> 00:14:38,499
as a cheerleader girl

254
00:14:38,749 --> 00:14:40,668
she is just average-looking.

255
00:14:41,127 --> 00:14:42,753
But I like her personality

256
00:14:43,254 --> 00:14:44,547
because I think

257
00:14:44,714 --> 00:14:46,340
she is very easy-going and friendly.

258
00:14:46,882 --> 00:14:47,883
You know,

259
00:14:48,092 --> 00:14:50,553
you'd like her when you just meet her.

260
00:14:52,054 --> 00:14:53,681
See this, the comments are mean.

261
00:14:54,473 --> 00:14:55,474
Old chick.

262
00:14:56,392 --> 00:14:58,144
Her body is so-so.

263
00:14:58,936 --> 00:15:00,563
Are you interested in her?

264
00:15:01,272 --> 00:15:03,024
No, she is not my type.

265
00:15:06,485 --> 00:15:08,988
(Mrs. Wang, when should we meet?)

266
00:15:17,121 --> 00:15:18,539
Good night.

267
00:15:18,998 --> 00:15:19,999
Good night.
