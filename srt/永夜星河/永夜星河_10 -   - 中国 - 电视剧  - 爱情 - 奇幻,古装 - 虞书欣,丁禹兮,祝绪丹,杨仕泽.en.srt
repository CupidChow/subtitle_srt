00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,180
=Episode 10=

3
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,590
Come.

4
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,680
Miss, take a look at these hairpins.

5
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,900
There are so many beautiful hairpins.

6
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,070
They are all made by me.

7
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,580
See if there's anything you like.

8
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,720
Let's go.

9
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,150
It's time to go back for dinner.

10
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,480
Come and take a look at the hairpin.

11
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,550
Come and have a look.

12
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:03,910
Take a look, take a look.

13
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:16,900
(Zhijing Town)

14
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,020
(Tailai Inn)
Delicious.

15
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,270
Here it comes.

16
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,490
Boss, they taste good.

17
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:22,760
All the dishes are here.

18
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,150
Enjoy your meal.

19
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,200
Although they are
ordinary stir-fried dishes,

20
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,550
they taste fresh and delicious.

21
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:28,530
It's nothing.

22
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,450
My wife's cooking is better.

23
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,860
If she were here,

24
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,640
she would definitely cook for you

25
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,740
the specialty of our inn, osmanthus fish.

26
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,950
These are very delicious.

27
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,020
That osmanthus fish must be
more delicious.

28
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,380
Absolutely.

29
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,860
Every autumn, when the osmanthus blooms,

30
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,940
I collect a few jars
of osmanthus flowers

31
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,030
and preserve them in syrup to cook fish.

32
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,080
Everyone who has tasted it

33
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,300
has praised it.

34
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,100
It seems that we are missing out.

35
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,610
Where did your wife go?

36
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,970
She visited her parents.

37
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,580
If her parents live outside the town,

38
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,890
it would take days for a round trip.

39
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,460
How long has it been?

40
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,530
Five years ago.

41
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,780
Five years?

42
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,780
She has not returned yet.

43
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,460
She'll be back tomorrow.

44
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,060
Enjoy your meal.

45
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,620
What's going on?

46
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,730
It feels strange.

47
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,620
All five jars are full,

48
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,180
and two have gone bad
perhaps from being stored too long.

49
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,950
Something's wrong with this town.

50
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,200
Since we arrived here…

51
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,380
Every household has someone
who is not at home,

52
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,110
and…

53
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,780
They will all return tomorrow.

54
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,640
Please save my daughter.

55
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,480
Go and take a look.

56
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,810
Save my daughter.

57
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,060
I beg you.

58
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,060
Save my daughter Douya.

59
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,470
Celestial official, I beg you!

60
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,940
Please save my daughter.

61
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,970
She went to the Mitu Valley.

62
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,940
(Douya's Mother, Villager)
I don't know where she got the silver.

63
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,850
She came to you to request a talisman.

64
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:29,100
She thought
this would help her avoid evil spirits.

65
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,810
Oh no, I shouldn't have given
her that silver.

66
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,010
It's that swindler's fault.

67
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,380
What does it have to do with you?

68
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,840
Anyway, saving her is the priority.

69
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,680
Please help me.

70
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,730
She is my only daughter.

71
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,430
She is my life.

72
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,100
Everyone, I beg you, please help me!

73
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,320
If she goes in, she won't come out.

74
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,100
She can't get out, you know?

75
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,530
Celestial official!

76
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,290
I have money.

77
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,290
If it's not enough,

78
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,060
I can even risk my life,
whatever it takes.

79
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,280
- No.
- Celestial official.

80
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,750
- It's not about the money.
- Please help me!

81
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,900
Help me, please! Please!

82
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,280
- Help me.
- Help them.

83
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,000
Don't argue. Stop arguing!

84
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,460
- Quiet, stop arguing.
- It's really so pitiful.

85
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,930
Your daughter has just gone out to play.

86
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,850
She will come back tomorrow.

87
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,660
She will come back tomorrow.

88
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,100
Worry-Free Curse.

89
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,990
Miaomiao,

90
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:47,990
wake up.

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,840
Miaomiao.

92
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,050
Why are there four of you again?

93
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,930
As an imperial Demon Catcher,

94
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,490
you don't exorcise evil spirits
to ensure peace,

95
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,050
but you curse people

96
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,300
and confuse their memories

97
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,850
to make them forget
the most important person.

98
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,050
What exactly are your intentions?

99
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:16,750
I…

100
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,970
I did it to save them.

101
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,920
Her daughter goes

102
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,260
to the Mitu Valley.

103
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,720
She'll die and never return.

104
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,160
Anyone who goes there to save her

105
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,480
will also die.

106
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,560
I don't want any more people to die.

107
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,020
That's why I used a curse

108
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,760
to make them forget.

109
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,680
What makes you so sure

110
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,910
that those who enter the valley
are bound to die?

111
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:38,750
I…

112
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,530
What exactly is in the Mitu Valley?

113
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,480
Speak!

114
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,660
Don't care what's inside.

115
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,030
Anyway, you can't handle it.

116
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,020
No one can handle it.

117
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:56,930
I think you are not worthy of
being a Demon Catcher.

118
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,050
If you won't save her, we will.

119
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,360
Let's go.

120
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,460
You guys…

121
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,970
Are you not following my advice?

122
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,460
What you intend to do

123
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,070
will make you pay the price.

124
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,970
Do you know that?

125
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,700
You will regret it.

126
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,940
(Mitu Valley Entrance)

127
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,290
There's a thick fog inside.

128
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,100
Generally, the fog gathers

129
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,290
on the high mountains.

130
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,260
But this low terrain has such a heavy fog.

131
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,500
There must be something unusual.

132
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,020
What unspeakable secret
is hidden here?

133
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,700
No matter what it is,

134
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,410
we will solve it.

135
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,410
The fog is getting thicker.

136
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:54,630
Everyone, be careful.

137
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,840
Miaomiao,

138
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,930
you stay close to Sheng.

139
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,850
Fuyi and I will scout ahead.

140
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,100
The fog is so thick.

141
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,580
The entrance we came through
is almost invisible.

142
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,000
Ziqi,

143
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,220
will we be able to find the exit?

144
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,430
Ziqi?

145
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,470
Ziqi!

146
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,040
Sister Mu!

147
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:54,950
Brother Liu!

148
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:57,830
There must be

149
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,610
a problem here.

150
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,940
Fire, fire can break the fog.

151
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,800
Miaomiao!

152
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,550
Miaomiao!

153
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,160
Ziqi!

154
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:35,830
Sister Mu!

155
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,280
Miaomiao, why are you so slow?

156
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,170
Catch up!

157
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,610
Sister Mu, Brother Liu,

158
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,490
did you see where Ziqi went?

159
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,240
Sister Mu!

160
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,400
Brother Liu!

161
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,430
Sister Mu!

162
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,350
Ziqi!

163
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,540
Ziqi, where did you go?

164
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,850
Sister Mu and Brother Liu…

165
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,420
They…

166
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,880
Ziqi.

167
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,800
Ziqi.

168
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,280
Ziqi!

169
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,340
Ziqi, where are you going?

170
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,760
What is this?

171
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:21,060
Let me out!

172
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,610
Let me out!

173
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:25,830
Let me out!

174
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:33,540
(Mission Failed)

175
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:48,180
(Game Over)

176
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,100
System Prompt:

177
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,940
Host's strategy mission has failed.

178
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,100
You'll be erased
by the Catching Demons system

179
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,300
and will never be able to return to
the real world.

180
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,460
Let me out!

181
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,460
Let me out!

182
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,220
Let me out!

183
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,460
Let me out!

184
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,300
Let me out!

185
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,800
Wake up!

186
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,800
You have been separated.

187
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,820
You can't go any further.

188
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,180
Let me out.

189
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,600
Miaomiao, wake up, wake up!

190
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,180
Let me out.

191
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:35,830
Yao.

192
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,350
Yao.

193
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,190
Miaomiao!

194
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,400
Miaomiao!

195
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,160
Miaomiao!

196
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,610
You really can't go any further.

197
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,490
Miaomiao, wake up!

198
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:00,940
Wake up!

199
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,970
Wake up!

200
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,340
You can't go any further.

201
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,340
If you continue, you'll drown.

202
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,340
Miaomiao!

203
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,180
Let me out.

204
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,850
Let me out.

205
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,640
Miaomiao!

206
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,420
(Mission Failed)

207
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,340
Let me out.

208
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,770
Let me out!

209
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,300
Let me out!

210
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:41,610
Let me out!

211
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,700
Come down quickly.

212
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,280
If you stay up there,

213
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,180
you'll drown.

214
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,700
Wake up!

215
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,340
Wake up!

216
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,220
Sleep now.

217
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,580
As long as you sleep,

218
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,100
you can let go of all your worries

219
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,010
and fears.

220
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,370
You no longer have to face all of this.

221
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,850
Sleep.

222
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,770
Miaomiao,

223
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,510
can you hear me?

224
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,350
Cuicui?

225
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,130
Why are you here?

226
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,130
You're finally awake.

227
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,460
You just seemed to have lost your soul.

228
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,400
You plunged head first into
the big water ball.

229
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,820
I couldn't pull you out.

230
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,420
You saved me.

231
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,960
I'm not that powerful.

232
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,200
It was sparks that shot out from you,

233
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,180
shattering that big water ball.

234
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,820
Sparks?

235
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,820
It's that guy's sachet that saved me.

236
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,220
I didn't expect it to be so powerful.

237
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,340
Where are they?

238
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,940
Things went wrong
as soon as you entered the valley.

239
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,010
It's like you're possessed.

240
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,730
You can't hear each other.

241
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,300
They must be lost, just like you.

242
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,610
We need to hurry and find them.

243
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,760
This place is

244
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,370
too scary.

245
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:09,360
Let's run quickly.

246
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,200
Let's go now.

247
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,280
Ziqi?

248
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,760
Go.

249
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:40,710
Master,

250
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,220
it is this little child.

251
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,140
(Mu Huaijiang, Mu Yao's Father)
Who is he?

252
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,970
Why would he sneak into the Mu Mansion?

253
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:47,710
I couldn't get an answer.

254
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,710
He must be a vagrant

255
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,610
trying to steal something.

256
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,490
- Let him go.
- Yes, Master.

257
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,640
- Wait a moment.
- Go.

258
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,460
He seems to have no home

259
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,010
and nowhere to go.

260
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,400
Father,

261
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,970
shall we take him in?

262
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,970
From now on, you will be my brother.

263
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,200
An orphaned wild child.

264
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,720
You little wild child, don't run away!

265
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,100
- Wild child.
- Orphaned little wild child.

266
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,140
- Don't run!
- You little wild child!

267
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,150
I am not!

268
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,720
An orphaned wild child!

269
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,560
A wild child!

270
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,040
- Wild child!
- Orphaned wild child!

271
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,270
Little wild child!

272
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,750
You're just a little wild child.

273
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,220
- I am not.
- Yes, you are.

274
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,560
Why do you always wear
that strange hairband?

275
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,400
Take it off.

276
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,240
I can't take it off.

277
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,240
- Why can't you take it off?
- Why?

278
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,510
- Take it off.
- Take it off.

279
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,730
I don't know, but I can't take it off.

280
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,400
Today, Sister Mu Yao is not at home.

281
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,730
No one can protect you.

282
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,890
Take off his hairband.

283
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,420
Take it off, come on, take it off.

284
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,940
Why don't you take off the hairband?

285
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,320
Are you a demon?

286
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,160
I am not a demon.

287
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,790
- Yes, you are!
- You are!

288
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,060
You are a demon!

289
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,120
Demon!

290
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,000
I am not.

291
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,970
You are.

292
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,420
Take off the hairband.

293
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:00,820
Let me go.

294
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,350
- Let me go!
- Demon!

295
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,640
I must take it off.

296
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,640
You can't take it off.

297
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,980
Demon!

298
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,440
Demon, run!

299
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,740
Run!

300
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,820
Are you looking for this?

301
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,160
So you really are a demon.

302
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,740
Sister, listen to me.

303
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,020
No need to explain.

304
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,130
I treated you like a brother,

305
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,130
but you deceived me for so long.

306
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,340
You make me sick.

307
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,130
Demon!

308
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,780
Sister, don't!

309
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,200
Sister,

310
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,200
don't!

311
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:41,830
Ziqi!

312
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,760
Ziqi!

313
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,210
Ziqi, wake up!

314
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,850
Ziqi!

315
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,640
Ziqi, don't go to that water ball.

316
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,980
You will drown.

317
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,790
He's also affected by the magic skill.

318
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,450
Shouting like that won't help.

319
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,980
Then hurry up and help!

320
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,820
I can't.

321
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,370
My demonic power is too weak.

322
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,750
You can't either.

323
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,100
Let him go quickly.

324
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,270
- Otherwise,
- No.

325
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,750
you too will be dragged into
the water ball

326
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,590
and drowned.

327
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,610
Ziqi, wake up!

328
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,690
Ziqi, stay conscious.

329
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,400
I don't care what you've seen.

330
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,910
Don't believe it.

331
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,270
Wake up, Ziqi!

332
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,790
You will lose your life.

333
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,210
Wake up.

334
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,130
Miaomiao!

335
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,740
Let him go quickly.

336
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,340
Miaomiao!

337
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,610
Let him go.

338
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,300
It's done.

339
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,780
Miaomiao!

340
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,130
Ziqi!

341
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:09,830
Ziqi!

342
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,390
Ziqi!

343
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,130
I don't know what you've seen.

344
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,390
Trust me.

345
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,600
It's all fake.

346
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,690
Don't be afraid, okay?

347
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,390
Don't be afraid.

348
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,680
Ziqi.

349
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,170
Ziqi, wake up!

350
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,210

You're awake.

You've regained consciousness.

367
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,370
A mere Water Formation can trap me?

368
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,040
You scared me to death

369
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:50,850
just now,

370
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,550
you know?

371
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,400
No matter how I called you,

372
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,360
you wouldn't wake up.

I even thought

374
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:58,240
you would die today.

375
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,130
You scared me to death.

376
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,820
Why did you come over?

377
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,450
I almost thought you…

378
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,800
thought you…

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,110
That's right, I almost drowned

380
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,850
in that water ball.

381
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,370
But fortunately,

382
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,130
your sachet saved my life.

383
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,580
Lucky I have it.

384
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,300
Lucky I have you.

385
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,150
You…

386
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:30,980
you're so stupid.

387
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,100
Don't get in the way.

388
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,580
It's so dangerous,
take care of yourself first.

389
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,110
These people

390
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,070
should be just like us before,

391
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,260
cursed

392
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,060
and swallowed by this water ball.

393
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,650
Inner Demon Curse.

394
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,260
Water Demon's trick.

395
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,280
Water Demon?

396
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,930
Is it the kind we encountered
at the Nanke Inn?

397
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,250
Water is the medium for various illusions,

398
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,210
so they are born with the ability to
bewitch the human heart.

399
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,930
The one in the valley is said to be
a great demon.

400
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,650
Not only is this demon of high rank,

401
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,340
but the moisture around the valley

402
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,210
greatly enhances its ability.

403
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,500
I can't get in touch with
my sister and Liu.

404
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,980
They seem to have been ambushed as well.

405
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,480
We need to find them quickly.

406
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,650
I just tried.

407
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,270
The fog is too thick here.

408
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,370
We can't even see the shadow of
a person two steps away.

409
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,260
I don't know how to find them.

410
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,150
Well,

411
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,980
I can give it a try.

412
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,000
Cuicui.

413
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,680
You…

414
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,060
You come out first.

415
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,110
I won't.

416
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:09,070
He is fierce and sharp-tongued.

417
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,210
He has a terrible temper too.

418
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,540
I get scared when I see him.

419
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,130
I'm listening.

420
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,000
By the way,

421
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,410
didn't I tell you not to follow me?

422
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,580
It's so dangerous for you
to follow me like this.

423
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,350
If I can help you

424
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,170
find your companions,

425
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,580
will you take me with you?

426
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,550
It's not time for a bamboo shoot

427
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,790
to negotiate terms with us.

428
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:35,780
Really?

429
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,420
Do you have a way

430
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,840
to find Sister Mu and Brother Liu?

431
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,550
The valley is filled with moisture.

432
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,930
Although I can't see it,

433
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,450
I can feel it.

434
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,780
There are many similar beings here.

435
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:50,060
I can try to contact them.

436
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,780
Good. Go ahead.

437
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,850
Dear uncles and aunts,

438
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,440
grandpas and grandmas,

439
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,160
brothers and sisters,
I'm sorry to disturb you.

440
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,020
Please help me find two people.

441
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:32,310
This demonic fog incites
people's obsessions

442
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,410
and brings out their inner demons.

443
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,250
A slight mistake can lead to
falling into the trap.

444
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,910
Yao!

445
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,450
Why is it ineffective?

446
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:08,060
Your companion is deeply
troubled by her inner demon.

447
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,740
Her obsessions have been consumed by me

448
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,410
and become my nourishment.

449
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,310
And you,

450
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,540
Liu Fuyi.

451
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,300
Your inner demon is

452
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:38,300
heavier than anyone else's.

453
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,100
Have you forgotten who you are?

454
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,020
Have you forgotten what you once did?

455
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,450
Liu Fuyi,

456
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,580
you are a swindler.

457
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,500
You have deceived all of us.

458
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:06,550
Yao.

459
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,310
Father.

460
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,420
(Hutian Wonderland)

461
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,280
Father!

462
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,760
Father!

463
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,150
Father!

464
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,280
Sister!

465
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,110
Sister!

466
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:10,550
Sister!

467
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,240
Sister!

468
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,390
Sister.

469
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,800
Sheng,

470
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,130
what happened?

471
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,410
Why?

472
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,210
Why did it happen?

473
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,520
Sister,

474
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,300
you don't remember?

475
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,630
What?

476
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,800
It's

477
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,370
the Resentful Woman.

478
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,540
It's the Great Demon Resentful Woman.

479
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,950
She escaped from the
Heavenly Tribulation Formation

480
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:48,850
set up by our father.

481
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,400
She killed everyone.

482
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,240
Resentful Woman.

483
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,480
Sister,

484
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,410
she killed everyone.

485
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,210
It's the Resentful Woman.

486
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,340
It's the Resentful Woman.

487
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,450
Don't be afraid, I'm here.

488
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,000
Demon,

489
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,210
get out of my mind

490
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,370
right now.

491
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,370
The scene of the massacre that day is

492
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,690
the nightmare I have every night.

493
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,610
I have been trapped in
this dream countless times,

494
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,210
so I am very skilled

495
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,580
at freeing myself from it.

496
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,780
You underestimated me, demon.

497
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,660
Cuicui, how are you?

498
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,120
This valley

499
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,980
has a very large magical formation.

500
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,150
Magical formation?

501
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,170
The bamboo trees here say

502
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:30,930
that the fog wasn't this thick in the past,

503
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:33,480
but later a magical formation

504
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,100
sealed this valley.

505
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,070
Since then, the mist carrying the
Water Demon's demonic power

506
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:38,990
hasn't been able to disperse,

507
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:41,060
and it has became thicker and thicker.

508
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,070
The Water Demon that lives here

509
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,370
has become increasingly powerful.

510
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:47,020
The Water Demon created
the magical formation for itself?

511
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,740
It was a Demon Catcher.

512
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,130
A Demon Catcher?

513
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,260
They said it was a Demon Catcher
from the capital city

514
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,360
who set up a large formation
here with others,

515
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,210
making the Water Demon
stronger and stronger.

516
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,500
Capital city?

517
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,480
- Guo Xiu?
- Guo Xiu!

518
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:24,910
Fuyi.

519
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,200
Sister.

520
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,440
Sheng,

521
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,800
where are you?

522
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,020
Is Miaomiao with you?

523
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,100
Sister Mu, we are together.

524
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:40,310
A Water Demon hides in this valley
and devours people.

525
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,650
You must be very careful.

526
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,800
Sister,

527
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,510
have you encountered the Inner Demon Curse?

528
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,890
Are you alright? Are you hurt?

529
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:46,960
I'm fine.

530
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,060
But Fuyi is trapped in an illusion
caused by his inner demon

531
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,410
and couldn't break free.

532
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,400
Sister, where are you?
I'll come to you.

533
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,240
No need.

534
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,840
Let's head back to the small town

535
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,690
and gather outside.

536
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,450
Sister, be careful.

537
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,760
You too.

538
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:15,780
Is it done?

539
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,200
I told you so.

540
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,510
With this extended antenna,

541
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,160
the wireless network signal will be
much better.

542
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,600
See, we are connected now.

543
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,500
You're saying things
I don't understand again.

544
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,340
You don't have to understand.

545
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,550
I'm really clever.

546
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,410
At critical moments,
you still have to rely on me.

547
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,580
It's my credit.

548
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,310
All right, it's your work, too.

549
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,170
Little Bamboo Shoot,

550
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,410
I didn't expect you to be so smart.

551
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,410
Yeah.

552
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:46,030
Look, I'm so capable and so smart.

553
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,640
Take me along with you,

554
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,650
okay?

555
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,270
Cuicui, what's wrong with you?

556
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,210
What's wrong with him?

557
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,110
Nothing.

558
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:57,340
He has exhausted his spiritual power
and needs to rest.

559
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:02,850
This Little Bamboo Shoot
is really honest.

560
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,790
If you don't have the strength,
just say so.

561
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:05,980
Why are you forcing yourself?

562
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,740
Humans have seven orifices.

563
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,210
Demons only have one orifice.

564
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,500
Therefore,

565
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,580
most demons are simply stubborn.

566
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,340
You asked him to use
all his abilities to help.

567
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,500
He is rigid in his thinking.

568
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,020
You've worked really hard.

569
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,160
Now you can get some sleep.

570
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,000
Come.

571
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:37,870
Cuicui,

572
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,980
I will find a way to take you with us.

573
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,040
Let's go.

574
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,820
But now Cuicui is asleep.

575
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,830
Without his guidance,
what if we get lost?

576
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:57,000
Just head northward and retrace our steps.

577
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,130
How could we need a little demon?

578
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,350
That's right.

579
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,650
Where is the north?

580
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,780
You can't find the north?

581
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:15,190
Heavy fog surrounds us.

582
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,720
There are no landmarks either.

583
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,940
Of course I can't give directions.

584
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,210
You're quite proud of that.

585
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,640
Of course I am.

586
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,250
Some people are born tone-deaf.

587
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,130
Some people are born
with no sense of direction.

588
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,550
And some people are born vicious

589
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,500
and clumsy.

590
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:34,910
Ziqi.

591
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,430
Ziqi.

592
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,680
Ziqi!

593
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,120
Ziqi!

594
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,800
Ziqi!

595
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,760
Ziqi!

596
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,560
So talkative.

597
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,210
Now you know fear?

598
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,760
Where did you go?

599
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,960
You scared me to death.

600
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,840
I thought you had left me again.

601
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,860
Let me go.

602
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,250
No.

603
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:07,440
- Let me go! What are you doing? Let me go!
- I won't let go.

604
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,170
- What if you leave me again?
- What are you doing?

605
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,420
This time it won't happen.

606
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,610
I don't believe you. You swear.

607
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,100
Childish.

608
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,690
I, Mu Ziqi, swear to the heavens,

609
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,860
if I ever lose you by mistake
in the future,

610
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:25,750
I will definitely turn back to find you,

611
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,280
no matter how far I have to turn back,

612
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,690
no matter how much effort it takes,

613
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,690
I will definitely find you
and bring you back.

614
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,730
Is that okay?

615
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:35,810
That's more like it.

616
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,610
Troublesome.

617
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:42,440
- What are you doing?
- The fog is too thick.

618
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,920
Let me hold your clothes and walk.

619
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,670
What if we get separated again?

620
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,940
How can I walk like this?

621
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,690
Just walk normally.

622
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,540
Walking hand in hand

623
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,020
is not impossible,

624
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,170
but let me say this first,

625
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:07,860
I'm afraid if we get separated again,

626
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,170
it will be a waste of time.

627
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,110
I know.

628
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,860
I also fear wasting time.
