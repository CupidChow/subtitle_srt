(Imperial Capital)

26
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,500
(Imperial Capital)

27
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,430
Sister, turn ahead and we'll arrive

28
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,790
(Tea)
outside the Imperial Capital.

29
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,850
Come on. Let's go.

30
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,250
Wait, hold on.

31
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,960
Before we go,

32
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,570
I have something important to say.

33
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,590
You must know.

34
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,130
Cuicui, you too.

35
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,780
What's so important?

36
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,460
Look,

37
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,620
once we're in the capital,

38
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,180
we shall be more united

39
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,140
and faithful.

40
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,500
No matter what happens,

41
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,140
we should trust each other, alright?

42
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,580
Of course.

43
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,500
One more thing.

44
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,540
After serious consideration,

45
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,260
I think we weren't

46
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,220
good enough as a team.

47
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,820
We're the best Demon Catchers.

48
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,940
Our team can't be nameless, right?

49
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:09,940
How old are you?

50
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,700
We're just doing our job.

51
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,140
A name is unnecessary.

52
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,740
You don't understand.

53
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,100
It's a must.

54
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,100
It can

55
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,420
bring us closer.

56
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,420
We'll be of one mind and one heart.

57
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,460
That's my experience.

58
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,820
Trust me.

59
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,340
I've come up with one.

60
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,140
Four Bamboo Masters.

61
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,620
Four Bamboo?

62
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,460
Masters?

63
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,380
- Good, huh?
- Four masters...?

64
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,220
Right?

65
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,980
Only four?

66
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,740
What about me?

67
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,380
You're the "Bamboo"!

68
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,220
But I'm still a root.

69
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,540
You'll grow up.

70
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,620
Hey,

71
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,300
dream big, you know.

72
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,900
(Tea)
Look at these.

73
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,670
(Four Bamboo Masters)
Handmade badges and our flag.

74
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,100
From now on,

75
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,580
they'll represent us.

76
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,260
That's great. You're so smart!

77
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,220
Yes, I am.

78
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,540
We'll each carry one.

79
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,380
Give me, give me!

80
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,700
Lady first.

81
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,260
Put it on.

82
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,100
Give me that.

83
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,020
I like your idea,

84
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,100
but it looks a bit messy.

85
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,740
Say that again.

86
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,980
Sorry, it's so cute.

87
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,260
The best I've ever seen.

88
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,380
It's not messy at all.

89
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,420
Must we... wear it?

90
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,500
Brother Liu is wearing it already.

91
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,820
Look.

92
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,820
Don't look at me. I won't.

93
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,340
Hold him.

94
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,180
What are you doing?

95
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,020
Hold him.

96
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,380
I said no!

97
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,460
I...

98
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,580
Get it off me! Hey!

99
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,580
You...

100
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,700
Let me see!

101
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:05,860
Perfect!

102
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,580
Not bad.

103
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,470
The Mu Family and their friends
have arrived.

104
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,220
How many?

105
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,060
Four.

106
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,780
All young and travel-stained.

107
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,580
Don't seem highly cultivated.

108
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,260
I see.

109
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,260
Find a way to meet them

110
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,900
before Dowager Consort Zhao.

111
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,740
Yes.

112
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,100
(The heart is as empty
as the yard by moonlight.)

113
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,780
Take a look, everyone.

114
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,220
What's happening?

115
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,940
Crescent, the supreme weapon,

116
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,500
hasn't moved for centuries,

117
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,780
but it's shaking now.

118
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,740
It's unprecedented.

119
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,860
There are no such records

120
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,500
in the Tianshu Pavilion either.

121
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,780
Could it be a bad omen?

122
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:55,860
A disaster is

123
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,220
going to befall the people.

124
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,940
What?

125
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,420
Gentlemen,

126
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,340
when Mu Qingshi sacrificed herself

127
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,940
to mend the sky,

128
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,340
she left behind Crescent.

129
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,740
As soon as she passed away,

130
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,460
the weapon

131
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,260
became this stone,

132
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,780
standing here

133
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,700
to guard the land.

134
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,860
No one can pull the weapon out since.

135
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,820
Only a Heavenly Demon Catcher

136
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,140
can wake it up

137
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,460
and become its new owner.

138
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,860
That's unbelievable!

139
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,260
But... but...

140
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,100
That's just a story

141
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,700
from a long time ago.

142
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,980
I think it's going to break out.

143
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,420
- Yes.
- As if...

144
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,820
as if to welcome its new owner.

145
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,940
- Perhaps
- But...

146
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,220
he or she is here.

147
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,100
The second Heavenly Demon Catcher

148
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,700
in almost nine centuries!

149
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,420
Is it possible?

150
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,260
Who is it?

151
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,260
Is it happening after hundreds of years?

152
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,340
- What should we do?
- Yeah.

153
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,700
The street is packed.

154
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,740
(Imperial Capital)
This should be the city center.

155
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,220
The housing price must be high.

156
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,060
I suppose.

157
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,380
It's too high.

158
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,060
A small house costs

159
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,020
decades of savings.

160
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,860
The mansions in the center

161
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,820
sell at hundreds of taels of gold.

162
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,540
All big cities are alike.

163
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,940
Check out these scripts and paintings.

164
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,020
Why do you ask?

165
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,420
Do you want to live here?

166
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,980
I do,

167
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,060
but I can't afford to buy a house.

168
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,060
I can dream about it, though.

169
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,220
- Have a look.
- Sister,

170
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,580
where's Liu Fuyi?

171
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,980
He's looking for an inn for us.

172
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,140
Stay with Miaomiao.

173
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,220
I'll go with him.

174
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,800
I want this one, Mother.

175
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,540
Feel free to look, Miss.

176
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,900
- It's cute.
- A rich girl like you must've seen

177
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,460
better things than these knickknacks.

178
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,340
I'm no longer a rich girl.

179
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,060
I am a new Demon Catcher.

180
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,700
How much is that?

181
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,660
They're giant clams from the East Sea.

182
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,140
Two taels of silver per string.

183
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,740
Two taels

184
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,820
for a shell?

185
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,140
That's too much.

186
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,180
We're far away from the sea.

187
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,420
The delivery alone

188
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,660
costs a lot of money.

189
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,060
You like it, don't you?

190
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,420
Buy it for your girlfriend, young man.

191
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:16,980
What?

192
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,180
Are you blind?

193
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,180
Yes, what are you thinking?

194
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,700
Do we look like fools?

195
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,700
It's a steal at two taels.

196
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,540
It's too much.

197
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,420
Give us a discount, please.

198
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,220
You aren't locals, right?

199
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,380
Sorry.

200
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,820
That's the price in the capital.

201
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,460
We live here too.

202
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,620
Look,

203
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,900
I don't mind the high price,

204
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,460
as long as it's worth it.

205
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,940
Let's go, Ziqi.

206
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,460
You don't want it?

207
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,620
Yes, I do.

208
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,420
- Then...
- It's a strategy.

209
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,860
- If we pretend to leave...
- Take a look.

210
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,100
he'll call us back.

211
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,300
Then we'll only need to pay half.

212
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,100
How much is this, sir?

213
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,500
Two taels of silver.

214
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,780
Slow down. Slow down.

215
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,500
Why hasn't he called us?

216
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,340
Keep going.

217
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,700
Still no.

218
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,940
It's beautiful.

219
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,420
Do you like it?

220
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,380
- Let's go.
- Have a nice day.

221
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,700
Others are willing to pay that much.

222
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,020
It is expensive to live in the capital.

223
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,700
Your plan worked.

224
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,660
You don't need to pay a penny now.

225
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,340
Take a look.

226
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,300
That hall is majestic.

227
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,540
It's the Xingshan Hall.

228
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,700
The Dowager Consort had it built.

229
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,230
(Xingshan Hall)
Dowager Consort Zhao?

230
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:58,980
Yes.

231
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,620
The Empress Dowager has passed away,

232
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,940
so she's the highest-ranking lady.

233
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,540
The royals exploited civilians

234
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,380
to build this for themselves.

235
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,660
Locals said

236
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,900
it's a holy temple built

237
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,700
for the people's welfare.

238
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,260
And Dowager Consort Zhao is

239
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,300
great and kind-hearted.

240
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,300
She cuts her own expenses

241
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,580
every month for charity

242
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,500
and has helped build dozens of shelters.

243
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,060
Her daughter, Princess Duanyang,

244
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,380
will get married on the eighth

245
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,460
in that hall next month.

246
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,820
She's using the money she raked in

247
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,420
for charity to get a good name.

248
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,020
It's not like

249
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,860
she can be the queen.

250
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,020
Why is she fishing for fame?

251
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,500
I'm afraid

252
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,900
it's for something much worse.

253
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,140
Excuse me.

254
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,820
Could you sell this to me?

255
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,500
I bought it from the stall over there.

256
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,940
You can go get another one.

257
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,500
I just want this one.

258
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,180
You paid two taels, right?

259
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,860
- Yes.
- I'll give you four taels.

260
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,420
- Four taels?
- Four taels?

261
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,340
Sell it to him then.

262
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,260
Sure.

263
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,740
Here you go.

264
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,500
Let's go.

265
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,020
We can pick up some snacks.

266
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,540
Ziqi?

267
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,420
Ziqi...

268
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,060
He left without telling me.

269
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,340
Where is he?

270
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:41,180
(Treasure Boutique)

271
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,420
Treasure Boutique?

272
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,620
(Treasure Boutique)

273
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,770
Welcome to the Treasure Boutique.

274
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,660
How can I help you, Miss?

275
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,620
I'd like to look around.

276
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,980
We have new arrivals.

277
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,620
Let me know if you're interested.

278
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,220
I can show you.

279
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,940
(She's just like those salespeople)

280
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,500
(in high-end stores.)

281
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,300
Hello,

282
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,780
is the Ethereal Dew in stock?

283
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,740
Welcome, ma'am.

284
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,820
It is in stock.

285
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:31,940
Arrived yesterday.

286
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,180
They've upgraded the formula.

287
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,340
If you use it,

288
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,140
(East Sea Whale Liquor)
that general, your ex-fiance,

289
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,380
will surely regret it.

290
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,180
Upgraded the formula? How?

291
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,780
They used blood from dead demons before.

292
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,060
Now they keep alive

293
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,900
the Nine-color Deer
with 300 years of cultivation

294
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,460
to draw the blood.

295
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,460
It'll make your skin

296
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,020
much better and younger.

297
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,380
I'll take two boxes!

298
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,380
Yes, ma'am.

299
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,180
Excuse me,

300
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,780
do all your masks contain demon blood?

301
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,380
Yes.

302
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,820
5.7 taels of gold per box.

303
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,540
Buy five boxes at a cheaper price

304
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,780
and get a free demon bone cane.

305
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,740
It's made of 13 bones
from 100-year-old Crane Demons.

306
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,940
Do you want the masks?

307
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,220
- Did you hear that, Miaomiao?
- Ma'am,

308
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,490
- That's terrifying!
- would you like to try

309
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,980
this Nine-fur Fox Cloak?

310
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,060
It's designed for you.

311
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,700
Yes, I heard it.

312
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,500
It feels soft.

313
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,940
You have good taste.

314
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,940
The Nine-fur Fox is Tier 5

315
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,500
with 500 years of cultivation
from the coldest land.

316
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,100
Its fur will tarnish as soon as it dies,

317
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,180
so the fur to make this was peeled off

318
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,260
when it was alive.

319
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,140
I'll take it.

320
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,940
- Thank you, ma'am!
- It's fun.

321
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,860
Help!

322
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,980
Help!

323
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:47,980
See you.

324
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,100
Take care.

325
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:52,980
It's beautiful.

326
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:53,900
Masks.

327
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,500
Excuse me,

328
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,100
did you happen to see a girl

329
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,540
looking kind of silly,

330
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,780
overly energetic,

331
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,380
but also strangely cute?

332
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,700
No, didn't see her.

333
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,900
Ask the others over there.

334
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,020
- Thanks.
- You're welcome. Good luck.

335
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,820
Let's go, let's go!

336
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,620
Does it bite?

337
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,020
Don't worry, ma'am.

338
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,820
We'll remove its teeth, trim its claws

339
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,780
and drive a gold nail into its heart.

340
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,300
Its cultivation will stop growing.

341
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,420
It's safe to keep it as a pet.

342
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,260
If you want it,

343
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,260
I'll give you a cage for free.

344
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,700
Sure. I'll take it, too.

345
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,620
Alright!

346
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,300
- Miaomiao, do something!
- Come on.

347
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,540
Remove its teeth and stick a nail in it.

348
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,140
Wait, I want it too.

349
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,900
I also want to buy it.

350
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,700
But she said it first.

351
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,620
I'll pay more money.

352
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,220
Please let me have it, ma'am.

353
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,420
Uh...

354
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,780
Sure. Alright.

355
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,500
Thank you, ma'am.

356
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,100
Here you go.

357
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,500
This is far from enough.

358
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,060
I'll get the rest from my friend

359
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,740
and pay you soon.

360
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,420
Sorry, no credit.

361
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,500
Pay now

362
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,780
or get out.

363
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,020
- Don't waste my time...
- Hold on.

364
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,220
She can certainly afford it.

365
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,980
Watch your attitude!

366
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,900
How rude!

367
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:12,940
My apologies.

368
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,740
She's only a saleswoman.

369
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,180
She's ignorant.

370
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,860
She can't tell how rich you are.

371
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:19,940
Please don't mind her.

372
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:21,900
What?

373
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:26,780
Your hairpin is a rare treasure.

374
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,500
An alive Bamboo Demon

375
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,940
can turn into anything.

376
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,020
Its demon core

377
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,820
can strengthen the body

378
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,660
and rejuvenate a 70-year-old senior.

379
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,740
How much will you sell it?

380
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,580
No way.

381
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,260
I won't sell my friend.

382
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,220
I understand.

383
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,660
Nurturing such a demon is

384
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,780
difficult and time-consuming.

385
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,780
I won't bargain with you.

386
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,060
Just name your price.

387
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,380
Or if you like

388
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,980
anything we have here,

389
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,660
we can do an exchange.

390
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,660
- Pick anything.
- No, no.

391
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,900
- No problem.
- I won't sell it

392
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,100
no matter what you offer!

393
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,380
Killers!

394
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,460
You...

395
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,620
Are you going to

396
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,620
rob me in broad daylight?

397
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,220
We wouldn't dare.

398
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,800
The Court of Judicial Review is next door.

399
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:13,980
The thing is

400
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:17,300
you've wasted so much of our time

401
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,500
and scared off so many clients.

402
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,620
Shouldn't you compensate us?

403
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,020
Guys, pluck off that hairpin!

404
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,340
Grab her!

405
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,580
Let go of me!

406
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,620
- Ziqi!
- Are you alright?

407
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,300
You...

408
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,500
Calm down. Don't cause trouble.

409
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,580
Ziqi.

410
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,700
This nonlocal Demon Catcher is

411
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,100
bullying a woman!

412
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,540
He's breaking the law!

413
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,580
Where is justice?

414
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,500
He broke jars

415
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,260
of my liquor!

416
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,540
Report him to the authorities!

417
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,500
This store is my life!

418
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,220
- He's killing me!
- Who is he?

419
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,100
You're twisting things.

420
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,980
You meant to grab my hairpin.

421
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,060
Who saw it? Any witnesses?

422
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,340
Did any of you see it?

423
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,060
It's your fault.

424
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,140
You had no money and broke my jars.

425
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,340
You're lying.

426
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,340
Excuse me. Make a way.

427
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,580
I'll beat the truth out of you.

428
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,700
- Hello.
- What's going on?

429
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,140
I know you're good people.

430
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,260
You're reasonable.

431
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,460
Look.

432
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,060
Just look around!

433
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,940
He ruined my store.

434
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,540
It's hard

435
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,580
to keep it running.

436
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,420
How much is the liquor?

437
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,700
We'll pay for it.

438
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,220
Don't listen to her!

439
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,740
She's trying to rip us off!

440
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,980
I'm not!

441
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,060
- I...
- No way!

442
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,540
- Calm down, Sheng.
- Hey, you...

443
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,660
We're new here and invited
by the Jade Token.

444
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,300
It's better not to cause trouble.

445
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,460
Yes, that's right.

446
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,820
She has a point.

447
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,900
We have more important duties.

448
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,580
Ma'am,

449
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,660
he broke 11 jars of the best liquor

450
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,980
and 12 jars of the second best.

451
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,820
I'll round it up.

452
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,500
800 taels of gold!

453
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,300
800 taels of gold?

454
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,380
Is this place a trap?

455
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,740
How many people have you ripped off,

456
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,700
you old witch?

457
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,700
What did you call me?

458
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,660
- You're evil!
- What trap?

459
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,660
- Do not pay her!
- I'm a witch?

460
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,970
- Miaomiao...
- You're a witch!

461
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,060
If you think it's unfair,

462
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,700
- go to the court next door!
- I'll pay

463
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,660
for them.

464
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,540
Take care, sir.

465
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,620
- See you next time.
- Pendants. Nice pendants.

466
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,980
- Pendants.
- I'll take my leave then.

467
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,380
Wait.

468
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,620
Thank you for helping us out.

469
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,020
May I know your name?

470
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,140
We'll pay you back.

471
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,820
Thanks, but that's unnecessary.

472
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,500
My master gives you his regards.

473
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,060
Your master?

474
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,420
Who is it?

475
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,620
You'll find out.

476
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,620
Good day.

477
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,500
How mysterious.

478
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,100
Is he working for Dowager Consort Zhao?

479
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:09,900
I don't think so.

480
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,740
Why bother to conceal the identity

481
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,180
if that person used the token?

482
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,260
We're being watched

483
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,860
as soon as we're here.

484
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,340
The capital is indeed a deep sea.

485
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,260
Let's go rest at the inn

486
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,580
and go to the palace tomorrow.

487
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,020
(Tuanyuan Inn)

488
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,380
Why are you still up this late?

489
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,100
You can't sleep?

490
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,220
Me neither.

491
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,260
I've been thinking about this morning.

492
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:02,940
Why?

493
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,500
I realize

494
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,380
this is a tough world for demons.

495
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,700
It is as it's always been.

496
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,380
You didn't know that before?

497
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,940
I did,

498
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,140
but I didn't know it was this bad.

499
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,660
Now I know

500
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,460
why you keep saying you aren't a demon.

501
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,420
Stop calling me a demon.

502
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,500
I am not!

503
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,460
Sorry.

504
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,180
Half-demon.

505
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,460
Knock it off, Lin Miaomiao.

506
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,820
Someone cast a demonic spell

507
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,180
on me when I was young,

508
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,420
so I turned out differently.

509
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:55,940
But I'm still a human

510
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,100
who catches demons.

511
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,740
Don't call me that ever again.

512
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,660
Sorry, my bad. I won't.

513
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,020
I won't say that again.

514
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,660
I meant to have a heart-to-heart with you.

515
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,180
It was your fault.

516
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,940
You had to get on my nerves.

517
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,780
Sheng,

518
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,020
stop being so mean.

519
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,460
Be nice to Miss Lin.

520
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,820
Don't be so rude.

521
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,300
Liu Fuyi,

522
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,500
am I being too nice to you?

523
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,060
Who are you to lecture me?

524
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,860
Calm down. Don't be mad.

525
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,700
Sit down.

526
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,660
Just go.

527
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,780
(This is bad.)

528
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,220
(The rift between Ziqi and Brother Liu)

529
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,340
(can't go any wider.)

530
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,420
(I must do something about it.)

531
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,220
Ziqi,

532
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,020
think about it.

533
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,060
He's actually

534
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,180
quite nice, isn't he?

535
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,580
He's been kind to you

536
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,660
and the rest of us

537
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,620
along the way.

538
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,380
What's your point?

539
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,180
My point is,

540
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,340
even if you don't like him,

541
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,180
we're in this together.

542
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,340
We should be a team,

543
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,180
right?

544
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,180
Yes.

545
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,100
You're right.

546
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,300
I'm being ungrateful.

547
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,220
How I treat him is none of your business!

548
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,700
(Corner Gate of the Palace)

549
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,620
Excuse me.

550
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,220
Why aren't we using the main gate,

551
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,580
(Tai'an Gate)
but the corner gate?

552
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,740
It's the Dowager Consort's order.

553
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,780
Please.

554
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,820
Does she think

555
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,300
she has our token,

556
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,140
so she can insult us like this?

557
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,780
We're following the order.

558
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,740
(Peiyun, Stewardess)

559
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,260
I'm ordered by the Dowager Consort

560
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,220
to receive all of you.

561
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,540
You're candid and straightforward.

562
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,540
I'll be honest with you, too.

563
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,780
(Taian Gate)
His Majesty dislikes cultivators.

564
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,820
You probably have heard that.

565
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,340
Even the Astronomical Bureau

566
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,980
has to tread carefully.

567
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,380
This matter is highly sensitive.

568
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,620
As noble as the Dowager Consort is,

569
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,300
she's only a member of the harem.

570
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,180
She has to be discreet.

571
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,340
Your visit must be off the record.

572
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,540
She went to great lengths to invite you

573
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,980
because she believed only the Mu Family

574
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,380
could help her.

575
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,140
Please try to understand her

576
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,260
and come with me.

577
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,940
Fine. Let's go.

578
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,300
She has a way with words

579
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,180
and sounds convincing.

580
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,580
Yes.

581
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,980
So does Sister Mu.

582
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,100
Did you forget what I said?

583
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,080
What?

584
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,260
Your love calamity.

585
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,420
When you're in the capital,

586
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,620
be wary of all beautiful girls.

587
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,140
Better to stay away from them.

588
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,500
I will.

589
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,420
Why do you care so much

590
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,700
about him and other girls?

591
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,100
So nosy!

592
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:09,260
Aren't you ignoring me

593
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,060
because I'm too talkative?

594
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,140
Love calamity?

595
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,400
How ridiculous!

596
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,930
Have you even heard that?

597
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,420
You know nothing about it.

598
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,420
(Zhao Qinru, Dowager Consort)

599
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,420
There they are.

600
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,820
The 19th leader of the Mu Family,

601
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,040
Mu Yao, comes with her brother, Mu Sheng,

602
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,100
and friends, Liu Fuyi and Lin Yu,

603
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,740
to pay their respects to you.

604
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,660
At ease.

605
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:59,700
So you're in charge now

606
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,180
at such a young age.

607
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,380
Well,

608
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,460
your family isn't as big as before.

609
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,140
It must be tough

610
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,140
without your father and seniors.

611
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,300
Thanks for your concern, Your Highness.

612
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,660
I might be young,

613
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,540
but I can revive our family.

614
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,780
Why did you invite us over

615
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,940
with the Jade Token?

616
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,340
Mr. and Miss Mu,

617
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,460
please come with me.

618
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:36,020
The other two of you may rest.

619
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:40,940
Don't worry.

620
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,500
Sheng and I can handle it.

621
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,660
Wait for us outside.

622
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,660
Please follow me.

623
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,340
Such resemblance!

624
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,820
Did you notice it?

625
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,580
(Ruyi, Stewardess Madam)
Yes, they look alike.

626
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,260
Almost identical.

627
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:11,100
(Fengyang Palace)

628
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,620
Don't strangle me!

629
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,980
Princess, Princess!

630
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,340
Stay back!

631
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,200
Don't strangle me!

632
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,860
(Li Songmin, Princess Duanyang)
- Don't strangle me! - You're safe.

633
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,660
Don't strangle me!

634
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,580
No, you're fine.

635
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,620
It's a bad dream. Let it go.

636
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,420
Cultivators from the Mu Family are here.

637
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,540
They're here to help you!

638
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,340
- Princess!
- Princess, Princess!

639
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,980
Who is it?

640
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,140
Who's calling me?

641
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,300
Princess!

642
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,580
There's a voice.

643
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,780
Who is it?

644
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,780
- Who is it?
- Princess!

645
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,220
Who is it?

646
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,140
Princess!

647
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,780
Princess!

648
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,580
- Princess!
- Princess!

649
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,630
No one will harm you.

650
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,470
Princess!

651
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,060
- Princess!
- Princess!

652
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:25,900
Princess!

653
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:31,780
Princess!

654
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,180
Don't look over there.

655
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,780
I said no.

656
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,580
Don't look at them.

657
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,380
I'm sorry for keeping you waiting.

658
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,260
It's not that
Her Highness doesn't trust you.

659
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,340
She and the Mu Family have gone way back,

660
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,020
so she trusts them more.

661
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,580
Please have some tea.

662
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,380
Thanks.

663
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,620
Where are you from, Young Master Liu?

664
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,300
I'm a wanderer,

665
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,660
drifting from place to place.

666
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,060
But you weren't born like this.

667
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,220
Many years ago,

668
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,780
I lived in Cainan.

669
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,900
Cainan?

670
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,460
It's beautiful.

671
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,140
Have you been to

672
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,860
Mount Zixia?

673
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,580
Where are Sister Mu and Ziqi?

674
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,620
Where did they go?

675
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,200
They're reporting back to Her Highness

676
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,580
after checking the situation.

677
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,620
They'll be back soon.

678
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,340
Do you mind doing me a favor?

679
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,020
Can you bring Cuicui
to the Imperial Garden?

680
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,300
Why?

681
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,420
Cuicui can check the feng shui.

682
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,300
Bamboo Demons believe in that.

683
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,700
Not me.

684
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,060
Please do it for me.

685
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,340
Pretty please.

686
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,380
I'll wait here for you.

687
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,620
Fine.

688
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,620
But not for too long.

689
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,620
They'll be back shortly.

690
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,460
Sure.

691
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,500
Go now.

692
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:17,980
Look, Miss,

693
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,940
he's left.

694
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,540
You may leave, too.

695
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,540
(While Sister Mu is away,)

696
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,980
(I'll watch Brother Liu for her.)

697
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,580
We've checked and found

698
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,300
nothing evil haunting the Princess.

699
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,300
It's not demons.

700
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,220
Impossible.

701
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,300
We did find nothing.

702
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,140
Sheng and I tried

703
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,660
spells, charms and formations

704
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,580
in her chamber.

705
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,300
There is no evil energy

706
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,460
or malicious resentment.

707
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:06,020
So you didn't find anything.

708
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,500
Because there is none.

709
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,060
Do you not trust our abilities?

710
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,780
Your Highness,

711
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:14,100
what did the Astronomical Bureau say?

712
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,460
They couldn't help her either.

713
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,020
They also didn't sense anything evil.

714
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,420
That's why I used your father's token.

715
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,540
I trusted your family the most.

716
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,020
Please check again.

717
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,820
My daughter must be haunted by demons.

718
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:37,660
How do you know it's demons?

719
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,500
Aren't her symptoms obvious?

720
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:45,620
Nightmares,

721
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,140
delirium, poor appetite.

722
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,500
She's haunted.

723
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,580
Maybe it's a rare disease.

724
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,980
The Imperial Physicians have checked her.

725
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,180
Her pulse is perfectly normal.

726
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,460
She isn't sick at all.

727
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,620
If only your father were still alive.

728
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,180
A token is a promise.

729
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,420
We will help you.

730
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,980
Give us some more time.

731
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,140
I promise

732
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,740
to find out the truth

733
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,180
before her wedding.

734
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,820
My Lord, the Mu Family have left
the Liuyue Palace.

735
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,580
Have they found anything?

736
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,740
We don't know yet.

737
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,020
My Lord.

738
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,060
My Lord?

739
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,780
Who is that?

740
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,060
Who do you mean?

741
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,580
That girl

742
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,820
who doesn't look like those
in the palace.

743
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,700
My Lord,

744
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,060
you'll marry the Princess next month.

745
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,860
You shouldn't look at other girls

746
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:52,900
at this time.

747
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,660
My Lord.

748
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:57,900
Come on. Let's go!

749
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,480
The Dowager Consort's servants are
watching you.

750
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,260
Come on.

751
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,540
Let's go!

752
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:02,900
Come on!

753
00:35:30,481 --> 00:35:34,611
♪The sky in my eyes
