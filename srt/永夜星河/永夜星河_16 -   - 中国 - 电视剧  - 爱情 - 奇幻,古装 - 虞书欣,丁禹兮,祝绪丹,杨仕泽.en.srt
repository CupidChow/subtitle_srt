=Episode 16=

3
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,540
(Bustling and Crowded)

4
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,620
Over the last three years,

5
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,700
the Princess has been looking for

6
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,890
her love
behind the Dowager Consort's back.

7
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,280
Is she already in love with someone?

8
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,120
Yes.

9
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:57,530
Marquis doesn't want to
marry her either.

10
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:58,940
The two of them

11
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,320
have never liked each other.

12
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,350
When they were young, the Princess

13
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,790
beat him from the front hall to the back.

14
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,740
He thought she was too violent

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,510
and added something

16
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,450
non-harmful

17
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,690
to her incense.

18
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:15,100
She took that chance to fake an illness.

19
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,780
You've found out about that?

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,680
I was worrying for nothing.

21
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,200
The Astronomical Bureau knew the truth

22
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,170
but said nothing. Why?

23
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,050
Because of Marquis Zhao?

24
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,740
No, not exactly.

25
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,310
He's young and naive.

26
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,610
We aren't afraid of him.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,970
So who are you afraid of?

28
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,950
You might be excellent cultivators,

29
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,200
but in terms of politics,

30
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,530
you're inexperienced.

31
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,760
Their marriage concerns

32
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,510
the honor of the Dowager Consort's family,

33
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,790
the Zhao Family.

34
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,020
It cannot be impaired no matter what.

35
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,250
If we couldn't solve the problem,

36
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,710
we'd look useless at most,

37
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,500
but we could still keep our jobs.

38
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,480
However...

39
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,740
You were afraid of the higher-ups.

40
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,450
You're smart.

41
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,530
We work to

42
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,840
make a living.

43
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,520
It's not worth it

44
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,870
to get ourselves killed.

45
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,900
Not at all.

46
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,690
They say the capital and the court are

47
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,290
a deep sea with sharks.

48
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,220
Clearly, it's true.

49
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,380
The Dowager Consort might trust you,

50
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,400
but if you expose the trick

51
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,340
of two nobilities,

52
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,250
it'll bring you more harm than good.

53
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,920
Take my advice.

54
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,340
Tell them you can't do it.

55
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,570
You think that'll help us?

56
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,550
Yes.

57
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,060
I gave you such information for free.

58
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,250
You already know that, though.

59
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,840
But you can tell

60
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,100
I'm helpful, right?

61
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,630
We aren't of the same kind. Goodbye.

62
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,620
Wait. Hold on.

63
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,220
If you leave,

64
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,910
when Her Highness asks tomorrow,

65
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,290
I can't cover for you.

66
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,570
If she means to give us a hard time,

67
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,030
she can try.

68
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,010
Bring it on.

69
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,660
She used the Jade Token.

70
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,460
I'll deliver my promise.

71
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,840
I'll report back to her tomorrow.

72
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,870
Wait. Calm down.

73
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,120
Listen to me, please.

74
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,340
I asked you to come over

75
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,410
for a favor, actually.

76
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,690
I'm working as a chief
at the Astronomical Bureau

77
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,120
only to find out

78
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,730
what happened at the Qilin Mountain.

79
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,810
Qilin Mountain?

80
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,430
The hometown of that Water Demon
from the Mitu Valley?

81
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,270
Yes.

82
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,560
Dowager Consort Zhao had it leveled

83
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,280
and all the demons there killed,

84
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,030
including the weakest Dust Demons.

85
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,690
Yes, that place it is.

86
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,900
Qilin Mountain...?

87
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:50,990
Mother,

88
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,310
I don't like this place.

89
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,810
When can we go back
to the Qilin Mountain?

90
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,430
Sheng...

91
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,640
Ziqi...

92
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,710
I'll go.

93
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,730
Did I say anything wrong?

94
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,820
What's up, Ziqi?

95
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,050
That place

96
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,200
was...

97
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,610
was my home, I think.

98
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,780
That woman...

99
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,970
who I dream about repeatedly

100
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,410
might really be my mother.

101
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,050
You remember it?

102
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,470
So...

103
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,930
So where is she now?

104
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,370
I don't know.

105
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,260
I faintly remember a few fragments.

106
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,640
But why...?

107
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,900
Why are they coming back to me?

108
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,820
I forgot everything.

109
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,660
Hey, try to relax.

110
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,660
This is good.

111
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,720
Are you recovering the things

112
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,140
that happened before you were seven?

113
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,140
Can you recall anything else?

114
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,460
I don't want that part of my memory.

115
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,530
I'm an orphan.

116
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,660
I don't care about the past.

117
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,140
The massacre ordered
by Dowager Consort Zhao

118
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,580
does seem strange.

119
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,370
Whatever was hidden there

120
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,340
must be a top secret.

121
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,970
It all led to the Qilin Mountain.

122
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,820
But given her noble status,

123
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,370
even if you can prove her guilty,

124
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,140
what can you do?

125
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,700
There's nothing I can do.

126
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,970
I only want to know the truth.

127
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,730
My master, all my fellows,

128
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,120
and the civilians in Zhijing Town

129
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,220
all died.

130
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,820
As the sole survivor,

131
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,410
I have to at least find out

132
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:21,850
what led to their tragic deaths.

133
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,290
What happened at the Qilin Mountain?

134
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,220
When I join them

135
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,530
in the underworld,

136
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,900
I'll be able to tell them.

137
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,050
I will help you

138
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,470
only if

139
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,850
you do something for me.

140
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,840
What is it?

141
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,370
I heard a decade ago,

142
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,900
that the Xingshan Hall was on fire.

143
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,170
Did that fire have anything

144
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,970
to do with Dowager Consort Zhao?

145
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,160
Peiyun,

146
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,970
what to do? I'm nervous!

147
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,530
Did you make a mistake?

148
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,290
You'll trust me when you see him.

149
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,240
No one else

150
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,070
in or out of the palace owns such charm.

151
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,140
I'm sure of it.

152
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,930
It's him. It really is him!

153
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,100
Peiyun,

154
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,970
he's Young Master Liu who saved me!

155
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,580
Greetings, everyone.

156
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,410
I'm glad to see you.

157
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,510
I meant to go to

158
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,780
the Astronomical Bureau
for a trivial matter.

159
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,140
Now that you're here,

160
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,610
do you mind helping me out?

161
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,660
Is this about the Princess again?

162
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,660
She's still the same.

163
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,820
It's the Imperial Garden.

164
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,660
Crabapple trees usually blossom
in March,

165
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,490
but not this year.

166
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,000
It's the end of April.

167
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,140
There aren't even any buds.

168
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,100
Even the best gardener

169
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,340
didn't know the cause.

170
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,840
I wonder if it has

171
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,100
something to do with demons.

172
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,060
It is a trivial matter.

173
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,130
We're quite busy, too.

174
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,770
Maybe you can ask others for help.

175
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,460
You probably don't know.

176
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,490
His Majesty adores those trees,

177
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,030
and he entrusted them to me.

178
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,730
He's returning from the border.

179
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,540
If he sees them sick,

180
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,130
I can't imagine the consequences.

181
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,610
Weed Demons are

182
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,910
most active at this time

183
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,220
of the year.

184
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,970
We're going to see Dowager Consort Zhao.

185
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,120
Maybe

186
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,100
we can check them for you later.

187
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,120
I understand.

188
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,770
Mr. and Miss Mu
have important things to do.

189
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,820
Young Master Liu, can you help me?

190
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,440
The Imperial Garden is right over there.

191
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,420
It won't take too much of your time.

192
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,010
Go ahead then.

193
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,370
We'll be fine.

194
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,200
Alright.

195
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,100
(This isn't about trees.)

196
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,540
(It's a honey trap.)

197
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,220
Please lead the way.

198
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,080
I'll join you.

199
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,150
I'm not a Mu either.

200
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,580
I'll go with you.

201
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,370
What can you do?

202
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,770
Can you make the trees blossom?

203
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,370
Yes, I can.

204
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,730
Be good.

205
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,870
Don't fool around.

206
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,350
Let's go.

207
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,480
Her Highness has

208
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,630
a visitor now.

209
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,460
Please wait in the side hall.

210
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,300
The audience was scheduled

211
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,850
at this hour in the letter yesterday.

212
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,220
Are you wasting our time?

213
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,120
Marquis

214
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,670
rushed in earlier

215
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,970
for an urgent matter.

216
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,540
We didn't mean to delay it.

217
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,420
Please rest in the side hall.

218
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,100
- This way, please.
- Thanks.

219
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,480
We aren't summoned at the moment.

220
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,130
Why not join Brother Liu?

221
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:44,540
Why?

222
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,300
Because of his love calamity?

223
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,840
Yes. Didn't you see

224
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,120
that stewardess, Peiyun,

225
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,730
staring at him just now?

226
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,440
She chose him in particular

227
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,180
for such a trifle.

228
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,970
That's suspicious.

229
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,370
Fuyi is always kind to others.

230
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,340
You're thinking too much, Miaomiao.

231
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,220
(Come on, Sister Mu.)

232
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,940
(Don't be so naive!)

233
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,220
(Imperial Garden)

234
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,560
Stewardess Peiyun,

235
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,010
I didn't sense

236
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,580
anything evil in this area.

237
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,180
Where are the sick crabapple trees

238
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,770
you said?

239
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,510
Right here.

240
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,700
"Apple" is my childhood name.

241
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,610
Marquis went to
see Her Highness before us.

242
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,100
What is he up to?

243
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,730
Is he going to feign innocence
and set us up?

244
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,970
Let's hear it.

245
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:22,710
Eavesdrop?

246
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,970
That's unethical.

247
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,340
What? You did it?

248
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,240
Zhao Ruoshi,

249
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,610
you crossed the line!

250
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,200
I...

251
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,700
I know I did,

252
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,180
but I never thought the Princess
would be haunted.

253
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,730
I put a tiny bit of enchanting incense

254
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,580
- just to...
- To do what?

255
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,710
Speak!

256
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,940
To make those in her chamber

257
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,820
think she grew a beard.

258
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:00,630
You...

259
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,650
You went too far!

260
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,850
Only because you forced me to marry her.

261
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,060
Pardon? What did you say?

262
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,130
I cannot marry her!

263
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,720
She beat me through my childhood.

264
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,180
I'm scared of her even now.

265
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,670
Do you think I wanted
to marry her to you?

266
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,100
She's the fairest and the wisest.

267
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,440
But look at you.

268
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,030
You aren't good at anything.

269
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,790
The Zhao Family took me in
and brought me up.

270
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,330
I've long considered myself one of them,

271
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,370
and I share weal and woe with them.

272
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,850
If you weren't their sole heir,

273
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,300
I wouldn't have arranged all this.

274
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,390
You're right.

275
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:48,360
In terms of knowledge,
talent and principles,

276
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,000
I'm way below Father's level.

277
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,440
But never have I ever wanted to

278
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,130
live like him.

279
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,370
His name "Qinghuan" means happiness,

280
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,940
but he's been living unhappily.

281
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:07,580
He possesses unmatched power and wealth,

282
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,840
but Your Highness,

283
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,220
he's never happy.

284
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,540
He named me "Ruoshi", meaning loss.

285
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,890
Perhaps he also thought

286
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,250
he had lost something important...

287
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,100
in his life.

288
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,800
Your Highness,

289
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,540
I've always been obedient to you,

290
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,300
but as the wedding approaches,

291
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,890
I can't help but recall my childhood

292
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,580
and such loneliness and void

293
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,100
between my parents.

294
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,940
Back then, I didn't understand.

295
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,440
The three of us were a family,

296
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,650
but even though we were together,

297
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,370
it was as if we were distant
from each other.

298
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,820
That felt

299
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,460
even worse

300
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,460
than being all alone in the world.

301
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,610
Then I said to myself,

302
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,510
if I couldn't

303
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:41,220
marry someone I love in the future,

304
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,730
I'd rather

305
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,730
remain single.

306
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,730
He sounds braver

307
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,420
than I thought.

308
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,630
Like a manly man.

309
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,550
I'm surprised that he's telling the truth

310
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,220
to fight against this marriage.

311
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,490
It's nothing.

312
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,730
I also won't marry a girl I dislike

313
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,490
just because of an order.

314
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:24,790
Ruoshi,

315
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,370
all these years,

316
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,130
I've let you do whatever you want

317
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,100
and have your way.

318
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,700
But this marriage is

319
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,300
non-negotiable.

320
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,100
Your Highness,

321
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,440
you can ignore my happiness,

322
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,940
but what about the Princess's?

323
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,730
She's your flesh and blood.

324
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:46,790
You said she's perfect,

325
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,460
while I'm good at nothing.

326
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,120
Right? She's way out of my league

327
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,420
and deserves a much better man.

328
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,870
Your marriage has been made public.

329
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:54,820
It's too late to cancel it.

330
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,320
I'm warning you.

331
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,560
This is serious.

332
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,700
If you escape,

333
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,510
when His Majesty comes back,

334
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,850
he'll ask what happened to Min.

335
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,850
Will he believe you only

336
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,170
used some enchanting incense?

337
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,650
Can you take the consequences

338
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,850
of murdering a princess?

339
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,000
I swear I didn't...

340
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,170
- Think carefully.
- I didn't mean to hurt her!

341
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,200
I didn't do it, Your Highness!

342
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,060
I'm telling the truth.

343
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,650
Listen, Ruoshi,

344
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,340
you're my nephew.

345
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,260
All that I've done is

346
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,130
for you and the Zhao Family.

347
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:27,870
If you

348
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,890
do what I say,

349
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,410
I'll cover

350
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,780
for your wrongdoing.

351
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,430
Alright?

352
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,890
It's cold at the border,

353
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,540
but spring still comes.

354
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,670
That's good enough.

355
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:47,980
What did you say?

356
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,210
I didn't mean to hurt the Princess,

357
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,300
but I did drug her.

358
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,740
I'll take any punishment

359
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,850
to break free from this marriage.

360
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,000
You're driving me crazy!

361
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,840
Your Highness,

362
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,370
I'd rather die in exile

363
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:17,410
than live like my parents!

364
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,000
Fine.

365
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,370
You're tough, huh?

366
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,150
Guards!

367
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,350
If this is your decision,

368
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,340
do not regret it.

369
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,060
Throw him in prison!

370
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,520
Hold on!

371
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,650
Who let you in?

372
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,630
Get out.

373
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,720
Your Highness,

374
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,610
you should hear this.

375
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,680
There was enchanting incense
in the Princess's chamber,

376
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,820
but it was harmless.

377
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,310
The truth is...

378
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,150
Mother.

379
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,520
Min.

380
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,020
Mother, I'm fine now.

381
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,540
Let me see.

382
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,580
- Really?
- Yes.

383
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,610
It's all thanks to Young Master Liu.

384
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,740
When he cast a spell
in the garden earlier,

385
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,980
I instantly felt so free and relaxed.

386
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,240
Really?

387
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,610
This is great!

388
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,130
I was so worried!

389
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,110
Relax, Mother.

390
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:21,950
I'm all well now.

391
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,350
What happened?

392
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,500
Why is Ruoshi held by them?

393
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,060
You may leave.

394
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,800
Yes.

395
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,430
Do you remember

396
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,340
I almost got hurt by demons
on the trip that year?

397
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,610
Those of the Astronomical Bureau there

398
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,780
were all useless.

399
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,310
Thankfully, Young Master Liu passed by

400
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,510
and saved my life.

401
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,980
Or I couldn't have come back.

402
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,020
I never forgot about him

403
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,850
and had people look for him everywhere.

404
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,930
And now here he is,

405
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,690
and he's saved my life again.

406
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,110
Mother,

407
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,300
what happened to me earlier

408
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,350
was probably because

409
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,110
I didn't pay him back for his help.

410
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,450
I was punished.

411
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:26,780
Mother, could you please put off

412
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,850
this marriage for now?

413
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,260
I'd like to pay off

414
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,850
the debts I owe Young Master Liu first.

415
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,580
What? You too?

416
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,020
You two really are a handful.

417
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,780
He'd rather give up his title
to cancel it.

418
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,580
And you don't care about it either.

419
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,820
I'm out.

420
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,100
Explain it to His Majesty yourselves.

421
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:00,870
Mother,

422
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:01,950
be careful.

423
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,300
Look at you.

424
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,650
You've never won

425
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,850
any of our fights since childhood.

426
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,850
But I should thank you this time.

427
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,670
Fuyi,

428
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,740
why didn't you tell me

429
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,100
you and Princess Duanyang are friends?

430
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,370
- Hold on, Young Master Liu.
- I...

431
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,190
May I

432
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,400
invite you to my chamber

433
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,260
for a drink?

434
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,690
That's too nice of you.

435
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,720
But I should go.

436
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,150
Wait.

437
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,350
- What about tomorrow?
- (What's going on?)

438
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,440
- Slow down!
- (She's a princess.)

439
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,280
Yao...

440
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,720
(How needy!)

441
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,650
Hold on, Miss!

442
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,020
Can we have a word?

443
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,430
Thank you

444
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:49,930
for helping me earlier.

445
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,800
You're welcome.

446
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,060
Uh, thank me for what?

447
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,590
For finding out that enchanting incense

448
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,610
was harmless to the Princess

449
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,510
and telling the truth to clear my name.

450
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,300
She didn't say anything at all.

451
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,080
And

452
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,370
hadn't it been for you,

453
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,960
I wouldn't have had the courage

454
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,580
to speak up before Her Highness.

455
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,040
I felt great.

456
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,190
That had nothing to do with me.

457
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,170
I knew

458
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,790
girls like the Princess

459
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,020
weren't my type,

460
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,170
but I didn't know what my type was

461
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,680
until I saw you...

462
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,520
Our work here is done.

463
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,780
Let's go back to practice.

464
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,560
Miss...

465
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,540
How did it go, My Lord?

466
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,440
The heart is no longer as empty
as the yard by moonlight.

467
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,890
I mean if you're punished
for your doing.

468
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,720
Jiu,

469
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,850
I've found my love!

470
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,920
Young Master Liu,

471
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,030
if you're busy today,

472
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:03,980
what about tomorrow?

473
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,300
When is it convenient for you?

474
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,260
You saved my life.

475
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,820
I ought to thank you.

476
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,890
I don't deserve it.

477
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,850
You weren't haunted.

478
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,370
No need to thank me.

479
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,890
I knew I couldn't fool you.

480
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,850
You helped me three years ago

481
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,450
at Mount Zixia.

482
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,100
That alone is worth a drink.

483
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,890
Catching demons is my duty.

484
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,060
You don't owe me anything.

485
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,150
Good day.

486
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,020
Young Master Liu...

487
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,520
Your Highness,

488
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,740
he seems to care a lot about Mu Yao.

489
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,300
He does.

490
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,580
The way he looks at her is

491
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,260
so sweet and warm.

492
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,370
I wonder if he's in love with her.

493
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,540
But that's fine.

494
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:55,400
I'll make him look at me alone

495
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,580
like that one day.

496
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,630
Yao.

497
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,670
Yao!

498
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,340
Princess Duanyang and I aren't friends.

499
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,500
We met once

500
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,740
a long time ago.

501
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,170
Hadn't she brought it up,

502
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,610
I wouldn't have remembered it.

503
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,130
I know.

504
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,720
Honestly,

505
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,020
I can barely recall it.

506
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,780
You're always on the way, too.

507
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,980
You know

508
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,350
we'll help those in need

509
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,980
no matter who they are.

510
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,690
I'm telling the truth.

511
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:44,540
When we met in the garden,

512
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,850
I didn't recognize her at all.

513
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,000
I...

514
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,150
Fuyi,

515
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,130
I trust you.

516
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,450
Although

517
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,880
you've never told me

518
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,720
about your past,

519
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,060
I know

520
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:03,740
you've never lied to me either.

521
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,190
Uh...

522
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,610
get some rest then.

523
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,540
(Oh no!)

524
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,300
(A rift is growing between them.)

525
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,980
(Things can't go on like this.)

526
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,980
I need your help, Ziqi.

527
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,680
Miss, this letter from the Marquis Mansion

528
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,890
invites you to see their flowers.

529
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:35,870
Flowers?

530
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,310
Please apologize for me

531
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,370
and tell them I can't go.

532
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,840
Yes.

533
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,800
Ziqi...

534
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,650
What's up with Ziqi lately?

535
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,780
He's being mean to me.

536
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,170
From my experience,

537
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,060
he likes you.

538
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,170
Young people

539
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,410
do this all the time.

540
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,830
You don't know anything.

541
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,370
Experience? You have none.

542
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,650
Yes, I do.

543
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,300
My grandfather said

544
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,890
900 years ago,

545
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:24,060
when he was young,

546
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,850
he fell for a cute photinia serrulata.

547
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,080
Hold on.

548
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,640
He was a bamboo

549
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,170
but in love with a tree?

550
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,100
Is that the point?

551
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,170
Go on.

552
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,650
He was young and stupid.

553
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:43,060
He liked her,

554
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,300
but he was too shy to admit it.

555
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,690
He pretended he didn't care

556
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,650
and said hurtful things.

557
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,500
When she blossomed,

558
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,560
he said,

559
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,650
"It stinks!"

560
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,720
It's true.

561
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,610
When you like someone,

562
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:09,370
you tend to say the opposite.

563
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:13,370
Your grandfather seemed to be pure.

564
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,430
Then what?

565
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,960
Then

566
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,310
she turned into a girl

567
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,500
and left with a Bird Demon,

568
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,540
a handsome sweet-talker.

569
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,260
She never came back again.

570
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,650
That girl was heartless.

571
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,650
I know, right?

572
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:37,880
"All demons have a bitter past.

573
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,980
All those in love will suffer.

574
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,340
Be it a human or a demon,

575
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:45,100
they'll be hurt in love."

576
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,060
My grandfather said so.

577
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:48,780
Anyway,

578
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,820
he's been in pain for over 900 years

579
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,410
and remained single to this day.

580
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:59,060
If so, who gave birth to you?

581
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,410
Plants don't need to mate for reproduction.

582
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,030
Our love is

583
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,640
not that complicated

584
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,610
and much purer than humans'.

585
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,260
Fine. Whatever.

586
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,370
I'll watch Ziqi closely

587
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:16,500
in case he'll end up
like my grandfather.

588
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,170
He definitely likes you.

589
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:21,640
That's why he's acting against you

590
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,500
and finding fault with you.

591
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,100
Is that so?

592
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,300
What else could it be?

593
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,920
(Speaking of Ziqi,)

594
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,930
(what's his favorability now?)

595
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,680
(Hasn't it increased)

596
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,930
(without us knowing it?)

597
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,370
Dust Demons, Dust Demons,

598
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:45,980
Dust Demons!

599
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,270
Why are you calling them?

600
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,920
I have a question.

601
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,300
Strangely,

602
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,920
I haven't seen them

603
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,650
since we arrived in the capital.

604
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,980
That's because of
the Astronomical Bureau.

605
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:00,200
It's said
that they have the supreme weapon

606
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,400
left by the only Heavenly Demon Catcher

607
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,130
from 900 years ago, Crescent!

608
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,370
It is the most powerful in the world.

609
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,780
With that weapon in the city,

610
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,410
demons can only use one third
of their power.

611
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:17,130
Don't you see I get sleepy

612
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,370
and tired easily lately?

613
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,400
The weakest demons such as Dust Demons

614
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,610
have gone into hiding.

615
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,210
I see.

616
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,790
You little shoot

617
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:30,060
are well-informed.

618
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,170
My grandfather is.

619
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,650
Like I said,

620
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:39,270
bamboos are connected by our roots.

621
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,450
My grandfather is 1,000 years old.

622
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,350
He can contact all the bamboos

623
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,740
and certain plants in the world.

624
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,170
In this case,

625
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,030
I can't know

626
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:53,130
his favorability, can I?

627
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,070
Just ask him.

628
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:57,850
Why can't humans be straight?

629
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,440
I…I can't do that.

630
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,540
I'll do it for you.

631
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,100
No, you can't.

632
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,650
Zip it!

633
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:14,750
(Forget about Ziqi.)

634
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,820
(Business first.)

635
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,850
(My poor memory!)

636
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,400
(I can hardly remember
what the book says.)

637
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,300
(Who suffered the love calamity?)

638
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,240
(I should protect the love)

639
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,130
(between Sister Mu and Brother Liu.)

640
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:30,300
(That's my top priority.)

641
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,260
Don't be sneaky, shorty.

642
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,780
Or you'll get hurt.

643
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,820
No, don't!

644
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,450
I didn't mean to be nosy,

645
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,920
but bamboos are straight shooters.

646
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:14,540
We can't stand others

647
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,540
hiding their feelings.

648
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,080
What is it?

649
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,100
Do you like Miaomiao?

650
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,350
What...?

651
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,850
What are you talking about?

652
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,170
I knew it!

653
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,340
You're just like my grandfather.

654
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,890
It's been 900 years,

655
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,780
but whenever we bring up that girl,

656
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,650
he'll drop what's in his hand

657
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,650
and stutter.

658
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,100
Who...?

659
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,890
Who's stut...?

660
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,650
She clings on to me all day

661
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,500
with a cute smile.

662
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,800
I...

663
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,930
I don't like her!

664
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,260
Listen,

665
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,450
don't act like my grandfather.

666
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:11,020
You have a bad temper

667
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,020
and a long face.

668
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,850
You're even meaner than him.

669
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,780
You can't sweet-talk her.

670
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,580
If you keep ignoring her,

671
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,210
if you don't tell her you like her,

672
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,820
she'll be with someone else!

673
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,450
Hey, shorty,

674
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,210
don't lecture me.

675
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,840
I'll break you!

676
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,890
That's all I can say.

677
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,420
Sir, only one braised meat bun is left.

678
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,840
Miaomiao,

679
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:17,870
eat it.

680
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,070
It's yours.

681
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,130
Don't look at me. I don't like it.

682
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,580
You're so sweet!

683
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,170
It's really good!

684
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,330
Do you like Miaomiao?

685
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:55,020
Our work is done.

686
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,590
Let's go shopping

687
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,900
after breakfast.

688
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,160
Sure.

689
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,430
Join us,

690
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,500
Brother Liu.

691
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:04,430
Alright.

692
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,420
Mu Sheng...

693
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,730
I'm not going.

694
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,650
Why?

695
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:24,610
Come here, Sister Mu.

696
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:25,940
Let's go.

697
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,170
Pendants!

698
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,500
Check out these new pendants!

699
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,770
(Still no interactions.)

700
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,290
(They clearly like each other.)

701
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,940
(They're too shy.)

702
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,710
(There's no time to take things slow.)

703
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,580
(They must be a couple today.)

704
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,770
This flower hairpin looks cute.

705
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,060
Do you like it, Sister Mu?

706
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,770
They sell better accessories
in the capital.

707
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,210
How much is it?

708
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,030
Three taels of silver.

709
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,900
Forget it. That's too much.

710
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,690
Wrap it up, please.

711
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,130
(Yes. That's what I'm talking about.)

712
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,420
You like it, don't you?

713
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:11,800
Hold on.

714
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,460
Don't wrap it now.

715
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,110
Sister Mu hasn't tried it on.

716
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,980
How do you know
if it'll look good on her?

717
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,680
Uh...

718
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,510
Sir.

719
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,610
Stop.

720
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,670
You're deft, Brother Liu.

721
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:52,130
It's perfect!

722
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,170
Young Master Liu?

723
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,240
What a nice surprise.

724
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,330
The Princess's carriage is over there.

725
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:05,610
She'd like to give you a ride.

726
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,350
Please tell Her Highness

727
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,150
I don't deserve

728
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:09,990
such special treatment.

729
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,330
It's dangerous outside.

730
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,100
Her Highness should

731
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,690
go back soon for safety.

732
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,770
(He's doing well.)

733
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:25,730
(He can say no to other girls now.)

734
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,210
Thank you, sir.

735
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,940
Your Highness,

736
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,330
Young Master Liu...

737
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,200
said no.

738
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,390
Step aside!

739
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:54,580
Young Master Liu.

740
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,510
