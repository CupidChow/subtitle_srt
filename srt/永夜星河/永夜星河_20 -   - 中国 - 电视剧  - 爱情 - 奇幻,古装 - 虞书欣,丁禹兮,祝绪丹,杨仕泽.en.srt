2
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,180
=Episode 20=

3
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,700
(Fengyang Palace)

4
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:11,920
Young Master Liu.

5
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,430
I request an audience with the Princess.

6
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,790
This way, please.

7
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,280
Your Highness.

8
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,880
Young Master Liu,

9
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,680
I feared you wouldn't come.

10
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:35,850
Your Highness,

11
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,000
do not go to the Xingshan Hall.

12
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,590
However long you wait,
you won't see me there.

13
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,950
Don't do anything beneath you.

14
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:43,920
Or others will judge you.

15
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,840
Please keep your promise

16
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,920
and forget about me.

17
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,040
After today,

18
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,430
you won't see me again.

19
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,200
What's so good about her?

20
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,950
I mean Miss Mu.

21
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,350
What does she have that I don't?

22
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,120
She's leaving you,

23
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,240
but you can't let it go.

24
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,960
Tell me why.

25
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,310
Yao is

26
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,840
not as tough as she looks.

27
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,520
Five years ago,

28
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,740
when I was badly injured
chasing a great demon,

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,950
she saved my life.

30
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,590
She was always cold and quiet.

31
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,190
That was after the massacre
of her family.

32
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,310
No one believed a young girl like her

33
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,590
could revive the Mu Family.

34
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,470
Everyone was waiting to see her fail.

35
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,840
But she didn't give up.

36
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,600
She and Sheng kept catching demons

37
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,840
while looking for the Resentful Woman

38
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,400
to send a message

39
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,710
that as long as she was alive,

40
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,590
the hundreds-of-years-old Mu Family

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,590
would thrive again someday.

42
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,790
Although Sheng was the closest to her,

43
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,800
he never saw her

44
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,150
being the slightest weak once.

45
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,080
But I did.

46
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,240
She couldn't look fragile

47
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,080
or helpless in front of others,

48
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,910
but told how lost she felt

49
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,350
to a strange Demon Catcher

50
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,240
because he was in a coma.

51
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,150
He couldn't tell anyone else.

52
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,000
However, she didn't know

53
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,310
I had woken up on the first day.

54
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,840
I just couldn't move.

55
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,310
They killed everyone

56
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,750
except me and Sheng.

57
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,870
I'll look after him.

58
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,910
I'll show everyone

59
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,400
the Mu Family didn't fall.

60
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,560
From that day on,

61
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,560
I could hear her

62
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,960
pouring out her troubles

63
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,470
at my bedside every night,

64
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,630
although we didn't know each other.

65
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,910
Behind the locked door,

66
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,280
she was still that beloved girl

67
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,280
in her family.

68
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,080
She'd miss her parents

69
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,310
and worry about her future.

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,800
Facing provocation,
she'd quiver with rage.

71
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,560
Facing insult, she'd cry.

72
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,950
But once the door opened,

73
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,390
she'd walk out

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,560
as the forever strong master
of the Mu Family.

75
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,240
She's highly skilled, proud and aloof.

76
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,430
She takes everything upon herself

77
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,720
with her thin shoulders.

78
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,660
She tries to protect everyone
around her.

79
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,630
We've been traveling together
to this day.

80
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,470
However,

81
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,750
she hasn't opened her heart to me again.

82
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,520
Your Highness,

83
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,870
Yao is the love of my life.

84
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,590
I once wished I was

85
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,270
the Heavenly Demon Catcher
in the prophecy.

86
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,510
Then I could help Yao get her revenge

87
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,720
to fulfill her mission.

88
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,680
Even if I'm not,

89
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,870
I want to be there for her

90
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,680
and protect her.

91
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,270
That's the best thing in my life.

92
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,070
That's my biggest wish,

93
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,160
whether she knows that or not...

94
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,520
Whether she...

95
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,830
loves me or not...

96
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,680
Tell me.

97
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,030
If that day...

98
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,870
I had got off the carriage

99
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,600
to thank you,

100
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,800
would we have met first?

101
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,720
Things would've

102
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,000
been different between us,

103
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,590
right?

104
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,040
There are no ifs.

105
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,940
Your Highness,

106
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,070
I don't love you,

107
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,800
but I respect you.

108
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,200
That's why

109
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,830
you can't go to the Xingshan Hall.

110
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,910
You're a wonderful girl.

111
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,830
You deserve the best man in the world.

112
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,070
I'm sure you'll find him.

113
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,870
Peiyun,

114
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,430
give me some space, please.

115
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,560
You may leave.

116
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,830
What did you say?

117
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,600
Yu agreed to marry me

118
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,750
because of that bracelet?

119
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,160
Impossible!

120
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,040
As normal as it seems,

121
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,510
it is dark and evil.

122
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,390
That witch from the Qilin Mountain

123
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,510
used it to enchant your father.

124
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,230
No way!

125
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,390
This is unheard of.

126
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,050
(Qingyi Marquis Mansion)
Everyone in and out

127
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,200
of the court and the harem

128
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,560
was watching Her Highness

129
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,160
and His Majesty,
who wasn't enthroned then.

130
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,390
Your father was bewitched.

131
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,750
That's the last thing

132
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,360
Her Highness wants to talk about.

133
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,510
I'll pretend I didn't see that bracelet.

134
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,560
Get rid of it before she's enraged.

135
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,880
Remember,

136
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,630
stay away from anything evil.

137
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,160
Don't bring disasters upon yourself.

138
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,070
I knew it.

139
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,680
Miss Lin didn't hit her head.

140
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,070
How come she suddenly fell for you?

141
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,950
Now, that explains it.

142
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,800
Actually, I'm in love with someone.

143
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,430
Did you also fall for me at first sight?

144
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,270
No, I didn't.

145
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,720
It's worthless.

146
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,240
Marquis.

147
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,040
Let's get married!

148
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,960
Yu,

149
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:22,360
do you like Mu Ziqi?

150
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,760
No.

151
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,950
I like you.

152
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,870
You're gorgeous, My Lady.

153
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,600
If the late Marquis could

154
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,740
see such a beautiful daughter-in-law,

155
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,030
he'd be happy, too.

156
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,270
What was Ruoshi's father like?

157
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,700
He was born with a talent.

158
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,630
He was handsome, charming,

159
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,320
kind and easygoing,

160
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,510
a perfect gentleman.

161
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,390
Back then, in the capital,

162
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,440
he was the most popular man.

163
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,960
No wonder Ruoshi is also sweet

164
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,200
and good-looking.

165
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,990
Like father, like son
in terms of personality.

166
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,360
His father looked better, though.

167
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,550
It's a pity that he died

168
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,360
at a young age.

169
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,150
You're right.

170
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,550
When Dowager Consort Zhao

171
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,080
chose a girl for his father to marry,

172
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:39,720
he said he'd see the world first.

173
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,120
When he returned over a year later,

174
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,720
he became someone else,

175
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,440
drowning himself in sorrow and alcohol

176
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,720
and ignoring all state
and domestic affairs.

177
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,910
Then he was almost killed

178
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,200
in the assassination.

179
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,870
Perhaps terror made him weak.

180
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,960
It wasn't long before he became too sick

181
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:03,690
and passed away.

182
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,000
Who was the assassin?

183
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,390
I think it was a child.

184
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,670
A child?

185
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,790
Only six or seven years old.

186
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,960
About your fiancé's age then.

187
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,630
More or less.

188
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,030
I heard the same.

189
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,150
He was ragged

190
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,060
and wore a strange hairband,

191
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,440
but he looked fierce

192
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,770
like a little beast.

193
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,480
Quite terrifying.

194
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,470
Hairband?

195
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,120
When did that happen?

196
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,620
About over ten years ago.

197
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,230
Hey,

198
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,320
don't tell others

199
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,200
I said this.

200
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,240
My brother worked
at the Astronomical Bureau then.

201
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,480
He said

202
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,510
that assassin seemed to

203
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,550
come from the Qilin Mountain.

204
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,910
He was a demon!

205
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:56,850
- A demon?
- A demon?

206
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,700
That's right.

207
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,720
Assassin!

208
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,440
Only to find out

209
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,960
what happened at the Qilin Mountain.

210
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,080
Qilin Mountain?

211
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,120
That place

212
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,230
was...

213
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,080
was my home, I think.

214
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,280
(Ziqi...)

215
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,750
(Whatever happened there might be)

216
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,120
(related to his background!)

217
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,440
Where are you going, My Lady?

218
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,560
I need to see a friend. It's important!

219
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,580
My Lady,

220
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,670
what can be more important
than your wedding?

221
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,720
- Yes.
- Complete the ceremony first.

222
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,310
The guests are in the Xingshan Hall

223
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,720
waiting for you and the Marquis.

224
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,920
That's right.

225
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,200
Yes, our wedding comes first.

226
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:58,820
My Lady,

227
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,600
please put on these bracelets.

228
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,750
Oh no!

229
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,550
Miss Lin is getting changed inside.

230
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,270
She needs to wear the bride's bracelets.

231
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,110
My Lord.

232
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,780
My Lord.

233
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,510
Oh no! Oh no!

234
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,510
There you are.

235
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:30,870

236

Do I look pretty in this gown?

239
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,910
Uh, the bracelet...

240
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,840
You didn't change it?

241
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,510
I thought about it.

242
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,550
You gave it to me as a love token.

243
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,600
I want to wear it on our wedding day.

244
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,750
It's special.

245
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,150
Finish your wedding first.

246
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,080
Other things can wait.

247
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,880
Ziqi...

248
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,720
Ziqi!

249
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,320
- Stop, Miss Lin!
- Lu Jiu!

250
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,410
You said you'd marry our Marquis!

251
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,350
Let her go.

253
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,510

I'm not sure if you should read it.

380
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,280
I know

381
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,720
we shouldn't read others' letters,

382
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,200
but I couldn't help it.

383
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:14,900
(Father, I like Ziqi. I want to marry him.)

384
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,380
She said she'd marry the Marquis,
didn't she?

385
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,940
(Ziqi)

386
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,270
In this world,

387
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,590
there are many things

388
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,200
that we cannot control.

389
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,960
Do your best and leave the rest to fate.

390
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,510
Strive hard
when it's time to fight for something.

391
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,200
As for the outcome,

392
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,680
we can only make a wish to the wind.

393
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,000
Make a wish?

394
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,590
If we make a wish to the wind,

395
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:57,680
the bamboo dragonfly
might fly back to us.

396
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,070
We can't control everything,

397
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,030
but let's remain hopeful.

398
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,520
Maybe

399
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,790

why didn't you open the door?

474
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,590
again.

475
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,110
Your Highness,

476
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,750
it's fine. It's not real.

477
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,480
He can no longer kill others.

478
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,760
Your Highness,

479
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,040
bad news!

480
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:09,390
The Princess...

481
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,000
What about her?

482
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,270
Is Min alright?

483
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,880
She seems to be

484
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,680
haunted again.

485
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,200
She's wearing a wedding gown

486
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,830
to get married in the Xingshan Hall.

487
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,760
And she said...

488
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,280
What?

489
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,440
She should've been there 15 years ago!

490
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,000
It's him!

491
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,740
He's back to kill me!

492
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,160
He'll kill me!

493
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,680
Where's Cultivator Mu?

494
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,550
She and the others

495
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:41,030
seem to have left the capital.

496
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,000
I've never seen a Tier 9 demon.

497
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,070
To think Crescent's been shaking lately.

498
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,110
That is indeed a bad sign.

499
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,310
Cultivator Mu asked us to lie in wait.

500
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,430
Can she handle

501
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,270
the Resentful Woman
who is the Queen of Demons?

502
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,590
Shut up, all of you.

503
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,750
She said

504
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:28,480
that great demon would
connect the demon core

505
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,510
with the core of the formation
to complete it.

506
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,510
When the formation is activated,

507
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:36,440
the demon core will reveal on the top,

508
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,770
making the demon the weakest.

509
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,480
If we act then,

510
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,070
we're likely to break her.

511
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,510
But we only have a small window.

512
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:48,350
If we miss it, things will be nasty.

513
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,550
That's why

514
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,920
we're guarding in a distance.

515
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,350
We cannot alert that demon.

516
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,400
So do not make a sound.

517
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:06,960
Cultivator Mu,

518
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:07,920
it's time.

519
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,230
Be extra careful.

520
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:14,880
I can do it.

521
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,280
(Father,)

522
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,720

to take on the Mus' duties)

523
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,030
(as Demon Catchers)

524
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,000
(and complete your unfulfilled mission.)

525
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,310
(I'll kill that demon in the formation.)

526
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,590
(My life will end today,)

527
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,720
(but I wish everyone else,)

528
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,350
(including those I love,)

529
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,720
(peace and happiness.)

530
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:57,910
Yao.

531
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:00,910
Fuyi?

532

Whatever lies ahead,

533
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,720
you won't take the risk alone.

You're all here.

538
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:19,870
Yes, we are.

539
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,400
Aren't we of one heart

540
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,400
as a team,

541
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,510
and we'll never separate?

542
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,480
I haven't become the "Bamboo"

543
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,880
of the Four Bamboo Masters, right?

544
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,280
Are you surprised?

545
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:32,990
We're siblings.

546
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,670
We know

547
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,150
each other's unspoken words.

548
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,670
When we played hide-and-seek,

549
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:39,510
you never won.

550
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,990
You think you can make me leave
with a few words now?

551
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,470
No way.

552
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,400
Not just you.

553
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,000
He almost fooled me, too.

554
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,440
I also thought he left.

555
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,670
What about you?

556
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,430
Yao,

557
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,230
I don't deserve my reputation.
