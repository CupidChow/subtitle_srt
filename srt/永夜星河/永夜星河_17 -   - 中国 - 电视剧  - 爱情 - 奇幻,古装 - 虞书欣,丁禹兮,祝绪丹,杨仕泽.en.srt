=Love Game in Eastern Fantasy=

2
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,180
=Episode 17=

3
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,030
- Young Master Liu.
- There are still a lot here.

4
00:00:58,670 --> 00:00:59,510
Your Highness.

5
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,600
Since you are unwilling to
get on the carriage,

6
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,170
I get off and walk with you.

7
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,720
(Why does she always follow us?)

8
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,690
Miss Mu, do you mind it?

9
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,500
- Sister Mu.
- No problem.

10
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:11,910
Young Master Liu, look,

11
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,300
Miss Mu has already said so.

12
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,220
You are guests at the Imperial Capital,

13
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:17,480
as the host,

14
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,050
can't I accompany you on a stroll?

15
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:21,510
Let's go.

16
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,500
Young Master Liu,

17
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,000
what are your usual interests?

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,170
What do you like to eat?

19
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,810
- She has so many questions.
- What do you like to do?

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,300
Can you tell me about it?

21
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,200
I…

22
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,190
Brother Liu doesn't have any interests.

23
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,810
He just likes to daydream alone.

24
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,440
Young Master Liu…

25
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,080
(When Sister Mu was subduing demons,)

26
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,600
(she could fight ten at a time.)

27
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,410
(Why is she so down today?)

28
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,100
(Never mind.)

29
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,640
(Today I will be)

30
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,480
(their love guard.)

31
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,480
If you like, I will dig it out tomorrow

32
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,100
and invite you to taste it,
how about that?

33
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,610
- I…
- Brother Liu doesn't drink alcohol.

34
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,780
He'll get drunk at one cup.

35
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,660
He can't drink.

36
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,300
Young Master Liu must like drinking tea.

37
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,580
You are so elegant,

38
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,940
you must enjoy drinking tea.

39
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,580
My Mother always said

40
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,990
that a woman knowing tea art
is truly graceful.

41
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,240
I never liked learning it.

42
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,640
If you like it,

43
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,380
I will definitely practice tea art well.

44
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,080
Do you need to learn?

45
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,800
I think your tea art is quite good.

46
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,900
Who are you?

47
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,340
You all take your time walking.

48
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,780
I won't be accompanying you.

49
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,690
- Sister Mu.
- Yao.

50
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:29,810
Young Master Liu.

51
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,550
- Your Highness,
- Yao.

52
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,810
I am a good friend of
Sister Mu and Brother Liu.

53
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,800
Since they have all left,

54
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,400
I will leave now.
Please walk at your own pace.

55
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,240
Stop right there!

56
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,380
I was speaking with Young Master Liu.

57
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,010
Why were you interrupting?

58
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,590
There should always be an order
to things, right?

59
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,840
Today, Sister Mu, Brother Liu and I

60
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,970
arranged first to go shopping here.

61
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,460
How dare you

62
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,110
offend Her Highness!

63
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,180
Do you know the rules?

64
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,560
Yes.

65
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,690
I realize my mistake.

66
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,220
- Please forgive me, Your Highness.
- You…

67
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,530
You have quite a sharp tongue.

68
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,410
You must be Lin Yu, the daughter of
the Taicang County Magistrate, right?

69
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:14,850
You know me?

70
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,040
Whoever it is besides Young Master Liu,

71
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,290
I must know.

72
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,290
You may rise.

73
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,970
Don't be afraid, I won't hurt you.

74
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,290
Miss Lin,

75
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,500
I don't blame you for today's events.

76
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,180
Then what do you want to say to me?

77
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,010
I want to say that,

78
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,110
in matters of mutual affection,

79
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,340
the order of arrival doesn't count.

80
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,320
And even if we consider
the order of arrival,

81
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,290
I met Young Master Liu first.

82
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,260
(Mount Zixia of Cainan)

83
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,550
Don't be afraid.

84
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,660
The demon has been captured
into the tower.

85
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,340
I'm fine.

86
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,310
Thank you for saving my life,
Young Master.

87
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,700
It was a mere trifle,
no need to mention it.

88
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,930
There are many demons roaming
on Mount Zixia.

89
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,170
You still have some distance
to go down the mountain.

90
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:31,900
Take this with you.

91
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,100
It will ensure your safety
along the way.

92
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,560
Please wait, Young Master.

93
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,410
Your Highness, don't.

94
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,150
You have a noble status,

95
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,290
how could you reveal yourself
before a commoner?

96
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,050
This is against the rules of propriety.

97
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,700
Later, I inquired along the way,

98
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,750
only to find out that
the Young Master's surname is Liu.

99
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,530
I always wanted to find him.

100
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,190
Blame me

101
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,530
for not stepping out of the palanquin
that day.

102
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,050
But now we have met again,

103
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,700
it is another chance
that fate has given me.

104
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,800
So I will never

105
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,560
let my pride and demeanor

106
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,220
keep me from the one I love.

107
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,160
But,

108
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,970
this…

109
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,410
Brother Liu's heart is

110
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,290
already filled with Sister Mu.

111
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,730
Before Young Master Liu makes a choice,

112
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,900
I want to let him know openly

113
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,370
that I like him.

114
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,170
I want him to know

115
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,440
that I am also an excellent woman

116
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,900
and worthy of his affection.

117
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,620
(Classic Artworks)

118
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,860
(Marquis Mansion of Imperial Capital)

119
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,070
My Lord,

120
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,000
please stop sighing.

121
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,660
You have sighed
for the eighth time today.

122
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,660
Going out from the main gate,
there are many women.

123
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,170
Though there are many,

124
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,170
none is whom I'm missing.

125
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,920
Jiu,

126
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,370
do you know what it means?

127
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,430
East.

128
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,370
What do you mean by "East"?

129
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,680
My Lord,

130
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,780
it is "Going out from the east gate,
there are many women".

131
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,930
Why are you a damper now?

132
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,610
Don't you see I'm missing my beloved?

133
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,610
All my beautiful mood

134
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,490
was ruined by you.

135
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,290
So I will still persist.

136
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,560
Close the window.

137
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,170
Wh…what's wrong, My Lord?

138
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,100
Bad luck.

139
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,900
Why isn't the Princess staying
in the palace

140
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,020
but wandering around aimlessly?

141
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,070
What are you waiting for?
Close the window!

142
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,220
Don't let her see me!

143
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,820
Bad luck.

144
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:41,990
My Lord,

145
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,820
Miss Lin is downstairs.

146
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,960
Look.

147
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,930
Miss Lin?

148
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,460
Is this shrew bullying her?

149
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,490
Take it slow.

150
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,280
Take it slow.

151
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,730
Even if you hate me,

152
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,610
even if the whole world laughs at me,

153
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,820
I don't care.

154
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,480
Li Songmin!

155
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,050
What are you doing?

156
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,410
Don't bully Miss Lin.

157
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,880
Zhao Ruoshi?

158
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,140
Why are you everywhere?

159
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,410
Marquis, why are you here?

160
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,490
Li Songmin, you're getting bold.

161
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,220
You dare to sneak out of the palace
to stroll around.

162
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,430
I'll go back and tell your Mother.

163
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,730
Let's see if she scolds you.

164
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,170
Alright.

165
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,190
You're bold now.

166
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,140
You dare to report me now?

167
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,050
Stop looking.

168
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,370
Turn your head away.

169
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:32,820
Turn away.

170
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,460
Li Songmin,

171
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,390
I'm telling you,

172
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,260
if you behave,
just go back to the palace.

173
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,370
Be gentle!

174
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,400
You hurry back to the palace.

175
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,490
I won't tell your Mother.

176
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,480
I'll beat you to death.

177
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,260
You, let go of me, don't hit me.

178
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,460
You dare to threaten me?

179
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,170
You have quite the nerve, don't you?

180
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,640
Li Songmin, I don't mind you bullying me.

181
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,950
You are not allowed to bully Miss Lin.

182
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:18,920
What if I bully you?

183
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,360
She… she didn't bully me.

184
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,240
Miss Lin, you don't need to be afraid.
It's alright.

185
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,240
I… I'm not afraid.

186
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,850
Take care of yourself first.

187
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,820
She didn't bully you?

188
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,170
No.

189
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,230
Move aside.

190
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,870
Your Highness,

191
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,830
it's getting late.

192
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,370
The Dowager Consort should have
woken up from her nap.

193
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,180
Perhaps she's going to visit you.

194
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,640
Return to the palace.

195
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,220
Miss Lin, are you alright?

196
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,510
Are you alright?

197
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,460
I'm fine.

198
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,610
You know why I said

199
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,220
I didn't want to marry Her Highness?

200
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,890
She is just a shrew.

201
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,800
But I think
Princess Duanyang is quite nice.

202
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,010
Don't speak of her like that.

203
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,180
Even if you don't like her,

204
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,560
I believe in the future,

205
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,820
she will find someone who likes her.

206
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,490
As long as it's not Brother Liu,
that's fine.

207
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:30,230
Marquis, you are safe now.

208
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,890
I will go find my friends.

209
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,890
Oh my,

210
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,390
how can she see the good in

211
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,940
someone like Her Highness?

212
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,820
She is so kind.

213
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,290
No.

214
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,160
I will never fall in love with anyone
in this lifetime.

215
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,250
If you had not
fallen in love with father,

216
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,010
you wouldn't have ended up
in this situation.

217
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,130
You wouldn't cry
from night till dawn every day.

218
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,420
What good is there in loving someone?

219
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:40,950
I don't want it.

220
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,220
I don't want to be like you.

221
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,310
What exactly is going on?

222
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,180
Is a confession really that difficult?

223
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,310
There's clearly only a thin layer
of window paper left for their love.

224
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,020
Great!

225
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,610
(I understand.)

226
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,680
(The romantic scene where they fell in love
in the original work)

227
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,830
(was messed up by me.)

228
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,240
(So I must create)

229
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,610
(another new romantic scene for them.)

230
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,970
Respected Cuicui, please sit down.

231
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,870
Cuicui, you are knowledgeable
and experienced.

232
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,320
Do you know any place
in the Imperial Capital

233
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,300
that is romantic
and has a good atmosphere?

234
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,030
It's the kind of place
where once you enter,

235
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,080
you feel as if you're truly there,

236
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,440
your heart flutters

237
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,420
and you can't help
but confess to your crush.

238
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,110
What are you going to do?

239
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,470
The Astronomical Bureau
just released an oracle

240
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,380
stating that from tonight until tomorrow,

241
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,790
it's not advisable to travel
or move around.

242
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,650
Why?

243
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,320
They say
before Phospherus appears tomorrow,

244
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,800
there will be fire rain in the sky.

245
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,110
It is an ominous sign.

246
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,250
Fire rain in the sky?

247
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,390
It means many stars in the sky

248
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,960
will turn into fire rain and fall.

249
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,220
It's very frightening.

250
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,180
Isn't that a meteor…

251
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,770
a meteor shower?

252
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,220
Cuicui, you are so clever!

253
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,220
Cut off delusions,
abandon foolish thoughts.

254
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,390
Abandon distractions,
forget both self and objects.

255
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,690
- Mind and spirit…
- Ziqi!

256
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:56,990
I have thought of a solution.

257
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,650
I come to you for help.

258
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,820
Forget both self and objects,
mind and spirit unify.

259
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,200
Ziqi, open the door.

260
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,770
Don't bother me, I'm sleeping.

261
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,490
Why is he so fierce?

262
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,610
He's been very irritable these days.

263
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,700
Maybe we shouldn't provoke him for now.

264
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,580
Why is he so irritable?

265
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:26,850
I don't know.

266
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,130
Forget both self and objects,
mind and spirit unify.

267
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,830
I'll count down three, two, one.

268
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,080
You pretend to cry with me.

269
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,940
Find a way to lure him out.

270
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,760
Come over here.

271
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,060
Three, two, one.

272
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,970
Cuicui, what to do?

273
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,550
It's too late, Cuicui.

274
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,790
It's too late, what to do?

275
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,390
He's not helping.

276
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,770
I have no way either.

277
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,750
Ziqi doesn't help us.

278
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,970
We two can't do anything.

279
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,890
It's too late.

280
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,920
Miaomiao!

281
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,800
Wait for me.

282
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:51,850
Here.

283
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,940
This is the place.

284
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,340
It's quiet and has a great view.

285
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:59,100
It's the best spot to
watch the meteor shower.

286
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,490
Meteor shower?

287
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,130
You'll know in a moment.

288
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,610
Meteor showers represent
dreams and hope.

289
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,200
Legend has it that if you make a wish
upon a meteor shower,

290
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,100
your wish is more likely to come true.

291
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,340
However,

292
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,610
I still feel there's a bit of
atmosphere missing.

293
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,920
Cuicui,

294
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,940
can you conjure up some flowers?

295
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,470
Flowers?

296
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,630
The kind that is colorful

297
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,720
and vibrant

298
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,790
and covers the entire landscape here.

299
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:38,850
The more, the better.

300
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,460
I am bamboo.

301
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:45,100
We bamboos will die once we bloom.

302
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,010
That's not feasible.

303
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,750
Don't you have any other

304
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,160
plant friends who can help?

305
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,650
You can't confess without flowers.

306
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,540
It's hard to see clearly at night.

307
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,490
Make do with it.

308
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,340
Alright, I won't insist.

309
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:06,080
But there's one more thing.

310
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,580
That is absolutely necessary.

311
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,010
What is it?

312
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,230
Swing chair.

313
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,490
What is it?

314
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,300
It's a kind of

315
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,850
chair.

316
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,980
It looks like this on top.

317
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,120
Then the chair will swing.

318
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,530
I got it.

319
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,370
What is this?

320
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,570
Not like this.

321
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,920
It's roughly like this,

322
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,080
and there's a stand.

323
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,100
There are vines and leaves.

324
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,820
I know.

325
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:44,720
Isn't it great?

326
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,400
This looks a bit like it.

327
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,200
- Doesn't it?
- But it needs to seat two people.

328
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,060
I don't know how to describe it.

329
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,580
It's just like this.

330
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,590
Ziqi.

331
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:21,890
How do you know?

332
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,820
I don't know either.

333
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,130
When I was little,

334
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,690
I used to play on a swing chair.

335
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,510
Back then, there were many couples

336
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,740
who would confess their love on it.

337
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,840
But I was too young,

338
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,210
so I always sat on it alone.

339
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,650
I didn't expect
to play on a swing chair here.

340
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,710
I can't bear it anymore.

341
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:05,200
I grow too much bamboos.

342
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,700
I'm sleepy.

343
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,270
How is it?

344
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,060
Isn't it particularly atmospheric?

345
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,520
Miaomiao.

346
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,030
They're coming.

347
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,650
Sister Mu and Brother Liu are coming.

348
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,930
Quick, hide yourselves.

349
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,310
Go.

350
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:11,550
No.

351
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,610
Quick, here.

352
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,300
Squat down.

353
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,580
She sat down.

354
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,650
She sat down.

355
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,200
Yao.

356
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,780
Why are you here too?

357
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,240
Where is Miaomiao?

358
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,580
I don't know.

359
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,890
Sheng had a cold face

360
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,340
and gave me this note,

361
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,820
asking me to meet here before dawn.

362
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,340
Yao,

363
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,630
I think

364
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,100
Sheng wants to challenge me to a duel.

365
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,610
You'd better avoid it.

366
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,150
Miaomiao also wrote me a note,

367
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,550
saying there's something important

368
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,020
to discuss here before dawn.

369
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,300
It seems I was overthinking.

370
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,820
Could it be that we arrived too early?

371
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,130
Let's wait for them.

372
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,580
They are sitting together now.

373
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,780
They're just sitting together.

374
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,260
Is it necessary to be so happy?

375
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,160
Now everything is ready.

376
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,780
We just need to wait for
the meteor shower now.

377
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,200
When the meteor shower comes,

378
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,200
with the romantic atmosphere,

379
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,780
they can express their feelings
to each other more quickly.

380
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,170
Do you really want them
to be together that much?

381
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,840
Of course!

382
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,790
I can tell

383
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,930
that they genuinely like each other.

384
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,590
But,

385
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,540
does liking someone

386
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,340
necessarily mean you have to express it

387
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,410
and be together?

388
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:14,870
Yes.

389
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,020
In this world,

390
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,580
how many people

391
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,980
who have given their heart
to another person

392
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,410
have a good ending?

393
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,130
Why are you like this?

394
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:32,610
You talk about the ending
before it even starts.

395
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:35,930
If there is no good ending,

396
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,930
it just adds another sadness

397
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,580
and another misfortune.

398
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,340
Why start then?

399
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,100
Although the ending is important,

400
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,260
it's not the most important thing.

401
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,170
There are so many people in this world.

402
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,020
How difficult it is to bring two people

403
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,880
who like each other together?

404
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,480
It's like someone

405
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,340
has already led you
to the gates of paradise,

406
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,820
and you just need to open the door
to find happiness,

407
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,270
but if you shrink back out of fear,

408
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,650
what a pity that would be!

409
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,410
However, I believe that

410
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,900
Sister Mu and Brother Liu

411
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,300
are not such timid people.

412
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,040
It's coming.

413
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,060

Someone is singing.

457
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,740
- It's her.
- Sister!

458
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,780
- Singing?
- Sister Mu, are you alright?

459
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,360
Didn't you hear it?

460
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,200
Sister.

461
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,100
It's nothing now.

462
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,260
It seems I was too nervous.

463
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:17,980
(Xunxia Qiyue Pavilion)

464
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:25,630
My Lord,

465
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,440
everything is ready.

466
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,890
The best musicians in the capital,

467
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,200
ten thousand butterflies,
ten thousand flowers,

468
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,740
and countless treasures are all in place.

469
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,130
Got it.

470
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,370
Tomorrow, I will arrange it personally.

471
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:44,550
Jiu.

472
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,450
Do you think she will…

473
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,200
My Lord, don't worry.

474
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,410
No woman can resist such a grand setup.

475
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:54,740
I believe she will not refuse you.

476
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,930
I am thinking

477
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:00,300
will she be so overwhelmed

478
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,680
that she wants to marry me on the spot?

479
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,590
This won't do.

480
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,940
The wedding garments
hasn't been made yet.

481
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,980
What can I do now?

482
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,200
By the way,

483
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,540
I recently found something.

484
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,110
I want to give it to her

485
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:18,980
when I confess.

486
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,610
It couldn't be more appropriate.

487
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,410
This is…

488
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,540
the late Marquis's relic.

489
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:29,930
Yes.

490
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,840
I remembered it a few days ago

491
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,930
when I heard Peiyun mention it.

492
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,500
Otherwise, I almost forgot about it.

493
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,740
My father played with it every day
when he was alive

494
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:43,580
and held it tightly in his final moments.

495
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,500
It must be his cherished possession.

496
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:50,260
I even asked about
the origin of this bracelet.

497
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:58,980
Father,

498
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,850
whose wooden bracelet is this?

499
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,550
I don't know.

500
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,700
(Childhood Zhao Ruoshi)
Where did it come from?

501
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:15,900
(Zhao Qinghuan, Late Qingyi Marquis)

502
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,370
I don't know either.

503
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,500
One day

504
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,610
it felt like I had a long dream.

505
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,690
When I woke up, it was there.

506
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,340
What did you dream about?

507
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,740
I forgot.

508
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,370
I only vaguely remember

509
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,300
this bracelet

510
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,980
should belong to the one I love.

511
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,200
But in this life,

512
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,450
I have never loved a woman.

513
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,170
Why?

514
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:07,170
The heart is as empty as the yard

515
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,820
by moonlight.

516
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:23,410
My father never met the one he loved,

517
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,820
so he didn't give this bracelet to anyone.

518
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,500
Today let me

519
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,370
give this bracelet

520
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,780
to Miss Lin.

521
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:22,870
Master,

522
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,650
you called me?

523
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,650
It's an urgent matter.

524
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,170
Why do you keep delaying?

525
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,680
I…

526
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,470
If you can't find a way

527
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,550
to make Princess Duanyang wear

528
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,610
the wooden bracelet
of the Qingyi Marquis Mansion soon,

529
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,980
our plans will come to nothing.

530
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,150
Master,

531
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,270
what exactly is that wooden bracelet?

532
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,110
It…

533
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,540
Could it hurt the Princess?

534
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,520
Well,

535
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:00,710
there's no harm in telling you.

536
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:04,580
The wooden bracelet was transformed
from the hair of Goddess Mei.

537
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:07,690
No one can resist the allure
of the Goddess Mei.

538
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,680
Anyone who wears this wooden bracelet

539
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,920
will inevitably

540
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,780
fall in love with the person
who gave her this.

541
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,370
This allure is invisible and intangible,

542
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:17,980
penetrating the heart and soul.

543
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,400
No spell or talisman

544
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,500
can detect or break it.

545
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,170
I see.

546
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,480
Why?

547
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,690
Have you developed compassion
for Princess Duanyang?

548
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:34,930
Don't you want revenge anymore?

549
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,850
Don't forget, she grew up perfectly fine,

550
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,690
while your only sister

551
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,160
became her scapegoat

552
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,780
more than a decade ago.

553
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,780
I must avenge Peiyu.

554
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,060
But now, in my heart,

555
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,610
the only person who
deserves to die is Zhao Qinru.

556
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,740
So what will you do?

557
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:02,260
Our plan

558
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,610
only needs a wedding,

559
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,690
no matter who the bride is,

560
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,580
am I right?

561
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,380
(Tuanyuan Inn)

562
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,240
Guest,

563
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,720
take it slow.

564
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:28,960
Yao,

565
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,980
the sunshine outside is lovely.

566
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,650
Do you want to go out for a walk?

567
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,500
No, Fuyi.

568
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,890
I'm feeling a bit tired.

569
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,820
Did you not sleep well?

570
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,210
Shall I make some jujube soup for you?

571
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,540
No need.

572
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:42,770
Thank you.

573
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:47,300
You rest early.

574
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,600
I won't disturb you.

575
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,690
If you need me,

576
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,930
just let me know.

577
00:33:58,990 --> 00:33:59,830
Cultivator Mu,

578
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,370
the matter you asked me to investigate

579
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,020
has some leads now.

580
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,120
Cultivator Mu,

581
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,600
here.

582
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,650
Cultivator Mu,

583
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,210
the task you gave me is done.

584
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,670
The great fire at Xingshan Hall
ten years ago

585
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:29,100
was announced as an accidental fire.

586
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,760
However, after my painstaking efforts

587
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,330
and tireless work day and night,

588
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:35,610
I have found out.

589
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,670
Just as you suspected,

590
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:38,900
the great fire is

591
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:43,810
closely related to the Dowager Consort.

592
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,460
The Princess's possession was feigned.

593
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,760
But Empress Dowager Zhao

594
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,980
insisted it was caused by a demon.

595
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:52,060
There must be a hidden truth behind this.

596
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,020
Since you have discovered some clues,

597
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:57,770
why are you hiding it from Fuyi
and telling me privately?

598
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,030
Because this matter concerns
your ancestor,

599
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:05,400
I think it's better to

600
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,250
talk to you alone first.

601
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,540
My ancestor?

602
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,130
Your father, Mu Huaijiang.

603
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:21,940
Does liking someone

604
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,250
necessarily mean you have to express it

605
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:25,940
and be together?

606
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,310
Yes.

607
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:32,760
How difficult it is to bring two people

608
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:34,660
who like each other together?

609
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:35,900
It's like someone

610
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,370
has already led you
to the gates of paradise,

611
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,650
and you just need to open the door
to find happiness,

612
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:44,110
but if you shrink back out of fear,

613
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,420
what a pity that would be!

614
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:11,220
(Bustling and Crowded)

615
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,060
Local specialties?

616
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,140
Yes.

617
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:19,480
I want to buy some local specialties
for my grandfather

618
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,940
to show my respect to him.

619
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,440
But

620
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,440
you haven't found your grandfather

621
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,060
and have no clues either.

622
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,390
So,

623
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,730
I need to buy it now.

624
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,100
When I meet him,

625
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,420
where would I buy it?

626
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,170
That's right.

627
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,120
Alright.

628
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,130
Let's go.

629
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,500
Go.

630
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,840
You have bought so many.

631
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,030
Aren't they enough?

632
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,070
It's far from enough.

633
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:47,210
We need to go shopping
for at least another hour.

634
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,070
Another hour?

635
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,360
I miss my grandfather so much.

636
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,880
I should buy more to show my respect.

637
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,250
Let's look at this store as well.

638
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,460
Green Bamboo Leaf?

639
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,060
Are you sure?

640
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,360
Who said bamboos

641
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,250
can't like Green Bamboo Leaf?

642
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,980
Let's go.

643
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,130
Miss Lin isn't here, right?

644
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:16,280
No, I've confirmed it.

645
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,730
Miss Lin left an hour ago.

646
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,980
(Tuanyuan Inn)

647
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:26,420
It seems even the heavens are helping me.

648
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,730
Miss Lin and I

649
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,980
are truly destined to meet.

650
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,590
Come on, move everything inside
and set it up.

651
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,430
Hurry up.

652
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,730
Take it slow.

653
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,580
(Tuanyuan Inn)

654
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,430
Slow down.

655
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:56,300
(Tuanyuan Inn)

656
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,390
Jiu.

657
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,730
Today, don't let anyone in.

658
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,500
I want Miss Lin

659
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,420
to have an unforgettable

660
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,500
and overjoyed day.

661
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:15,960
It must be unforgettable,

662
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,330
