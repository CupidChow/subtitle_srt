00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,990
Please

4
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,620
give me a hand!

5
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,400
Senior,

6
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,120
is the Hundred Demons
Mountain and Sea Map repaired?

7
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,060
Great, let me take a look.

8
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,190
Don't rush.

9
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,380
Tomorrow is Chinese New Year's Eve.

10
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,850
You can look at it after the New Year.

11
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,200
Why?

12
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,430
Girl,

13
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,080
don't look.

14
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,660
The Resentful Woman is at…

15
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,630
The grass is lush and green

16
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,810
and flowers are in full bloom here.

17
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,750
There's not a hint of the New Year

18
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,180
or New Year's Eve.

19
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,810
What would make it
like New Year's Eve?

20
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,060
I remember

21
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,530
at least,

22
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,530
there should be snow.

23
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,970
Snow?

24
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,530
You haven't seen snow?

25
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,290
What is that?

26
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,780
It's a kind of…

27
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,380
a kind of

28
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,180
white,

29
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,340
and icy

30
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,620
thing that melts as soon as
it touches your hand.

31
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,410
If it snows,

32
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,310
we can build snowmen
and have snowball fights.

33
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,060
It's so lively and fun.

34
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,060
Do you want to see the snow?

00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:19,670

Come.

113
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,240
- Finally, let's start.
- It smells quite good.

114
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,020

Sister, you're so happy today.

It's the New Year,

130
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,370
of course, we should be happy.

131
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,350
That's right.

132
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,130
Sister, don't worry.

Worry what?

134
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,420
In the future, every year,

135
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,180
we will celebrate the New Year together.

136
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,120
We'll cut paper decorations,

137
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,220
make dumplings,

138
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,500
and build snowmen together.

139
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,380
Sister,

140
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,610
it will be over soon.

141
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,560
Yes,

142
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,130
it will be over soon.

143
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,960
I

144
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,940
am very reassured about each of you.

145
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,910
Sister Mu, Ziqi,

146
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,790

147
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,100
- Yes.
- Come on, come here!

148
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,550
So beautiful!

149
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,770
Set off some more!

150
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,160
So beautiful!

151
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,440

Beautiful!

155
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,700
Have they gone to sleep?

156
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,300
I am ready.

157
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,370
Does it have to be today?

158
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,130
There is still time
until the catastrophe of heaven.

159
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,820
Since the answer was already known,

160
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,650
why keep delaying it?

161
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,960
Girl,

162
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,220
you die for the world,

163
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,700

164
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,130
Even so,

165
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,730
do you not regret it?

166
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,420
My sibling,

167
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,630

168
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,680

169
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,730
are by my side.

170
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,340
Along this journey,

171
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,180
they love me, trust me,

172
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,180
protect me and help me,

173
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,130
willing to go through any difficulties

174
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,610
at the risk of their lives for me.

175
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,300
In my life,

176
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,010
there are no regrets.

177
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,560
Tonight,

178
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,540
I have bid farewell to them one by one.

179
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,250
I have no more attachments.

180
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,590
So,

181
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,850
Senior, please activate the Formation.

182
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,940
Use my body

183
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,970
to slay the Queen of Demons Resentful Woman.

184
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,180
This…

185
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,460
Isn't this the Heaven Sealing Formation?

186
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,720
The catastrophe of heaven hasn't arrived yet,

187
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,700
why is it being activated now?

188
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,030
Grandfather!

189
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,870
Be careful!

190
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,970
What's going on?

191
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,590
Demon Trap Tower.

192
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,220
Why has it become so big?

193
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,280
Where is Sister Mu?

194
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,630
What did you do?

195
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,350
Where is my sister?

196
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,350
Inside the tower.

197
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,440
Master,

198
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,130
what on earth is happening?

199
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,610
The Mountain and Sea Map has been repaired.

200
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,700
The enemy that I traveled

201
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,250
everywhere to find

202
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,700
was within me.

203
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,850
You knew this all along, didn't you?

204
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,580
That's right.

205
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,460
That's why you asked Fuyi

206
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,890
to approach me and watch me.

207
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,970
I spent several years

208
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,460
finding the answer.

209
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,890
So I have always been reluctant
to tell you.

210
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,970
You have been in Liaoran Valley for many years.

211
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,850
- It was to…
- It was to find

212
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,300
a way to resolve
the Resentful Woman within you.

213
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,080
Have you found it?

214
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,110
Uncle Lu,

215
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,850
Sheng, Fuyi, and Miaomiao

216
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,700
are all unaware of this.

217
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,370
Could you give me one more day?

218
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:44,610
I want to celebrate with them

219
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,130
the last New Year's Eve.

220
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,250
The Resentful Woman
is almost fully recovered,

221
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,970
if we let it continue,

222
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,890
Yao's physical body

223
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,770
will be taken over by the Resentful Woman.

224
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,340
How could this happen?

225
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,300
Why is the Resentful Woman inside Yao?

226
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,440
Master,

227
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,200
it must be a mistake.

228
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,130
This is impossible.

229
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,470
(Why?)

230
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,580
(This ending seems familiar to me.)

231
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,200
Sheng,

232
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,520
you have been with Yao since childhood.

233
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,820
If this is true,

234
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,250
how could you not know?

235
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,630
Sheng!

236
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,130
What he said is true.

237
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,850
This is because of me.

238
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,700
I saw it with my own eyes.

239
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,040
Yao.

240
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,230
Sheng,

241
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,100
remember my name.

242
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:25,630
I

243
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,410
am the Resentful Woman.

244
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,170
Remember my name.

245
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,340
I

246
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,130
am the Resentful Woman.

247
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,050
I have kept it from my sister
for so many years.

248
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,210
I kept it from everyone.

249
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,100
So I don't want her to repair the map.

250
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,900
I don't want her to look for
the Resentful Woman.

251
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,610
But I can't tell her the truth.

252
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,410
I already found a way.

253
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,780
Why did you lie to me?

254
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,550
You promised me

255
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,300
to help me restore my sister.

256
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,300
It only requires sacrificing me alone.

257
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,760
Ziqi.

258
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,190
I said,

259
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,890
your method is too much of an adventure.

260
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,610
If it fails,

261
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,450
it will bring about
the catastrophe of heaven.

262
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,540
The bigger picture is important.

263
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,650
No one can bear such a cost.

264
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,580
But you haven't even tried.

265
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,500
I have deduced all possible outcomes.

266
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,610
Only sacrificing her

267
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,610
is a foolproof solution.

268
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,690
Huaijiang and I

269
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,170
have each experimented

270
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,690
thousands of times on the blueprint.

271
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,690
The only conclusion is that

272
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,900
the Resentful Woman
is the Demon Queen of the world.

273
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:15,580
Only by using all the
demon creatures as fuel,

274
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,930
can her soul be obliterated.

275
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,100
All demonic creatures?

276
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,410
Include my grandfather and I?

277
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,850
My friend Wenxin,

278
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,340
back then, you asked me for help,

279
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,300
using my roots to connect all the plants

280
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,020
to create a

281
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,850
great formation that
could cover the entire world.

282
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,650
Do you know

283
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,200
how much time I spent,

284
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,780
how much energy I used,

285
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:49,300
to finally help you complete
this great formation?

286
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,300
I thought it was to deal with
the catastrophe of heaven,

287
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,550
but it turns out you did it for…

288
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,390
Yes.

289
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,450
I did this to slay the Resentful Woman.

290
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,100
Once the Resentful Woman is slain,

291
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,300
the catastrophe of heaven will not come.

292
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,500
Brother Bamboo,

293
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,820
you will join all the demons in the world

294
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,650
and die for the world.

295
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,390
Senior,

296
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,580
we all trusted you so much.

297
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,690
- Why did you…
- Why did you deceive us?

298
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,240
I did not deceive you.

299
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,450
To each and every one of you,

300
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,410
I have not spoken a single lie.

301
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:31,780
Some decisions

302
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,750
are best made by an old villain

303
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,300
like me.

304
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,820
You all must

305
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,370
live well in the days to come.

306
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,020
If this Formation succeeds,

307
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,020
what will happen to Sister Mu Yao?

308
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,760
Demon Trap Tower,

309
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,720
catch!

310
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,880
Master, you…

311
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:03,750
Yes.

312
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,820
You find it.

313
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,450
I have connected my inner core
to the great formation.

314
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,800
It can ensure the formation's success.

315
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:13,820
By then, I will accompany Yao

316
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,650
and all demons in the world to die.

317
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,690
Darn it.

318
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,070
I'll kill you first!

319
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,350
Ziqi, don't be impulsive.

320
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,020
The urgent task is to save Sister Mu.

321
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,740
The great formation is complete.

322
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,850
It can no longer be stopped.

323
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,410
Whether you hate me or kill me,

324
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,650
no one can change

325
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,850
what I have decided.

326
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,800
Brother Liu,

327
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,980
is there any entrance to the tower?

328
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,760
Yes.

329
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,240
At the top of the tower.

330
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,020
What are you doing?

331
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,540
As long as there is a sliver of hope,

332
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,170
we will not give up.

333
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,520
Of the five of us,

334
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,060
not a single one can be missing.

335
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,410
The formation's core has formed.

336
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,370
Once you forcefully enter,

337
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,690
you will never come out!

338
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,190
Fuyi,

339
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,410
you know it.

340
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,150
I know,

341
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,020
but what of it?

342
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,580
Inside the tower is the one I love.

343
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,820
Even if it cannot be done,

344
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:41,670
in this life,

345
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,210
I don't want to regret anything anymore.

346
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,040
That's right.

347
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,410
If saving the world requires

348
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,100
sacrificing so many innocent lives,

349
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,690
this world

350
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,300
is not worth saving!

351
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,930
Sister Mu,

352
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,580
wait for us.

353
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,150
And me too.

354
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,610
Cuicui!

355
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,240
Children,

356
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,650
don't go!

357
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,850
Come back!

358
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,020
Come back!

359
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,170
This is the first layer of the tower.

360
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,200
In the Empyrean Demon Trap Tower,

361
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,580
each layer is a world.

362
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,250
It has nine worlds and three realms.

363
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,800
Every three worlds form one realm.

364
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,780
Namely, the Samadhi Realm,
Avici Realm, and Sea of Sin Realm.

365
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,150
The first layer of the tower

366
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,850
is the Miaoguo World of the Samadhi Realm.

367
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,880
(First Layer: Miaoguo World)
The weather here is pleasant all year round,

368
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,900
and the land is rich and fertile,

369
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,300
resembling a paradise on earth.

370
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,690
However, with each descending world,

371
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,170
the environment becomes
more barren and harsh,

372
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,890
causing greater harm to the demon creatures.

373
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,110
(Second Layer: Wangduan World)

374
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:12,500
In the Avici Realm, not a single grass
grows under the unpredictable climate.

375
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:15,580
(Third Layer: Wanyuan World)
Ordinary demon spirits can hardly survive.

376
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,940
(Fourth Layer: Kuangqu World)
While the Sea of Sin Realm at the bottom

377
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,260
is a triple purgatory.

378
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,700
(Fifth Layer: Wuxiang World)

379
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,820
(Sixth Layer: Huaqi World)
Where is my sister?

380
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:27,930
The deeper the sins,

381
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,610
the stronger the demonic power,

382
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,260
(Seventh Layer: Shi'e World)
the more likely to be trapped lower.

383
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,610
Yao is possessed by the Resentful Woman.

384
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,180
(Eighth Layer: Qiku World)

385
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,130
So she will only be in…

386
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,380
The bottom layer.

387
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,220
(Ninth Layer: Liuyin World)

388
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,370
The ninth layer at the bottom

389
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:42,780
is the Liuyin World.

390
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,340
That is the most terrifying place.

391
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,650
How can we reach the bottom of the tower?

392
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,210
This is my first time entering the tower.

393
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,980
I only know that between each world,

394
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,690
there is a karma gate blocking the way.

395
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,200
If we find the corresponding karma gate,

396
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,370
we can enter the next layer.

397
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,650
What are we waiting for then?

398
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,350
Let's find it.

399
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,540
Come, come over here.

400
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,100
Be careful.

401
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,540
Give me a hand.

402
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,320
I'll go first.

403
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:20,870
Brother Liu,

404
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,400
how big is each layer exactly?

405
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,830
If each layer is truly a world,

406
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,210
where do we find the gate?

407
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,110
Be careful,

408
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,450
something is approaching.

409
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,610
There are demon creatures.

410
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,060
And there are many.

411
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,260
Numerous demon creatures here

412
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,650
were brought inside the tower by me.

413
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,590
Everyone, be careful.

414
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,780
(Cat Demon)

415
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,930
Isn't this Young Master Fuyi?

416
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,430
You are…

417
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,060
You can't recognize me anymore?

418
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,640
I am Mimi.

419
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,410
Back then, I stole and ate
all the fish at a harbor.

420
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,960
You grabbed me by my scruff

421
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,260
and caught me in.

422
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,930
And me, and me too.

423
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,760
Mimi.

424
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,700
(Bird Demon)
Young Master Fuyi,

425
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,640
do you remember me?

426
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,300
Back then, I was too willful

427
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,720
and destroyed many crops in the village.

428
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,130
So you caught me.

429
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,400
(Turtle Demon)

430
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,540
And me, Old Turtle.

431
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,100
I was also captured by you, Young Master Fuyi.

432
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,560
It's you.

433
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:28,320
Where are the other demons?

434
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,780
Why don't they come out to meet us?

435
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,510
The three of us have never hurt people,

436
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,200
but those demons
who have committed serious offenses

437
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,170
are different.

438
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,790
They struggled hard from the bottom

439
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,030
to this top layer,

440
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,400
fearing they might encounter you

441
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,930
and be taken down again.

442
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,580
Young Master Fuyi,

443
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,540
we were fortunate to meet you back then.

444
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,690
If it had been another demon catcher,

445
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,160
they wouldn't have given us

446
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,070
the chance to reform ourselves.

447
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:52,920
Yes.

448
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,240
Young Master Fuyi, you said,

449
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,440
as long as we focus on

450
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,370
cultivation to cleanse our sins,

451
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,930
we can reach the top of the tower
and find the exit.

452
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,830
But we have already been here

453
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:02,830
for many years now,

454
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,650
and still haven't found the exit.

455
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:05,920
Young Master Fuyi,

456
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,340
is it because our sins

457
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:09,300
have not been fully atoned for yet?

458
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,550
- Yes, is that it?
- Yes.

459
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:14,020
Those who have cleansed their sins
can leave the tower.

460
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,580
This is what my Master told me back then.

461
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,240
- But…
- It was your Master who said it.

462
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,510
It must be a lie.

463
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:20,510
Once entering the Demon Trap Tower,

464
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,820
everyone becomes fuel
for the great formation.

465
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,650
How is that possible?

466
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,300
Cuicui.

467
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,930
- You…
- What?

468
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,780
You deceived us?

469
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,650
- Deceived us.
- Deceived us.

470
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,250
He really deceived us.

471
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,950
- Deceived us.
- Deceived us. It's too much.

472
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,800
It's outrageous.

473
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,400
We trusted you so much.

474
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,030
- Exactly.
- Yes.

475
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:41,130
Do you know
how long we've been here?

476
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,480
Stay calm.

477
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,240
Everyone, stay calm.

478
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,400
Let's first hear
what Young Master Fuyi says.

479
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,650
Don't be anxious.

480
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:50,690
Listen to me,

481
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:53,210
this tower is Brother Liu's magical weapon.

482
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,020
Once we rescue Sister Mu Yao,

483
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,440
he will definitely have a way

484
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,020
to lead everyone out of the tower.

485
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,300
Brother Liu, is that right?

486
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,720
Who knows if it's true or not?

487
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,560
Yes.

488
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,890
I'm not sure.

489
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,340
I don't dare to guarantee it.

490
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:09,690
- You…
- Young Master Fuyi,

491
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,480
we trusted you so much in vain.

492
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,440
- Yes.
- Exactly.

493
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,270
Because we trusted you,

494
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,680
we surrendered without a fight

495
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,030
and entered this Demon Trap Tower.

496
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,310
- Yes.
- Exactly.

497
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,680
If I had known earlier that
I trusted the wrong person.

498
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,750
It would have been better from the start
to have fought you to the death.

499
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,790
What kind of situation is this?!

500
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,290
- Get lost.
- Yes.

501
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,170
If you block the way again,

502
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,260
don't blame me for being rude.

503
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,110
This…

504
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,210
Fine, it's death anyway.

505
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,960
Wait.

506
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,060
Everyone, calm down,

507
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,160
Brother Liu is unwilling
to make a promise lightly

508
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,610
because he doesn't want to deceive you.

509
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,750
When we don't know

510
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,540
how to exit the tower clearly,

511
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,820
we can't just make blind promises to you.

512
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,130
I don't care about your promises.

513
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,480
What should we do now?

514
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,820
- Yes.
- You…

515
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,480
Everyone,

516
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,130
I once deeply believed in my Master's words.

517
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,410
I never intended to deceive you.

518
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:04,100
I know that the axis of this tower is
at the bottom layer.

519
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,450
If there is a method to break the tower,

520
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,720
it must be at the bottom.

521
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,740
If you are willing to trust me once more,

522
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,500
please step aside and let us pass.

523
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:15,240
I will do my utmost,
even at the cost of my life

524
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,410
to give you an explanation.

525
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,720
Yes.

526
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,790
At this point,

527
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,480
we must work together

528
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,200
to get the chance of successfully
leaving the tower.

529
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,820
Thank you, everyone.

530
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,480
May I ask if you know

531
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,210
how to reach the next karma gate?

532
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:52,020
The location of each karma gate is different,

533
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,070
but they are all situated
at the center of the Formation.

534
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,170
Follow the vein of the Formation,

535
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,690
you should be able to find it.

536
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:00,060
And once found, how do we open it?

537
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,300
This…

538
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,690
We do not know.

539
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,200
We only move upwards.

540
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,160
We don't move downwards.

541
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,540
Who would want to go down and suffer?

542
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,680
That's the logic.

543
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,520
Exactly.

544
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,650
Is there a door?

545
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,070
Be careful!

546
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:24,910
Walk slowly.

547
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,020
- Walk slowly.
- I found it.

548
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,300
It's over there.

549
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,840
Cuicui,

550
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,080
are you alright?

551
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,920
Is the door open?

552
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,370
Why did this door open so easily?

553
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,780
Although it was by chance,

554
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,410
it was due to determination.

555
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,650
What do you mean by that?

556
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,480
The further down we go,

557
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,580
the harsher the environment becomes.

558
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,830
No demonic creatures have ever
tried to cross the karma gate,

559
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:58,850
proceeding downward.

560
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,580
According to the Formation's indication,

561
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,980
the incantation to open the gate

562
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,890
is the determination to proceed downward.

563
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,580
I didn't think about anything.

564
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,450
I just thought about going down
to save Sister Mu.

565
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,820
Little Shoot, well done.

566
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:20,630
Come.

567
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:28,630
Cuicui,

568
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,170
you stay here.

569
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,060
Why?

570
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,240
The further going down,

571
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,650
the more harm to demons,

572
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,540
your demonic power won't hold up.

573
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,480
Who says I can't hold up?

574
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,320
I…

575
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,040
Cuicui,

576
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,260
I have something to entrust to you.

577
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,740
What is it?

578
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,890
Just now, I promised them

579
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,820
to do my utmost to
lead them out of the tower.

580
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:57,410
When we reach the bottom
and open the tower gate,

581
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,980
I hope you can

582
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,820
guide them out of the tower here.

583
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,370
Alright, leave it to me.

584
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:04,870
Little Shoot,

585
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,650
this task is very challenging.

586
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,260
Can you hold your position well?

587
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,650
No problem.

588
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,410
Cuicui.

589
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,780
Take care of yourself.

590
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,310
Let's go.

591
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,740
Let's go, Miaomiao.

592
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,420
This is the second layer.

593
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,580
As expected, it is much more desolate.

594
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:16,500
The demon creatures on the first layer

595
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,250
were all reformed good demons,

596
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,810
but the demons here still
harbor evil thoughts

597
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,510
and are very alert.

598
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,450
They are unwilling to show up.

599
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,800
The karma gate on this layer
is in the southwest.

600
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:30,430
Go.

601
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,800
Demon creatures at the Samadhi Realm

602
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,540
are not inclined to hurt people actively.

603
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,780
But when we reach the next layer,

604
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,860
the demon creatures will become
more dangerous and troublesome.

605
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,580
We should be careful.

606
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,380
Shouldn't they be the ones to be careful?

607
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,860
Ziqi, let's go.

608
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,330
It's the third layer now.

609
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,500
Going further down leads to the Avici Realm.

610
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,230
My friend Wenxin,

611
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:16,690
it's nothing to deceive me, an old bamboo,

612
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,420
after all, I am a demon.

613
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,020
But those children

614
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,420
are good kids.

615
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,060
I thought you were different from those

616
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,580
heartless Demon Catchers.

617
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,580
Why have you become like this now?

618
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,290
No,

619
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,770
I didn't change.

620
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,480
When I saved you

621
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,690
from the Demon Catcher,

622
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,290
what I valued was

623
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,250
your tier-8 demonic power

624
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,610
to help me complete this Grand Formation.

625
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:52,170
In this world,

626
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,860
if I have to do something,

627
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:58,690
all compassion is superfluous.

628
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,860
Children,

629
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,980
it's the fourth layer now.

630
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,060
Stop the formation!

631
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:12,060
Once the great formation is activated,

632
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:14,020
it cannot be stopped,

633
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,690
even if I die, it remains so.

634
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,460
I have considered all contingencies.

635
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,900
I will not leave myself any room for regret.

Stop going down!

680
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,060
If you don't go down to the ninth layer,

681
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,100
after the great formation is complete,

682
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,650
you might still survive.

683
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:50,100
But if you reach the bottom,

684
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:54,290
just the damage along the way

685
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:57,250
will be enough to take your lives.

686
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,290
Why is there no movement at all?

687
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,160
Be careful.

688
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,130
It's so cold here.

689
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,200
Come.

690
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,330
It's already the eighth layer.

691
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,650
One more layer down,

692
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,610
we can see Sister Mu.

693
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,350
Brother Liu.

694
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,800
Brother Liu!

695
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,330
- Liu Fuyi…
- Why are you so badly hurt?

696
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:18,910
Miaomiao,

697
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,350
Sheng,

698
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:21,580
next,

699
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,580
it will probably be up to you.

700
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,380
Every time you open the door,

701
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,020
you will suffer a backlash.

702
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:32,510
With so many layers before,

703
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:33,900
why didn't you tell us?

704
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,100
Liu Fuyi,

705
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,540
why are you being so stubborn?

706
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:40,900
Don't you want to save my sister?

707
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,760
Yao

708
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,730
is the person I love most in this life.

709
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,130
How could I not want to save her by myself?

710
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:54,420
Entrusting this matter

711
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,500
to anyone in the world

712
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,060
will not put me at ease.

713
00:41:58,630 --> 00:41:59,470
But

714
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,100
I believe in you.

715
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,420
- Liu Fuyi!
- Brother Liu!

716
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,640
Also,

717
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,020
the weakness of the Demon Trap Tower

718
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:10,180
is the stone pillar
at the bottom of the tower.

719
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,330
It is the keel axis of the entire tower.

720
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:14,500
Break it.

721
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,250
Perhaps the entire tower

722
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:18,690
can collapse from within.

723
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,120
Remember,

724
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:23,130
you must do it
after slaying the Resentful Woman,

725
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,840
otherwise,

726
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,330
the Resentful Woman

727
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,860
will escape from the tower.

728
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,810
The Liuyin World is the most dangerous place.

729
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,980
You must be extremely careful.

730
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,640
Miaomiao,

731
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,160
Sheng,

732
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,540
you must

733
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,020
bring Yao

734
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,610
and all the demons
who have exhausted their karma

735
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:44,900
to escape from the tower.

736
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:47,210
No, Brother Liu.

737
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,880
We need to go together.

738
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,500
You should go to save Sister Mu.

739
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:55,100
The door is closing.

740
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,240
Hurry up.

741
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,170
