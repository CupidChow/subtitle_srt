=Episode 6=

3
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:45,940
(County Magistrate's Mansion)

4
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,310
I'm leaving first.

5
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:55,540
Bye.

6
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,060
(County Magistrate's Mansion)

7
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:57,910
Take it.

8
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,350
Miss, we are leaving.

9
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,430
Who will serve you in the future?

10
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,640
I have hands and feet,
I don't need you to serve me.

11
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:09,790
But you,

12
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,120
after you leave,

13
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,680
make sure to take good care of yourself,

14
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,560
and live well,

15
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,400
understand?

16
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,120
Go now.

17
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,320
Miss.

18
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,350
Take care, Miss.

19
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,580
(County Magistrate's Mansion)

20
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,360
Old Lin.

21
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,280
Are you feeling particularly sad now?

22
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,470
Old Lin?

23
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,030
Show your respect for elders.

24
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,630
You know what,

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,840
I think

26
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,910
you look better in these common clothes

27
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,120
than in the official costumes.

28
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,240
You're more affectionate

29
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,590
and more like my father.

30
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:43,840
What do you mean by "like"?

31
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,030
I am your father.

32
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,750
Yes.

33
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,000
Alright.

34
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,870
Don't look so worried.

35
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,590
I can understand how you feel now.

36
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,120
You were born in the
richest family in Jiangnan

37
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,590
and lived a luxurious life
as a young master,

38
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,910
(Simplicity and Ambition)
but you acted like a hero this time,

39
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:10,750
from now on,

40
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,910
you will have to live a life

41
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,240
just like ordinary people.

42
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,750
You'll move out of the mansion

43
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,150
you've lived in for most of your life,

44
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,560
you must be sad.

45
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,960
Actually, it's nothing.

46
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,470
I'm sad

47
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,590
because of you.

48
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,430
Me?

49
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,870
I'm getting old.

50
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,000
But you

51
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,590
are at your best age.

52
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,680
From now on,

53
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,800
you'll have to live a poor life.

54
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,120
What's wrong with a poor life?

55
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,590
Dear,

56
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,750
from your birth to now,

57
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,590
you have no idea what a poor life is like.

58
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,470
You don't know how terrifying it can be.

59
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,080
I know.

60
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,000
You know nothing.

61
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,680
Dad,

62
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,180
you were born into a wealthy family.

63
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,480
It's you who knows nothing
about poor life.

64
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,380
Let's go, follow me.

65
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,550
Where are we going?

66
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,800
You'll know once you come.

67
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,680
Take a look.

68
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,870
Have a glance.

69
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,120
Excuse me.

70
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,350
Ma'am,

71
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,830
how much are pork ribs per jin?

72
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:39,870
Young lady,

73
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,240
this costs five cents per jin.

74
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,150
Five cents?

75
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,560
It's too expensive.

76
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,000
How about three cents?

77
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,870
Ma'am, I only have three cents.

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,160
- Look.
- It's a good price.

79
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,560
Alright then, Dad, let's go.

80
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,320
Come back.

81
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:53,870
Alright.

82
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,000
For the sake of your beauty.

83
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,040
Thank you, Ma'am.

84
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,950
This costs six cents.

85
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,270
Six cents?

86
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,920
It is too expensive.

87
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,240
- You always buy in bulk.
- Look at this quality, it's natural.

88
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,430
- Look, there are defects.
- You still think it's expensive?

89
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,560
Two cents, then.

90
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,870
Three cents.

91
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,120
Four cents.

92
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,120
Let's meet halfway.

93
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,390
- Alright.
- Dad.

94
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,600
Welcome to come again.

95
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,440
Let's go.

96
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:23,990
Take a look.

97
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,510
I think these

98
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,390
are not very cost-effective.

99
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,510
Free-range chickens are
very cost-effective.

100
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,120
Let's take this one. How much is it?

101
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,030
Ten cents for one.

102
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,430
Ten cents?

103
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:35,910
Five cents.

104
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,240
- No.
- Boss,

105
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,800
my Dad wants to eat some chicken.

106
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,360
- Give it to her.
- My Dad is out of health.

107
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,360
Is that okay?

108
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,950
Alright, take it, take it away.

109
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,630
You give it to me? Okay, that's great.

110
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,520
Seeing you are so filial,

111
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,720
I'll give it to you.

112
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,070
Here you are, Boss.

113
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,160
Wishing you prosperity and good health.

114
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,230
Let's go.

115
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,620
Come and take a look.

116
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,240
It's amazing.

117
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,720
It's unbelievable.

118
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,950
I've been in Taicang County for so long.

119
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,240
I didn't know a mere three hundred cents

120
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,630
could buy so many things.

121
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,270
Are you convinced?

122
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,070
When it comes to bargaining,
I am the master.

123
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,720
Well-deserved.

124
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,950
The bargaining techniques you just used

125
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,480
were smooth, effortless,

126
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,350
and convictive.

127
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,870
I saw the vendor had cold sweat
on his forehead.

128
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:23,870
A duel between experts

129
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,720
is a psychological game.

130
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:26,680
Take a look, come and see.

131
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,430
My dear daughter is amazing.

132
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,040
Actually, we can't
rely entirely on bargaining.

133
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,040
Take the carriage just now for example,

134
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,680
we can get a wholesale price
by following him.

135
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,470
It will be very cost-effective.

136
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,430
Besides, we can find
affordable alternatives.

137
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,780
What is an affordable alternative?

138
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,000
It means an affordable substitute.

139
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,480
For example,
if spareribs are too expensive,

140
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,360
we can buy this kind of pork ribs instead.

141
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,160
The price is more than half cheaper.

142
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,120
There is also plenty of meat.

143
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,920
The nutritional value is almost the same.

144
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,560
Another important aspect is timing.

145
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,310
We can patiently wait for the discount.

146
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,520
Dad, look,

147
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,630
- those freshly made flower cakes
- Here you are.

148
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,480
shouldn't be bought in the morning.

149
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,630
We have to wait until dusk,

150
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,680
because if they are left until the next day,

151
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,830
they won't be fresh anymore.

152
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,390
So the closer it gets to dusk,
the cheaper the price becomes.

153
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,600
Dad, don't just keep nodding.

154
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,000
Do you remember what I said?

155
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,360
You are just spoiling
your daughter too much.

156
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,480
But you shouldn't be
extravagant and wasteful.

157
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,510
Look, this kind of life

158
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,560
is also quite enjoyable, right?

159
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,950
Let's see what else we can buy.

160
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,310
Dad, give me chili peppers.

161
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,200
Chili pepper.

162
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,200
Have a taste.

163
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:38,630
Dear,

164
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,670
when did you learn to do these things?

165
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,240
You had never been to the market before,

166
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,120
and you did nothing at home.

167
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,960
Not to mention cooking,

168
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,390
you even didn't sweep the floor once.

169
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,390
How could you

170
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,550
learn so many things that I don't know?

171
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,600
It was Wan and Huayi who taught me.

172
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,380
What do you think?

173
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,510
I learn quickly, don't I?

174
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,000
It's not just these things.

175
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,120
I think your temperament

176
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,150
has become very different from before.

177
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,000
It seems like you are not my daughter.

178
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,200
Dad,

179
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,390
actually,

180
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,790
I had a dream.

181
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:37,960
In the dream,

182
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,360
you are also my Dad.

183
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,870
But later on,

184
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,320
you passed away.

185
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,750
Dear, you had a nightmare?

186
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,440
It wasn't exactly a nightmare.

187
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,200
It was an entirely different world.

188
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,270
Everything is different from here.

189
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,320
For example,

190
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
there are no demons in that world.

191
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,630
Not a single demon left?

192
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,030
How peaceful it would be!

193
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,720
Have you finished tidying up?

194
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,750
- You're going to be late.
- Coming.

195
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,590
Alas.

196
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,960
I'm coming.

197
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,320
(Ling Miaomiao's mother)
It's not too late.

198
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,180
(Ling Miaomiao's father)
Eat slowly.

199
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,280
(Young Ling Miaomiao)
It's too late.

200
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,200
Take this. Eat it on the way.

201
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,650
- It's too late. Go now.
- No.

202
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,750
Don't rush!

203
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,590
It's too late!

204
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,360
The teacher asked her to
arrive five minutes early.

205
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,840
- Hurry, go.
- No, not like this.

206
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:39,750
Hurry up.

207
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,840
Look at you.

208
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,630
I told you to be quicker.

209
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,150
Come, don't rush.

210
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,270
Here, daughter, have some milk.

211
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,670
- Do you bring the water bottle?
- Yes, I do.

212
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,960
Take another sip.
Remember to drink more water.

213
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,550
- I can't drink anymore.
- Look at how dry your lips are.

214
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,080
Watch your step, don't fall.

215
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,960
Take it slow.

216
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,120
I told you to call her
ten minutes in advance.

217
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,240
(In that world,)

218
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,320
(I live a completely different life.)

219
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,440
You see, she didn't have breakfast.

220
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,790
(I was born into an ordinary family.)

221
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,630
(My parents were regular people.)

222
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,150
(They didn't have much money,)

223
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,630
(but they never let me
suffer any hardships.)

224
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,320
(I was always happy,)

225
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,030
(Watermelon, ten yuan for 7 jin)
(officious,)

226
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,870
(and hot-headed.)

227
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,200
Little girl.

228
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,030
(Originally, I thought)

229
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,870
- Sorry about that.
- (I would keep being this cheerful.)

230
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,110
I really didn't mean to.

231
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,980
(Until one day...)

232
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,960
Pei Xiaocen,

233
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,630
we have known it.

234
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,470
To be honest,

235
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,670
did you report to the teacher?

236
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,510
I…

237
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,900
What are you pretending for?

238
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,440
I tell you,

239
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,960
if you dare to report to the teacher again,

240
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,630
you'll know the consequences.

241
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,470
Wu Nian,

242
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,080
you are bullying people again.

243
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,750
Do you think others don't exist?

244
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,720
What does it have to do with you?

245
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,550
You can't bully people anymore.

246
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,870
Do you want to stand up for her?

247
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,870
What if I say yes?

248
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,200
Teacher, please don't make the call.

249
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,750
My dad and mom are busy.

250
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:07,750
Teacher.

251
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,680
Hello.

252
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,630
Alright.

253
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,200
I'll be there soon.

254
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,560
Okay.

255
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,030
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

256
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,480
Give me a cup of milk tea.

257
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,440
I want the lemon flavor.

258
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,470
Okay.

259
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,030
Please hurry up.

260
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,200
Is it done yet?

261
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:51,750
- Give me.
- Here.

262
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,120
- Thank you.
- Bye.

263
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,390
(I heard)

264
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,510
(after I transferred schools,)

265
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,320
(the classmates who bullied others
were punished.)

266
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,550
(But for me,)

267
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,360
(that day was the darkest)

268
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,670
(in my life.)

269
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,440
Nurse!

270
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,360
Where is Ling Chang'an?

271
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,270

275
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,720
Why are you covered in blood?

276
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,320
Are you alright?

277
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,030
Speak!

278
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,120
Isn't your dad at work?

279
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,150
How could he suddenly go to the school?

280
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,960
Say something.

281
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,930
Speak.

282
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,320
Calm down.

283
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,670
- Please wait outside.
- Doctor, please save him!

284
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,080
We'll start the rescue.
Please wait outside.

285
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,320
You must save him, doctor!

286
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,160
Please leave.

287
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,920

Dad, why are you crying like this?

It's so late.

378
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,560
(Wait, I need to win him over!)

379
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,200
(It's rare that he comes to me.)

380
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,350
(A lone man and woman
stay together at night,)

381
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,510
(it's a good opportunity.)

382
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:21,960
Welcome.

383
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,000
Of course, you're welcome.

384
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,240
What would you like to talk about?

385
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,880
Let's talk about

386
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,510
the strange dream you mentioned.

387
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,180
You eavesdropped on
my conversation with my Dad?

388
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,160
From the first time I met you,

389
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,880
I always felt that
something was not right.

390
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,720
What exactly is the strange world

391
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,270
in your dream?

392
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,880
I said it was in a dream.

393
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,480
How can we take things
in a dream seriously?

394
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,750
Young Master Mu, what do you like to eat?

395
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,200
I love eating Balut the most.

396
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:55,960
We don't seem to have much in common.

397
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,350
Let's stop chatting.

398
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,550
How about playing chess?

399
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,550
You take the first move.

400
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,270
First move, Tengen.

401
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,070
It's your turn. Make your move quickly.

402
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,550
Do you even know how to play chess?

403
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,750
Not really.

404
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,160
You don't know how to play chess.

405
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,510
But this chess set of yours

406
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,240
is smooth and polished,

407
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,070
it must be someone
who plays with it every day.

408
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,480
If it's not you,

409
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,590
who could it be?

410
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,680
It's…

411
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,550
it's me.

412
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,920
I was just kidding.

413
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,570
How could I not know how to play chess?

414
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,550
I definitely know how to play.

415
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,160
Moreover, I am an expert at playing chess.

416
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,390
Young Master Mu,

417
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,400
take another look.

418
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,640
Observe it carefully.

419
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,920
Are they in a line?

420
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,560
Yes.

421
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:31,870
I see it.

422
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,110
But only a fool will string it together.

423
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,480
You don't understand this.

424
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,350
Come, let me explain it to you.

425
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,640
This is the popular way of playing chess

426
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,270
in Taicang County.

427
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:48,310
It is called Gomoku.

428
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,160
Make five chesses in a line.

429
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,590
I win.

430
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,190
Gomoku.

431
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,030
Nüwa created humans,
Fuxi made the Go.

432
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:04,110
It's said Gomoku started before Go,

433
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,640
and flourished in the Yao
and Shun periods.

434
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,110
Young Master Mu, didn't you know?

435
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,590
I'm not very good at traditional Go.

436
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,310
But I'm highly skilled at Gomoku.

437
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,640
Why are you looking at me like that?

438
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,640
Don't underestimate this Gomoku.

439
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,960
It appears to be simple,

440
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,070
but it is profound.

441
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,270
You are good at playing Go.

442
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,680
But you may not

443
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,590
play this Gomoku well.

444
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,030
How about we play it again?

445
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,640
As long as I make five pieces in a line,
I win, right?

446
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,590
Yes, that's right.

447
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,640
Moving horizontally
or diagonally both count.

448
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,310
Exchange the chess?

449
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,520
That's right.

450
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,000
This is Yunzi.

451
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,400
Look at its color,

452
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,680
it's as white as your face,

453
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
so beautiful.

454
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,510
This time, you go first.

455
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:13,850
Wait a minute.

456
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,760
(If I want to flirt with a guy,)

457
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,310
(I should create more physical contact.)

458
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,830
We should have a bet, right?

459
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,480
So, if who wins,

460
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,310
the winner gets to
flick the other's forehead,

461
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,190
okay?

462
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,320
Why?

463
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,640
Can't you afford this?

464
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:36,950
Okay.

465
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,310
I won just now.

466
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,240
I'll flick you first.

467
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,270
Come, let me flick you.

468
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:42,630
Okay?

469
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,760
Yes.

470
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,680
Come on, let's continue.

471
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,960
Let's do it.

472
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,590
I win again.

473
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,070
Come, Young Master Mu.

474
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:18,910
No.

475
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,200
Continue.

476
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,270
I win again.

477
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,350
Young Master Mu.

478
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,680
Mu Sheng, can you do it?

479
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,440
Can you stop giving in to me?

480
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,790
You just won a few games,

481
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,240
how dare you call me by my full name?

482
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,720
We are so familiar now,

483
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,260
what's wrong with calling a full name?

484
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,480
Who is familiar with you?

485
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,240
Why?

486
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,070
Are you unable to accept defeat?

487
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,720
Progress prompt:

488
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,790
Favorability change detected.

489
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,680
Your target Mu Sheng's

490
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,810
favorability towards you decreases to

491
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,500
negative twenty-five percent.

492
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,000
(What a petty person!)

493
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,790
(Help!)

494
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,240
(I've been single since birth.)

495
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,320
(Ask me to flirt with a guy)

496
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,270
(and such a difficult guy,)

497
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,000
(I'm suffering.)

498
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,150
Young Master Mu,

499
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,400
it's late.

500
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:21,350
Why don't you go back and rest for now?

501
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,000
Young Master Mu, do you need an umbrella?

502
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,430

503
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,640

00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
what was your name?

505
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,550
Why are you asking this?

506
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,590
I want to know.

Lin Yu sounds like prison,

514

it's quite ominous,

515
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,040

00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,600
I wouldn't be able to get the words out.

565
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:33,960
Demon Catchers

566
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,440
wander around the world,

567
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,030
and live a drifting life.

568
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:38,630
She

569
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,590
should live peacefully

570
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,760
with a smooth life.

571
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,400
I shouldn't have

572
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,960
had any ties with her.

573
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,830
Oh no, how could I forget it?

574
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,790
They will set off today.

575
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,440
Sister Mu, Brother Liu,

576
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,480
Mu Sheng,

577
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,620
wait for me.

578
00:30:59,030 --> 00:30:59,870
Sir,

579
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,110
Sir,

580
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,750
did you see Sister Mu and the others?

581
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,240
Miss, I didn't see them.

582
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,070
Could they have left already?

583
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,550
Why didn't you take me along?

584
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,830
(In the original plot,
the entire family is executed,)

585
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,720
(the surviving Lin Yu became an orphan.)

586
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,070
(That's why she followed them.)

587
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,480
(Now, this part is gone,)

588
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,590
(the storyline is broken.)

589
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,550
(How could I forget about this?)

590
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,390
Yao.

591
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,070
Have you packed everything?

592
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,480
Yes.

593
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,080
Let me help you carry it.

594
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,150
Let's go.

595
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,050
Sister,

596
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,270
if you can't bear to part with Miss Lin,

597
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,590
you'd better meet her one more time.

598
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,940
Sister Mu!

599
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,440
Sister Mu!

600
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,210
Thank heavens!

601
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,510
Fortunately, you haven't left yet.

602
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,190
Lin Yu,

603
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,070
I planned to say goodbye to you.

604
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,560
Don't bother.

605
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,030
I want to go with you.

606
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:23,680
Go with us?

607
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:30,750
Demon Hunting is fraught with
countless dangers.

608
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,200
Not to mention dealing with those demons,

609
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,640
even the life in the wild

610
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,110
is not something you can handle.

611
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,920
Don't worry, I'm very strong.

612
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,110
I can endure any hardship.

613
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,640
We don't have a big bowl of rice

614
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,000
for you to eat every meal.

615
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,520
Sheng,

616
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,830
it is not the time for jokes.

617
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:49,120
I promise I won't hold you back.

618
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:50,620
I'll exercise every day to stay fit.

619
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:51,950
If I encounter danger,

620
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,920
I will run if I can't fight back,

621
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,420
and I can run very fast.

622
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,190
Forget it.

623
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,680
I should be responsible for your safety.

624
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:13,000
Miss Lin, why did you suddenly
decide to go with us?

625
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,040
Because…

626
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,800
Because

627
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:21,880
I don't want to live
this kind of life anymore.

628
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,460
If I hadn't met you,

629
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,000
I might be

630
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,720
confined to my boudoir,

631
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,680
succumb to my parents' orders,

632
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,070
and marry a stranger,

633
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,200
then live a dull life

634
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,200
for all my life.

635
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,240
I want to choose my own life.

636
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,720
I don't want to be

637
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,030
trapped in this small world.

638
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,240
Tell the truth.

639
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,000
I…

640
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:55,590
I really want to go with you.

641
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,420
This is a significant matter.

642
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,680
Miss Lin, have you discussed it
with your father?

643
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:02,670
Fuyi.

644
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,400
On the day of the Lantern Festival,

645
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,000
Miss Lin told me

646
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,280
if it's what you really want,

647
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,920
it is important and reasonable.

648
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,000
Since that's the case, I agree.

649
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,550
I agree as well.

650
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,550
Sheng.

651
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:21,720
It's too troublesome for
three people to order food.

652
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:23,070
If we four people stay together,

653
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,030
we can live two rooms

654
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,100
and order three dishes and a soup.

655
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,190
It's quite suitable.

656
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,760
Sister Mu, look,

657
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,760
three to one, they all agreed.

658
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,110
Please take me with you.

659
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,190
That day,

660
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,840
we were the first

661
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,400
to fly the Unity Lantern.

662
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,320
Yes.

663
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,920
Goddess Mei

664
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,510
wishes the four of us

665
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,270
stay together

666
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,550
and never be apart.

667
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,510
Yes, that's right.

668
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,360
Goddess Mei

669
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,590
will definitely bless you.

670
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,960
You will be safe

671
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:57,990
with us.

672
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,240
That's right.

673
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,200
Alright,

674
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,240
the four of us

675
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,510
will go together.

676
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:07,410
Great, Sister Mu.

677
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,750
From now on,

678
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,400
we will be together,

679
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,130
wandering the world.

680
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,350
Okay?

681
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,350
Come.

682
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,880
Let's wish us

683
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:49,550
good luck with Demon Hunting.

684
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,430
Dad.

685
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,630
A grown daughter can't be kept at home.

686
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,470
That's fine.

687
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,480
You go out,

688
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:23,190
explore and see the world.

689
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,680
That sounds good.

690
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,830
Good, Old Lin.

691
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,320
I thought

692
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,550
you would cry and shout to stop me.

693
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:37,280
Am I such an incompetent father?

694
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,280
When you're away from home,

695
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,510
take good care of yourself,

696
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,670
make sure to eat well and sleep well.

697
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,800
Do you know?

698
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,710
Don't worry, I know.

699
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:56,880
Every time you arrive at a place,

700
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,840
remember to write to me,

701
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,510
let me know you're safe.

702
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,200
Sure.

703
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,030
I am out of money now.

704
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,640
If I had money,

705
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,280
I would buy you a

706
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,630
big and luxurious ship.

707
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,320
The masts are all made of gold.

708
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,090
Isn't that too extravagant, Dad?

709
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:30,990
Dad,

710
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,880
I have a very important matter.

711
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:34,760
You must handle it for me.

712
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,550
Dear, just say it.

713
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,320
Mu Sheng.

714
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,630
You're so slow.

715
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,350
Thank you.

716
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,070
For what?

717
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,000
Thank you for speaking up for me earlier.

718
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,090
If it weren't for you,

719
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,800
Sister Mu wouldn't have agreed
to take me along.

720
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,030
No need.

721
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,700
I don't care

722
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:06,070
whether you're here or not.

723
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,550
Why did you speak up for me?

724
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:11,510
You don't seem like

725
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:13,000
such a kind-hearted person.

726
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,070
You finally got a bit smarter.

727
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,550
But if you are smart enough,

728
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,280
you should know

729
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,480
not to ask too many questions.

730
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,440
The more you know,

731
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,800
the more dangerous you are.

732
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,360
What are you looking at?

733
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:37,160
The color of your headband is very pretty.

734
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,290
It really suits you.

735
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,110
This flower is also very beautiful.

736
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:58,590
It suits you very well.

737
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,510
Oleander is poisonous.

738
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,550
It's a pity

739
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,360
beautiful things

740
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,400
are always very malicious.

741
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,200
Poisonous?

742
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,670
Sheng, Lin Yu,

743
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,800
we should get going.

744
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,870
Coming.

745
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:30,390
Poisonous.

746
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,840
Let's go.

747
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,320
Dad, take care.

748
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,630
Eat less and exercise more.

749
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,190
Take care of your health.

750
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,510
Write letters to me.

751
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,110
Go back.

752
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,070
Be careful.

753
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,290
This railing is unstable.

754
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,440
I don't want to cause trouble
as soon as we set off.

755
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:18,760
Master!

756
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,640
Master!

757
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,440
Good news!

758
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:24,550
Master!

759
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:25,510
Good news!

760
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,760
What are you shouting?

761
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,710
My dear daughter is gone.

762
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,070
What good news could there be?

763
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,360
We discovered a gold mine.

764
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,680
Really?

765
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:36,560
Dad,

766
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,110
on the Desolate Mountain in the South,

767
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,840
there is a Goddess Mei Temple.

768
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:40,750
Do you remember it?

769
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,280
It seems so.

770
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,320
Go and buy it.

771
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,360
What are you going to do with it?

772
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,590
That mountain is so barren
that not even grass grows.

773
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:51,230
Nobody wants it.

774
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,070
I want you to buy it.

775
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,510
After buying it,

776
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:56,590
you dig up the foundation of the temple,

777
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,880
and repair it properly.

778
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,280
If you want me to buy it, I'll buy it.

779
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,840
However,

780
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,400
even if it is a barren mountain,

781
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,360
I can't afford it now.

782
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,840
Don't worry.

783
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,670
I've already prepared everything for you.

784
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:20,260
This is what I secretly hid away.

785
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,110
If you pawn it, you can buy it.

786
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,320
I secretly hid it.

787
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,280
You must follow what I said.

788
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,640
The Goddess Mei Temple

789
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,860
contains a huge gold mine
in the foundation.

790
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:40,030
There might be
ten thousand taels of gold inside.

791
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,350
Master,

792
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,530
you'll be the richest man in Jiangnan.

793
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,280
Dear,

794
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,150
we have become wealthy again.

795
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,400
We have become wealthy again.

796
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,960
Dear,

797
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,320
the mountain you asked me to buy
is a gold mine.

798
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:09,470
Why…

799
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:12,320
Why don't you come back?

800
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,800
(At the end of the book, it says)

801
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:24,230
(there is a gold mine in the
barren mountain of Taicang County.)

802
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:25,760
(Since childhood, my dream)

803
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,630
(is to suddenly have God's perspective)

804
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,030
(and guide my parents to
buy a grand prize lottery ticket.)

805
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:32,800
(Then, we will buy a big house,)

806
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,800
(live a good life,)

807
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,300
(and travel around the world together.)

808
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:38,960
(I always want to experience this plot.)

809
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:50,430
Goodbye,

810
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,640
Dad.

811
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,680
Regret it?

812
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:08,840
It's not too late to go back now.

813
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:13,480
No regrets.

814
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:17,480
I won't go back.

815
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,010
On this road,

816
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,480
I can only move forward.

817
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,880
There's no turning back.

818
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,400
You

819
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:25,590
are really annoying.

820
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:28,320
However, sometimes,

821
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:30,440
you are somewhat useful.

822
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:33,510
What do you mean?

823
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,800
Hundred Demons Mountain and Sea Map.

824
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:40,760
It's good you burned it.

825
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:44,360
It's not me, I didn't.

826
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,280
What are you talking about?

827
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:47,030
Wasn't this matter resolved

828
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:48,190
a long time ago?

829
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,400
Don't talk nonsense.

830
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,280
Stop pretending.

831
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:55,670
You deceitful liar.

832
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,590
You wouldn't kill me again, would you?

833
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:03,430
Of course not.

834
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,070
Regarding this matter,

835
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:07,480
we are allies.

836
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,190
Hundred Demons Mountain and Sea Map

837
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:13,800
is an extremely precious magical artifact.

838
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,480
It is woven from
Northern Ice Silkworm Silk.

839
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,880
Every stroke contains
strong spiritual power.

840
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,760
Without my assistance from the side,

841
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,630
you think you can burn it
with just a candle?

842
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:29,010
You…

843
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,510
So it was you who burned it.

844
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:33,350
But…

845
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,640
didn't you take the Heartburn Curse?

846
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:36,960
You even swore to the heavens,

847
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:37,960
you'll be struck by the lightning

848
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,010
if you stole the
Hundred Demons Mountain and Sea Map.

849
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:41,800
Yes.

850
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:46,070
Because the person who stole the map

851
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:48,880
is you.

852
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:54,760
Then,

853
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,070
why do you always say
that I acted stealthily

854
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,120
and suspected me?

855
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,320
At that time, I did want to kill you
to silence you.

856
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,280
You…

857
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:08,190
You are truly a cunning and deceitful man.

858
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,760
Speaking of this,

859
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,960
we should be the same kind of people.

860
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:15,880
Who is the same as you?

861
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,160
You think so?

862
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,480
My sister thought
you were sincere to her,

863
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:25,110
and truly considered her a friend,

864
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:26,550
so you approached her
and treated her well.

865
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,320
But I know

866
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:32,280
you have other intentions.

867
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,590
I burned the map to protect her,

868
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,030
preventing her from facing
the Resentful Woman

869
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:41,110
without a foolproof plan.

870
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:46,840
But why you went to great lengths
to burn the map?

871
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,360
What exactly is your purpose?

872
00:45:57,650 --> 00:45:58,510
It's okay if you don't tell me.

873
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:01,840
I'll find out sooner or later.

874
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:05,030
By the way,

875
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,400
didn't you ask me

876
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:09,920
why I spoke up for you

877
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,190
and agreed to take you with us?

878
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:14,510
Because

879
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:19,150
I will keep an eye on you all the time

880
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:23,630
