3
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:42,950
But

4
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,980
how to use this magical weapon?

5
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,480
Why?

6
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:12,930
Do you know

7
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,100
what it means to put a ring
on a girl's finger?

8
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:19,750
What does it mean?

9
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,800
Forget it.

10
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,550
Spark,

11
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,390
explode!

12
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,000
I think this magical weapon

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,500
doesn't seem to be useful.

14
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,450
It's not even as good as
my bamboo ladle.

15
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,940
If you're going to call me stupid,

16
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,100
don't say it.

17
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,290
What about

18
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,190
lending me your demon staff?

19
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,030
No way.

20
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,380
Why are you so stingy?

21
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,530
Isn't that
what the Water Demon King said?

22
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,690
This is a low-level magical weapon.

23
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,410
Besides, it looks quite old.

24
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,530
Why do you value it so much?

25
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,500
My sister gave it to me.

26
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,410
When I was little,

27
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,410
I didn't have any magical weapons.

28
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,460
My sister made this demon staff for me.

29
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,340
This is my most precious possession.

30
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,510
Mu Sheng,

31
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,410
have you noticed that

32
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,190
everything about Sister Mu

33
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,530
is extremely important to you?

34
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,220
But you never
took your feelings into account.

35
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,780
I was never important.

36
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,810
How can you think like that?

37
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,120
Everyone's existence

38
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,500
has its meaning.

39
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,850
The reason I live in this world

40
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,530
is to protect,

41
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,080
assist,

42
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,160
and fulfill my sister.

43
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,500
Apart from that,

44
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,500
I don't know why

45
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,480
a monster like me

46
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,730
should live.

47
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,780
You are not a monster.

48
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,810
And

49
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,000
I think you need

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,730
to see a psychologist.

51
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,360
See what?

52
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,340
The stars.

53
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,880
Look.

54
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,510
Come.

55
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,510
Mu Sheng,

56
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,810
do you remember

57
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,970
the world I told my dad

58
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,610
in Taicang County?

59
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,310
Yes, I remember.

60
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,790
It's a strange world

61
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,260
without demons and magic skills.

62
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,820
In that world,

63
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,460
I was an ordinary girl

64
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,700
with an ordinary appearance,

65
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,050
personality

66
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,700
and job.

67
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,700
My life is ordinary, too.

68
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,530
But

69
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,340
I still want to go back.

70
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,050
Because that is

71
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,700
my real world.

72
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,430
Everything I have experienced here,

73
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,580
is an unrealistic existence

74
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,100
for me.

75
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,050
I know

76
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,970
you think I'm talking nonsense.

77
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,780
I'm listening.

78
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,580
At first

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,370
I looked forward to going home every day.

80
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,460
I can't wait,

81
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,530
not even for a moment.

82
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,370
But today

83
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,520
I suddenly

84
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,050
realized that

85
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,780
I'm beginning to feel reluctant to leave.

86
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,410
I know

87
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,340
that when the dream ends,

88
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,460
I will never see Sister Mu Yao,

89
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,290
Brother Liu

90
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,970
and you again.

91
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,410
Because of all of you,

92
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,170
I have begun to feel a sense of belonging
to this world,

93
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,700
to believe in everything here

94
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,730
and to integrate into it.

95
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,900
I believe there are demons,

96
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,660
magic skills,

97
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,730
and spiritual powers here.

98
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,530
I believe

99
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,780
it all really exists.

100
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,960
You

101
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,050
didn't believe that before?

102
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,360
I used to think

103
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,370
it was absurd,

104
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,220
like a fairy tale.

105
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,530
When practicing magic skills,

106
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,850
I didn't have a sense of conviction.

107
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,800
So when I taught you
the Four Phases Technique,

108
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,700
and when I taught you
to hold your breath and concentrate,

109
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,290
you didn't believe it.

110
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,290
No wonder you couldn't master it.

111
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,970
Is that the main point?

112
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,610
Come down, Lin Yu.

113
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,530
My disciple

114
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,220
must not embarrass me.

115
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,520
Wait.

116
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,160
What?

117
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,020
I can continue practicing

118
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,370
if you agree

119
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,260
to one condition of mine.

120
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,430
What condition?

121
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,750
From now on,

122
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,580
don't call me Lin Yu,

123
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,900
call me Miaomiao,

124
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,070
okay?

125
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,480
Why?

126
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,430
Because

127
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,150
I told you before,

128
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,530
my nickname is Miaomiao.

129
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,720
From now on,

130
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,410
I'll call you Ziqi.

131
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,050
You call me Miaomiao.

132
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,820
As you wish.

133
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,180
Then call me.

134
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,460
Just call me.

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,880
Can I?

182
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,430
No.

183
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,640
Why?

184
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,250
You have just learned a magic skill,

185
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,650
and now you're becoming arrogant.

186
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,420
You should cultivate your inner core first.

187
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,920
Inner core?

188
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,360
Practitioners condense their energy
in their Dantian

189
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,200
to form the core.

190
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,280
This is the true source
of demon catcher's power,

191
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,850
as well as the foundation
of their magic skills.

192
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:55,770
The stronger the inner core,

193
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,610
the more powerful the magic skills.

194
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,750
It's such an important thing,

195
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,370
why didn't you tell me before?

196
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,940
Who knew you could hold on for so long?

197
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,940
You really underestimate me.

198
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,110
Well, how long do I need

199
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,300
to cultivate my inner core?

200
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,940
If everything goes well,

201
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,060
you can form a core
in three to five years.

202
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,060
At your level,

203
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,600
it might take eight to ten years.

204
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,280
That's too long!

205
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,480
That's because you're so stupid.

206
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,730
- You're stupid.
- Who?

207
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,250
Little Bamboo Demon?

208
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,460
Why did you follow us?

209
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,730
He's afraid of you. Turn around.

210
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,800
All right, he's not staring at you now.

211
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,640
Speak.

212
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,280
I…

213
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,970
I want to go with you.

214
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,770
Come with me?

215
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:06,770
Why?

216
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,130
Your name is Cuicui, right?

217
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,820
Aren't demon catchers your greatest fear?

218
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,700
I'm surrounded by
powerful demon catchers.

219
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:18,700
But I'm not afraid of you.

220
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,490
You're not powerful at all.

221
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,590
Thank you.

222
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,470
You're welcome.

223
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,970
But you do have a reputation.

224
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,250
When you pleaded,

225
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,820
he let me go.

226
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,650
Besides,

227
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,200
you're the one who broke into my home
in the first place.

228
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,820
Now I can't

229
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,010
go home.

230
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,340
I can only follow you.

231
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,970
Why can't you go back?

232
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,420
All right, he turns around.

233
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,770
Why can't you go back?

234
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,250
Because he went

235
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,070
to the cave.

236
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,060
Now

237
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:08,370
it's full of demon catchers' aura,

238
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,300
especially the Mu Family's aura.

239
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,250
What's wrong with
the Mu Family's aura?

240
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,830
He's shy around strangers.

241
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,010
Let me ask.

242
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,010
Answer the question.

243
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,650
Because there are rumors among the peers

244
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,250
that the Mu Family's heir

245
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,350
has pure Yin blood

246
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,610
flowing through his veins.

247
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,770
If someone could capture and eat the heir,

248
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,730
his cultivation would increase greatly.

249
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,180
So all my peers, great and small,

250
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,460
are coming here.

251
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,580
Does Sheng have pure Yin blood?

252
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,670
This is a secret between me and Sheng.

253
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,350
No one else

254
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,650
has known about it for so many years.

255
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,820
Even Brother Liu doesn't know about it,

256
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,100
so how could it be spread around?

257
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,550
It must be someone
who is deliberately spreading the news.

258
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,180
It might not be a human being.

259
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,700
You mean...

260
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,040
Resentful Woman.

261
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,700
When the Resentful Woman
slaughtered the Mu Family,

262
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,870
she might have smelled Sheng's blood aura.

263
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,250
If she knew about it,

264
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,490
it makes sense.

265
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,890
All demons fear the Mu Family name.

266
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,730
Even with the temptation of pure Yin blood,

267
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,230
they would not dare to provoke
the Mu Family so easily, unless…

268
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,850
Unless there's a sufficient reason

269
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,650
or an irresistible order.

270
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,200
The one who can mobilize so many demons

271
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,820
to act together

272
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,280
can only be

273
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,490
Resentful Woman,

274
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,540
the hidden Queen of Demons.

275
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,600
If this is indeed being spread

276
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,970
by the Resentful Woman,

277
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,420
her purpose is to drive the demons

278
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,700
and use others to kill Sheng.

279
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,340
If that's the case, it's fine.

280
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,300
It indicates that
the Resentful Woman's demonic power

281
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,130
has not yet recovered
from the fierce battle that year.

282
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,440
She can only hide in the corner

283
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,540
and use cunning tricks.

284
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,300
When I find her,

285
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,940
I must kill her.

286
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,610
I told you I couldn't take you with me.

287
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,460
I won't bother you.

288
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,970
I can help you.

289
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,650
You can ask me for anything.

290
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,860
(Nanke Inn)

291
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,610
I said no, and that's final.

292
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,180
We are all demon catchers.

293
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,510
Besides,

294
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,370
Sister Mu hates demons the most.

295
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,010
If she finds out about you,

296
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,490
you won't survive.

297
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,860
(Nanke Inn)

298
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:19,340
(Map)

299
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,980
(Zhijing Town)

300
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,480
Who?

301
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,200
Yao,

302
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,020
what's wrong?

303
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,890
Maybe I misunderstood.

304
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,590
Yao,

305
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,650
what are you thinking about?

306
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,070
Fuyi,

307
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,740
the Astronomical Bureau said that

308
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,340
a Heavenly demon catcher would appear.

309
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,410
My father once believed

310
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,890
that the person they were talking about
was him.

311
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,100
After my father passed away,

312
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,450
I also secretly wondered

313
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:23,300
if that person was me.

314
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,300
I've been learning magic skills
since I was a child,

315
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,580
and I progressed faster than my peers.

316
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,980
The elders often said

317
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,100
that I would achieve something
when I grew up.

318
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,400
If I want to avenge them,

319
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,120
I must surpass all my peers

320
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,340
and reach the Heavenly Level.

321
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,740
But after meeting you,

322
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,340
I realized

323
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,980
that all your fame and glory

324
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,890
are well deserved.

325
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,540
My talent

326
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,740
is not as good as yours.

327
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,110
Talent

328
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,540
is not everything.

329
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,020
No matter what,

330
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,850
even if I cannot kill the Resentful Woman,

331
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,690
I must find her

332
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:00,980
and have a showdown with her.

333
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,240
Fuyi,

334
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,690
I really hope

335
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,690
that you're

336
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,370
the designated Heavenly Master.

337
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,980
If it really is me,

338
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,210
I will take on the mission

339
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,740
of killing the Resentful Woman.

340
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,540
Even if it wasn't me,

341
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,060
it's still my duty of a demon catcher

342
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,610
to eradicate the evil demons
in the world.

343
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,300
I know I may not succeed,

344
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:33,980
but I'm not afraid to die.

345
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:38,830
Yao,

346
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,480
you and I

347
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,570
are like-minded.

348
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,550
Miaomiao,

349
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,300
hurry up and pack, it's time to leave.

350
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,310
Got it.

351
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,930
Isn't that the bamboo ladle from the inn?

352
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,580
I almost take it with me.

353
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,400
No.

354
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,410
Take me with you.

355
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,650
How can this thing talk?

356
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,410
Cuicui.

357
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,100
Please, take me with you.

358
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,340
Didn't I say no?

359
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,300
Wait a moment.

360
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,540
I'm useful.

361
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,210
I'll turn into something more useful.

362
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,780
Have you ever seen anyone travelling

363
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,850
with such a big basket?

364
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:43,910
That's right.

365
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,410
I'll turn into something for travelling.

366
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,450
That's not what I mean.

367
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,210
Why don't you listen to me?

368
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,850
Why do you have to follow me?

369
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,650
I want to find my grandfather.

370
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,300
Looking for your grandfather?

371
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,020
My grandfather

372
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:05,060
is a thousand-year-old bamboo.

373
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:08,370
He has been kind to others all his life.

374
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:11,890
He hasn't even hurt a single grass.

375
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,840
My grandfather and I talked all day.

376
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,740
We counted the stars.

377
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,610
Our days are filled with joy.

378
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,170
But one day,

379
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,980
a demon catcher came.

380
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,260
The demon catcher
took your grandfather away?

381
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:33,300
Did your grandfather do something wrong?

382
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,880
He didn't do anything wrong,

383
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,650
so why would the demon catcher catch him?

384
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,100
Demon catchers don't care
whether the demons are good or bad.

385
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,500
Your demon catcher friends

386
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,890
may seem very fierce

387
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,450
and look down on demons,

388
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,210
but they are reasonable.

389
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,980
Maybe my grandfather is still alive.

390
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,820
I must find him.

391
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,650
Do you know where your grandfather is?

392
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,850
I don't know.

393
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:02,130
We bamboos never travel far from home.

394
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:04,850
I never had the courage.

395
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,160
Anyway,

396
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,740
my home is gone now.

397
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,540
It's time to go and find my grandfather.

398
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:12,820
You are all skilled and warm-hearted.

399
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:13,930
So

400
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,300
I beg you.

401
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,410
(This Little Bamboo Demon)

402
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,450
(was never written
in the original book.)

403
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,210
(I've already deviated a lot from
the main story.)

404
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,760
Cuicui,

405
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,200
to be honest,

406
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,690
I actually have very important things to do.

407
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,450
If I don't finish it,

408
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,830
I won't be able to go home

409
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,980
and see my mom.

410
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,740
I can hardly protect myself.

411
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,390
So I can't look after you.

412
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,390
You'd better

413
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,340
think of other ways.

414
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:05,850
I'm sorry.

415
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,960
Sister.

416
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,150
Come with me.

417
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,740
I hired a carriage.

418
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,830
It can save you some trouble.

419
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,680
Fine.

420
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,960
Where is the Little Bamboo Demon
who sent the message yesterday?

421
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,930
Sent him away.

422
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,230
He's still a child.

423
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,100
He's timid.

424
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,030
He has no family.

425
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,780
(Nanke Inn)
How pitiful!

426
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,410
You mean

427
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,300
the demon in the Bamboo Demon Cave?

428
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,170
He's just a bamboo shoot.

429
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,720
Miaomiao,

430
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:05,910
you must remember

431
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,990
that the nature of demons is unpredictable,

432
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,340
so be careful and vigilant.

433
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,410
Don't show any mercy

434
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,170
to any demon.

435
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,680
Let's go.

436
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,800
Sister.

437
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,510
It's half a day's ride

438
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,650
from the town ahead.

439
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,370
We should let the horses rest.

440
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,470
Yao and I

441
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,710
will go hunting together.

442
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,340
We can fill our stomachs first.

443
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,210
All right, I'll get some firewood.

444
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,960
Who?

445
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,360
Don't come any closer. Evil spirits go.

446
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,500
Evil spirits go.

447
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,130
Why is it you?

448
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,680
You scared me!

449
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,550
Why are you standing behind me
without making a sound?

450
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,130
I thought I had met another demon.

451
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,440
Give it to me.

452
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,150
What?

453
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:12,830
What for?

454
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,960
Give it to me.

455
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,500
This is confusing.

456
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,980
It's much better now.

457
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:56,160
You, why did you burn it?

458
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,060
The strong smell was giving me a headache.

459
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,830
But, but you can't just

460
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,160
burn it.

461
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,060
This is the amulet
that Brother Liu gave me.

462
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,990
Did you even ask my opinion?

463
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:05,880
You are my disciple.

464
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,920
When Liu Fuyi gave you the sachet,

465
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,120
did he ask my opinion?

466
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,850
This sachet is for self-defence.

467
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,720
Now you've burned it.

468
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,500
What if I run into danger in the future?

469
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,600
I will tell Sister Mu Yao right away.

470
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,650
Let her teach you a lesson.

471
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,390
Why?

472
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,340
Are you scared?

473
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,580
Why are you giving me a sandbag?

474
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,070
It's a sachet.

475
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,020
Doesn't it look like that?

476
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,720
It doesn't.

477
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:43,550
You...

478
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,070
Did you make it?

479
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,580
You are my disciple.

480
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,740
The protective equipment you wear

481
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,170
must be given by me.

482
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,030
All right,

483
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:02,100
since you send me a new one,

484
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,370
I forgive you.

485
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,650
Your sandbag,

486
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:12,550
your sachet's strap is too short.

487
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,020
- It's so hard to tie.
- Verbose.

488
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,550
I'm not verbose.

489
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,060
This is too short.

490
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,070
You…

491
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,160
This is my first time making this.

492
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,260
I'm not sure how long the strap should be.

493
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,980
Can't you just make do with it?

494
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,450
Thanks a lot.

495
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,340
Don't tell anyone I gave you anything.

496
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,520
We're back.

497
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,590
You're back.

498
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,450
Where did the sandbag come from?

499
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,590
Miss Lin,

500
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,890
you picked up a sandbag?

501
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,060
I, I didn't say anything.

502
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:26,890
Come here, eat some fruit.

503
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,590
Miaomiao,

504
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:37,980
it's good to have you with us.

505
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,980
I haven't seen Sheng

506
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,650
so happy for a long time.

507
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,690
Are you sure he's happy?

508
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,690
I have watched him grow up
since he was a child.

509
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,720
After so many years,

510
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:05,130
he has a friend for the first time.

511
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,480
Here you are.

512
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:49,140
(Zhijing Town)

513
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:53,980
(Partner)

514
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:00,940
(Tailai Inn)

515
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:04,060
(Tofu Workshop)

516
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,260
Let's prepare the guest rooms first.

517
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:19,870
Mrs. Li,

518
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,980
take ten cents worth of tofu.

519
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,590
You come to help every few days.

520
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,840
Why pay for it?

521
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,680
Take it back.

522
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,640
Mr. Li isn't at home.

523
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,640
We are all neighbors.

524
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,960
It's nothing for me to

525
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,070
help you move things.

526
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,340
You should charge for the tofu.

527
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,410
Good boy.

528
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,580
Mr. Li will be back tomorrow.

529
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:37,930
Thank you, Mrs. Li.

530
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,340
- It's nothing.
- Old Zhang.

531
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:40,960
When your son went to town

532
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,300
on business,

533
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:45,740
did he take a fairly large carriage?

534
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,410
Yes, he did.

535
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,450
He should be back tomorrow.

536
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:52,710
By the way,
your mother went for a medical check-up.

537
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:53,920
She should be back soon, right?

538
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,230
She'll be back tomorrow.

539
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:57,740
Maybe they will meet on the way.

540
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,060
Yes.

541
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,820
People here are simple and honest.

542
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,690
It's truly a paradise on earth.

543
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,580
The paradise in your heart

544
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:08,210
has low standards.

545
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:11,450
This is called seeing the essence
through the phenomenon.

546
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,120
Look how good their
neighborly relations are!

547
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,030
This proves that
the atmosphere here is very good.

548
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,720
And look at them,

549
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,220
they all live at a leisurely pace.

550
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,460
There's no struggle with the world.

551
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,930
Isn't it paradise?

552
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,070
- You…
- Let me go.

553
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,200
- What are you doing?
- Let me go!

554
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,510
- Don't be so wild.
- Take it out.

555
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,350
Let me go.

556
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,840
What's going on? What happened?

557
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,740
Let me go.

558
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,870
Let me go.

559
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:36,820
What's going on?

560
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,300
Wallet?

561
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,960
(Douya, Villager)

562
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,540
Isn't that my wallet?

563
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,300
How could you steal things?

564
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,450
Where are your parents?

565
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,020
I steal from you, so what?

566
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,900
You can't even part with
such a small amount of money.

567
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,130
You miser.

568
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,280
Douya,

569
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,930
why did you steal again?

570
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,240
Your dad passed away,

571
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,580
so no one can discipline you?

572
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,200
This child is so pitiful.

573
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,070
Her dad is gone.

574
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,540
Her mother has been bedridden for years.

575
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,310
- No one takes care of her.
- Yes, that's right.

576
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,440
The child has been stealing things

577
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,310
so that...

578
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,650
So that her mother can be treated.

579
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:08,170
- Yes.
- Yes.

580
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,350
Yes.

581
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,680
Guys...

582
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,020
To forgive others is to forgive yourself.

583
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,840
Let her go.

584
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,710
Take this money.

585
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:16,900
Use it to treat your mother's illness.

586
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,500
Ungrateful.

587
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,580
Will it cost you anything
to say thank you?

588
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:29,370
(You know this kind of personality is
annoying, right?)

589
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,890
Why are you looking at me?

590
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:35,410
Look how polite you've suddenly
become.

591
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:40,210
Sir, has this child always
been stealing things?

592
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:43,510
It's a long story.

593
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,350
Yes.

594
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,780
I run a small business.

595
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,340
I don't have any employees.

596
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,060
I'm not

597
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,540
very good at cooking,

598
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,060
but I hope you can enjoy your dinner today.

599
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,780
When my wife returns tomorrow,

600
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,780
(Tailai, Villager and the Inn Owner)
she'll make you our specialty, osmanthus fish.

601
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,100
Thank you, but it's not necessary.

602
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,450
We're only staying for one night.

603
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,990
We'll leave tomorrow.

604
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:16,290
Where are you all going?

605
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,380
We plan to go east.

606
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,650
We will go through the valley
to reach the outer regions.

607
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,060
You're going into the mountain?

608
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,100
What's wrong with that?

609
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,170
You may not know

610
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,130
that this mountain is inaccessible.

611
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,470
Leaving this town,

612
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:38,610
to the east lies the boundless Mitu Valley.

613
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,800
Once people go in there,

614
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,170
they never come out again.

615
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,500
Since you live near the mountain,

616
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,500
doesn't anyone

617
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,980
go there to hunt or gather herbs?

618
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,120
No.

619
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,290
We locals all know

620
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,150
that the Mitu Valley is an ominous place.

621
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:57,500
No one can find a way out
once they enter.

622
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,650
It'll also bring disaster to the family.

623
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,800
For example, Douya, the girl you met

624
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,150
at the door.

625
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:07,100
Months ago, her dad, driven by greed,

626
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,730
entered the Mitu Valley to dig for ginseng.

627
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,980
As a result, he never returned.

628
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,550
From then on,

629
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,980
Douya's mother's illness
got worse every day,

630
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:19,130
and Douya became a little thief.

631
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,760
Anyway,

632
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,960
people in our town

633
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,320
would never tempt fate

634
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,580
by looking for trouble.

635
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,770
Who told you that?

636
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,690
Celestial official Guo.

637
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,940
Celestial official Guo?

638
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:35,880
Exorcise evil spirits
and resolve disasters.

639
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,330
- Put the silver on the table.
- Thank you.

640
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,350
Who put it there?

641
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,730
Oh, you put it.

642
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,030
- It's not expensive.
- All right.

643
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,320
Give me one more.

644
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,550
A tael of silver each.

645
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,690
Hurry, go.

646
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,540
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

647
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,210
Is there more?

648
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,190
Yes.

649
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,500
Hurry! Come on!

650
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,670
This is the Living Immortal
the innkeeper mentioned,

651
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,590
with an extremely high cultivation level.

652
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,980
Thank you. I have it.

653
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,210
Take it and leave quickly. Next.

654
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,810
Here you are.

655
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,350
This is

656
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,540
a mosquito-repelling spell.

657
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,920
It looks suspicious.

658
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,800
Slow down.

659
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,550
This celestial official's
skills aren't that great,

660
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,440
but his ability to swindle money is
quite impressive.

661
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,760
(Stupid Tax.)

662
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,600
One tael of silver per sheet.

663
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,450
I want one.

664
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:24,650
- It's not expensive at all.
- Give me two.

665
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:25,480
Come, put the silver down.

666
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,030
- Here you are.
- Don't touch me.

667
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:27,870
Give me one.

668
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,610
I really don't understand.

669
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,320
He's such an obvious fraud.

670
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,440
Why do people here

671
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,450
still firmly believe in him

672
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:34,650
and call him the celestial official?

673
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,770
Look what he has on his table.

674
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,800
- You.
- Thank you.

675
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,640
Here you are.

676
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,250
Thank you, it's mine.

677
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,580
(Astronomical Bureau)
Is there more?

678
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,940
It's the badge of the Astronomical Bureau.

679
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,670
It seems that this person is
an Imperial Demon Catcher

680
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,100
registered with the court.

681
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,060
So the common people believed him

682
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,580
and called him the celestial official.

683
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,800
(He's registered.)

684
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,150
The people in the Astronomical Bureau are

685
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,860
becoming more and more incompetent.

686
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,500
In such a remote place,

687
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,150
where it's already difficult
for ordinary people

688
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,020
to make a living,

689
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,580
he's still swindling the people's money.

690
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:07,520
Imperial Capital, Astronomical Bureau,

691
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:08,870
Dowager Consort Zhao.

692
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,840
It's the Dowager Consort Zhao
who forced my dad

693
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,330
to pay tributes and bribes.

694
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,380
Let's have a look.

695
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,890
Finally, I got one.

696
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:18,950
- Thank you very much.
- That's great.

697
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,100
Friends,

698
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,500
(Guo Xiu, Imperial Demon Catcher)
you must be from another place.

699
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:29,420
You can buy one each.

700
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,810
Keep you safe when you go out.

701
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,650
Fellow practitioners.

702
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:42,690
I haven't seen fellow practitioners
for many years.

703
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,730
How should I address you?

704
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,420
My sister's surname is Mu.

705
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,770
My brother's surname is Liu.

706
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,630
You're a demon catcher,

707
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,680
so you should know these two names,
right?

708
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,940
Judging by your appearance,

709
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:55,940
age and demeanor,

710
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,800
are you

711
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,860
the renowned Young Master Fuyi?

712
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,980
I've heard a lot about you.
It's my honor to meet you.

713
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,650
The younger generation is truly impressive.

714
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,680
As for Mu,

715
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:12,210
is it the Mu Family
that was destroyed years ago?

716
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,170
Why do you speak so harshly?

717
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,070
Why is your face like that?

718
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:18,940
I'm asking you a question.

719
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,290
You said that the Mitu Valley brings
misfortune and disaster, did you?

720
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,610
I didn't say that.

721
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:27,150
That's what happened.

722
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,440
If you don't believe me,

723
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,400
you can go to the town

724
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,590
and ask around.

725
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,510
As long as a person enters

726
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,580
the Mitu Valley,

727
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,900
he won't come to a good end.

728
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,500
You're not thinking
of entering the valley,

729
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,020
are you?

730
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,100
Don't worry about it.

731
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,720
That place is

732
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,840
very dangerous.

733
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,210
You shouldn't go there.

734
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,640
Let's go.

735
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,630
For the sake of fellow practitioners,

736
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,110
I'm trying to persuade you.

737
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,590
You shouldn't be so self-righteous.

738
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,110
Young Master Fuyi, whatever happens,

739
00:38:59,110 --> 00:38:59,950
don't…

740
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,940
Boast and mystify things.

741
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,630
I think

742
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:10,060
this valley must have
an unspeakable secret.

743
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,460
So you think

744
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,750
he deliberately started the rumor

745
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,020
to stop people from entering the valley?

746
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,460
It's possible.

747
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:17,800
Let's sleep for the night

748
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,840
and enter the valley tomorrow.

749
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,960
If he is hiding something,

750
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,210
we'll find out tomorrow.
