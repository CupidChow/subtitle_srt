=Episode 18=

3
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,800
Stop it! This is enough!

4
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,920
- These are a lot!
- They're newly dried.

5
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,200
More than enough for 20 grandfathers!

6
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:54,300
Miaomiao,

7
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,620
wait!

8
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,350
Don't break the petals.

9
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,300
Easy.

10
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,740
Move! Move!

11
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,280
My Lord! My Lord!

12
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,520
- What's up?
- Miss Lin is outside.

13
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,500
She's here already?

14
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:05,510
Let's go!

15
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,950
Get the musicians ready!

16
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,510
- Come on. Let's go!
- Let's go!

17
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,480
Put it here.

18
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,780
Go, go!

19
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:16,840
Miaomiao,

20
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,860
no rush.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,330
It's still early.

22
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,030
Cuicui,

23
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,560
you seem strange.

24
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,410
Are you hiding something from me?

25
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,450
No, I'm not.

26
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,940
Look at you

27
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,450
lying through your teeth!

28
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,450
No, I'm not. I swear!

29
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,070
Mu Sheng didn't threaten to

30
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,100
turn me into shredded bamboo shoots.

31
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,810
Shredded bamboo shoots?

32
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,480
What is Ziqi doing?

33
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,400
Stop!

34
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,760
There's no surprise inside.

35
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,860
Let's go on shopping.

36
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,500
Surprise? Like what?

37
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,070
How did you know that?

38
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,500
You just told me.

39
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,000
It's too nice of him.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,350
He drove me away

41
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,450
to prepare a surprise for me.

42
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:08,270
Although you've figured it out,

43
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,620
you have to act surprised.

44
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:12,690
Otherwise,

45
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,140
Mu Sheng will be disappointed.

46
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,960
No problem.

47
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,000
I'll be more surprised than ever.

48
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,040
Come on. Let's go.

49
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,500
Music!

50
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,600
Start!

51
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,430
Miaomiao.

52
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:38,670
Miaomiao.

53
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,760
Your acting is so convincing!

54
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,900
I... I'm not acting.

55
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,040
Mu Sheng must've spent a fortune

56
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,460
just to tell you he likes you.

57
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,180
He what?

58
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,480
Come on.

59
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,080
I didn't sleep well

60
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,680
or freshen up or do my hair.

61
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,710
This isn't my best dress either.

62
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,870
You are perfect.

63
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,730
Go ahead.

64
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,200
Go.

65
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,530
So touching!

66
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,570
I love seeing such romance.

67
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,180
Zhao Ruoshi?

68
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,520
Higher, higher!

69
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,500
Up, up!

70
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,250
No, no!

71
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,910
Lower, lower!

72
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,180
Down, go down!

73
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,400
Go up. Up!

74
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,280
No, no!

75
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,360
Up! Head up, feet down.

76
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,290
Down, down!

77
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,320
Up, up. Go up!

78
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,700
Down... Up, up!

79
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:20,870
What's...?

80
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,290
What are you doing?

81
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,850
My Lord! My Lord!

82
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,490
Down, go down!

83
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,820
Are you alright?

84
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,630
Marquis?

85
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:55,970
What are you doing here?

86
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,660
Huh? What?

87
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,460
What are you doing here?

88
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:07,930
Stop it! Stop!

89
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,990
Stop.

90
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,680
Another one, another one!

91
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,520
Not this.

92
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,630
Come on!

93
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:17,310
Miss Lin,

94
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,200
I've kept this to myself for too long.

95
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,220
I have to let it out.

96
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,780
- You know, I...
- So...

97
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,220
It's you.

98
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,610
You prepared all these.

99
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,040
Yes.

100
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,100
I wasn't sure what you'd like,

101
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,950
so I...

102
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:36,790
Stop!

103
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,930
Enough!

104
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,720
Stop.

105
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,820
Stop playing it.

106
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,780
You don't like this at all?

107
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,170
Marquis.

108
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,700
Come with me.

109
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,670
Miao...

110
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,820
Wh...What are you doing here?

111
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,230
Uh,

112
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,100
what are you doing?

113
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,320
I...

114
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,850
What are you doing?

115
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,590
Oh no!

116
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,830
Bad news!

117
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,220
Come with me!

118
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,610
Sorry, Miss Lin.

119
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,050
I didn't mean to upset you.

120
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,560
No, I'm not.

121
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,590
Sorry,

122
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,430
I overreacted.

123
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,910
Please forgive me.

124
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,750
No need to apologize, Miss Lin.

125
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,560
It's my fault. Please don't be mad.

126
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,910
No, no, I'm not.

127
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,830
I wasn't prepared to see that.

128
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,930
It wasn't what I thought.

129
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,700
I'm not mad.

130
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,310
I... uh...

131
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,350
No man has ever done this to me.

132
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,970
It was too grand.

133
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,170
I found it a bit too much.

134
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,140
I'm glad you aren't mad.

135
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,610
I see you aren't into this style.

136
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,800
Miss Lin,

137
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,610
can you give me another chance?

138
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,120
I'll take you to a place

139
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,070
where we won't be disturbed.

140
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,000
It's going to be beautiful

141
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,950
and tranquil...

142
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,790
Sorry,

143
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,100
I can't do that.

144
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,240
What happened?

145
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,080
Uh...

146
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,580
Where's she?

147
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,410
She was right here.

148
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,600
Maybe she's in the back.

149
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,400
Come on.

150
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,530
Actually, I'm in love with someone.

151
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,160
You...

152
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,050
You are, really?

153
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,610
Did you also

154
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,360
fall for me at first sight?

155
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,200
No, I didn't.

156
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,540
I'm sorry,

157
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,650
Marquis.

158
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,700
You did all that for nothing.

159
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,220
Don't blame yourself.

160
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,940
You've found love.

161
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,890
I'm happy for you.

162
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,880
Oh,

163
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:53,940
here's something for you,

164
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,650
a wooden bracelet.

165
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,890
It's nothing expensive.

166
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,100
Keep it

167
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,420
as a memento.

168
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,130
What are they saying?

169
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,580
I can't hear it clearly.

170
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:15,450
I can't take it.

171
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,610
It's worthless.

172
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,860
Miss Lin,

173
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,370
I wish you two

174
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,700
forever happiness.

175
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,700
Hold on, please.

176
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,460
Marquis,

177
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,370
let's get married!

178
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,350
We've decided to

179
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,180
get married on the eighth.

180
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,720
His wedding with the Princess

181
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,800
was scheduled on that day.

182
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,280
Now he's marrying me. That's all.

183
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,250
That's all?

184
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,180
Do you know what you're saying?

185
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,580
I do.

186
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,710
I insist

187
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,060
that all of you stay

188
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,580
and attend our wedding.

189
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,190
Sister,

190
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,760
she...

191
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,550
she...

192
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,060
She's crazy!

193
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,120
Miaomiao,

194
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,130
do you really like Marquis?

195
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,610
Yes, of course.

196
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,490
Perhaps

197
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,730
this is better.

198
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,060
Better? How?

199
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,700
Are you crazy too, Sister?

200
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,060
It's so sudden.

201
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,970
We can't predict love.

202
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,130
It just happens

203
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,770
before we know it.

204
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,580
It only takes a moment to fall in love.

205
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,250
Who knows?

206
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,770
It makes sense.

207
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,610
Not at all!

208
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,270
Miss Lin, the carriage is outside.

209
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,770
His Lordship is waiting for you.

210
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:31,950
Coming.

211
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,480
Goodbye, Ziqi.

212
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,320
Miao...

213
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:37,830
Sister,

214
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,010
we just let her go?

215
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,340
She's from a prominent family.

216
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,250
She'll live a well-off life

217
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,610
in the Marquis Mansion.

218
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,890
It's better than drifting with us.

219
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,680
- She's out.
- She's out.

220
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,650
She'll become Mrs. Zhao.

221
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,970
- I heard
- It's her?

222
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,830
Marquis refused to marry

223
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,340
Princess Duanyang for her.

224
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,490
Are they judging me?

225
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,040
No.

226
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,820
They're envious of me.

227
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,970
Let's go.

228
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,120
Hold on!

229
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,320
- Come here.
- What are you doing?

230
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,160
Hey, you...

231
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,890
It's fine. Don't mind him.

232
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,490
What's going on?

233
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,370
Why did she go back?

234
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,580
What's happening?

235
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:35,550
Don't know.

236
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,420
What are you doing, Ziqi?

237
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,580
Are you brain-damaged?

238
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,340
Are you insane?

239
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:44,970
Or are you haunted?

240
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,940
I'm not insane or haunted!

241
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,420
Are you doing this

242
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,060
to make me mad?

243
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,490
Why would I make you mad?

244
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,650
Are you really going to marry that fool?

245
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,100
Yes.

246
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,580
And don't call him a fool!

247
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,440
Relax. I'm not haunted.

248
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,390
I'm fine.

249
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,130
See? I'm perfectly normal.

250
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,250
Fine. Check all you want.

251
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,540
Are you done?

252
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,370
Ruoshi is still waiting outside.

253
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,350
Hurry.

254
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,010
"Ruoshi"?

255
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,100
Are you on a first-name basis already?

256
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,750
We're getting married.

257
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,820
What else should I call him?

258
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,130
Enough. I am fine.

259
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,590
Who gave you that bracelet?

260
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,650
Ruoshi.

261
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,420
The sun and the moon

262
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:14,970
shall reveal all evil.

263
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,680
What are you doing?

264
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,790
What is wrong with you?

265
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,730
Don't break it!

266
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,820
What on earth is happening?

267
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,020
It's been a long while.

268
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,550
Ruoshi.

269
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,520
There she is.

270
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,850
Did he hurt you?

271
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,040
Don't worry.

272
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,060
Ziqi would never hurt me.

273
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:17,610
That's good.

274
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:18,820
Let's go.

275
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:35,830
Uh,

276
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,310
Miss Lin,

277
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,820
I feel as if I'm living in a dream.

278
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,300
Are you really going to marry me?

279
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:52,670
You...

280
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:53,830
Why are you here?

281
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,580
My sister's worried.

282
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,060
She sent me to escort you.

283
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,610
We... we don't need you.

284
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,490
I have tons of guards.

285
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,540
Wait, Ruoshi.

286
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,970
After thinking,

287
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,820
I want him to stay.

288
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,940
After all, he's like my family.

289
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,200
With him here,

290
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,770
I'll feel securer.

291
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,700
You're right.

292
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,870
On the wedding day,

293
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,630
he can carry you out.

294
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,470
Thanks.

295
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,120
My Lord,

296
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,420
where are we going?

297
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,130
Fangxia Pavilion in the south.

298
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,240
Yes.

299
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,580
Fangxia Pavilion?

300
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,460
What's that place for?

301
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,960
Their tailors should've come to

302
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,130
measure us for the wedding garments.

303
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,220
But the top masters

304
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,840
working here are

305
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,400
somewhat haughty.

306
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,710
Other than His Majesty,

307
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:58,220
all clients must book their time first.

308
00:16:58,830 --> 00:16:59,790
We came unbooked.

309
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,320
Let's see the ready-made clothes first.

310
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,160
It's fine.

311
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,010
Picking wedding garments now?

312
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,890
Isn't it too soon?

313
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,990
The sooner, the better.

314
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,750
I just checked the calendar.

315
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:12,540
Today is a really good day.

316
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,310
My Lord,

317
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,070
given Mrs. Zhao's figure,

318
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:22,020
she can pick from these wedding gowns

319
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,780
and try them on.

320
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,780
She is not Mrs. Zhao!

321
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,130
- She will be soon.
- You...

322
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,760
Ziqi,

323
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,030
can you help me pick?

324
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,540
Which one do you like?

325
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,850
I like the one in the center, too!

326
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,130
Please follow me.

327
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,280
I...

328
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,120
Ruoshi,

329
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,060
look. Is it beautiful?

330
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,170
What's wrong? Tell me.

331
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:05,820
It does look good,

332
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,100
but I think you look better.

333
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,440
I mean,

334
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,740
its style, tailoring, and design

335
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,850
could've been better.

336
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,400
Is it not good enough?

337
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,930
What can be better than this?

338
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,540
Do you have better ones?

339
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,370
Please wait a minute.

340
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:33,230
Show them Nimbus, the only piece

341
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,470
our top master made last month.

342
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,320
But he said

343
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,350
its beauty could only be

344
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,340
appreciated by those
from 1,000 years later.

345
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:44,340
It's too avant-garde now.

346
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,830
Marquis has a unique taste.

347
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,890
Just show him.

348
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,370
It is out of this world!

349
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:05,690
Oh my!

350
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,310
It's as beautiful

351
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,400
as you.

352
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,780
You deserve each other.

353
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,930
If you wear it,

354
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,690
you'll be a fairy.

355
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,930
A fairy?

356
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,280
Miaomiao,

357
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,690
are you going to wear that?

358
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,410
Miss Lin,

359
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,780
do you like it?

360
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,580
I do.

361
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,400
We're indeed like-minded.

362
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,680
Alright. We'll take it.

363
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,710
Where's the counter?

364
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,060
This way, please.

365
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,960
We'll alter it and deliver it

366
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,410
to your place tomorrow.

367
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,610
Are you out of your mind?

368
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,980
Do you really like it?

369
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:41,550
Yes.

370
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,390
You...

371
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,210
You're lying!

372
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,780
I'm not.

373
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,780
The wedding ceremony is important.

374
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,230
You know,

375
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,450
I like whatever

376
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,410
my love likes.

377
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,170
You call him...

378
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,370
your love?

379
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,820
Ever since we came to the capital,

380
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,980
my mood has been like a roller coaster.

381
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,500
Sometimes I'm over the moon.

382
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,500
Sometimes I hit rock bottom.

383
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,850
I didn't know why

384
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,760
until...

385
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,540
I met Ruoshi.

386
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:27,010

But in the meantime,

422
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,500
calling you "Miss Lin" is a bit strange.

423
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,940
What should I call you then?

424
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,540
Call me whatever you like.

425
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,580
Your name is Lin Yu.

426
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:10,940
How about I call you "Yu"?

427
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,620
Sure.

428
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,020
Or maybe "Miaomiao"?

429
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,700
I heard your friends such as Mu Ziqi

430
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,900
call you that.

431
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,420
"Miaomiao" sounds cute

432
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,420
and intimate.

433
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,460
I'll call you that.

434
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,460
Just call me Yu.

435
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,580
Why?

436
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:30,580
I'm used to that name.

437
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,220
Yu it is.

438
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,540
I found

439
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,780
that the Xingshan Hall was

440
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,900
set on fire by a great demon.

441
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,180
That demon was

442
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,020
formidable,

443
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,780
cunning,

444
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,540
but bodiless.

445
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,260
I think he could

446
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,900
only possess someone to show up.

447
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,220
He somehow lured a wizard,

448
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,740
Tao Ying, into working for him.

449
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,340
Tao took advantage
of Dowager Consort Zhao's dependence

450
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,100
on talismans and spells

451
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,620
to gain her trust.

452
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,580
It wasn't long

453
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,340
before she

454
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,180
firmly believed that evil-doer

455
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,620
with witchcraft.

456
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,860
But he was only that demon's puppet.

457
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,940
What was that demon up to?

458
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:41,780
I checked all the records
in the Astronomical Bureau

459
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,420
and found only a few clues.

460
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,580
They were enough to help me

461
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,460
put together the truth, though.

462
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,860
14 years ago,

463
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,340
Tao Ying talked

464
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,860
Dowager Consort Zhao into building

465
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,860
the Xingshan Hall for people's welfare.

466
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,740
But actually, she meant to use him

467
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,780
to gain His Majesty's favor

468
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,980
and climb up the ladder.

469
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:13,740
So he set up an evil formation.

470
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,180
And he made...

471
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,420
this drawing of that hall.

472
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,700
Life Suction Formation

473
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,820
is the evilest of all.

474
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,340
It sacrifices human lives

475
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,580
to gain supreme demonic power.

476
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,140
The more the sacrifices,

477
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,100
the greater the power.

478
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:54,900
If a demon uses this formation to kill

479
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,370
hundreds or even thousands of humans,

480
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,100
the demonic power generated

481
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,660
will be able to shake the world,

482
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:07,500
and that demon will be immortal.

483
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,820
Immortal?

484
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,360
Meaning it can't be killed?

485
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,620
Yes.

486
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,300
So someone must find

487
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,660
the core of the formation

488
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,700
and break it

489
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,460
before the formation is complete.

490
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,620
(Hutian Wonderland)

491
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,580
Life Suction Formation?

492
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,140
It...

493
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,900
It's rarely seen.

494
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:52,100
(Drawing of the Xingshan Hall)
And it's deeply hidden under the base.

495
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,140
The seniors at the Astronomical Bureau

496
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,200
didn't find it.

497
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,860
You had a glance and found it?

498
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,020
Carry on.

499
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,580
Back then,

500
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:07,540
Dowager Consort Zhao took Tao's advice.

501
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,620
She sent a girl she found somewhere

502
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:14,700
to pray in that hall as the Saintess.

503
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,020
Tao's hundreds of followers

504
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,460
also came.

505
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,500
That evil formation

506
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,620
almost worked that night.

507
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,100
Luckily, a top master

508
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,020
from a house of Demon Catchers

509
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,140
happened to be there

510
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,980
and destroyed

511
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,900
Tao and that demon's plot.

512
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,260
That top master was

513
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,780
your father, Mu Huaijiang.

514
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,200
Stop drinking and eat.

515
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,380
You go ahead.

516
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,380
I'll drink.

517
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,340
Your cup is full.

518
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,020
Don't drink too much.

519
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,180
I'm fine.

520
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,620
Eat up, Yu.

521
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,420
Here.

522
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:30,060
Stop, or you'll be too drunk to walk.

523
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,980
No way.

524
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,260
I can walk.

525
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,620

Go.

531
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,660
I'm happy!

532
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,700

533
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,620
Go! More liquor!

534
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,340
You can drink a lot and stay sober.

536

I'm excited!

537
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:02,100
- Miss Lin,
- Too excited!

538
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,340
normally, he isn't like this.

539
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,660
He can hold his liquor.

540
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,540
I'll get him some hangover soup.

541
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,580
You stay with him.

542
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,660
Thank you, Miss Lin.

543
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,540
No... No rush, Yu.

544
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,580
You shouldn't have let her go.

545
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,700
What were you thinking?

546
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,420
Be careful, Yu!

547
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,180
Who is it?

548
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,580
My Lord...!

549
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,620
Lu Jiu,

550
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,260
what happened?

551
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,580
Where's Ruoshi?

552
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,820
It... it hurts...!

553
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,340
- Zhao Ruoshi.
- Where am I?

554
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,100
What did you do to Miaomiao?

555
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,940
Who are you?

556
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,460
Where's Yu?

557
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,940
Why did she suddenly fall for you?

558
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,420
Tell me now.

559
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,820
I didn't do anything.

560
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,860
Let me go!

561
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,700
Yu...

562
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:23,860
Hands off!

563
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,420
Leave her alone

564
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,260
if you want to live.

565
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,860
She's my fiancée.

566
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,940
Why should I leave?

567
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,620
I'll kill you!

568
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,380
I won't let her go,

569
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,900
alive or dead!

570
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:20,940
Ziqi!

571
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,660
Ruoshi!

572
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:52,980
Yu...

573
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,140
Are you alright?

574
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,540
Can you hear me?

575
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,780
Wake up!

576
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,820
Miaomiao...

577
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,300
You...

578
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,460
Are you afraid of me?

579
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,660
You were

580
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,820
the only one

581
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,580
who wasn't afraid of the real me.

582
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,860
But now, you're scared.

583
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,340
I...

584
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,940
I'm not.

585
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,980
I'm not scared of you, Ziqi.

586
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,820
Liar!

587
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,860
I'm not, really.

588
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,500

Peiyu!

636
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,300
Sister!

637
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,580
Peiyu!

638
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:16,820
Sister!

639
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:17,860
Sister!

640
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,780
Help me, Sister!

641
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,460
- Peiyu!
- Sister!

642
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,340
Peiyu!

643
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,660
Peiyun,

644
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:44,060
has your hatred reduced?

645
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,020
No, never!

646
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,420
Peiyu,

647
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,100
eat up.

648
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,900
I brought you your favorite cakes.

649
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,820
They'll

650
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,180
rebuild the hall soon.

651
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,900
I can't come here to talk to you again.

652
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,900
I'm the worst sister!

653
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,020
I can't avenge your death!

654
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,220
Whose nightmare sounds

655
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:47,860
so bitter?

656
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,660
Trust me, Master.

657
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,220
I've waited

658
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,140
seven long years for revenge.

659
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,340
The wedding ceremony

660
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,900
will go ahead on the eighth

661
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,100
as you hoped.

662
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,820
You remind me of that person

663
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,740
I found over a decade ago.

664
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,300
He was also struggling in hatred,

665
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,900
willing to sacrifice himself

666
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:39,420
to avenge his loved ones' deaths.

667
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:44,220
My plan would've succeeded

668
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,540
if

669
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,860
that Demon Catcher hadn't interfered.

670
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,100
I was badly injured.

671
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,620
It's been over ten years. I'm still weak.

672
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,220
This time,

673
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,860
I will succeed,

674
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:01,660
and you'll get your revenge.

675
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,420
But Mu Yao

676
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,420
and Liu Fuyi are highly skilled.

677
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,540
They might ruin everything.

678
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,420
The Mu Family?

679
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,660
If they show up,

680
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,620
I'll settle the score with them!

681
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,420
(There's the hidden formation.)

682
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,100
(It seems familiar.)

683
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,580
(It's...)

684
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,340
(It's Father's power!)

685
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,100
(But why?)

686
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,500
(Why didn't he)

687
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:12,020
(kill that demon but seal him instead?)

(Xingshan Hall)

689
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,900
(Unless he couldn't)

690
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,220
