2
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,180
=Episode 31=

3
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:00,230
Sister Mu!

4
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,490
- Sister Mu!
- Sister!

5
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,270
- Sister Mu!
- Miaomiao!

6
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:08,990
It's a formation.

7
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,040
Sister Mu!

8
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:29,710
Miaomiao...

9
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,680
Sheng...

10
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,840
You came anyway.

11
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,070
Sister Mu,

12
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,480
why did you do this?

13
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:37,640
Didn't you say

14
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,430
you'd never leave us again?

15
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,480
Why did you come here alone?

16
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,480
It won't work.

17
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,400
This pillar holds the Demon Trap Tower.

18
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,950
Once it's broken,

19
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,400
the tower will collapse.

20
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,840
Stop wasting your energy.

21
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,950
You cannot break it.

22
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,400
Sister,

23
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,520
I can do it!

24
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,290
Ziqi,

25
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,370
wait.

26
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,630
She's not Sister Mu.

27
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,520
Resentful Woman!

28
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,960
Oh, Sheng,

29
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,590
you're as gullible as before.

30
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,670
Son,

31
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,280
I've finally woken up

32
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,030
after all these years.

33
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,130
(Queen of Demons Resentful Woman)
I miss you so much.

34
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,710
Don't listen to her, Ziqi.

35
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,710
She's the Resentful Woman.

36
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,320
Who's this young lady?

37
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,630
Is she

38
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,520
your love, Sheng?

39
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,310
Didn't I tell you to never fall in love

40
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,150
with anyone?

41
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,520
Son,

42
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,080
kill her now

43
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,030
and come to me.

44
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,910
She's woken up.

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,470
We can't let her get out.

46
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,310
Otherwise,

47
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,030
all will go out of control.

48
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,310
The origins have fallen.

49
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,590
The evil must die.

50
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,000
Activate the formation.

51
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,240
Form up!

52
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:20,910
Watch out!

53
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,640
I'm fine.

54
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,950
She can't bewitch me.

55
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,390
Without a body,

56
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,480
she can't do anything but talk.

57
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,750
That's all.

58
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,760
Look, Ziqi,

59
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,920
she's absorbing Sister Mu's life.

60
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,120
It won't take long

61
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,000
before she possesses Sister Mu's body.

62
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,510
We came right in time.

63
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,680
Isn't that my Tier 9 demon core?

64
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,400
Son,

65
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,870
you'll return it to me,

66
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:53,910
right?

67
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,200
Yes.

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,240
I'll return it to you

69
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,040
and use its power

70
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,630
to kill you!

71
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,120
Others can't kill you

72
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,830
because they don't know
how you became like this.

73
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,310
"Without her heart,
Mei'll be the Resentful Woman."

74
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,120
On the contrary,

75
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,600
once the Crystal Heart is fully restored

76
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:19,830
with flesh and blood...

77
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,040
My mother will come back to life,

78
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,950
while you and your evil soul will be

79
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,630
completely destroyed.

80
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,080
Why did you

81
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,750
take the hit for me?

82
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,750
Protect yourself first.

83
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,750
I know your inner core and power

84
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,240
are needed at the bottom of the tower.

85
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,040
They're the key to success.

86
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,320
How did you know that?

87
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,800
I heard what Mr. Wenxin

88
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,800
and you said outside just now.

89
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,150
I know

90
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,920
you meant to sacrifice yourself
behind our backs

91
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,390
to have him restore
the Crystal Heart, right?

92
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,560
Miaomiao,

93
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,790
- I...
- Ziqi, like I said,

94
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,070
you aren't alone anymore.

95
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,800
None of us is.

96
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,190
We have to trust each other

97
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,310
and work as a team

98
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,480
to be able to change the end.

99
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,640
The end?

100
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,920
I have a feeling

101
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,790
that things

102
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,240
shouldn't be like this now.

103
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,880
Miaomiao.

104
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,950
Although Mei owns unmatched power,

105
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,160
she's burdened with hopeless love.

106
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,680
Her heart is too fragile.

107
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,800
The power on the ninth floor is too strong.

108
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,480
Her heart will collapse soon.

109
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,110
So I'm

110
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,360
the Queen of Demons!

111
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,600
Enough!

112
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,800
You're not my mother

113
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,240
or the Queen of Demons!

114
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,310
Humans won't stop

115
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,600
killing demons,

116
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,510
while demons hate humans' guts.

117
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,920
All their hatred and malice are

118
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,160
bringing me infinite power.

119
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:40,000
You cannot defeat me!

120
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,110
- Sister!
- Sister Mu, no!

121
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,860
Resentful Woman! Stop!

122
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,200
Stop!

123
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,320
Stop!

124
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,980
Sister Mu!

125
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,430
I'm finally free.

126
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,070
Kneel to the Queen of Demons!

127
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,590
What are you doing?

128
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,360
What's going on?

129
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,440
What's happening?

130
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,380
What... what are you doing?

131
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,350
You...

132
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,350
Ziqi,

133
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,080
let's split up.

134
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,720
I go right.

135
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,440
You go left.

136
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,720
Ziqi, Ziqi! What's wrong?

137
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,150
Are you alright, Ziqi?

138
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,510
Old bamboo,

139
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,470
what have you done?

140
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,110
Hey!

141
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,990
You...

142
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,200
Wenxin,

143
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,510
I just connected all my roots

144
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,440
with the core of the formation,

145
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,150
making myself

146
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,240
part of it.

147
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,320
I took the hit

148
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:59,120
when you activated the formation.

149
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,030
Why did you do this?

150
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,000
What did you do to Ziqi?

151
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,600
You can't make me your pawn.

152
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,600
Never!

153
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,000
You've always been my pawn

154
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,120
and manipulated by me.

155
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,480
You just didn't know.

156
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Do you know how you ended up in the Mu's?

157
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,670
When Mu Huaijiang killed Mei

158
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,000
and woke me up,

159
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,720
you heard my calling.

160
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,910
Sheng...!

161
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,200
That

162
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,790
was you!

163
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,270
I lured you to the Mu's

164
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,390
to take shelter.

165
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,240
And I lured you

166
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,440
to see me

167
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,750
and remove

168
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,670
the last chain your mother cast on me.

169
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,080
I should give you a big reward.

170
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,720
You stayed with Mu Yao

171
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,000
and protected me for seven years.

172
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,000
Now, I've finally woken up.

173
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,270
You've been under my control the whole time.

174
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,960
You've been the best pawn

175
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,720
in my hand.

176
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,840
The end has been written.

177
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,080
All of you will die!

178
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,090
Why did you do that?

179
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,150
I wanted you to

180
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:26,650
give yourself

181
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,320
another chance.

182
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,320
Me?

183
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm 1,000 years old.

184
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,510
I have a bad memory,

185
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,630
but I've never been wrong about people.

186
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,150
You believe humans and demons

187
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,910
can love each other,

188
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,000
have children together,

189
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,910
and coexist peacefully.

190
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:04,000
If you believe that miracle will happen,

191
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,790
why not

192
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,790
believe in those children?

193
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,350
Hey!

194
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,960
Hey!

195
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,040
You...

196
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,750
It's Mr. Wenxin!

197
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,240
He's stabilized the tower for us.

198
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,320
That old fart!

199
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,600
Too late!

200
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,000
Listen, children,

201
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,670
you must kill her

202
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,120
in the tower!

203
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,120
You're wrong!

204
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,510
Ziqi isn't your pawn.

205
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,080
When you meant to kill the Mus,

206
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,390
you tried to

207
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,510
possess Ziqi's body

208
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,120
but failed.

209
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,630
You could only

210
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,750
hide in Sister Mu's body to heal yourself.

211
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,390
12 years ago,

212
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,870
you already lost once.

213
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,320
Apocal Power?

214
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,080
Who exactly are you?

215
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,510
That's not your concern!

216
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,440
As long as I'm here,

217
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,360
you cannot get out

218
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,630
or lay a finger on anyone

219
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,720
in this world!

220
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,120
Kill her!

221
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,030
Mu Sheng, kill her now!

222
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,280
Ziqi...

223
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,720
I'm the Queen of Demons.

224
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,080
All demons shall obey me

225
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,080
and kill everyone in my way.

226
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:02,870
Mu Sheng,

227
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,200
I'm ordering you to kill her.

228
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,280
No way.

229
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,510
Ziqi would never hurt me.

230
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:15,870
Ziqi...

231
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:18,000
it's me.

232
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:23,920
I'm Miaomiao...

233
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,320
Miaomiao,

234
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,350
get out of here now.

235
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:28,640
I can't hold it for long!

236
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,030
- Ziqi...
- Miaomiao...

237
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,680
There's demon blood in you.

238
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,000
Why aren't you obeying me?

239
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,240
You can't tame me.

240
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,750
Demons have emotions.

241
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,110
They know love and hatred.

242
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,750
They have their own personalities.

243
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,830
But you only force others to obey you.

244
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,920
You cannot be the Queen of Demons!

245
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,950
Miaomiao!

246
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:12,820
Ziqi!

247
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,320
Ziqi...

248
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,350
Miaomiao...

249
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,030

you'll lose a chunk of your memory

385
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,580
of the real world.

386
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,590
Eventually, it'll all be gone.

387
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,480
All gone?

388
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,510
At that point,

389
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,440
you're unlikely to complete your mission.

390
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,070
Once you fail,

391
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,880
you can never return to the real world.

392
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,440
Please confirm

393
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,960
if you'll unlock the Apocal Power.

394
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,000
Please confirm

395
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,480
if you'll unlock the Apocal Power.

396
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,230
Please confirm

397
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,600
if you'll unlock the Apocal Power.

398
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,880
Please confirm

399
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,510
if you'll unlock the Apocal Power.

400
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,400
No reply detected.

401
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:59,280
Sending you back to Catching Demons.

402
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,280
Unlock it.

403
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,480
Whatever it takes,

404
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,830
I have to save them all.

405
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,350
So I've forgotten

406
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,310
about myself.

407
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,550
The pass back to reality

408
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,960
has been unlocked.

409
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,920
Please confirm it now.

410
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,720
No.

411
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,680
This can't be the end.

412
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,760
System,

413
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,680
reset it.

414
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,590
I'll rewrite the end.

415
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,720
It can't end like this!

416
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,640
The five of us

417
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,240
live and die together.

418
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,790
Ziqi can't die.

419
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,200
No one will die.

420
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,440
Reset it now!

421
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,550
I'll rewrite the end!

422
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,790
Newbie Protection has ended.

423
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,660
Request denied.

424
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,590
Characters Mu Sheng, Mu Yao, and Liu Fuyi

425
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,630
are dead.

426
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,680
In Catching Demons,

427
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:24,130
only the Apocal Power

428
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:25,500
can revive characters.

429
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,900
Apocal Power...

430
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,830
Warning.

431
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,680
You're running out of your Apocal Power.

432
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,200
If you keep using it,

433
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:39,680
you'll lose all your memory of reality.

434
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,160
This is your last warning.

435
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,720
Catching Demons is a parallel universe

436
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,160
based on a novel.

437
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:50,440
Please think carefully

438
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,550
if you'll give up your achievement

439
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,310
and the chance to return to reality

440
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,550
for virtual characters.

441
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,680
Ziqi is real.

442
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,510
This world is also real.

443
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,160
I want all of them back!

444
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:55,670
Miaomiao?

445
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:58,430
Miaomiao!

446
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,920
Are you alright? Are you injured?

447
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,430
I'm fine.

448
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,310
Thanks to you.

449
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,200
Sheng,

450
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,180
let's go find Sister Mu and Brother Liu.

451
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,750
You aren't Miaomiao.

452
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,720
Who are you?

453
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,200
I'm your wife, Lin Yu.

454
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,800
You don't recognize me?

455
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,040
Where's Miaomiao?

456
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,030
Where is she?

457
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,480
Wait.

458
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,270
Just now, I got injured,

459
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,480
and

460
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,320
I died.

461
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,400
What did Miaomiao do?

462
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,800
Sheng,

463
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,750
isn't this a happy ending?

464
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,160
The Resentful Woman is gone.

465
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,270
Everyone is back alive.

466
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,640
It's good.

467
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,160
Our future will be even better.

468
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,320
No.

469
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,550
I reject this end!

470
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,310
What are you doing?

471
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,940
(Lanyin Illusion Space)

472
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:53,350
You aren't Miaomiao

473
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,750
or Lin Yu.

474
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,560
Who exactly are you?

475
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,910
You're the Guardian Master
from 900 years ago,

476
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:08,670
Mu Qingshi.

477
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,590
Yes, it's me.

478
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,200
Where am I?

479
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,880
Lanyin Illusion Space,

480
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,350
where everything started.

481
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,110
Why am I here?

482
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,350
Because she had been here

483
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:28,680
before she disappeared.

484
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,520
Miaomiao...

485
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:38,480
She knew what I would do

486
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,550
and asked you to stop me.

487
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:42,910
No.

488
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,440
She wanted me to help you

489
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,830
bring her back.

490
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:57,710
Are you really going to

491
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,640
sacrifice yourself

492
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,590
for him and his world?

493
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,390
No.

494
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,830
I'm going to write

495
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,510
a happy ending for our story,

496
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,480
where

497
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,430
those in love

498
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,510
will stick together.

499
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:18,550
No one will die for others.

500
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,800
Ziqi told me

501
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,070
the Heavenly Demon Catcher's supreme power

502
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,070
could unlock the illusion space

503
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,840
and go back in time.

504
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,000
After I save his life,

505
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,110
he'll return to the past

506
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,550
to bring me back.

507
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:37,990
But

508
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,320
the end of this world

509
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,360
has been written.

510
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,400
Everyone is a lone wolf.

511
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,130
There are secrets and fear among them.

512
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,360
They hide their true feelings.

513
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,710
In the end, everything falls apart.

514
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,550
Will it be better

515
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,630
if you do it all over again?

516
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:04,870
I'm sure

517
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:06,590
it will.

518
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:09,230
No matter how many times I disappear,

519
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:12,590
Ziqi will bring me back.

520
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,070
I,

521
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,670
Mu Ziqi, swear to the heavens,

522
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,920
that if I lose you somehow,

523
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,410
I'll go back to find you.

524
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,480
No matter how far it is,

525
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,320
no matter how hard it is,

526
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,030
I will bring you back.

527
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,070
Master Mu,

528
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,590
I have a question.

529
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,880
Why do I look exactly like you?

530
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,440
Why do I own your power?

531
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,200
In a way,

532
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,670
I'm you

533
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,110
and not you.

534
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,070
Many years ago,

535
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,920
you already saved him

536
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,280
and his world once.

537
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,080
You didn't know

538
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,820
you would do that, though.

539
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,740
But this time,

540
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:06,850
you choose to do the same thing.

541
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,110
I'll do it a million times

542
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:15,000

You've finally found me.

573

Let's go back to the very beginning.

574
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:23,910
This time,

Although Mei owns unmatched power,

577
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,510
she's burdened with hopeless love.

578
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,760
Her heart is too fragile.

579
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:59,070
The power on the ninth floor is too strong.

580
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:02,030
Her heart will collapse soon.

581
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:05,070
So I'm the Queen of Demons!

582
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,440
