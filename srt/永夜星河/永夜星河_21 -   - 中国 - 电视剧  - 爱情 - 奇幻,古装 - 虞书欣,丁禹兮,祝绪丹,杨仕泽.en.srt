=Love Game in Eastern Fantasy=

2
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,180
=Episode 21=

3
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:57,700
(Xingshan Hall)

4
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,300
(Zhao Qinru, 15 Years Ago)

5
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,900
(Xingshan Hall)

6
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,710
The construction took five years

7
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,280
and enormous amounts.

8
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,000
The hall is finally complete today.

9
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,230
It's all for the Blessing Ceremony.

10
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,590
I've done my utmost.

11
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,310
I can swear to the heavens.

12
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,950
After the ceremony,

13
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,280
you'll top the harem

14
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,000
as you wish.

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,150
And your son, the Seventh Prince,

16
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,680
will become the Crown Prince.

17
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,840
The future of the Zhao Family

18
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,400
lies on you, Master Tao.

19
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:56,990
But

20
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,760
it's just a ceremony.

21
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,950
Can it achieve

22
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,230
such ambitious goals?

23
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:04,910
"Just"?

24
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,200
The ceremony

25
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,030
needs one last

26
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,000
and the most vital sacrifice.

27
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,000
I wonder

28
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,400
if you can provide it.

29
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,030
What is it?

30
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,560
I'll give you anything for my son

31
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,280
to become the Crown Prince,

32
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,000
including my life.

33
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,360
You can take it.

34
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,800
No, Your Highness.

35
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,960
I need your daughter,

36
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,310
Princess Duanyang.

37
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,870
My daughter?

38
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,430
Slow down, Your Highness!

39
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,630
Be careful!

40
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,750
Careful now.

41
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,150
She was born on an auspicious day.

42
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,150
Her natal chart matches
the formation perfectly.

43
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,030
She's most suitable to be the Saintess.

44
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,120
I can't do that!

45
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,840
I can't sacrifice my daughter!

46
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,150
I can't!

47
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,400
The formation won't take her life.

48
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,470
It'll transfer

49
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,630
her lifespan and fortune

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,360
all to your son.

51
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,280
She's born royal, noble,

52
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,630
lucky and long-living.

53
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,780
(Xingshan Hall)
With her in the core of the formation,

54
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,680
your son will be

55
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,710
the Crown Prince for sure.

56
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,310
I can't let her go!

57
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,430
Your Highness,

58
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,120
let me remind you.

59
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,710
If the Empress's son ascends the throne,

60
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,750
what will happen

61
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:40,520
to your son,

62
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,910
his former biggest rival?

63
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,240
What about the long-lasting

64
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,430
and prominent Zhao Family?

65
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,060
(Xingshan Hall)

66
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,430
What will happen to Min?

67
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,710
She'll lead a miserable life.

68
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,080
She can't get anything she wants,

69
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:07,870
or she'll lose everything eventually.

70
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,310
She'll never be happy.

71
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,040
Slow down, Your Highness!

72
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,590
Be careful.

73
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,240
Slow down.

74
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,440
Slow down.

75
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,360
Careful now.

76
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:25,910
Mother.

77
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,160
Are you crying, Mother?

78
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,270
Min.

79
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,950
If I want you to be

80
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,830
the Saintess for the Blessing Ceremony,

81
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,240
will you do it?

82
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,400
What's a Saintess?

83
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,800
If I'm the Saintess,

84
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,360
will you get what you want

85
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,750
and stop crying?

86
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,610
If so, I'll do it.

87
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,900
I'll be the Saintess, Mother.

88
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,640
Min,

89
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,430
I'll forever adore you and love you.

90
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,870
I'll give you anything you want.

91
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,360
You'll be the most-loved princess.

92
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,860
You're the best, Mother.

93
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,470
Your Highness,

94
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,670
the Princess went in

95
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,400
over an hour ago!

96
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,160
The wedding is about to begin!

97
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,670
Useless!

98
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,390
All of you wait here.

99
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,720
I'll bring her back.

100
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,880
Chief!

101
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,590
Chief!

102
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,000
Keep your voice down!

103
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,830
Chief, Dowager Consort Zhao is here.

104
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,390
Why did she come?

105
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,680
It seems the key to solving

106
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,640
this complicated puzzle is here.

107
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,150
Sister Mu.

108
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,480
(However wild that demon is...)

109
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,190
(As long as we're back together...)

110
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,310
(Right now, in that hall...)

111
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,920
(We will solve it!)

112
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,110
(Yes!)

113
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:34,300
(Xingshan Hall)

114
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,040
You look vigorous, General Li.

115
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,400
Chancellor,

116
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,510
please look after my son
at the Imperial College.

117
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,920
Sure, sure.

118
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,000
- Look at this fabric.
- Mr. Liu,

119
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,800
- It's of top quality.
- I'll have to rely on you.

120
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,510
I have some more at home.

121
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,360
If you like it,

122
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,120
- I'll have it sent to your place.
- No problem.

123
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,750
Thank you.

124
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:20,700
(Xingshan Hall)

125
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,840
Min!

126
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,630
Go back with me.

127
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,680
I won't.

128
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,670
It's overdue for 15 years.

129
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,600
It has to be done today.

130
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,200
What are you saying?

131
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,800
Let's go.

132
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,670
What am I saying?

133
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,960
Don't you know the best, Mother?

134
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,440
Lu Jiu,

135
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,030
Princess Duanyang is possessed.

136
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,390
Take her away now.

137
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,390
Lu Jiu!

138
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,000
Are you defying me?

139
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,510
Let's go!

140
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,630
Ruoshi...!

141
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,190
Min...!

142
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,360
It's time.

143
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,080
Tao Ying?

144
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,160
It's you!

145
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,720
You're manipulating her
with your witchcraft, aren't you?

146
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,240
You won't succeed!

147
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,360
(Incubus Demon)
Tao Ying died ten years ago.

148
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,960
Your Highness,

149
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,670
did Mu Huaijiang not tell you

150
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,840
that Tao Ying was a mere puppet?

151
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,110
I am

152
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:21,120
the mastermind behind everything.

153
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,840
Demon! Demon!

154
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,080
Guards!

155
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,910
Catch that demon!

156
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,960
Help! Catch that demon!

157
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,790
Finally, this day has come.

158
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,910
Everyone in this hall

159
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,960
will die a worthy death today.

160
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,320
Chief,

161
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,410
the Life Suction Formation

162
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,550
is about to be activated.

163
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,120
Stand by. Get ready to assist.

164
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,200
Stick to Cultivator Mu's plan.

165
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,960
Dowager Consort Zhao is there, too.

166
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,550
If something happens to her,

167
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,600
His Majesty will punish us...

168
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,910
Cultivator Mu has told me

169
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,550
about the situation
with a Message Charm.

170
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,840
Relax. It's fine.

171
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:19,990
Chief,

172
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,080
the stakes are high.

173
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,120
Do you really believe
in those civilians?

174
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,750
Absolutely.

175
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,680
You evil demon.

176
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,240
Do you think your plan is working?

177
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,840
Look around.

178
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,110
Are those guests

179
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,550
in panic?

180
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,440
You look vigorous, General Li.

181
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,440
Chancellor,

182
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,840
please look after my son
at the Imperial College.

183
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,480
Sure, sure.

184
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,360
- Look at this fabric.
- Mr. Liu,

185
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,150
- It's of top quality.
- I'll have to rely on you.

186
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,840
I have some more at home.

187
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,750
- If you like it,
- Sure, sure.

188
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,270
I'll have it sent to your place.

189
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,320
Thank you.

190
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,680
Look,

191
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,560
your plan failed.

192
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,550
To gain immortality

193
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,550
with this formation,

194
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,000
you'll need hundreds of lives.

195
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,360
But now other than us

196
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,870
and Dowager Consort Zhao,

197
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,390
only the bride and the groom are here.

198
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,790
Who are you?

199
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,630
I always tell the demons

200
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,630
who are going to kill them.

201
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,160
I'm a Mu from Huainan,

202
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:56,710
Mu Yao.

203
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,000
One of the Mu Family?

204
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,630
15 years ago,

205
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,670
Mu Huaijiang ruined my plan!

206
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,910
Now, you!

207
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,840
At first, I thought

208
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,270
it was the powerful Resentful Woman.

209
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:09,910
Turns out,

210
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,510
you're only a Tier 4 Incubus Demon.

211
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,690
Making such an elaborate plan

212
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,550
to catch you is a complete waste.

213
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,550
But that's fine.

214
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,720
It's worth it for the safety

215
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,000
of the people.

216
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,240
The formation has been activated.

217
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,000
Your demon core will solidify

218
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,320
and appear at the core of the formation.

219
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,390
It'll be so fragile

220
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,510
that a little child

221
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,080
can easily break it.

222
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,040
Here it comes.

223
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,480
The dark energy is...

224
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,680
Resentment.

225
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,040
15 years ago,

226
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,840
over 400 people were killed here.

227
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,270
Lingering resentment, obsession, hatred

228
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,440
and other painful

229
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,510
and twisted feelings

230
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,870
can be forged in the demon core

231
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,030
to boost demonic power.

232
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,360
That explains it.

233
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,440
With such energy,

234
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,510
his demon core is unbreakable.

235
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,480
It's a pity that the pain
of those people's tragic deaths

236
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,000
is now fueling his evildoing.

237
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,670
Demon Catchers,

238
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,000
you've underestimated me.

239
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,120
Even if I can't reach immortality today,

240
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,750
you can't do anything to me,

241
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,240
but you'll

242
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,000
all die here!

243
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,550
How beautiful.

244
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:04,710
Your Highness,

245
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,040
where are we?

246
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,030
I... I don't know.

247
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,390
Why are you asking me?

248
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,600
Of course you know.

249
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,230
We're

250
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,240
in your dream.

251
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,510
Nonsense!

252
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:16,750
A Tier 7 Incubus Demon

253
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,150
can create a nightmare

254
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,280
and trap people inside forever.

255
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,000
This one is merely Tier 4.

256
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,920
Normally, he can't do that.

257
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,400
But with the strong resentment

258
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,480
in his demon core,

259
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,480
he's as powerful as a Tier 7 Incubus Demon.

260
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,840
Resentment

261
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,550
flows to its source.

262
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,110
Dowager Consort Zhao,

263
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,720
we are in your nightmare.

264
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,440
Mother,

265
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,630
this place is so beautiful and peaceful.

266
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,600
Why is it your nightmare?

267
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,750
Where exactly are we?

268
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,630
I don't know.

269
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,030
Stop asking me!

270
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,000
I know nothing about it.

271
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:51,910
A perfect habitat for demons

272
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,150
in such a remote place.

273
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,630
This is

274
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:55,840
the Qilin Mountain.

275
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,510
The Qilin Mountain?

276
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,960
Are we in

277
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,320
the Qilin Mountain?

278
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,350
Mother,

279
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,910
isn't that you from years ago?

280
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,150
Level this evil mountain

281
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,840
with ten mountain talismans.

282
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:50,000
Let no demons go.

283
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,590
Yes.

284
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,030
Ten mountain talismans?

285
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,070
Why?

286
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,550
It's a demon lair.

287
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,790
Do I need a reason to kill demons?

288
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,270
They were produced by natural energy.

289
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,030
They never left here or did evil.

290
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,310
Demons are like beasts.

291
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,510
I'm a consort.

292
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,440
I don't need to explain it to you!

293
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,310
I meant to protect the people

294
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,800
before it was too late.

295
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:01,910
Liar!

296
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,110
That's

297
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,960
the Qingyi Marquis Mansion.

298
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,280
It's the one

299
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,720
from over ten years ago.

300
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,750
This is

301
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,350
her second nightmare.

302
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,550
Father!

303
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:44,160
Wake up, Father!

304
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,110
Take your young master away.

305
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,440
- Father!
- Yes.

306
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:49,920
Father!

307
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,000
Let's go, Young Master.

308
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,350
Please wake up!

309
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,440
You may leave.

310
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,790
Father!

311
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,630
Qinghuan.

312
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,400
Sister...

313
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,320
this is probably my last night.

314
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,590
No.

315
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,720
You're still young.

316
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,510
You'll recover soon.

317
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,440
Over the years,

318
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,590
I've been doing what you said.

319
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,270
I've never tried

320
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,920
to find out the connection

321
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,200
between me and the Qilin Mountain,

322
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,480
or why I don't remember

323
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,590
about my trip,

324
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,270
or what happened to me.

325
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,210
But now

326
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,470
I'm dying.

327
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,440
I have one last wish.

328
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,640
Tell me,

329
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,310
was I in love with someone,

330
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,430
even if...

331
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,510
even if she was a demon?

332
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,160
Why are you asking that

333
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,200
at this point?

334
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,800
Sister...

335
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,400
please

336
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,030
tell me.

337
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,720
Why do I always feel

338
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,110
there's a hole in my heart?

339
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,480
Did I lose someone I loved?

340
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,760
Sister...

341
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,720
You're the Seventh Prince's uncle

342
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,000
and the Master of the Zhao Family.

343
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,590
You're at the top of the pyramid.

344
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,160
You aren't involved with any demon

345
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,880
whatsoever.

346
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,560
Qinghuan!

347
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,280
Qinghuan!

348
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,000
Qinghuan!

349
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,440
Qinghuan!

350
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,830
Qinghuan!

351
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,510
Qinghuan!

352
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,640
Qinghuan!

353
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,270
Qinghuan!

354
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,270
So

355
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,350
the late Marquis was away
for a long time

356
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,880
before getting married

357
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,790
because he fell in love with a demon

358
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,110
at the Qilin Mountain.

359
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,370
And you

360
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,820
covered it up at all costs

361
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,350
for the Zhao Family's honor

362
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,200
and for fear that your son

363
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,200
couldn't become the Crown Prince,

364
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,630
right?

365
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,400
I did all that for you.

366
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,720
Min,

367
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,720
Ruoshi,

368
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,480
I had to protect the Zhao Family.

369
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,810
As the new Master,

370
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,730
Qinghuan was bewitched

371
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,030
by a demon.

372
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,720
Hadn't I made that move,

373
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,940
he would've ruined everything.

374
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,750
"That move"?

375
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,640
Do you mean the Worry-Free Curse?

376
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,920
You killed so many innocent lives,

377
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,200
but never did you know

378
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,590
your brother would

379
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,350
also die because of you.

380
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:19,950
No!

381
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,270
It was that demon!

382
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,160
That demon killed him!

383
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,120
It had nothing to do with me!

384
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,190
The Worry-Free Curse

385
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,270
can erase one's memory,

386
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,920
but not one's love or hatred.

387
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,720
The late Marquis died with regrets

388
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,280
because of you.

389
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,000
It became your nightmare

390
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,110
because even when he was dying,

391
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,790
you, who he saw as his intimate sister,

392
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,400
were still lying to him.

393
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,310
I was his sister

394
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,400
and he was my younger brother.

395
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,720
We were siblings.

396
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,200
We grew up together.

397
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,160
I'd never harm him!

398
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,200
I did what I did for his sake!

399
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,430
I'm a sister, too.

400
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,670
I also have a younger brother.

401
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,000
Zhao Qinru,

402
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,400
you don't know what siblings are for.

403
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,150
Mu Yao,

404
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,510
easy for you to say.

405
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,660
The Mu Family is widely respected

406
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,680
as all of you are Demon Catchers.

407
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,270
Were your brother being with a demon,

408
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:11,460
could you still remain untroubled

409
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,590
and lenient?

410
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,960
Could you do that?

411
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,740
(Xingshan Hall)

412
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,200
The Xingshan Hall?

413
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,960
It's the one in her dream.

414
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,280
Finally,

415
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,830
your dream has led us here.

416
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,580
(Xingshan Hall)

417
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,740
(Xingshan Hall)

418
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,720
Is that me in childhood?

419
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:07,950
Your Highness,

420
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,310
we followed your order

421
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,830
and finally found this civilian girl,

422
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,320
Yu.

423
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:16,830
Her birthday and natal chart
are similar to the Princess's.

424
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:18,870
Very well.

425
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,920
Her figure and looks match Min's, too.

426
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,350
The Blessing Ceremony is tomorrow.

427
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,240
Use her to see how it goes.

428
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,270
We've been warned of the importance.

429
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,240
We shall tread carefully.

430
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,400
The Saintess

431
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,640
should be pious for the prayer
to be answered.

432
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,400
Do you want to be the Saintess?

433
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,430
Yes.

434
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,640
I really do.

435
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,240
I want to be the Saintess,

436
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,720
so Your Highness will give us money

437
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,240
to pay for my sister's treatment.

438
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,480
Thank you, Your Highness.

439
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,590
I think I know who she is.

440
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,480
I once saw

441
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,720
that rattle-drum.

442
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,000
Peiyun

443
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,400
carried it with her all the time.

444
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:21,110
She said it was left by her sister,
Peiyu.

445
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,310
So this girl is her sister, Peiyu!

446
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,720
Peiyun?

447
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:29,750
She...

448
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,390
Did she

449
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,030
come to the palace

450
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,270
and work for Min and me,

451
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,960
all for...

452
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,270
for revenge?

453
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,480
You're vicious,

454
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,030
but not too dumb.

455
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,000
I remember it.

456
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,200
You also wanted me to be the Saintess.

457
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,000
Mother,

458
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:59,240
did you mean to sacrifice me too?

459
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,720
No!

460
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,510
I love you the most!

461
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,750
You know that, Min.

462
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,880
I'd never sacrifice you.

463
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,720
So you sacrificed another girl?

464
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,030
She was from a poor family.

465
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,550
I paid her family

466
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,830
way more than selling 100 girls.

467
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:14,790
In your eyes,

468
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,400
demons are mere nothing.

469
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,150
So are humans,

470
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,520
I guess.

471
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,960
- I...
- You used another girl

472
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,270
instead of your daughter
to be the Saintess.

473
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,240
Did you already know

474
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,550
there'd be a fire

475
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,200
that'd kill everyone

476
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,550
at the Blessing Ceremony?

477
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,680
I built this hall

478
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,790
to pray for the people's welfare

479
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,640
and well-being!

480
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,750
That wizard Tao Ying

481
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,310
colluded with that demon

482
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,880
and fooled me.

483
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,880
I knew nothing about their plot, really!

484
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,840
At this point,

485
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,110
you're still defending yourself

486
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,310
as if you've done evil

487
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,420
for the right cause

488
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,280
and it's others' fault.

489
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,350
It is their fault!

490
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:53,270
I didn't know anything. I swear!

491
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,350
I didn't do it.

492
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,590
I didn't know.

493
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,680
Stop asking me!

494
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,110
They lied to me.

495
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,010
I didn't know...

496
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,520
I swear I knew nothing at all!

497
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,320
Mother,

498
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,110
are you hearing it?

499
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,830
This is the scene after the fire.

500
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:22,950
Your Highness,

501
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,350
15 years ago,

502
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,750
over 400 people came for the ceremony.

503
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:27,870
No one survived

504
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,760
except you.

505
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:29,650
Why?

506
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,590
That was an accident.

507
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,030
The court concluded the case.

508
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,030
An unfortunate accident.

509
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,200
You keep lying to us.

510
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,760
20 years ago,

511
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:46,000
to break up your brother and his love,

512
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:49,000
you had the Astronomical Bureau
level the Qilin Mountain.

513
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,790
I've checked Tao Ying out.

514
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,430
He and his daughter

515
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,070
had been living in seclusion there

516
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,720
until you gave that order,

517
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,000
causing his daughter

518
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,590
to be killed in that catastrophe.

519
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,790
That blood-stained wooden doll

520
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,400
was left

521
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,790
by her.

522
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:08,790
Tao Ying wasn't a demon.

523
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,160
He and the Incubus Demon who used him

524
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,270
came to you for revenge.

525
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,160
You did evil

526
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,390
for your selfish desires.

527
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,720
To cover that up,

528
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,310
you did it again,

529
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,510
leading you to a vicious circle,

530
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:22,880
the depths of vice,

531
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,110
and eventually, the massacre by fire.

532
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,430
Zhao Qinru,

533
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:29,030
do you think you can atone for your sins

534
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,000
simply by playing a philanthropist?

535
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,160
If you don't tell the truth,

536
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,750
we'll forever be trapped in the nightmare.

537
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,720
Resentment is a personal feeling.

538
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,030
It should've left with that person.

539
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,350
But now it's being used
by the Incubus Demon.

540
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,790
Only if you confess

541
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,490
can we break out.

542
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,680
Otherwise,

543
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,350
your daughter,

544
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,380
your nephew

545
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,310
and even you

546
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,480
will all die here.

547
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,080
Chief,

548
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,240
the formation has been running
for over a quarter.

549
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,160
Cultivator Mu and the others...

550
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,680
I think they're acting as planned,

551
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,270
using themselves as bait

552
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,640
to be lured into
the Incubus Demon's Boundless Nightmare.

553
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,480
A Tier 7 Incubus Demon's
Boundless Nightmare?

554
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,760
If they're trapped inside

555
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,000
for an hour,

556
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,560
they won't be able to get out.

557
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,110
Don't I know what?

558
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,000
They're well aware of it, too.

559
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,680
And they have a solution.

560
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,270
Make Dowager Consort Zhao confess.

561
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:37,590
I've done nothing wrong.

562
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,750
Not before, not now, not ever!

563
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,590
You're setting them off.

564
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,080
Watch out, Your Highness!

565
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,000
Ruoshi!

566
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,720
Aren't we in a dream?

567
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,270
How come they can hurt us?

568
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,590
The dream isn't real,

569
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,750
but the victims' resentment is.

570
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,590
Be careful, everyone!

571
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,240
We're in the Xingshan Hall

572
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,830
in the dream and reality.

573
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,110
They've overlapped,

574
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,400
so their resentment has sneaked in.

575
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,440
It can't hurt people in reality,

576
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,520
but we're in the dream.

577
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:40,950
Dreams come from

578
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,160
one's mind.

579
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,040
So

580
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,110
the resentment here

581
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,920
can kill us!

582
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,270
Your... Your Highness...

583
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,160
Ruoshi!

584
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,550
Ruoshi!

585
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,480
Ruoshi!

586
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,590
Ruoshi!

587
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,590
Ruoshi!

588
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,510
If he's killed
in the Boundless Nightmare,

589
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,350
Ruoshi!

590
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,880
- he will die in reality, too.
- Ruoshi!

591
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,320
Zhao Qinru,

592
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,440
confess now.

593
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,960
We can't hold it any longer.

594
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,320
You can't get away with it.

595
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:16,870
Such resentment

596
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,480
won't stop until it devours

597
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,480
its source.

598
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,880
Stop denying it!

599
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,110
Mother!

600
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,000
I'm scared, Mother!

601
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,070
Mother!

602
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,880
What have I done wrong?

603
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:37,720
All that I've done is

604
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,270
for the Zhao Family's glory.

605
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,480
I've done my best

606
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,110
for the ancestors and the descendants.

607
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,030
Let the resentment devour me!

608
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,080
Come at me!

609
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,590
You're incorrigible!

610
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,960
The resentment will not only

611
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,640
harm you!

612
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:57,590
Come on!

613
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,160
Devour me!

614
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,480
Do it now!

615
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,640
I've done nothing wrong!

616
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,440
Nothing at all!

617
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,390
Min!

618
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,840
Min!

619
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,560
Min!

620
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,350
Mother...

621
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,200
If you

622
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,480
want me to be the Saintess

623
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,830
and you can be happy,

624
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,830
I'll do it.

625
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,270
If I'm the Saintess,

626
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,030
will you get what you want

627
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,480
and stop crying?

628
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,910
If so, I'll do it.

629
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,030
I'll be the Saintess, Mother.

630
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,400
Min!

631
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,160
Tao Ying lost his daughter,

632
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,680
so he wanted you

633
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,670
to kill your daughter as revenge.

634
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,150
He was killed by that fire.

635
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,400
His resentment is

636
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:15,670
not only towards you.

637
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,030
It'll devour your daughter, too.

638
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,840
I'm losing it!

639
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,190
It's my fault.

640
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,320
It's all my fault!

641
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,960
I was deluded into

642
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,000
setting up this evil formation

643
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,320
out of greed.

644
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,880
I couldn't

645
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,880
sacrifice my daughter,

646
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,710
so I replaced her with another girl.

647
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,400
Seeing the hall on fire,

648
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,230
I thought if words got out,

649
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,030
the Zhao Family and my son

650
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,320
would be in trouble,

651
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,590
so I had them

652
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,280
close all the doors,

653
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,510
causing hundreds of deaths.

654
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,230
- Your Highness!
- Help!

655
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:14,760
- Help!
- Help!

656
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,840
Open the door!

657
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,320
Let us out!

658
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,860
Your Highness!

659
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,580
Your Highness!

660
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,800
Can't let them out...

661
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,000
I'm guilty.

662
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:43,190
I'm the most sinful!

663
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,190
I'm sorry.

664
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,880
I'm really sorry!

The capital holds
over 100 Imperial Demon Catchers,

692

are you going to purify him?

No.

700
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,400
I believe we should give

701
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,030
bad demons another chance.

702
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,880

703
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,320
all kinds of evil
for his selfish desires,

704
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:22,030
leading to dreadful consequences.

Even if he ended up in my tower,

It's better to

00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,030
let Yao end him
