=Episode 22=

3
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:01,940
He's breaking his demon core.

4
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:03,160
Why?

5
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,220
The formation will collapse with it.

6
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,580
Release it now.

7
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,650
Formation Breaking Skill!

8
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,500
It's not working.

9
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,970
How can a mere Tier 4 Incubus Demon

10
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,450
break the formation?

11
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,500
It's all thanks to your father.

12
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,100
What do you mean?

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,890
He was greedy and wildly arrogant.

14
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,860
He cast the seal,

15
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,310
weaving my demon core

16
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,380
into the Life Suction Formation.

17
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,050
Now I'll die with it.

18
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:40,410
And all of you will join me!

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,270
Father sealed you

20
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,450
because he couldn't kill you then.

21
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,020
I'm only Tier 4.

22
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,410
Do you believe he couldn't do that?

23
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:50,890
Young lady,

24
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,440
it seems

25
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,070
that you don't know

26
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,300
your father at all.

27
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,840
This place is about to explode!

28
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,730
Let's go!

29
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:15,900
Too late.

30
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,430
If the formation breaks,

31
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,990
half of the capital will be destroyed!

32
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,240
Even if we can get out,

33
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,100
the civilians outside can't run away.

34
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,750
Sister Mu Yao, what are you doing?

35
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,970
- Sister!
- Yao!

36
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,060
The formation contains

37
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,110
my father's spiritual power.

38
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,110
Only I've mastered my father's skills,

39
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,630
and only I can get into the core.

40
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,460
My inner core can replace the demon core

41
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,480
to delay the blast.

42
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,080
No, you can't go!

43
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,570
You can't take the risk alone!

44
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,510
Sister...

45
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,940
I'm not alone.

46
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,530
I have you by my side.

47
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,200
Miaomiao,

48
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,730
don't you always say

49
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,660
no matter what happens,

50
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,570
we'll stick together?

51
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,900
Good. I trust you.

52
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,780
Once I get in,

53
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,940
have the cultivators of the Bureau

54
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,730
hold the eight corners
with their inner cores

55
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,220
to neutralize the explosion.

56
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,570
I know it's difficult,

57
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,690
but together

58
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,900
we can get it done.

59
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,600
Yes.

60
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,630
Sister Mu Yao,

61
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,030
you have Message Charms, right?

62
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:24,880
Give me one.

63
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,570
I'll use it to get help.

64
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,530
Be careful.

65
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,730
Go to a safe spot.

66
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,180
(Xingshan Hall)

67
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,940
Let's do it.

68
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,630
Guo Xiu, Guo Xiu,

69
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,560
come in to assist us.

70
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,660
We need backup!

71
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,720
Cuicui!

72
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:20,700
Cuicui, Cuicui!

73
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,190
- Let's go out to check.
- Sure.

74
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,050
Let's go!

75
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,970
It... it's about to break!

76
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,220
Everyone in this area will be killed!

77
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,170
They're waiting for us to assist them.

78
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,580
They're trying to halt the formation.

79
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,460
It's been running for a while,

80
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,000
and it's become too powerful.

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,970
We can't halt it in a minute.

82
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,810
We can't do it.

83
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,080
We're shorthanded.

84
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,730
We'll die anyway.

85
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,480
Eliminating evil
and protecting people

86
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,520
are what we Demon Catchers do.

87
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,370
If we work together

88
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,050
and spare no effort,

89
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,780
maybe we'll succeed!

90
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,580
What if we fail?

91
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,660
- Yes.
- Yes, what then?

92
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,630
You're right.

93
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,220
Run! Let's go!

94
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,490
Go, go!

95
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,100
Get out of here!

96
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,660
Where are they?

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,340
What's taking them so long?

98
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,970
We'll help you!

99
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,820
- Here I am!
- I'm coming!

100
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,280
- Mu Sheng!
- Miaomiao...

101
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,820
leave with Cuicui.

102
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,960
We can't hold out for long!

103
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,730
No, we're a team.

104
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,020
- I won't leave without you.
- Get out or you'll die, too!

105
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,670
No!

106
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,290
Me neither.

107
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,140
Every little bit of power helps!

108
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,580
Form up!

109
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,550
Cuicui!

110
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,310
Cuicui!

111
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,730
Cuicui, are you alright?

112
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,630
System, System,

113
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,480
I need energy!

114
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,420
I have to save everyone!

Please confirm

00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,940
if you'll unlock the Apocal Power.

118
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,460
Yes, unlock it now!

119
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,820
Warning.

120
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,420

They're out! They're out!

They're out! They're out!

148
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,850
Lord, what happened?

149
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,180
We heard loud bangs last night.

150
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,100
We tamed a mere Tier 4 demon.

151
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,870
Everything is under my control.

152
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,720
Nothing to worry about.

153
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,150
- The Astronomical Bureau is great!
- Well done!

154
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,310
It's nothing.

155
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,130
We simply did our job.

156
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,700
You're welcome.

157
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:04,550
You're the best!

158
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,610
I'm hungry.

159
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,540
A rainbow inner core indeed!

160
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,700
Yes.

161
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,260
- This...
- It's real!

162
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,370
Is it so rare?

163
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,970
Of course.

164
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,250
We've never seen it before!

165
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:15,300
It's said that when the Mu progenitor,
Mu Qingshi,

166
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,200
mended the sky to save the world,

167
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,060
her inner core created a rainbow.

168
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,150
But that's only a story.

169
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,320
Found it.

170
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,820
I found it!

171
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,250
The Guardian Master's portrait
from 900 years ago.

172
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,890
Look! Look at it!

173
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,940
Is the first half

174
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,300
of the Prophecy coming true?

175
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,820
Isn't that

176
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,960
our progenitor?

177
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,870
Miss Lin's father is
a County Magistrate.

178
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,230
No one in her family has
practiced magic skills.

179
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,080
How come...?

180
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,920
Miaomiao,

181
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,420
who exactly are you?

182
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,680
According to the Prophecy,
the Guardian Master is

183
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,540
Cultivator Lin.

184
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,770
Guardian... Master...?

185
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,770
My respects, Guardian Master!

186
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,610
My respects, Guardian Master!

187
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,820
Don't... don't do this.

188
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,060
Please stand up. This is too much.

189
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,770
Come on... Please rise.

190
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,220
Please... stand up...

191
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,250
Please, all of you!

192
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,220
It's been over 20 years.

193
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,540
Finally,

194
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,970
we've found you!

195
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,650
Over 20 years?

196
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,340
That... That long?

197
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,060
Over two decades ago,

198
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,510
the Heavenly Wall in the Bureau

199
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,870
revealed the Prophecy

200
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,340
that the Demon Catcher who could

201
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,100
draw out Crescent would soon appear.

202
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,320
Just like the first Guardian Master,

203
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,850
Mu Qingshi, that person would be

204
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,250
talented with unlimited potential

205
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:04,420
and could become the Heavenly Master.

206
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,890
Over the years,

207
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:11,220
we had no idea

208
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,730
who that person was.

209
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,180
But now it seems

210
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:18,970
that you're the new Guardian Master,

211
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,540
the supreme leader
of all Demon Catchers!

212
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,970
Please draw out Crescent, Guardian Master!

213
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:34,250
Me? To draw that out?

214
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm so nervous!

215
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,950
What if I can't?

216
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,130
Miaomiao, you can do it!

217
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,960
She can't do it?

218
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,720
Isn't... she the Guardian Master?

219
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,560
What's happening?

220
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,260
I'm sorry.

221
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,410
I let all of you down.

222
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,680
I think I'm not

223
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,100
that Guardian Master.

224
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,500
Sister Mu!

225
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,370
It's fine. Don't be upset.

226
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:22,890
Cultivator Mu,

227
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,740
Mu Qingshi is

228
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,340
your ancestor.

229
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,610
So could you be

230
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,370
the Guardian Master?

231
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,350
Give it a try.

232
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,680
Actually,

233
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,580
I've tried

234
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,690
and failed.

235
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,780
- What about Fu...?
- Not me either.

236
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,040
Look!

237
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,350
Mu Sheng...

238
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,610
Can he draw it out?

239
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,020
It's out!

240
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,740
He's the one!

241
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,110
It's him!

242
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:13,020
My respects, Guardian Master!

243
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,740
(Without them,)

244
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,500
(I would bear regrets forever.)

245
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,850
Young Master Liu!

246
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,350
Thank goodness

247
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,890
you're still here.

248
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,130
Please help the Princess!

249
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,610
What's wrong?

250
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,170
It's all my fault.

251
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,880
I let that demon out

252
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,740
and helped him reactivate the formation.

253
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,600
Please help the Princess!

254
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,170
I'll die for her!

255
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,720
What?

256
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,350
You've been helping

257
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,410
that sealed demon in the Xingshan Hall?

258
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:23,860
Yes.

259
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,820
Don't worry.

260
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,410
The Princess will be fine.

261
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,880
How can you be sure?

262
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,680
She's in the hall already.

263
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,310
That demon won't let her go.

264
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,750
The wedding there is no longer

265
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,130
a trap set by that demon.

266
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,880
My sister has made a plan

267
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,260
to use his trap to catch him.

268
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,610
I know my sister.

269
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,540
She'd never let innocent people
get hurt.

270
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,070
Peiyun,

271
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,750
can you tell us everything

272
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,690
you know?

273
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:47,830
Yes.

274
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,170
Tell us what we're missing

275
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,780
so that we can help Yao

276
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,060
to eliminate that demon for good.

277
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,470
Then the Princess and everyone else

278
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:57,410
in the capital will be safe.

279
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,580
From now on,

280
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,610
you'll be our help.

281
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:07,910
(Your Highness,)

282
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,930
(I'm sorry.)

283
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,450
(I sided with the evil.)

284
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,210
(I can't face you again.)

285
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,690
(It's time for me to leave.)

286
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,340
(I'll do good)

287
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,370
(to atone for my sins)

288
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,210
(and pray for you.)

289
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,600
(I wish you forever health,)

290
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,740
(peace and happiness.)

291
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,520
(Your Highness,)

292
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,340
(please take care.)

293
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:42,100
(Tuanyuan Inn)

294
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,100
How long will you remain invisible?

295
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,020
Wait until we leave the capital.

296
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:52,930
You... You...

297
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,400
Yes, good for you.

298
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,100
But they keep bothering me.

299
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,790
Besides, others think

300
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,440
I'm talking to myself.

301
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,890
I look like a fool.

302
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,980
Just "look like"?

303
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,240
Miss Lin.

304
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,000
Do you know

305
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,170
where the Guardian Master is?

306
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,340
I don't know.

307
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,980
His appearance has been known to all.

308
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,780
Even His Majesty has given the order.

309
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,830
Crescent belongs to the Guardian Master.

310
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:27,740
He has to take it

311
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,450
to fulfill the rest of the Prophecy.

312
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,110
But you haven't figured out

313
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,470
what it says, have you?

314
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,410
We... we're almost done.

315
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,580
But now we can't find
the Guardian Master.

316
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,960
We know he's too powerful.

317
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,820
Even if he's here,
we can't force him to do anything.

318
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,370
What should we do?

319
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,510
Keep looking, I guess.

320
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,740
Keep looking? Fine.

321
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,170
Sure. We'll keep looking.

322
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,790
But he could be anywhere.

323
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,300
How can we find him?

324
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:58,830
Where should we go?

325
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,170
There's no sign of him. What to do?

326
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,300
They're gone. Come out now.

327
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,550
Ziqi?

328
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,070
Ziqi?

329
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,590
Where are you?

330
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,310
Ziqi?

331
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,150
Zi...

332
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,070
Be careful.

333
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,610
- You're so...
- Mind the step.

334
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,000
This way, please.

335
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,100
Your room is over there.

336
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,680
This way.

337
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:35,340
The best one is right ahead.

338
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,750
Please.

339
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,960
Nice inn. It's quiet.

340
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,820
You're right.

341
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,580
You freaked me out.

342
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,740
Where else could I be?

343
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,370
Can we snuggle like this all day?

344
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,540
Why can't we?

345
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,500
We're leaving the capital soon.

346
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,070
I hope from now on,

347
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,450
everything will be fine.

348
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,520
Yao,

349
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,450
you seem troubled.

350
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,650
Are you confused

351
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,260
because of

352
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,980
that Incubus Demon's last words?

353
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:45,690
Maybe he lied.

354
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,060
I don't know.

355
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,500
Ever since we came here,

356
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,260
I've been feeling

357
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,410
that this trip has

358
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,740
something to do with my father.

359
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,500
Why did he do that?

360
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,020
What exactly did he do?

361
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,820
I don't have an answer.

362
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:06,890
He always detested evil

363
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,850
and had no mercy on evil demons.

364
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,410
But back in the Xingshan Hall,

365
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,650
he did nothing

366
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,210
and indulged a Tier 4 Incubus Demon

367
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,930
in vice.

368
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,300
And the resentment there...

369
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,680
What about it?

370
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:26,610
♪Red Moon♪

371
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,740
♪Round Moon♪

372
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:36,410
♪I carry a lantern under the moon,
stepping up the stairs♪

373
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,470
♪Straight stairs♪

374
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,540
It made me

375
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,300
hear something strange.

376
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,340
Then I got it.

377
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,500
The Incubus Demon meant
to steal my nightmare

378
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,800
and played a trick to scare me off.

379
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,480
But I was misled by him,

380
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,510
thinking that demon was
the Resentful Woman.

381
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,020
But why did my father

382
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,910
keep an evil demon alive?

383
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,700
And how did Dowager Consort Zhao

384
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,010
get our Jade Token?

385
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,260
She probably knows something we don't.

386
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,620
You haven't asked her about it.

387
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,300
Yao,

388
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,460
are you... afraid?

389
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,180
If you can't

390
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,020
face something now,

391
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,220
it's better to wait for another time.

392
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,700
I'll visit her in the palace tomorrow.

393
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,460
I'll have the carriage ready

394
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,900
and escort you to the gate.

395
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,260
Fuyi,

396
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,220
can you go with me?

397
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,140
Whatever is waiting for me,

398
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,540
if you're by my side,

399
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,860
I'll feel better.

400
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,260
Sure.

401
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,100
As long as you need me,

402
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:01,260
I'm always there for you.

403
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,100
Try this.

404
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,740
It's good! It's so tasty!

405
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,380
Right? Am I right?

406
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,220
Eat up, Sister.

407
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,460
You too.

408
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,860
Ziqi, come here!

409
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,220
Let's go!

410
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,540
- Come on!
- What's up?

411
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,100
Why such secrecy?

412
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,020
Did you see that?

413
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,980
Sister Mu put food in Cuicui's bowl!

414
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,140
Did she?

415
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,300
Yes.

416
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,940
She filled up his bowl

417
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:46,060
and said he should eat more to grow up

418
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,780
and find his grandfather.

419
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,460
She was on guard against demons

420
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:56,580
and always cold to Cuicui.

421
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,540
But

422
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,100
just now she was so nice to him!

423
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,060
Do you think she has

424
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,700
started to accept that little demon?

425
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,260
Ziqi, I know

426
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,740
you don't want me
to bring certain things up.

427
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,260
It's fine.

428
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,140
From now on, just say whatever you want.

429
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,780
I won't be mad.

430
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,540
That doesn't sound like you.

431
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,340
Being kind and friendly is easy.

432
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,700
I can do that.

433
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,740
I'm thinking

434
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:37,020
when the right time comes,

435
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:41,780
you can tell her who you really are.

436
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,980
But if you don't want to...

437
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,300
It's not like that,

438
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,260
but

439
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,740
in the past

440
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,260
she meant the most to me.

441
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,940
I've kept that secret
from her for so long.

442
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,100
There isn't a day that I'm not scared,

443
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:04,220
but I've had enough.

444
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,700
I know.

445
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,140
I know how you feel.

446
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,380
It's better to tell her

447
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,780
before she finds out herself.

448
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,020
Besides, if she can

449
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,420
accept Cuicui for who he is,

450
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,500
I think she'll accept you, too.

451
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,540
Ziqi,

452
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:26,220
tell her now.

453
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,020
Sister.

454
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,580
Sheng,

455
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:51,990
what's up? Come on in.

456
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,120
Sister...

457
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,380
I have something to tell you.

458
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:57,940
What is it?

459
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:00,900
I...

460
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,260
I...

461
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,140
I hired a bigger carriage.

462
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,340
It might go a little over budget.

463
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,980
But it'll make you and Miaomiao
more comfortable.

464
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,220
You've grown up

465
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,420
and become so sweet.

466
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,020
Uh...

467
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,420
good night, Sister.

468
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,540
Is there anything else?

469
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,420
No.

470
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,020
Really?

471
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,820
Good night then.

472
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,820
Miaomiao...

473
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,260
Uh...

474
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,260
What...?

475
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:47,940
Ziqi...

476
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,060
You know what?

477
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:51,700
Actually,

478
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,460
I have a secret, too.

479
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,140

Sorry, an out-of-order error
was triggered.

501
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,510
Congratulations!
You've conquered the target.

00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,600
Warning. 100%.
The catastrophe of heaven is coming.

504
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,800
You're falsely transferred to the end.

505
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,660

506
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,740
Congratulations!

00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,460
Are you alright?

511
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:50,020
I think I had a strange dream.

512
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,300
What did you see?

513
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,140
I saw

514
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,740
a strange figurine

515
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,260
talking to me, but I didn't understand.

516
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:05,540
That doesn't make sense.

517
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,700
It is quite strange.

518
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,060
Forget about it.

519
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,300
Were you here

520
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,260
the whole night?

521
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,140
Yes.

522
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:23,140
You were wild when you were drunk.

523
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,060
How wild?

524
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,340
You refused to let me go.

525
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,460
Sister brought you soup
and closed the door

526
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,940
without taking a glance at us.

527
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,620
You... You're lying!

528
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,420
Don't be shy.

529
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,570
You've told your father everything
in the letter, right?

530
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:45,700
What do you mean?

531
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,980
Isn't this your handwriting?

532
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,020
(Father,)
"I like Ziqi.

533
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,500
I want to marry him."

534
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,260
- You...
- It's clearly written

535
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,500
right here.

536
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,500
I... You...

537
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,740
Cuicui!

538
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,140
I like that naughty little shoot

539
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,940
more and more.

540
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,980
He's been of great help.

541
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,380
It's so wise to bring him along.

542
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:09,900
Give it back!

543
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,500
Give it to me!

544
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,300
Where did it go?

545
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,140
I just cast a spell.

546
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,820
Now it's

547
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,300
1,000 miles away

548
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,940
on your father's table.

549
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,700
You... Get it back!

550
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,540
Now!

551
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,740
Calm down.

552
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,980
You drank too much last night.

553
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,620
