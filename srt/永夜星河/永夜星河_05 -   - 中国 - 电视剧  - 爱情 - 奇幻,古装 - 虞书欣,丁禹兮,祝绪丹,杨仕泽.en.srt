00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,180
=Episode 5=

3
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,150
Lin Yu,

4
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,400
are you hungry?

5
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,920
There is a snack shop.

6
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,250
Let me buy you something to eat.

7
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:57,570
I'll go buy it.

8
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,380
Let me buy it.

9
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,000
I haven't done this

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,170
with my friends.

11
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,560
(Although the situation is a bit)

12
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,020
(different from what I imagined,)

13
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,020
(the effect is the same.)

14
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,250
(Mu Sheng should be in a good mood now.)

15
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,410
Progress prompt:

16
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,330
Favorability change detected.

17
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,240
Your target Mu Sheng's

18
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,020
favorability towards you
decreases by fifty percent.

19
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,470
Current favorability is

20
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,330
negative two hundred and fifty percent.

21
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,110
Sis…

22
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,170
Lin Yu, take it.

23
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,740
Thank you.

24
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,800
(Why?)

25
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,330
(I have separated the leading roles,)

26
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,880
(why he is still unhappy?)

27
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,550
- Why Fuyi still hasn't returned?
- Freshly baked snack!

28
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,610
Come and try it!

29
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,110
Sister,

30
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,610
I'm hungry, too.

31
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,500
Why didn't you say it earlier?

32
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,530
I thought you didn't like sweets.

33
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,530
(Alright, I understand.)

34
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,800
Sister,

35
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,860
it's rare for us to enjoy the lanterns.

36
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,380
Why do you bring outsiders
to disturb us?

37
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,060
How can you say that?

38
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,710
Lin Yu,

39
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,100
don't mind what he said.

40
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,500
I dare not.

41
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,130
Look at that fan.

42
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,410
It will make a perfect pair
with the one in your hand.

43
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,290
I'll go win it back for you.

44
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,380
Sister Mu Yao, I already have one.

45
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,850
Have one?

46
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,200
Lin Yu,

47
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,180
are you showing off?

48
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,620
No, I'm not.

49
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,060
My sister just bought you some snacks.

50
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,130
What's special about that?

51
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,220
I bought some snacks.

52
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,550
Where's Yao?

53
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,220
Wasn't Lin Yu always clinging to you?

54
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,500
Why doesn't she do so now?

55
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,200
You…

56
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,290
What use are you?

57
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,730
Sheng is in a bad mood today.

58
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:28,670
Where's Yao?

59
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,620
- Go now.
- Let's go.

60
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,970
Come on, girl, take a look.

61
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,660
They are all beautiful.

62
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,020
(Young Mu Sheng)

63
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,900
(Young Mu Yao)
Do you want a decorative lantern?

64
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,960
Sister,

65
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,580
I feel like I've seen the beauty

66
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,100
on this lamp somewhere.

67
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,220
Sister.

68
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,780
Sister!

69
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,850
Girl, come and take a look.

70
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,600
Sister!

71
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,490
- Great!
- (Mu Sheng likes the Lantern Festival)

72
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,410
(because of such a history.)

73
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,780
(Perhaps he wants to make up
for childhood regrets.)

74
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,880
Sister Mu Yao.

75
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,110
Lin Yu.

76
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,370
You should try it, too.

77
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,100
Sister Mu Yao,

78
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,240
don't just play with me.

79
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,820
You should also play with Mu Sheng.

80
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,760
He's not a child anymore.

81
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,610
No need to play with him.

82
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,530
Sister Mu Yao,

83
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,190
have you and Mu Sheng

84
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,050
attended the Lantern Festival before?

85
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,000
Mu Family has strict rules.

86
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,700
We are rarely allowed to
indulge in entertainment.

87
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,850
I remember one time,

88
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,700
when Sheng and I were still young,

89
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,490
we attended it once.

90
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,580
Was it fun that time?

91
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,760
Did anything happen?

92
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,760
That is impressive,

93
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,670
and unforgettable

94
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,780
for over a decade.

95
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,260
I remember that

96
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,100
I got separated from Sheng.

97
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,610
Then I twisted my ankle.

98
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,100
My Uncle was very angry.

99
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,660
He even beat Sheng.

100
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,900
I told you to follow your sister,

101
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,750
- Uncle,
- protect her,

102
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,820
stop beating Sheng.

103
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,220
Uncle.

104
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,750
- Uncle, stop beating him.
- you don't follow me.

105
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,590
I'll beat you to death.

106
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,440
You little brat.

107
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,280
Uncle.

108
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,440
Move aside.

109
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,260
Uncle, stop beating him.

110
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,970
It was my fault for running around.

111
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,260
Don't beat him anymore.

112
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,340
I ran around on my own.

113
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,490
Don't beat him.

114
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,070
Yao,

115
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,340
you must remember

116
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,320
you are the future master of Mu Family.

117
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,730
If you have anything wrong,

118
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,290
don't mention this little brat,

119
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:54,970
I can't bear it either.

120
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,480
Do you understand?

121
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,040
Does it hurt?

122
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,710
Sheng,

123
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:14,580
I'm sorry.

124
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,820
It was my fault that you got beaten.

125
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,460
I didn't protect you well.

126
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,580
How about this?

127
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,100
When you have recovered from your injury,

128
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,440
I will take you to
the Lantern Festival again.

129
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,280
What do you think?

130
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,220
Seriously?

131
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,410
It's a deal.

132
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,320
It will be just the two of us.

133
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,230
I'll buy you whatever you want to eat.

134
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,470
I'll win whatever prize

135
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,610
you want for you.

136
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,960
Okay?

137
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,480
Miss,

138
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,830
you have won the first prize.

139
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,100
You can take any prize here.

140
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,230
It's okay.

141
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,570
I already have a fan.

142
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:01,420
Tanghulu.

143
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,080
Try. Tanghulu.

144
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,360
Then,

145
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,270
I'll take that Lantern.

146
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,110
Alright.

147
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:07,990
Wait a moment.

148
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,530
Tanghulu.

149
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,330
Tanghulu.

150
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,240
Miss, your decorative lantern.

151
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,080
Thank you.

152
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,400
Sheng,

153
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,800
this is for you.

154
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,070
Sister.

155
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,420
I remember when you were little,

156
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,710
you were not interested
in any myths and legends

157
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,010
the adults told us,

158
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,340
except the one about Goddess Mei.

159
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,770
You listened to it carefully.

160
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:10,300
Sister, why did you think of these things?

161
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,010
I still remember,

162
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,890
at that Lantern Festival we attended,

163
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,060
the reason we got separated is

164
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,670
I saw you being captivated

165
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,220
by Goddess Mei's Lantern,

166
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,010
I wanted to win the Lantern for you.

167
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,370
But I didn't win the Lantern.

168
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,130
Instead, I got lost,

169
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,370
and twisted my ankle.

170
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,920
Later on,

171
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,010
I promised you,

172
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,850
in the future,

173
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,370
I will take you to a Lantern Festival again.

174
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,340
Over the years,

175
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,300
we've experienced many things.

176
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,180
I forgot it.

177
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,240
It's okay.

178
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,610
It doesn't matter.

179
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,770
Actually, I forgot it, too.

180
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,700
Really?

181
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,990
My promise that

182
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,180
I would win whatever you want for you

183
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,540
can no longer be counted?

184
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:24,920
If it doesn't count,

185
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,390
I'll give this lantern to someone else.

186
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,850
Of course, it has to count.

187
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,460
This is mine.

188
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,190
Are you hungry?

189
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,830
Sister.

190
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,890
I'll eat it later.

191
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,800
What about this?

192
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,040
Let's have a little competition.

193
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,880
Let's see who

194
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,510
can become today's Lantern King.

195
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,350
Dare to try?

196
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,340
Let's compete then.

197
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,010
He laughs.

198
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,540
He laughs.

199
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,730
He finally laughs.

200
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,320
Amitabha.

201
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,420
He finally laughs.

202
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,480
Sorry, Brother Liu.

203
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,440
I see they are so happy,

204
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,100
I am happy for them, too.

205
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,460
Yes.

206
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,490
Yao is so happy.

207
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,200
Brother Liu,

208
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,040
I'm sorry.

209
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,520
What's wrong?

210
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,970
I was just playing with
Sister Mu Yao and Mu Sheng,

211
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,940
leaving you alone.

212
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,280
It doesn't matter.

213
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,610
Anyway,

214
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,460
it's good if Yao enjoys herself tonight.

215
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:58,940
I originally just wanted to

216
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,010
spend some happy time with her again.

217
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,130
Brother Liu,

218
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,460
do you care a lot about Sister Mu Yao?

219
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,280
You…

220
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,730
Why do you say that?

221
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,490
I can see it.

222
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,940
You must want to stand by her side, right?

223
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,350
Brother Liu,

224
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,850
if you care about someone,

225
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,470
no matter what obstacles you encounter,

226
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,180
you must resolutely choose her.

227
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,580
The world is ever-changing.

228
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,300
We can't do everything we want.

229
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,770
What we want

230
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,250
or don't want

231
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,770
is not important.

232
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,060
Who said that?

233
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,610
If it's what you really want,

234
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,770
it's very important.

235
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,700
They are truly a perfect match,

236
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,730
a pair of perfect lovers.

237
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,770
My dear daughter

238
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,250
really knows how to choose a husband.

239
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,630
But I wonder if this Young Master Liu

240
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,130
would like to marry into our family.

241
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:17,010
- Great!
- Great!

242
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,100
- Great!
- Great!

243
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,340
- Great!
- Great!

244
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,800
- Great!
- Great!

245
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,470
Lord,

246
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,630
the Dowager Consort in the palace

247
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,970
sent a gift to you.

248
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,130
She said,

249
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,940
thank you for feeding this beast
these years.

250
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,400
But this year, for some reason,

251
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,300
this beast is greedier than previous years.

252
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,180
She asked you

253
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,940
to take good care of it.

254
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,190
Got it.

255
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,000
Enjoy the lanterns.

256
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,970
Let's enjoy the lanterns first.

257
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,940
(Invisible Golden Toad)

258
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,460
Midnight is approaching,

259
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:03,340
our Lantern Festival's competition

260
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,010
is about to conclude.

261
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,890
Everyone, put in a bit more effort!

262
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,040
- Okay.
- Okay.

263
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,880
Keep going!

264
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,700
Sister Mu Yao, listen to me.

265
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,030
Why does Miss Lin

266
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,850
only have so few colored notes?

267
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,160
Didn't I ask you to inform
the boss of each stall

268
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,300
to give her a boon?

269
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,820
It's not that the boss didn't do it,

270
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,110
it's just that her skill is so poor

271
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,460
that no one can help her

272
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,460
make a difference.

273
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,400
Today's Lantern King can
only be Miss Lin.

274
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,250
Otherwise, how can we explain it
to the County Magistrate?

275
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,540
How about…

276
00:15:58,990 --> 00:15:59,970
Everyone,

277
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,540
this year's Lantern King

278
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,790
- is decided.
- Decided.

279
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,840
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

280
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,100
She is

281
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,460
the County Magistrate's daughter,

282
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,420
Miss Lin Yu!

283
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:15,790
Lin Yu!

284
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,280
She only won two colored notes.

285
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,420
Why is she the Lantern King?

286
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,110
- Lin Yu.
- She just won a few of these.

287
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:20,950
Why?

288
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,000
Why is she the Lantern King?

289
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,920
Yes.

290
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,300
Don't make noise.

291
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,870
Miss Lin

292
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,840
is attending the Lantern Festival

293
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,000
with her friends.

294
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,300
So, the colored notes
the four of them won

295
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,700
should all be counted.

296
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,960
- Right?
- Yes.

297
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,340
Lin Yu, take these.

298
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,160
Sheng.

299
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,300
Let's invite the Lantern King

300
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,730
and her lover

301
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,010
to fly the lantern together.

302
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,960
Sister Mu,

303
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,490
come with me.

304
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,970
I go with you?

305
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,160
Young Master Mu, Sister Mu, Brother Liu,

306
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,730
let's go to the stage together.

307
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,130
The Lantern King flies a lantern
to pray to Goddess Mei,

308
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,540
blessing their love.

309
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:02,980
If the four of us go to
the stage together,

310
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,130
- what does it mean?
- It means we're good friends.

311
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,590
Goddess Mei blesses all lovers

312
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:10,540
to stay together and

313
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,840
never to part.

314
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,550
But it never said that
only romantic love counts as love.

315
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,240
Friendship, brotherhood,

316
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,980
sisterhood, and sibling bond all count.

317
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,650
Lin Yu is right.

318
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,450
Goddess Mei blesses

319
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,440
all the people who are affectionate
and righteous,

320
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,820
and want to accompany each other.

321
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,540
Sheng,

322
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,750
Lin Yu, Fuyi,

323
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,780
let's go together.

324
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,680
Let's go.

325
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,690
My dear daughter has really grown up.

326
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,260
She's flying a lantern with her beloved.

327
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,550
Well…

328
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,580
Who is the person your daughter likes?

329
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,000
He is…

330
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,210
Why are there so many people?

331
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,720
Please.

332
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,260
It was you who made my sister recall

333
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,450
the Lantern Festival during childhood

334
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,700
and the incident of her getting lost?

335
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,720
No, it's not.

336
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,890
My sister said that

337
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,780
you are good at taking care of people,

338
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,170
and repeatedly asked her to accompany me,

339
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,210
fearing I'd be lonely by myself.

340
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,890
Don't be polite.

341
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,340
Who asked you to do this?

342
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,200
(What a lousy character set!)

343
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,300
(It really makes me angry.)

344
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,650
(He always misunderstands me.)

345
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,060
Aren't you happy?

346
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,060
Whether I'm happy or not

347
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,890
has anything to do with you?

348
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,340
(A lot of things, okay?)

349
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,920
It has nothing to do with me.

350
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,990
But, at the Moon Appreciation Festival,

351
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,260
everyone should be happy.

352
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:08,200
Besides, I think your smiling face

353
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,210
is much better than your long face.

354
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:14,960
Lin Yu,

355
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,130
come to light the lantern.

356
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,280
Here.

357
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,120
The previous auspicious words

358
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,450
were always "a hundred years of harmony".

359
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:33,690
But this year,

360
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,650
I really don't know what to say.

361
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,750
I'll count down from three to one.

362
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,590
Three!

363
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,550
Two!

364
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,630
One!

365
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,650
It flies!

So beautiful.

392
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,260
Devotee Mu Yao makes a wish:

393
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,890
May I soon find the Resentful Woman

394
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,060
to avenge my parents.

395
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,170
Devotee…

396
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,890
I hope

397
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,980
to become more beautiful,

398
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,540
not gain weight,

399
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,880
make a fortune,

400
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,310
wish come true.

401
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,740
You are too greedy.

402
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,340
You can only make one wish.

403
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,930
Then I wish

404
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,450
that all affectionate
and righteous people

405
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,540
are at peace.

406
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:12,980
Just that?

407
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:16,060
It's not just that.

408
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,300
Peace is

409
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,610
the greatest wish of ordinary people.

410
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,820
If it is possible,

411
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,850
I really hope that I myself,

412
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,300
the person I love,

413
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,980
and the person who loves me,

414
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,580
live our entire lives in peace.

415
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,150
What are you doing?

416
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,390
Look.

417
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,500
(Peace)

418
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:28,220
(Peace)

419
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,070
Look.

420
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,490
- Look.
- Great!

421
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,100
Peace.

422
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,210
Peace is good.

423
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,130
Peace is gold.

424
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,930
Peace is a blessing.

425
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,540
Peace and safety.

426
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,310
Progress prompt:

427
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,130
Favorability change detected.

428
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:08,550
(Really?)

429
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,370
(I didn't do anything wrong.)

430
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,880
Your target Mu Sheng's

431
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,060
favorability towards you
has greatly increased.

432
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,160
Current favorability is

433
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,340
zero percent.

434
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,590
(He doesn't dislike me anymore.)

435
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:24,510
(That's great.)

436
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,170
(My Dad is safe.)

437
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,220
(Grain)

438
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,200
Fire!

439
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,840
The granary catches fire!

440
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,890
Quick, put out the fire.

441
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,440
Run quickly!

442
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:56,930
Sister!

443
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,070
Excuse me!

444
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,950
- Lin Yu!
- Make way!

445
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,980
Lin Yu!

446
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,450
(How could it be?)

447
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:09,910
(I already...)

448
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,540
(I already…)

449
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,360
- Master!
- Dad!

450
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,640
Run! You must run now!

451
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,480
Dear,

452
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:19,640
Dear, don't be afraid.

453
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,480
You go back first.

454
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,990
I have to go put out the fire.

455
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,370
You can't go.

456
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,400
Once the fire is out,
your crime will be exposed.

457
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,680
You will be executed.

458
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,270
- Dad.
- Dear.

459
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,540
- You…
- I know

460
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,340
the granary and silver vault are empty.

461
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,720
I have already lost my father once.

462
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,400
I can't lose you a second time.

463
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,920
Dad, run quickly!

464
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,300
Dear,

465
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,370
listen to me,

466
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,960
I am the County Magistrate,

467
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,030
the parental official of the people.

468
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,360
I have to go.

469
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,120
Dear, listen to me,

470
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:45,960
go back first.

471
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,230
I will explain it to you later.

472
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,780
Dad, don't go.

473
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,760
No!

474
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,910
Don't.

475
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,100
Dad!

476
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,310
Go!

477
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,100
Dad!

478
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,110
Go!

479
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,880
- Follow me!
- Go!

480
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,740
Quick!

481
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,800
Quick!

482
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,850
Fire!

483
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,740
Make way!

484
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:15,980
Quick, keep up.

485
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,340
Quick, put out the fire!

486
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,680
Quick!

487
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,890
Quick, put out the fire!

488
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,370
Take the bucket, quickly.

489
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,070
Catch it.

490
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,680
- Hurry, hurry up!
- Quick, hurry up!

491
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,580
Inside!

492
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,990
Evacuate the common people first!

493
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:35,830
Quick!

494
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,260
Yao, be careful!

495
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,300
Move aside quickly.

496
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,340
Faster! Quick!

497
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,310
Quick!

498
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,790
Dad!

499
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,100
Do you see my Dad?

500
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,200
Dad!

501
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,300
Dad, where are you?

502
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,540
Quick!

503
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,540
Hurry! Help my Dad.

504
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,480
Dad!

505
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,300
- Hurry up!
- Anyone see my Dad?

506
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,550
- Quick!
- Dad!

507
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,780
Where is my Dad?

508
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:32,410
Anyone see my Dad?

509
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,850
Do you see my Dad?

510
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,580
Where is my Dad?

511
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,480
Quickly!

512
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,400
Do you see my Dad?

513
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,340
No.

514
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,580
Are you out of your mind?

515
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,930
Mu Sheng, I beg you.

516
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,880
Do you have any way to save my Dad?

517
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,960
We must not let others find out

518
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,650
the granary and the vault are empty.

519
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,550
What are you talking about?

520
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,210
See for yourself.

521
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,060
Someone, come quickly!

522
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,210
- Move them out quickly!
- Hurry!

523
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,390
Quickly!

524
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,130
Why is it full?

525
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,930
Dad, are you alright?

526
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,520
Dear,

527
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,790
come here.

528
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:05,630
Come.

529
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:06,590
Sit.

530
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,590
Come on.

531
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,690
Dad, why are the granary
and the vault full?

532
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,070
Dear,

533
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,410
how did you know

534
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:22,830
the granary

535
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:25,370
and vault were empty?

536
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:31,350
Dad,

537
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:34,370
I always knew

538
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,300
you were a corrupt official.

539
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,960
I am not a corrupt official.

540
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,100
Your grandfather

541
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,890
made a fortune doing business.

542
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,170
He was the richest man in Jiangnan.

543
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,580
The cost of our food, clothing,
and daily necessities

544
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:56,500
was all your grandfather's
hard-earned property.

545
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,850
There isn't a single penny
of ill-gotten gains.

546
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,390
You…

547
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:05,930
You were not corrupt.

548
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,800
No.

549
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,740
The original book…

550
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,580
Why

551
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,580
the items in the warehouse

552
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,930
have gone?

553
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,240
Those

554
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,020
were all offered to

555
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,580
Dowager Consort Zhao in the Capital City.

556
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,780
(Dowager Consort Zhao)

557
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,750
(is an elderly concubine,)

558
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,980
(the emperor's biological mother,)

559
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:30,500
(a minor antagonist in the book.)

560
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,690
(She appears when
we leave Taicang County.)

561
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,210
That being said,

562
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:36,630
Dad,

563
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,340
you were merely a tool for
Dowager Consort Zhao

564
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:40,340
to accumulate wealth,

565
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,500
and almost became the scapegoat.

566
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,980
That would have been too unfair.

567
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:45,980
Dear,

568
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,690
you must trust me.

569
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,300
I…

570
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,500
I am just cowardly.

571
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,650
She took away the silver
from Taicang vault.

572
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,540
I dared not to stand out

573
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,410
and prevent her from doing so

574
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:02,910
for the common people.

575
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,540
But I myself

576
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,130
never thought about

577
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,740
seizing the people's property.

578
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,720
Well,

579
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,360
why the warehouse

580
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,020
is full again?

581
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:21,260
I used all of our family's assets

582
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,500
to cover

583
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,300
those deficits.

584
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:29,870
Actually,

585
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:33,450
I never wanted to be an official.

586
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:37,690
It was you who asked me to be.

587
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,500
You said childishly,

588
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,130
you want to know

589
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:44,580
the feeling of being an official's daughter.

590
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,260
So, I…

591
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,890
diligently studied and
became the County Magistrate.

592
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,210
Why this time

593
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,740
you spend all our family fortune

594
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,540
to fill the vault?

595
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,370
Because you

596
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,340
want me to be safe and sound.

597
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,300
Dad,

598
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,970
I only hope

599
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,260
that you can live well

600
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:12,540
and always stay by my side in peace.

601
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,890
I told you long ago,

602
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,500
even if you want the moon in the sky,

603
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,500
I would buy it for you,

604
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,690
not to mention the family fortune.

605
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:29,130
As long as it can buy peace,

606
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,340
and bring happiness to you,

607
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,520
it's worth.

608
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,240
Dad,

609
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,350
I put in so much effort today

610
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,340
to change your ending.

611
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:56,170
I didn't expect the truth to be like this.

612
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,100
As long as you are at peace.

613
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,170
Peace is good.

614
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,930
Your Excellency,

615
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:29,100
the granary and vault don't
suffer significant damage,

616
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:31,440
why do you look

617
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,610
so surprised?

618
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:37,550
I?

619
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,590
No.

620
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,100
How could I be surprised?

621
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,540
This box is moving.

622
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:02,130
The box cannot move.

623
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,540
It didn't.

624
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,500
It didn't move.

625
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,020
Invisible Golden Toad.

626
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,500
Don't let it get close to the silver.

627
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:44,140
(Silver Vault)

628
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,250
Sheng, don't!

629
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,810
It is also called Gold-Devouring Beast.

630
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,360
It loves eating gold, silver, and wealth.

631
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,540
If you kill it now,

632
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,760
the gold and silver in its belly

633
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,360
will vanish with it.

634
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,200
Yes.

635
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,590
Don't kill it.

636
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:38,290
I lost my entire savings

637
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,610
to fill the deficit.

638
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:53,280
That's our silver.

639
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,280
Dear,

640
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,500
don't go.

641
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,020
It keeps devouring gold and silver,

642
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,330
and will expand infinitely.

643
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,560
Fuyi,

644
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,460
Demon Trap Tower.

645
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,280
The Demon Trap Tower does not
accept gold or silver.

646
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,070
It is full of gold and silver,

647
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,130
it cannot be subdued.

648
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:07,020
It cannot be killed or captured.

649
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,580
I can't think so much anymore.

650
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,290
Don't.

651
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:12,510
You don't care,

652
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,900
but my dad's entire fortune is at stake.

653
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,860
- Quick.
- Lord.

654
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,670
If this matter gets exposed,

655
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,900
I wonder how you will explain it
to the Dowager Consort.

656
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,020
Run quickly!

657
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:40,950
I understand.

658
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,730
It only likes to eat gold and silver,

659
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,420
and doesn't like to eat human food.

660
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:48,990
There are doughs.

661
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,210
Let's use that to hit it.

662
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:54,950
Hurry.

663
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,250
Sister Mu Yao, hurry up.

664
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,810
Let's go.

665
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,250
The snacks run out.

666
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,350
You…

667
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,200
It's from my sister.

668
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,940
Shh.

669
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:36,990
Dear.

670
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,280
Dear.

671
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:41,910
Dear,

672
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,060
- Lord.
- are you alright?

673
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,960
I'm fine.

674
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,250
It has already been captured.

675
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,280
The Invisible Golden Toad

676
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:48,860
is an extremely rare demon creature.

677
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,980
Why does it appear here?

678
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:52,380
Ask him.

679
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,640
He is the secret envoy of
the Dowager Consort.

680
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,360
The gold and silver in the vault

681
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,150
were secretly transported by
the Golden Toad

682
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,540
to the capital city.

683
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,800
County Magistrate,

684
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,210
don't falsely accuse me.

685
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:17,770
(Account book)
I have evidence of your embezzlement.

686
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,510
You want to use forged evidence
to frame my Dad?

687
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:24,650
- You are going too far.
- Lin Yu.

688
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,130
This is the evidence you forged.

689
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:35,500
You...

690
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,380
County Magistrate,

691
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,690
this is not merely a matter
of Taicang County.

692
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,640
You

693
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,650
make it difficult to explain to

694
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,420
the Dowager Consort.

695
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,080
This…

696
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,100
Honored as the Dowager Consort,

697
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,130
she commands a demon for her own use.

698
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,280
The Golden Toad she raised

699
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,380
caused such a big trouble
in Taicang County.

700
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,130
Just this matter,

701
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:18,240
if I were that Dowager Consort,

702
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,900
I should think about carefully

703
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,250
how to explain to the Emperor.

704
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:24,420
That's right.

705
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,420
You go back

706
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,980
and report to the Dowager Consort

707
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,070
that I am getting old,

708
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:33,440
I can no longer serve as
the County Magistrate.

709
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,330
I quit.

710
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:36,290
From now on,

711
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,330
if she needs to spend money,

712
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:40,610
she should find a solution herself.

713
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,020
Alright.

714
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:57,860
What are you looking at?

715
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:01,400
I didn't expect you

716
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,060
would speak up for others.

717
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,550
You really hit the nail on the head.

718
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:06,980
You're cold-faced but warm-hearted.

719
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,650
Don't think this matter is over.

720
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:11,290
You have to compensate me for

721
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,690
