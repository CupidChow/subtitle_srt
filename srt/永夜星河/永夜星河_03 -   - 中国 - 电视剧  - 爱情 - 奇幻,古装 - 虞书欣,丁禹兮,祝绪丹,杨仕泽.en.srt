00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,180
=Episode 3=

3
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,520
This color is too bright,

4
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,440
I can't use it.

5
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,110
I think so, too.

6
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,640
Sister Mu Yao, you are so gentle.

7
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,600
This rustic brown suits you better.

8
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,710
Yes, this is really nice,

9
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,920
much better than what Sheng picked.

10
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,390
Sheng bought rouge for me before.

11
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,920
The color was shockingly pink.

12
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,950
Men know nothing about these.

13
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,280
They can't even distinguish between

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,480
bright red, bright pink and russet red.

15
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,120
Speaking of lipstick,

16
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,200
my first lipstick was given by my mom,

17
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,070
my mother.

18
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,640
It's the first time
you mention your mother.

19
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,710
Your mother…

20
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,950
She is not here.

21
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,280
She is in another world.

22
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,040
Although she often nagged me,

23
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,760
I suddenly miss her now.

24
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,430
I understand.

25
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,710
My mother also passed away early.

26
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,350
No, no.

27
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,480
That's not what I meant.

28
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,070
The other world I mentioned

29
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,640
is truly another world.

30
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,310
In my hometown,

31
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,590
my mother is still alive and well.

32
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,280
I often think the same way.

33
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,280
My parents have not passed away.

34
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,350
They are just in another world.

35
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,000
They are still in my old house,

36
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,310
living well.

37
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,750
Lin Yu,

38
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,030
sometimes, I really envy you.

39
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,910
I was born into the Mu Family,

40
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,030
destined to be a Demon Catcher.

41
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,750
I still have unfinished missions.

42
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,560
Sister Mu, please don't say that.

43
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,310
You are so good-looking,

44
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,310
open-minded, generous, and responsible.

45
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,560
Most importantly, you can catch demons.

46
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,630
You are so powerful.

47
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,960
Really?

48
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,470
(The supporting actress is tricky.)

49
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,080
(The supporting actor is tenacious.)

50
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,240
(The leading actor is kind to everyone.)

51
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,710
(After reading the entire book,)

52
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,960
(I only like the leading actress.)

53
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,120
I didn't expect you

54
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,680
are so straightforward.

55
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,240
When I saw you the first time,

56
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,680
I thought you were introverted,

57
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,960
gentle and worrisome.

58
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,030
(Sister, be more mindful.)

59
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,960
(That's a vicious supporting actress.)

60
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,520
(She'll compete with you
for the leading actor.)

61
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,960
(Right, speaking of the lead actor…)

62
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,080
Wait a moment.

63
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,680
Brother Liu,

64
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,960
the grasshopper is ready, right?

65
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,840
Sister Mu Yao is inside.

66
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,680
Hurry and give it to her.

67
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,080
How did you know I bring a grasshopper?

68
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,920
Let's go.

69
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:26,870
Lin Yu,

70
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,460
what did you do to my sister?

71
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,990
- Hurry up.
- How did she suddenly like you?

72
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,840
Sister Mu,
Brother Liu has something to give you.

73
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,080
Don't be shy.

74
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,920
Give you.

75
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,710
Open it and take a look.

76
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,840
How exquisite!

77
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:54,990
Where did you get it?

78
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:56,870
I…

79
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,470
This is woven by Brother Liu himself.

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,150
He was afraid you would be bored

81
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,240
and made it for you.

82
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:04,870
Yes.

83
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,520
Do you like it?

84
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,840
Yes.

85
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,800
(In the book,
Lin Yu fights for this grasshopper,)

86
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,920
(which caused a misunderstanding
between them.)

87
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,360
(This plot is really annoying
and unnecessary.)

88
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,720
You have a good chat,

89
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,920
take your time.

90
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,390
I'm leaving first.

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,920
Miss Lin,

92
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,630
I really underestimated you.

93
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,560
I haven't heard

94
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,750
my sister laugh so happily

95
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,800
and so relaxed for a long time.

96
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,470
Tell me,

97
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,680
how exactly did you bewitch my sister?

98
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,720
Are you okay?

99
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,390
Your sister was rarely so happy and relaxed.

100
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,600
Shouldn't you feel happy?

101
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,120
You are an outsider.

102
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,600
Why did she laugh for you?

103
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,040
Why did she feel good with you?

104
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,680
Why is she like siblings with you?

105
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,360
Do you know how hard it is for me

106
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,270
to make my sister happy?

107
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,080
You…

108
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,240
What are you laughing at?

109
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,430
So, you're jealous.

110
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,800
How ridiculous!

111
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,240
Who do you think you are?

112
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,630
Do you deserve to make me jealous?

113
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,040
You are clearly jealous!

114
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,720
Your sister chats with me happily,

115
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,430
but has nothing to say with you.

116
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,950
Is there a possibility

117
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,720
Sister Mu Yao just wants to find a girl

118
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,630
to chat about topics between close friends?

119
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,160
So she has nothing to say to you.

120
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,880
Are you saying

121
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,240
I grew up together with my sister

122
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,390
and we have accompanied
each other for decades,

123
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,160
but our relationship can't compare to you,

124
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,720
a stranger we've only
known for a few days?

125
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,360
Young Master Mu,

126
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,950
you don't need to resort to violence, do you?

127
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,480
I'm warning you.

128
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,040
Don't do anything reckless.

129
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,160
Otherwise…

130
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,310
Otherwise, what?

131
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,120
Otherwise,

132
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,000
Sister Mu Yao,

133
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,560
your brother bullied me again.

134
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,480
- Sister.
- I…

135
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,000
Your brother bullied me again.

136
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,840
I…

137
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,720
Sister Mu Yao,

138
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,310
Sister Mu Yao.

139
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,160
Lin Yu,

140
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,360
- what's wrong?
- Sister Mu Yao.

141
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,480
Your brother said I was getting close to you

142
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,240
with bad intentions.

143
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,360
He said I want to harm you.

144
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,870
I feel so wronged.

145
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,920
Miss Lin is a frail girl.

146
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,830
Sheng, don't go too far.

147
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,880
Sheng,

148
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,790
apologize.

149
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,260
Sister, I completely…

150
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,720
I ask you to apologize to Lin Yu,

151
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,710
did you hear that?

152
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:53,950
I'm sorry.

153
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,270
She didn't hear it.

154
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,560
Louder.

155
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,830
I'm sorry.

156
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,630
This was my fault.

157
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,600
I apologize to you.

158
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,000
Please don't cry.

159
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,750
Look, he has already apologized to you.

160
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,800
Don't cry anymore.

161
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,390
Alright.

162
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,920
I will forgive him.

163
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,190
I'll stop crying.

164
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,120
Lin Yu,

165
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,160
just wait.

166
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,960
Sister Mu,

167
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,950
is this place good?

168
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,070
I've wandered around.

169
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:11,920
In my yard,

170
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,270
this small pavilion is the most comfortable.

171
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,160
In the summer, it's cool here.

172
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,240
We can drink tea under the moon at night.

173
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,830
It is truly tasteful.

174
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,480
Young Master Mu,

175
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,720
haven't you finished peeling yet?

176
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,800
Sheng,

177
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,550
you said you wronged Lin Yu

178
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,200
and want to apologize to her.

179
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,240
Miss Lin,

180
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,960
please help yourself.

181
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,030
(I've been killed by you so many times.)

182
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:03,240
(I must get my revenge this time.)

183
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,360
I want to eat grapes.

184
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,600
Who is stopping you?

185
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,390
Sister.

186
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,390
Do grapes need to be peeled?

187
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,680
Miss Lin,

188
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,550
did you break your hand?

189
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,430
Do you need me to help you set the bone?

190
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,390
Sheng,

191
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,720
don't scare her.

192
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,160
Sister,

193
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,670
you're spoiling her.

194
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,550
She's clearly making fun of me.

195
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,360
What bad intentions could Lin Yu have?

196
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,870
It's just peeling some grapes.

197
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,080
It doesn't take much effort.

198
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,670
Why be so stingy about it?

199
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,670
It's so sour.

200
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,240
(Wonderful.)

201
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,080
(It's good to have a strong backing.)

202
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,270
(I should have clung to
the leading actress earlier,)

203
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,910
(enjoy the protagonist's halo)

204
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,750
(and handle Mu Sheng.)

205
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,510
Sister Mu Yao,

206
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,000
have some tea, please.

207
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,510
What's wrong with you?

208
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,270
Is your shoulder uncomfortable?

209
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,960
It seems like I accidentally twisted it.

210
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,290
When my neck was uncomfortable before,

211
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,240
It was Sheng who massaged me.

212
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,630
His technique is excellent.

213
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,900
Why don't you have a try?

214
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:32,600
No need.

215
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,030
How could I trouble Young Master Mu?

216
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,480
Why be so polite?

217
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,440
I've already peeled
longan and grapes for you.

218
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,360
Give your shoulders a little massage.

219
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,870
It's no big deal.

220
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,440
I…I'm not in pain anymore.

221
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,870
Young Master Mu, I'm already fine.

222
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,030
- I'm already fine.
- I haven't even started yet.

223
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,260
It hurts!

224
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,110
Go away.

225
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,320
- Help! Help!
- Stop!

226
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,720
Help! Help!

227
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,600
- Sister Mu Yao, help!
- Stop there!

228
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,320
- It doesn't hurt anymore.
- I massage well.

229
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,080
I beg you, please, I was wrong.

230
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,000
How about I peel some fruit for you?

231
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,280
I was wrong.

232
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,920
What are you doing?

233
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,390
What are you doing?

234
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,510
What's that?

235
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,320
Making a fuss over nothing.

236
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,790
It's just a Dust Demon.

237
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,750
Dust Demon?

238
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,870
- Sister.
- Dust Demons are the most minor demons,

239
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,800
and almost have no magical power.

240
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,870
They are as inconspicuous as dust,

241
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,360
hence the name.

242
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,600
(Is this a setting in the book?)

243
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,670
(It's all my fault for being hasty)

244
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,910
(and skipped quite a few chapters.)

245
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,750
(I didn't read the settings carefully.)

246
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,560
So,

247
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,630
are there many demons in this world?

248
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,960
All things have spirits,

249
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,790
whether it is animals or livestock,

250
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,480
plants, or even objects.

251
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,000
If there is fate,

252
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,360
anything can turn into a demon.

253
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,910
Demons are everywhere.

254
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,360
They coexist with us.

255
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,440
There are so many demons.

256
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,390
Can you Demon Catchers handle them all?

257
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,550
Only demons with great magical abilities

258
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,840
can harm humans,

259
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,030
and thus need to be captured.

260
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,720
Dust Demons are as common as mosquitoes.

261
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:41,150
What do other demons look like?

262
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,440
Are you a three-year-old child?

263
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,080
Don't you even have
this basic common sense?

264
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,360
Lin Yu is a young girl

265
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,360
and has been protected well.

266
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,840
It's normal for her not to know this.

267
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,360
What I taught you when you were young?

268
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,840
You explain it carefully to Lin Yu.

269
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,790
The Demon Clan is
divided into nine levels.

270
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,720
The Dust Demon belongs to the first level.

271
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,510
Some rare and special Demon Clans,

272
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,120
blessed by the essence of heaven and earth,

273
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,550
can transform into human shapes
when awakening spiritual intelligence.

274
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,360
Most Demon Clans need to
cultivate to the fourth level

275
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,940
to awaken their spiritual intelligence

276
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,910
and transform into human shapes
at the fifth rank.

277
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,360
The higher the demon level,
the fewer their numbers,

278
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,390
and the rarer to encounter.

279
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,720
A nine-level demon

280
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,450
is even rarer,
appearing only once in a millennium.

281
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,030
Once it appears,

282
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,750
it will be the King of Demons.

283
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,630
Resentful Woman?

284
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,200
Yes.

285
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:01,990
Resentful Woman,

286
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,910
is the strongest and

287
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,030
the most evil demon in the world.

288
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,480
(Isn't that the final boss in the book?)

289
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,270
(I have to defeat her to clear the game.)

290
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:17,360
Do you have any solutions

291
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,270
to defeat the Resentful Woman?

292
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,960
You don't even know about the Dust Demon.

293
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,150
You want to defeat the Resentful Woman?

294
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,440
So ignorant and fearless.

295
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,000
I am just worried.

296
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,750
When it comes into my mind that

297
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,240
there are so terrifying demons,

298
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,630
I can't fall asleep at night.

299
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,680
Rest assured.

300
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,840
We will definitely kill the Resentful Woman.

301
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,920
We endure the hardships of life outdoors

302
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,030
to guard the peace of ordinary people.

303
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:58,480
Moreover, the Resentful Woman
has a blood feud with the Mu Family.

304
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,480
No matter the cost,

305
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,120
I will definitely find her

306
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,390
and kill her.

307
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,510
Sheng,

308
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,320
remember my name.

309
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,670
I

310
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,480
am the Resentful Woman.

311
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,720
Resentful Woman?

312
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,910
Actually, Sister Mu is quite good.

313
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,390
She is cool and generous.

314
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:03,670
We can consider ourselves as sisters now.

315
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,720
(Lin Yu is a fake friend
of the leading actress,)

316
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,080
(pretending to be sincere,)

317
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,600
(scheming against her all day.)

318
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,960
(But now, I really like Sister Mu.)

319
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,120
(I don't know if this continues,)

320
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,600
(will the plot progress more smoothly?)

321
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,550
Task three for a beginner:

322
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,200
please go to Mu Yao's bedroom,

323
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:32,120
and destroy the family heirloom
that Mu Yao is repairing,

324
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,480
Hundred Demons Mountain and Sea Map.

325
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,270
(It's written in the book that)

326
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,790
(Hundred Demons Mountain and Sea Map
is the Mu Family's heirloom.)

327
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,870
(It can reveal the movements of demons,)

328
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,200
(but it was damaged several decades ago.)

329
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,000
(Mu Yao carries it with her,)

330
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,910
(collecting spiritual power
from all over the world,)

331
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,960
(attempting to repair it,)

332
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,150
(hoping to find the Resentful Woman
who has been missing for years,)

333
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,560
(to avenge the family.)

334
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:01,240
(Mu Sheng suspects that
Liu Fuyi wants to steal this map)

335
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,840
(and argues with Mu Yao.)

336
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,400
Sister, are you so sure

337
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,030
Liu Fuyi's affections toward you

338
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,200
are all genuine and sincere,

339
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,270
without any ulterior motive?

340
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,840
I believe it.

341
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,160
What if he approached you
from the very beginning

342
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:24,030
just for this Hundred Demons
Mountain and Sea Map?

343
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,070
Sister, you have to be cautious.

344
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,670
Nonsense.

345
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,720
Fuyi is upright and honest.

346
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,240
He is not that kind of person.

347
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,440
(This conversation is overheard
by Lin Yu.)

348
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,240
(After the siblings part on bad terms,)

349
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,160
(when Mu Yao falls asleep,)

350
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,240
(Lin Yu secretly burns this map.)

351
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,030
(If Brother Liu truly approaches you)

352
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,720
(for this map,)

353
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,500
(Hundred Demons Mountain and Sea Map)
(and I burn it,)

354
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:44,920
(Brother Liu will have no reason
to stay with you,)

355
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,160
(isn't it?)

356
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,920
This plot is so retarded.

357
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,750
Two such powerful Demon Catchers

358
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,350
are discussing matters inside the house.

359
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,240
How could the weak supporting actress

360
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,680
not be discovered when eavesdropping?

361
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,750
They said it's an important

362
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,800
trea…

363
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,480
treasure.

364
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,640
Don't they know to hide it properly?

365
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,750
(If burning the picture is a must,)

366
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,750
(why should she burn it
in the leading actress' room?)

367
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,480
(Isn't she afraid of the lead actress
waking up?)

368
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,200
(Without fifty years of cerebral thrombosis,)

369
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,000
(one couldn't write such an absurd plot.)

370
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,920
(The most ridiculous thing is now)

371
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,310
(I have to personally
go through this lousy plot.)

372
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,590
It's really annoying.

373
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,270
I have to finish
this part of the main storyline.

374
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,150
Sister,

375
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,480
are you so sure

376
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,960
Lin Yu's closeness to you

377
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,640
is genuine and sincere,

378
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,960
without any other motives?

379
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,000
I believe.

380
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,200
But what if she intended
from the very beginning to…

381
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,390
To do what?

382
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,720
Although I don't know why,

383
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,750
she definitely has ulterior motives.

384
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,990
Sister, you must be on guard.

385
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,200
Lin Yu is gentle and kind.

386
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:03,880
She is not that kind of person.

387
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:10,550
What is there to guard against her?

388
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,310
Lin Yu is the daughter
of a County Magistrate,

389
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,400
lacks neither gold nor silver,

390
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,400
and has no interest in magical arts.

391
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,000
What could she possibly want from me?

392
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,720
She…

393
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,790
Maybe she is doing it for Liu Fuyi.

394
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:26,720
Fuyi?

395
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,350
No.

396
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:31,720
It doesn't seem quite right.

397
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,010
I don't know.

398
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,640
Anyway,

399
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,070
she just doesn't have good intentions.

400
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,440
You're here again.

401
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,680
Is it that I have a new friend

402
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,030
makes you feel uneasy?

403
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,200
You lived in the Mu Family since childhood,

404
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,960
and had no friends of the same age,

405
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,200
only the two of us kept each other company.

406
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,880
Along this journey,

407
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:04,240
the only person you can wholeheartedly trust

408
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,350
is me alone.

409
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,440
Whether it's Fuyi

410
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,110
or Lin Yu,

411
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,240
you are unwilling to open your heart
and make friends.

412
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,440
I understand you.

413
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,790
I don't blame you.

414
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,350
But, in the future,

415
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,240
I hope you

416
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,070
can open your heart

417
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,000
and trust others,

418
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:32,310
because there are many lovely

419
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,160
and trustworthy people in this world.

420
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,240
(The leading actress Mu Yao is good,)

421
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,880
(but just a bit too saintly.)

422
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,310
(If it weren't for the protagonist's halo,)

423
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,310
(she probably wouldn't survive long.)

424
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:52,790
(As a person,)

425
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,750
(how can she be so naïve?)

426
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,270
So,

427
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,590
you've decided to treat
Lin Yu as your friend.

428
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,750
Actually, I don't know

429
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,880
how to get along with girls of the same age.

430
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,480
I always thought that as Demon Catchers,

431
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,680
we would seem strange to ordinary girls,

432
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,030
but Lin Yu is really nice.

433
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,680
Chatting with her is relaxing and joyful.

434
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,510
If she thinks the same way,

435
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,800
I think

436
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,310
she should be my first

437
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,640
bosom friend.

438
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:27,750
I quit.

439
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,640
Why do I have to do

440
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,070
such a thing that upsets others?

441
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,680
Silly Mu Yao, Mu Sheng is right.

442
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,000
I'm not a good person at all.

443
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,880
(Qingyue Pavilion)
You shouldn't trust me so much.

444
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,160
What a bad system!

445
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,010
You are cold-blooded, shameless

446
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:40,950
and selfish.

447
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,160
Listen, I'm not going to be this
vicious supporting actress anymore.

448
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,750
At worst, I'll never complete the game.

449
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,070
What's the big deal about that?

450
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:13,160
(Forget it,
why am I taking a book seriously?)

451
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,310
(I'd move on with the plot.)

452
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,440
(No need to overthink it.)

453
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,110
Alright, it's getting late.

454
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,000
Go back and sleep.

455
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:28,950
Sister,

456
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,030
you haven't been sleeping well lately.

457
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,200
This is a calming talisman.

458
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,200
Alright, leave now.

459
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,240
Sister Mu Yao.

460
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,900
(Hundred Demons Mountain and Sea Map)

461
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,440
(Fu Zhou writes it like this.)

462
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,310
(Sister Mu, I'm sorry.)

463
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,720
(I didn't mean to do it.)

464
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,440
(Is there no other way?)

465
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,070
(No, wait.)

466
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,880
(Even if there's just a little.)

467
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,160
What to do?

468
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,830
(Such an important treasure
is too easily burned.)

469
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,030
(I only save this little bit.)

470
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,880
Mu…

471
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,720
Young Master Mu.

472
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,480
I just want to ask you,

473
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,480
in the dead of night,

474
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,440
what were you doing

475
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,510
in my sister's room?

476
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,310
I...

477
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,560
I…

478
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,790
My Sister's Mountain and Sea Map is…

479
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,560
Burned.

480
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,390
You…

481
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,960
Young Master Mu, are you sleepwalking?

482
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,640
I just want to ask you,

483
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,310
in the dead of night,

484
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,200
what were you doing

485
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,680
in my sister's room?

486
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,030
I couldn't fall asleep.

487
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,030
So I came out for a walk.

488
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,270
What's wrong? Is it illegal?

489
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,920
Can you explain

490
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,240
why my sister's

491
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,070
Hundred Demons Mountain and Sea Map

492
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,400
is hidden in your clothes?

493
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,110
No.

494
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,880
I don't believe it.

495
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,590
In the dead of night,

496
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,310
what were you doing

497
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,830
in my sister's room?

498
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,640
I didn't do anything.

499
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,720
If you don't believe me, search me.

500
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:18,790
(Passed?)

501
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,750
You act stealthily

502
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,200
and repeatedly cause trouble.

503
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,920
Although I've been monitoring you for days,

504
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,350
I haven't caught any evidence against you.

505
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,680
But it's the safest to kill you.

506
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,920
Bro, don't be so ruthless.

507
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,160
(There's evidence against me, I will die.)

508
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,590
(There's no evidence against me,
I will still die.)

509
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,480
(This is unreasonable.)

510
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,480
I'm waiting for you.

511
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,920
How did you know I was coming?

512
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:50,310
(Nonsense.)

513
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,440
(You've killed me three times today.)

514
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,480
I guessed it.

515
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,110
Since that's the case,

516
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,240
what exactly is your purpose?

517
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,880
(I have no purpose at all.)

518
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,920
(I just want to survive.)

519
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,790
You act stealthily

520
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:05,880
and repeatedly cause trouble.

521
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,350
Although I've been monitoring you for days,

522
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,720
I haven't caught any evidence against you.

523
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,720
But…

524
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,920
But I like you.

525
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,200
I act stealthily

526
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,880
because I am following you.

527
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:21,830
I repeatedly cause trouble,

528
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,110
because I want to look at you more.

529
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,840
That's right.

530
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,680
I like you.

531
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:31,160
I like you so much that
I don't know what to do.

532
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,070
How is it? Is it okay?

533
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,160
Is it alright now?

534
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,240
When exactly do you want to let me go?

535
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,000
Wishful thinking.

536
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,270
(This tsundere character.)

537
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,790
Congratulations, host.

538
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,070
You have finished the third task.

539
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:12,550
You have completed all the tasks
for a beginner.

540
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,820
(Qingyue Pavilion)

541
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,880
What impressive skills!

542
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,520
Sheng,

543
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,270
shall we have a sparring match?

544
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,560
No need.

545
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:14,640
You are a renowned busy person.

546
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,510
Why waste time?

547
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,590
Sheng,

548
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,720
we've been together for so long.

549
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,070
Why are you still being so distant?

550
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,440
Then I'll ask you something.

551
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,150
Please go ahead.

552
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,920
How long do you plan to
cling to my sister?

553
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,110
Gone.

554
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,510
What is gone?

555
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,780
Hundred Demons Mountain and Sea Map.

556
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,960
Which one should I choose?

557
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,680
Wan, come over and help me choose.

558
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,270
It's like this,

559
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,000
I have a friend,

560
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:17,000
she accidentally caused
trouble for someone.

561
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,680
She felt bad about it

562
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,640
and wanted to give a gift as compensation.

563
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,110
What do you think about this?

564
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,520
Miss,

565
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,240
this is crafted by top artisans
from the Western Regions,

566
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,960
Lily Pattern Gemstone Hairpin.

567
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,350
It's even rarely seen in the palace.

568
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,440
But it looks a bit tacky, doesn't it?

569
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,000
How about this one?

570
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,200
This seems a bit too plain.

571
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,830
Miss, this…

572
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,550
This one is quite unique.

573
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,400
It's quite heavy, too.

574
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,350
Is this expensive?

575
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,090
This Inlaid Pearl and
Butterfly Hairpin is priceless.

576
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,480
When you were 15, you said you want it.

577
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,750
The master went through great difficulties…

578
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,790
Is it expensive or not?

579
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:11,950
Expensive.

580
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,440
This is the most expensive one.

581
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,640
Expensive is correct.

582
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,790
If it's too cheap,
I'm afraid it won't be presentable.

583
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,040
I'll choose it.

584
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:19,950
Miss.

585
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,280
Miss.

586
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,300
(Qingyue Pavilion)

587
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:29,000
Hundred Demons Mountain and Sea Map
was burned completely,

588
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,450
except for this broken fragment.

589
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,350
If it weren't for
the leakage of spiritual energy,

590
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,550
I'm afraid I wouldn't find this fragment.

591
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,160
Where was this found?

592
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,960
At the bottom of the pond
in the West Courtyard.

593
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,200
Sister Mu, I have a gift for you.

594
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,720
You are chatting.

595
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,160
I won't disturb you for now.

596
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,350
Miss Lin, please wait.

597
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,840
Miss Lin,

598
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,350
is there anything suspicious
in your mansion lately?

599
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,200
For example, strangers break in?

600
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,480
No.

601
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:03,720
Miss Lin, do you have any impression
of this map fragment?

602
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,000
No.

603
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,480
To be honest,

604
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,440
Yao lost something important.

605
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:18,280
It seems a thief came to your mansion.

606
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,350
Thief?

607
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,710
- That is serious…
- Sister.

608
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,880
This matter won't be over.

609
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,960
I will do whatever

610
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:29,710
to catch this thief.

611
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:36,070
The pond in the West Courtyard
is not shallow.

612
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,440
Young Master Liu,
you can find this fragment

613
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,400
with just a trace of spiritual energy.

614
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,470
You are so skillful.

615
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,190
Tracing energy

616
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,360
is just an ordinary skill.

617
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:47,510
Are you tracing energy
or predicting the future?

618
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:49,760
What do you mean by that?

619
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,280
You just said

620
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,320
Hundred Demons Mountain and Sea Map is

621
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,600
a treasure wanted by all Demon Catchers.

622
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,550
What about you?

623
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,390
Sheng,

624
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,770
you're going too far with this statement.

625
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,200
Miss Lin,

626
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,920
please call all the guards in your mansion,

627
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:06,880
and ask them one by one

628
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,230
whether I approached Yao's
bedroom these days.

629
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,470
No problem.

630
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,070
Asking might not yield any answers.

631
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:18,000
I have a simple solution.

632
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,000
This is the Heartburn Curse.

633
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,000
As long as this curse is applied,

634
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,070
one will reveal everything in no time.

635
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,150
I mean,

636
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:38,960
we gather everyone who
interacted with my sister

637
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:41,630
from the day before yesterday to today,

638
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,480
and use this curse for interrogation.

639
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,840
They couldn't stay silent.

640
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,760
And you, Miss Lin,

641
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,920
you sneaked around the pond last night

642
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,150
and told lies,

643
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:57,190
could it be that they are your accomplices?

644
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,960
- No, no.
- Since Liu Fuyi doesn't admit it,

645
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,480
we'll start with you.

646
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,500
Sheng.

647
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:07,470
You feel heartache?

648
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,920
Even unreasonable troublemaking
should have its limits.

649
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,670
Usually, out of respect for Yao,

650
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,630
I respect you and protect you,

651
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,470
but this time,

652
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,630
I have no choice but to reprimand you
as an elder brother.

653
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,920
Unreasonable troublemaking?

654
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,550
All I seek is the truth.

655
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,360
I came to my sister's room yesterday.

656
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,150
I won't bother you.

657
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,190
I will take this curse first.

658
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:46,400
I, Mu Sheng, swear to the heavens

659
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,900
that I've never stolen the
Hundred Demons Mountain and Sea Map.

660
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:52,320
If I tell lies,
I will be struck by the lightning!

661
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,590
Miss Lin,

662
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,360
