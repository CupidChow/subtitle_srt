00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,180
=Episode 23=

3
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,200
By the Mandate of Heaven,
the Emperor decrees:

4
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,070
Dowager Consort Zhao,
who has trusted treacherous people,

5
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,710
done many wrongs and accumulated
resentment among the people,

6
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,250
deserves the utmost punishment.

7
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,300
Considering her status
as the Emperor's mother,

8
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,320
she is deprived of her title

9
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,790
and permanently confined
to the Cold Palace,

10
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,810
without meeting the Emperor until death.

11
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,170
By Emperor.

12
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,310
Min,

13
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,160
Min.

14
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,680
Min…

15
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,380
The Princess asked me to tell you

16
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,410
that she is feeling overwhelmed

17
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,450
and needs some time to calm down.

18
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,020
Once she resolves her inner turmoil,

19
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,050
she will request permission from
His Majesty to come to see you.

20
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,780
I have told so many lies,

21
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,690
trying to hide the truth
from the world for ten years.

22
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,810
But the person I most wanted to
hide it from was my daughter.

23
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,780
Now she knows the truth.

24
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,580
She resents and hates me.

25
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,500
It is what I deserve.

26
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,810
If you hadn't gone to
such lengths before,

27
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,200
and clarified the facts earlier,

28
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,250
admitting your mistakes,

29
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,600
the Princess wouldn't be
so disappointed in you.

30
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,530
It's easier said than done.

31
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,580
As parents,

32
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,840
we always want to show the best side

33
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,140
to our children.

34
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,330
Cultivator Mu,

35
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:11,410
what did you come to see me today for?

36
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,290
The Jade Token promise
has been completed,

37
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,100
so I am here
to fulfill the entrusted task,

38
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,120
and also to seek an answer.

39
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,180
Previously, Your Highness mentioned

40
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,380
this Mu's Jade Token

41
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,930
was a gift from my father.

42
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,680
But why did my father

43
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,250
give such an important token

44
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,930
to Your Highness?

45
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,970
When constructing Xingshan Hall,

46
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,940
your father passed by
the Imperial Capital

47
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,180
and happened to see the foundation and
blueprints of Xingshan Hall,

48
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,630
so he specially entered the palace to
present this Jade Token to me,

49
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:48,980
instructing me that,

50
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,880
when the hall is completed,

51
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,970
use this token to summon him.

52
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,530
At the inception of Xingshan Hall,
my father already knew

53
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,130
about the foundation and the blueprints?

54
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,550
Yes.

55
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,130
Your father is a remarkable person
in this world.

56
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,130
I have always held him in high regard.

57
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,710
I inquired about the site selection
of Xingshan Hall

58
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,900
and how the feng shui was.

59
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,970
He did not answer any of them,

60
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,970
but repeatedly asked me

61
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,660
not to let others know about
the Jade Token.

62
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,810
Now it seems that

63
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,940
perhaps your father had already realized

64
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,570
that Xingshan Hall was an ominous hall.

65
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:31,810
And then?

66
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,970
Two years later, the hall was completed.

67
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,570
I used the Jade Token as promised.

68
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,060
Your father did come.

69
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,190
He spent several days

70
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,130
carefully inspecting Xingshan Hall.

71
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,240
Afterward,

72
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,250
I was reminded

73
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,940
that Tao Ying's words
should not be fully trusted.

74
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,570
To ensure security,

75
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,290
I'd better

76
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,120
use an ordinary family's child

77
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,180
to replace Min.

78
00:03:58,770 --> 00:03:59,730
What do you mean by this?

79
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,380
Cultivator Mu,

80
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,780
haven't you considered that?

81
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,810
Xingshan Hall is

82
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,380
of great importance to me.

83
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,010
Without the instruction of a master,

84
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,240
how could I dare to use a girl
with the same birth time

85
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,470
to replace Min

86
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,940
as the most important Saintess
in the formation?

87
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,000
This is impossible.

88
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,970
My father…

89
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,850
If my father knew
something was unusual in the hall,

90
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,580
he would inform you in advance

91
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,850
to terminate the ceremony.

92
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,510
He would never come up with

93
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,410
such a reckless compromise.

94
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,370
Zhao Qinru,

95
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,660
at this point,

96
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,820
you are still shirking responsibility

97
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,140
and blaming others.

98
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,830
Cultivator Mu,

99
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,020
how much do you know about your father?

100
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,420
My father is upright and honest,

101
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,180
hating evil very much.

102
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,260
Everyone in the world knows that.

103
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,100
If I say,

104
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,260
on the night of the great fire
at Xingshan Hall,

105
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,820
someone helped me
lock the doors tightly.

106
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,380
That person was your father,

107
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,100
would you believe it?

108
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:35,580
(Xingshan Hall)

109
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:57,900
Why?

110
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,220
Afterward, your father explained

111
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,500
that the situation was
extremely dangerous.

112
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,300
If he hadn't sealed
the formation in time,

113
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,620
the situation would have spiraled
out of his control.

114
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,340
Whether these words are the truth

115
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,700
is something that I'm not sure now.

116
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,180
Perhaps from the very beginning,

117
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,620
your father had already anticipated

118
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,420
everything that would eventually happen.

119
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,940
Perhaps Tao Ying, I

120
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,540
and that demon hidden within the hall

121
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,220
are all part of
your father's calculations.

122
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,580
As parents,

123
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,440
we always want to show the best side

124
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,540
to our children.

125
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,900
Who would want their children to see

126
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,260
their ugly side?

127
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:03,940
Yao.

128
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,060
I don't believe it.

129
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,980
The Dowager Consort's words
are just one-sided.

130
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,620
It cannot be fully trusted.

131
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,220
From childhood to adulthood,

132
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,660
I have always wanted to
become someone like my father.

133
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,400
I don't believe my father
would do such a thing.

134
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,580
Yao,

135
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,020
go to Liaoran Valley with me.

136
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,780
Let's go see my Master.

137
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,060
I don't have answers to your questions,

138
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,060
but my Master might have them.

139
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,340
Why?

140
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:37,900
Cultivator Mu,

141
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,700
Cultivator Liu,

142
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,460
I've been looking for you
for a long time.

143
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,660
Well,

144
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,220
where is the Guardian Master?

145
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,340
We must invite him

146
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,900
to visit the Astronomical Bureau.

147
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,300
You're looking for Sheng.

148
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:53,890
What's the matter?

149
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,500
The catastrophe of heaven
is approaching.

150
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,660
When the Blood Moon is in the sky,

151
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,500
it is the day when
the catastrophe of heaven reappears.

152
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,660
We observed the celestial phenomena
at night.

153
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,700
After painstaking research
for several days, we discovered

154
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:13,820
that there are only three years left
until this great disaster.

155
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,220
This….

156
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,460
Your Lordship,

157
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,140
everything depends on you.

158
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,300
But I am not the Guardian Master.

159
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,150
900 years ago,

160
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,900
when the ancestor of the Mu Family
mended the heavens,

161
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,020
she used this divine weapon.

162
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,450
Now that you have drawn it,

163
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,260
the responsibility of saving the world

164
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,500
falls upon your shoulders.

165
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,260
What does this have to do with me?

166
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,550
What is the job
of your Astronomical Bureau?

167
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,400
You cannot leave.

168
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,890
You must not leave.

169
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,580
Stay calm.

170
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,700
Stay calm.

171
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,140
Everyone, listen to me for a moment.

172
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,100
I have just one thing to say.

173
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,860
Just now His Lordship did not
say anything about

174
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,180
not saving the world, right?

175
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,220
He only mentioned how to save it,

176
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,890
and no one knows the solution, right?

177
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,150
According to the record
of the Tianji Pavilion,

178
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,460
900 years ago,

179
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,180
when the catastrophe of heaven arrived,

180
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,940
the Guardian Master, Mu Qingshi,

181
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,820
took the divine weapon
and formed a great formation

182
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,480
to break the demonic shadow
and mend the sky crack,

183
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,180
saving the world from peril.

184
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,180
Now,

185
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,180
the Guardian Master
and the divine weapon are present.

186
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,500
But

187
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,940
how to form the great formation?

188
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,820
How to break the demonic shadow?

189
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,380
How to mend the sky crack?

190
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,620
Isn't there a solution?

191
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,540
Moreover,

192
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,660
everyone,

193
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,500
do not forget,

194
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,060
the Astronomical Bureau

195
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:51,380
has always taken it upon itself
to save the world from peril.

196
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,020
We have never stood by idly.

197
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,460
We must fully assist the Guardian Master

198
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,540
to devise strategies
and face the catastrophe of heaven.

199
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,540
Isn't that right?

200
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,580
- Yes, that's right.
- That's right.

201
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,380
Could this immense contribution

202
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,780
belong to the Guardian Master alone?

203
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,620
Chief Guo is correct.

204
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,990
Speaking of the great formation
and the demonic shadow,

205
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,700
I vaguely remember
that more than a decade ago,

206
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,460
no, seven or eight years ago,

207
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,220
a strange person came here
to borrow some books.

208
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,900
He was talking nonsense that day,

209
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,470
saying that the catastrophe of heaven
was coming.

210
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,820
Since it was coming,

211
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,940
we had to prepare
and set up the great formation

212
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,100
as soon as possible.

213
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,580
At that time we thought

214
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,700
he was just a raving lunatic.

215
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,180
No one paid attention.

216
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:44,900
But now it seems
his every word has come true.

217
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,540
- Yes.
- Yes.

218
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,060
Since this person has
such prophetic abilities,

219
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,540
he should know a lot about

220
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,940
the catastrophe of heaven.

221
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,180
What is his name?

222
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,460
His name…

223
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,180
It's been so long
that I can't remember it.

224
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,220
The name…

225
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,600
Right, it's Mr. Wenxin.

226
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,620
Where is he now?

227
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,820
How can we find him?

228
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,460
I can't say for sure either.

229
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,100
Think over.

230
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,300
- This…
- This…

231
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,820
I know

232
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,140
where Mr. Wenxin is.

233
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,340
What?

234
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,340
Mr. Wenxin is your Master?

235
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,500
Yes.

236
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,490
My Master has been in seclusion
for many years,

237
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,180
never stepping out of Liaoran Valley.

238
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,460
In this world, those who know his name

239
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:36,620
are very few.

240
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,380
You are renowned worldwide,

241
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,530
yet your Master has always been
a mystery.

242
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,380
You used to say

243
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,660
that your Master was
an unknown cultivator.

244
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,510
Now it seems he must be not so simple.

245
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,300
To be honest,

246
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,540
I once thought

247
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,180
he was just an unknown cultivator.

248
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:57,890
Until I completed my cultivation,

249
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,700
I carried his Empyrean Demon Trap Tower
as I roamed the world,

250
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,340
and people were all amazed,

251
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,950
saying that an ordinary person
couldn't wield such a magical weapon.

252
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,220
Only then did I realize

253
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,040
that my Master might have an
extraordinary background.

254
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,320
What makes him extraordinary?

255
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,580
I don't know where he comes from,

256
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,860
or even his name.

257
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,740
Even you don't know?

258
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,220
That is quite extraordinary.

259
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,780
Ever since I met my Master,

260
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,820
he has been living in seclusion,

261
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,420
only referring to himself as Mr. Wenxin.

262
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,380
He said who he used to be

263
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,900
is no longer important.

264
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,380
So you never asked?

265
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,340
I have always followed
my Master's orders,

266
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,700
almost never questioning him.

267
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,900
Actually, my Master asked me
to get close to you,

268
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,940
and although I don't know
the exact reason,

269
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,060
I think he must have his intentions.

270
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,940
As for the truth
about your father's past,

271
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,090
I believe he will have the answers.

272
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,300
That's why I suggested

273
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,060
that you go back with me to see him.

274
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,420
It's so coincidental.

275
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,660
Your Master happens to know about
the catastrophe of heaven.

276
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,440
Has he mentioned it to you before?

277
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,180
No, never.

278
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,700
These past days,

279
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,700
I have had many doubts in my heart, too.

280
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,900
What are we waiting for?

281
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,820
Let's go directly to ask him in person.

282
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,180
Miaomiao is right.

283
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,980
I'll lead the way.
Let's set off tomorrow.

284
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:24,860
Sheng,

285
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,260
since the Crescent has recognized
you as its new master,

286
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,820
you should take it with you.

287
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,700
Sister,

288
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,580
what is the Astronomical Bureau like?

289
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,800
We are not unaware of it.

290
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,140
Why take it so seriously?

291
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,580
This matter is significant.

292
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,060
At least, we should investigate it
thoroughly first.

293
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,460
We need to hire a larger carriage.

294
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,420
We don't have enough space
for all the luggage.

295
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,060
Miaomiao still wants to carry
all the bags with her.

296
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,420
It seems this time it's not Miaomiao.

297
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,500
Sister Mu, look at him.

298
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,300
I told you not to bring so much.

299
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,780
This is too much?
It's already very little.

300
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,060
Look, we don't know

301
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,140
what accommodation we'll find.

302
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,740
We should take familiar bedding.

303
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,710
Otherwise you won't sleep well.

304
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,740
Autumn is approaching.

305
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,650
Warm clothes for the cold weather
are also necessary.

306
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,220
What about the pillow?

307
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,780
This is accustomed by Miaomiao.

308
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,060
Take it.

309
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,860
Cuicui,

310
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,860
go to the kitchen

311
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,980
and bring the bowls and chopsticks
that Miaomiao used.

312
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,780
Well,

313
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,100
we won't need this iron pot, right?

314
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,230
It's too heavy.

315
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,260
Didn't you say
that this kind of iron pot

316
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,420
makes the food taste better?

317
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,180
Go ahead.

318
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,700
Treat me as an errand runner again.

319
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,140
It seems we do need to
hire a larger carriage.

320
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,420
Cultivators,

321
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,900
the Marquis knows that you are
departing the capital today,

322
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,340
so he specially sent me to see you off.

323
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,340
Here is some gold

324
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,300
for your travel expenses.

325
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,900
This won't be necessary.

326
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,450
As wandering in the world,

327
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,940
it's not convenient
to take too much wealth.

328
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,370
Many thanks to the Marquis
for assisting in subduing the demon.

329
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,740
We can consider him a friend now.

330
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,580
The Marquis has
a few important words to say.

331
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,660
He wants to invite you for a chat alone.

332
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,340
What needs to be said privately?

333
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,900
You'll know once you go.

334
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:36,860
Young Master Mu,

335
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,580
please.

336
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,420
Me?

337
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:40,900
Yes.

338
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,940
The person the Marquis
wants to invite is you.

339
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,580
Looking for me?

340
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,380
Yes.

341
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,620
It seems

342
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,380
you indeed resemble Father

343
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,540
more than I do.

344
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,220
I have already investigated.

345
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,780
You and I

346
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,780
are half-brothers.

347
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,180
I have no parents.

348
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,620
Parents are the origin of one's life.

349
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,100
Everyone has an origin.

350
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,300
But I do not.

351
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,340
I would rather not.

352
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,340
Brother Ziqi,

353
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,260
no matter how you view your identity,

354
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,860
since I already know

355
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,180
Father's previous secret,

356
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,260
I cannot pretend to be indifferent.

357
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,620
Whether you admit it or not,

358
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,380
you are my elder brother.

359
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,540
If you want kinship,

360
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,060
I'm sorry,

361
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,060
but I'm not interested in you.

362
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,860
When I was little,

363
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,540
I always felt particularly lonely,

364
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,380
hoping for a brother to accompany me.

365
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,220
But now I understand,

366
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,460
you and I

367
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,020
only share the same bloodline,

368
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,180
without a sibling bond.

369
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,820
That's right.

370
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,980
I really envy you.

371
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,380
Envy me?

372
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:49,980
Yes.

373
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,940
Miss Mu takes great care of you.

374
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,540
The term "sibling"

375
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,740
is not about blood relations,

376
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,940
but about spending time together

377
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,460
and the bond of mutual trust and loyalty.

378
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,100
You live freely
and can do whatever you want,

379
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,940
unburdened by worldly concerns.

380
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,860
You can share mutual affection
with your beloved,

381
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,380
accompanying each other.

382
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,100
Nothing in the world can hinder you.

383
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,010
These are what Father pursued
all his life,

384
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,820
yet never attained,

385
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,220
and also what I envy.

386
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,420
These are the things I do not have,

387
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,460
but you have them all.

388
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,860
It sounds a bit bitter

389
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,620
and some relief.

390
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,700
I originally thought

391
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,980
the one who has everything

392
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,620
is you.

393
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,900
If I trade these things with you,

394
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,820
are you willing?

395
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,980
No, I'm not.

396
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,020
If it were me,

397
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,500
I wouldn't either.

398
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,820
By the way,

399
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,820
here's something for you.

400
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,340
This should belong to your mother.

401
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,780
If you ever meet her one day,

402
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,860
return it to her.

403
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,340
I don't even know

404
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,860
if she is still alive.

405
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,340
Just in case.

406
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,540
It's getting late,

407
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,980
I won't hold you up any longer.

408
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,180
Safe journey.

409
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:44,100
(Tea)

410
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:44,980
Everyone,

411
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,540
do you remember this tea stall?

412
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,540
It holds special significance.

413
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,780
Yes, I remember.

414
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,220
Back then Miaomiao gave us the name

415
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,860
"Four Bamboo Masters".

416
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,380
We will wander the world,

417
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,100
can't we change the name?

418
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,220
No, we can't.

419
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,780
In the battle of the capital,

420
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,570
we have already made the name of

421
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:08,620
the Four Bamboo Masters famous.

422
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:10,500
When we are used to it,

423
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,380
this name sounds quite nice.

424
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,100
Ziqi really has good taste.

425
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,020
This time, thanks to Miaomiao

426
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,140
for reminding us of unity

427
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,020
when we arrived in the capital.

428
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,540
By the way,

429
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,580
back then Miaomiao

430
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,060
kept reminding me
to keep away from women,

431
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,700
how did you foresee it?

432
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,420
I don't know

433
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,060
why I would say such things.

434
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:37,620
But ever since Xingshan Hall,

435
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,620
my memory seems to have worsened,

436
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,500
and many things are fragmented.

437
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,060
I don't quite remember.

438
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:49,340
An ominous sign from the heavens
indicates a turbulent year.

439
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:51,100
Inside Miaomiao's body,

440
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,780
a rainbow inner core
suddenly emerged.

441
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,700
Ziqi drew out the Crescent.

442
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,300
These are all quite unusual.

443
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:03,060
It seems we can only seek
Mr. Wenxin for answers.

444
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,540
Try this?

445
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,180
No, I dare not.

446
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,020
Still eating?

447
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,620
You dare not?

448
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,300
Hand over the money to me.

449
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,570
- Put it there.
- Hurry up.

450
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,750
- Take it out.
- Take it out.

451
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,220
Hand over all the money to me.

452
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,820
Spare me.

453
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,660
Please spare me.

454
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:27,900
Behave yourself.

455
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,620
Sir, this is a small business.

456
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,060
Please spare me.

457
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:34,940
So little money?

458
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:36,860
Chief,

459
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,900
look at those people from the capital.

460
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,980
They must have a lot of money.

461
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,420
Ignorant little thief.

462
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,780
Sheng,

463
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,020
just teach them a lesson.

464
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,340
It's too much to bully others with power.

465
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,980
Little girl, do you want to stand out?

466
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,460
She doesn't even need talisman paper

467
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,020
to knock people down
with internal force.

468
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,180
This is truly astonishing.

469
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:30,220
Come on, everyone.

470
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,700
Is there anything else I need to do?

471
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,380
Wait a moment.

472
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,460
Alright, stop showing off.

473
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,620
Is it necessary to use magic skills
for such a small matter?

474
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,780
Are you jealous
of my extraordinary talent?

475
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,380
What am I jealous of you for?

476
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,540
You haven't learned much
about talismans and spells.

477
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,940
Don't let your inner core
be full of brute force.

478
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,980
I've finally become this strong.

479
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,740
It's my turn to protect you.

480
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,860
I have to show off a bit.

481
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,300
Miaomiao, Sheng,

482
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,380
come and eat.

483
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,020
Coming!

484
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,700
- Here you are.
- I can make the horse disappear.

485
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,460
Eat.

486
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,020
The road ahead is rugged.

487
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,740
The carriage can't go any further.

488
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,860
We can only walk from here.

489
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,570
Fortunately,
the entrance to Liaoran Valley

490
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,780
is not far ahead.

491
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,260
Fuyi,

492
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,700
what kind of person is your Master?

493
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,620
My Master is very kind and compassionate.

494
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,380
He is a very easygoing old man.

495
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,820
I believe he will definitely like you.

496
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,820
Yao, the water pouch is empty.

497
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,420
Could you go fetch some water?

498
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,500
Sure.

499
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,900
Brother Liu, would you like some fruit?

500
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,460
Sheng,

501
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,660
come with me.

502
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,020
I have something to tell you.

503
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,740
Why can't you say it here?

504
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:26,940
There's no outsider here.

505
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:27,980
Yes.

506
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,250
Among the Four Bamboo Masters,

507
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,460
there are no secrets, right?

508
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,220
Alright then.

509
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,500
Give me your hand.

510
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,740
What for?

511
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,340
What are you doing? That's disgusting.

512
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,460
This is a barrier talisman.

513
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,260
My Master set up a Mirror Formation

514
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,020
at the valley entrance

515
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,100
as a barrier.

516
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:04,780
When you enter the valley,

517
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,380
hold this barrier talisman in your hand

518
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,650
and your demon form will not be revealed.

519
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:08,580
What are you talking about?

520
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,800
What mirror...?

521
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,820
How do you know I am...

522
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,020
A half-demon?

523
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,140
No, it wasn't me.

524
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,820
I didn't say anything.

525
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,500
Of course it wasn't me either.

526
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:38,100
My Master's Mirror Formation is profound.

527
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,700
It can reflect the nature,

528
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,700
and the nature can manifest
into a tangible form.

529
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,420
Those who pass through this formation

530
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,170
will have their nature's form
and shadow

531
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,850
projected onto the stone wall.

532
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,630
Although I'm not sure

533
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:50,980
whether your demon form
will be revealed,

534
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,660
we'd better be cautious.

535
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,780
Liu Fuyi,

536
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,020
did you know long ago that I am…?

537
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:03,940
Yes.

538
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,140
Did you ever tell my…?

539
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:09,780
(Hidden)

540
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,940
Miaomiao has been advising you

541
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,380
to tell these things to Yao.

542
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,180
I know

543
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,620
you have never been ready.

544
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,780
Sheng,

545
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,860
I understand,

546
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,060
some secrets are harder

547
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,620
to speak to those closest to us.

548
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,020
You are the perfect Young Master Fuyi.

549
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,570
What secrets could you possibly have
that can't be spoken?

550
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,420
Don't pretend to understand me.

551
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,340
Ziqi means

552
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,300
he is very grateful to you.

553
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:55,780
These words must be told
to Sister Mu Yao,

554
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,900
but if it wasn't spoken by himself,

555
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,580
it would lack a bit of sincerity.

556
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,340
Fortunately, you remind him.

557
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,660
Here is the entrance to Liaoran Valley.

558
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,020
After I break the formation,

559
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,900
we can pass through one by one.

560
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,660
In Liaoran World,
everything transforms into dust.

561
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,060
Eight doors rotate,
nature makes it open.

562
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,420
Break.

563
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,580
We can pass through now.

564
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:50,900
Okay.

565
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,700
There's a circle over there.

566
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,140
This is the Mirror Formation.

567
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,940
That's Brother Liu's shadow.

568
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,700
Why is it a child?

569
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,500
As I mentioned before,

570
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,060
everyone's form and shadow of the nature

571
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:49,430
will be reflected on the stone wall.

572
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:54,220
So Brother Liu's nature is a child.

573
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,380
I'll give it a try too.

574
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,140
That's really Sister Mu up there.

575
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,060
But she's dressed so impressively.

576
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:19,980
Sheng,

577
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,380
do you remember?

578
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,140
These are Father's attire and sword.

579
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,700
Yes, I remember.

580
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,860
These are the attire of
the Master of the Mu Family.

581
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,650
Interesting.

582
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,340
Really interesting. Let me try it too.

583
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,300
Look.

584
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,460
My shadow is a bamboo forest.

585
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,980
My shadow is a bamboo forest.

586
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,220
I have grown into a bamboo forest.

587
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,060
I am a bamboo forest,

588
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,380
I'm so tall and grand.

589
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,900
See what I said before.

590
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,700
Little shoot, it's my turn.

591
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,300
What does this mean?

592
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,780
Is this Miaomiao?

593
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,940
Why does it look like this?

594
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,260
What are you wearing?

595
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,500
I don't know either.

596
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,620
Logically speaking,

597
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,460
I am now someone
with supreme divine power.

598
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,350
At least

599
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,900
I should look like
the Saintess in the painting.

600
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,940
What does this mean?

601
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,420
It's strange.

602
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,420
The heart is subtle and complex.

603
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,700
You might not understand
your own heart sometimes.

604
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,540
The stone wall only shows the answer,

605
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,980
but why it is this answer

606
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,420
needs to be found out by yourself.

607
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,460
Sheng,

608
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,780
it's your turn.

609
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:38,700
Why is Sheng's shadow

610
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,660
a normal one?

611
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,260
It shows that Ziqi is
consistent inside and out,

612
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,460
with a pure heart.

613
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,940
Yes. That makes sense.

614
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,500
Sister.

615
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,780
Let's go.

616
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,220
Let's go.

617
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:18,100
(Liaoran Valley)

618
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,100
How dare you!

619
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,140
Where did this demon come from?

620
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,540
How dare you trespass
into my Liaoran Valley?

621
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:39,140
(Lu Huai'an, Master of Liu Fuyi)

622
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,660
Master.

623
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,460
Kneel down.

624
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,740
You rebellious disciple.

625
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,240
I bestowed upon you
the Empyrean Demon Trap Tower

626
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,780
to capture all the demons in the world.

627
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,930
Yet you make friends with them

628
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,340
and travel with them,

629
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,980
even helping them deceive me

630
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,300
to pass through the Mirror Formation.

631
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,260
Do you still have the face to see me?

632
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,020
- Master, I…
- What?

633
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,020
Senior,

634
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,260
even if Cuicui is a demon,

635
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,940
he has no intention of hiding it.

636
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,100
We openly pass through the formation.

637
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,820
What do you mean by "deceive"?

638
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,100
Openly?

639
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,460
Is it really open?

640
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,780
Ziqi.

641
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,500
Sheng!

642
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,460
Ziqi, are you alright?

643
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,540
Are you alright?

644
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,500
Yao.

645
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,660
Look carefully,

646
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,900
without the barrier talisman,

647
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,220
what kind of thing is he?

648
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,540
