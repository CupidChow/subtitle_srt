00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,180
=Episode 25=

3
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,580
My question is,

4
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,300
why are you afraid

5
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,120
to enter the Mirror Formation?

6
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,220
Do you want to know what's in my heart?

7
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:06,860
Sure.

8
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,260
Hey, how about a bet?

9
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,100
If you can pick up Crescent

10
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,780
and merge with it like me,

11
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,260
I'll tell you.

12
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,260
Otherwise,

13
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,180
you don't deserve to know,

14
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:21,980
you little brat.

15
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,540
You old fart!

16
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,620
Stop beating around the bush.

17
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,660
Are you playing tricks

18
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,460
to cover up

19
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,590
your elaborate plot?

20
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,820
It's good to be young.

21
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,460
They always imagine things as they like.

22
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,980
Too bad,

23
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,740
they never know

24
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,260
what's more important in life.

25
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,580
Has it crossed your mind

26
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,820
that if you can't save the world,

27
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,940
everyone will die,

28
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,820
including the two of us?

29
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,980
In that case, whether I'm persistent

30
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,420
or wicked,

31
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,100
whether I'm good or bad,

32
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,900
that won't matter anymore,

33
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,660
right?

34
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,620
Am I right?

35
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,860
Don't provoke me.

36
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,060
As a half-demon,

37
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,180
I've endured the worst growing up.

38
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,900
When everything was fine,

39
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,340
they all wanted me to disappear.

40
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,780
When disasters befell them,

41
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,340
they all wanted me to help.

42
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,420
How ridiculous!

43
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,580
Why should I do that?

44
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,940
Why should I take that responsibility?

45
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,300
You're holding a grudge!

46
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,430
Of course.

47
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,020
The world is disgusting

48
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,620
and broken,

49
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,860
so let it fall.

50
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,580
I won't feel bad at all.

51
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,540
Then again, it's also home

52
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,430
to my love,

53
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,380
my family,

54
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,800
my sworn brothers

55
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,560
and my friends.

56
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,100
I'll save the world for their sake.

57
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,460
I'll die for them

58
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,980
if I have to.

59
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,140
So I'm not doing this because of

60
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,060
some noble cause

61
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,940
or others' repeated exhortations,

62
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,780
and it's surely not because of...

63
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,380
you!

64
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,740
"Not because of... you!"

65
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,180
That little brat pushed me!

66
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,980
This is my Master's study.

67
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,820
He has a soft couch.

68
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,660
I brought you a set of bedding

69
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,100
I had usually used.

70
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,780
Everything is clean.

71
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,420
There aren't guest rooms in the valley.

72
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,420
I'm sorry

73
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,180
that you can only rest here.

74
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,900
It's good enough.

75
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,300
No need to apologize.

76
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,540
Fuyi, come here!

77
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,900
Did your Master draw this formation?

78
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,700
It matches his penmanship.

79
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:02,820
What's wrong?

80
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,780
This formation

81
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,420
and my father's in the Xingshan Hall

82
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,300
look identical.

83
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,620
Are you sure?

84
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,700
I'm certain. I saw it.

85
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:12,900
This evil formation

86
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,900
kills innocent people.

87
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,500
It's fueled by the lives around it.

88
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,620
The upright would never use it.

89
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,500
But why did my father set it up,

90
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,740
and why did your Master draw it here?

91
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,100
Did you come alone?

92
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,020
Master,

93
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,340
you left your manuscripts there

94
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,540
to let Yao see them

95
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,460
and come to ask you, right?

96
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,220
Did you fear she couldn't process

97
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:10,900
the truth all of a sudden,

98
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,540
so you came to ask me for her?

99
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,380
Master,

100
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,420
her father,

101
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,140
Master Mu,

102
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,220
what was he like?

103
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,420
Do you remember

104
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,340
when was the last time

105
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,340
I went out of the valley?

106
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,180
Seven years ago.

107
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,990
The Mu Family were annihilated then!

108
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,700
At that time I went out

109
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,620
to find out the truth.

110
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,980
I did go to the Xingshan Hall

111
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,820
and saw the rest

112
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,340
of the formation Huaijiang had left.

113
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,020
And I was able to confirm

114
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,660
that he had set it up
to kill the Resentful Woman

115
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,780
and get her demon core.

116
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,200
Kill the Resentful Woman?

117
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,020
Had he already known

118
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,460
she would soon appear?

119
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,300
He knew that the whole time,

120
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,900
and that she was the cause

121
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,740
of the catastrophe of heaven.

122
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,260
So Master Mu was

123
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,460
doing everything he could
to save the world.

124
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,460
But...

125
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,940
But over 400 people died in that hall...

126
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,060
She's been looking for

127
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,540
an answer to their deaths, right?

128
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:49,820
She wants to be told

129
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,060
that her heroic father

130
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,140
did all that for the right cause.

131
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,820
He wasn't a hypocrite.

132
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,120
20 years ago,

133
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,300
the Prophecy
from the Astronomical Bureau

134
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,980
said the chosen Heavenly Demon Catcher

135
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,660
had been born.

136
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,140
At that time,

137
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,260
Mu Yao was a baby,

138
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,060
while her father was

139
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,540
in his prime,

140
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,660
young and powerful.

141
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,420
His skills were second to none.

142
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,540
Everyone believed

143
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,580
he was

144
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,580
the chosen one.

145
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,580
And he thought so, too.

146
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,780
That's who he was,

147
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,820
proud and arrogant,

148
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,700
always seeing himself as a hero.

149
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,860
But when the Mu Family

150
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,940
were massacred,

151
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,830
he was killed by the Resentful Woman.

152
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,820
He meant to protect everyone,

153
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,700
but in the end

154
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,180
he couldn't even protect his family.

155
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,160
You don't need to tell her the truth.

156
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,960
Just let her know

157
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,080
her father is

158
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,130
a revered hero.

159
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,780
That'll give her a sense of closure.

160
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,500
I have to tell her

161
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,500
everything I know.

162
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,380
No more, no less.

163
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,660
As you said,

164
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,580
she knows me best.

165
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,100
Go ahead then.

166
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:38,900
Master,

167
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,020
I have one last question

168
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,700
that I've kept to myself

169
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,180
all these years.

170
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,220
What is it?

171
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,610
Who exactly is Mr. Wenxin?

172
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:00,980
Are you

173
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,700
getting to the bottom of everything?

174
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,700
I respect you

175
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,500
the most.

176
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,290
And you mean the most to me as a family.

177
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,820
I really want to know the answer.

178
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,380
Does Mu Yao

179
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,140
work well with that weapon

180
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,460
she usually brings?

181
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,460
That chain made of mystic silver is

182
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,820
the best of the best.

183
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,020
It's perfect for her.

184
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,180
Do you know where it came from?

185
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,140
Yao once told me

186
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,260
her father's friend gave it to her

187
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,980
shortly after she was born.

188
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,240
- Look, she's smiling!
- Look at that smile.

189
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,700
She's so adorable when she smiles.

190
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:52,860
Yes.

191
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,300
Hey,

192
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,260
if you like children so much,

193
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,020
you should've got married

194
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,580
to carry on the Lu Family's bloodline,

195
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:02,900
right?

196
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:03,940
That's enough.

197
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,020
The seniors at home

198
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,140
keep nagging me.

199
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,300
You too?

200
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,500
I'm a free man.

201
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,570
I don't want such responsibilities

202
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,860
like you.

203
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,700
Fine.

204
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,420
Don't regret it when you get old.

205
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,460
Bring it in.

206
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,900
This is for my dear niece.

207
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,100
It's...

208
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,420
It's made of mystic silver!

209
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,540
Aren't you sharp?

210
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,020
Such material is bendable and light

211
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,220
with great strength,

212
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,980
perfect for weapons for girls.

213
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,220
I looked everywhere for a year

214
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,420
and found barely enough

215
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,260
to forge this Snow Chain.

216
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,940
I'm lending it to you for now.

217
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,700
I really appreciate it.

218
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:53,980
It's you!

219
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,700
You're Lu Huai'an,

220
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,300
the Demon Catcher

221
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,740
who travelled with Master Mu

222
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,580
and became as famous.

223
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,420
That Lu Huai'an?

224
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,540
Don't say that.

225
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:07,750
I'm not that good.

226
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,250
Yao told me

227
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,940
her father had been looking for you.

228
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,740
He said you were his best friend

229
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,820
and the only person

230
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,060
he could rely on.

231
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,060
As he was to me.

232
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,300
Master,

233
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:33,900
all these years

234
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,100
you'd rather live in seclusion here.

235
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,570
Why didn't you go to see him?

236
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,420
Why didn't I go?

237
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,300
I was too young

238
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,900
to prioritize things in my life.

239
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,380
Not even close.

240
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,010
You aren't even close

241
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,740
to your predecessor's level.

242
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,820
It's over. It's hopeless.

243
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,700
My life will probably end soon.

244
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,380
Whatever!

245
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,620
I quit.

246
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,540
We'll all be doomed.

247
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,180
Don't scare me.

248
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,860
I'm over 1,000 years old.

249
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,060
I'm not scared.

250
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,540
It's just

251
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,220
that the land, the plants,

252
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,180
the foxtail between your teeth,

253
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,830
humans and demons

254
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,660
will all be destroyed soon.

255
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,420
Look,

256
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,620
if I can't conquer this weapon

257
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,460
to save the world,

258
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:48,940
what to do?

259
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:53,940
Young man,

260
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,610
I've pondered that

261
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,780
for more than 900 years

262
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,660
and thought it through.

263
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,660
I've realized something.

264
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,870
Photinia serrulata smells the best.

265
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,380
I should've known

266
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,540
once the catastrophe of heaven strikes,

267
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,370
the world will fall.

268
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,460
Nothing will matter anymore.

269
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,700
When that time comes,

270
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,500
the right thing to do is

271
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,220
to leave no regrets
between you and your love.

272
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,340
Yanyan,

273
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,220
were there a second chance,

274
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,780
I'd tell you I love you.

275
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:48,980
Hey,

276
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,300
where are you going?

277
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,180
I've made no progress.

278
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,590
Staying here is a waste of time.

279
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,180
Wait, you...

280
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,380
Are you quitting?

281
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,340
For real?

282
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,540
Why are you sighing?

283
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,620
I should ask you that.

284
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,100
I'm worried.

285
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,220
Why can't Ziqi

286
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,220
merge with Crescent?

287
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,500
What's the problem?

288
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,020
What's the problem?

289
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,670
Cuicui,

290
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,460
stop imitating me.

291
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,500
Think about it.

292
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,780
If he can draw it out,

293
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,860
he should be able to use it.

294
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,900
He's been practicing hard,

295
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,940
but why can't he succeed?

296
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,740
Why the devil is that?

297
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,740
Why the devil...?

298
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,740
There... There's...

299
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,020
a devil?

300
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,260
Another metaphor?

301
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,300
Hey, young lady.

302
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,600
Can you come to the kitchen?

303
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,260
Coming.

304
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:10,980
Are you coming or not?

305
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,340
What's wrong?

306
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,140
Are you scared

307
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,290
that the world will end,

308
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,780
and so will we?

309
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,540
How could I not be?

310
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,940
We're living in a lovely

311
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,540
and beautiful world.

312
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,180
It's a shame to let it fall.

313
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,660
Besides, in this world,

314
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,380
there are so many people I cherish

315
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,860
and love.

316
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,220
That boy said the exact same thing.

317
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,300
You two are like-minded.

318
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,540
That half-demon is so lucky

319
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,100
to have met you.

320
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,220
Sir,

321
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,500
do you know any ways

322
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,100
to have Ziqi and Crescent

323
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,220
become a whole?

324
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,780
Will it be too late

325
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,270
when we find one?

326
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,460
There's something

327
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,140
he can try.

328
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,740
Really? What is it?

329
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,980
It lies in his nature.

330
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,300
As long as he knows where he's from

331
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,460
and who he is,
he can unify his heart and mind

332
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,700
and eventually achieve success.

333
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,620
That's the universal law.

334
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,300
Knowing where he's from.

335
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,540
Are you saying

336
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,620
Ziqi's failure is partly because

337
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,100
he lost his childhood memory?

338
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,940
Yes. His memory loss

339
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,220
has left a hole in his heart,

340
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,980
so he can't reach unification.

341
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,100
He can use pure strength

342
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,700
to command ordinary weapons,

343
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,660
but Crescent is too powerful.

344
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,780
He can't conquer it.

345
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:09,460
I see.

346
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,940
I'll go tell him now!

347
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,540
Wait, come back!

348
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,780
Right now,
his mind and heart are battling,

349
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,610
causing stagnation.

350
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,540
He's hit a...

351
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,700
a bottleneck.

352
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,540
He knows that too.

353
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,780
That boy is quite sharp.

354
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,540
You're right.

355
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,420
Ziqi resists that part

356
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,540
of the memory from his childhood.

357
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,860
Exactly.

358
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,460
Then what should we do?

359
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:44,980
We'll wait.

360
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,460
Wait?

361
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,220
The catastrophe of heaven is so close.

362
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,620
There's no time!

363
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,100
When the water starts boiling,

364
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,700
put the vegetables in the pot.

365
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,020
Remember, don't add the salt first.

366
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,980
Is the water boiling?

367
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,740
Not yet.

368
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,860
I'll add more firewood.

369
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,300
Be patient.

370
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,380
Miaomiao.

371
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,020
Ziqi?

372
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,140
Come here.

373
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,180
I need to talk to you.

374
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,540
The vegetables are right here,

375
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,380
sir.

376
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,520
It is boiling now.

377
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,540
Ziqi,

378
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,220
what is it? You look serious.

379
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,420
Miaomiao,

380
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,840
can you go to a place with me?

381
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,460
Where to?

382
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:00,750
The Qilin Mountain.

383
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,400
I want to go back and see

384
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,740
if I can recover my childhood memory.

385
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,660
But

386
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,020
aren't you afraid of it?

387
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,940
Not exactly.

388
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,260
I'm afraid to face my fear,

389
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,060
but now I have to be brave.

390
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,220
Does that mean you're no longer afraid?

391
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,010
I was with Cuicui's grandfather
just now.

392
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,110
He said...

393
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,220
What did he say?

394
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,620
Stop asking questions.

395
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,860
Anyway, I can face it.

396
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,940
I know you're the bravest!

397
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,900
Let's go pack up.

398
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,010
Miaomiao...

399
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:56,860
Look!

400
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,180
Look at those Dust Demons.

401
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,380
What are they doing?

402
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,140
They seem to be forming a pattern.

403
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,100
I'm clueless.

404
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,780
Are they sending me a message?

405
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,540
Forget it. Your memory comes first.

406
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,780
- Sir.
- What's up?

407
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,460
Have those two left?

408
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,660
Yes.

409
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,700
They've set out

410
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,540
for Xilai County
where the Qilin Mountain is.

411
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,380
Good. That's good.

412
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,620
Sir,

413
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,100
if Sheng recovers his memory,

414
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,300
can he merge with Crescent

415
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,820
to defeat the Resentful Woman

416
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,460
and stop the catastrophe of heaven?

417
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,180
Good question.

418
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,900
That catastrophe will happen

419
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,460
once the Resentful Woman

420
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,420
regains her full power.

421
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,620
At that time,

422
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,380
she'll become the Queen of Demons.

423
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,260
All demonic beings

424
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,220
will kneel in front of her.

425
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,160
And the weak-minded ones

426
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,940
will take orders from her to do evil.

427
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:28,140
You guys won't be her match.

428
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,940
Master, what...?

429
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,260
To prevent that from happening,

430
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,540
you must strike first,

431
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,260
or it will be too late.

432
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:40,220
Before she regains all her power

433
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,460
and the Blood Moon appears in the sky,

434
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,900
eliminate her

435
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:45,940
for good!

436
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,980
But we don't even know where she is.

437
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,300
The map to show her whereabouts

438
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,420
has been burned.

439
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,700
Is that so?

440
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,060
It can be fixed.

441
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,700
Only a fragment is left.

442
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,180
It's beyond repair.

443
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:19,620
Some fire that was.

444
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,620
Don't worry.

445
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,780
I can fix it.

446
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,420
Even with one fragment?

447
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:27,900
Master,

448
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,940
how come you can fix this map?

449
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:39,700
(Hundred Demons Mountain and Sea Map)

450
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,090
Hundred Demons Mountain and Sea Map?

451
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,260
Huai'an,

452
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,900
what are you doing?

453
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,840
Just take it.

454
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:00,340
Are you drunk?

455
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,380
You...

456
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,620
This map can show every demon's trace.

457
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:12,060
It took generations

458
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,900
of the Lus hundreds of years

459
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:17,540
to put together this rare treasure.

460
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,580
You shouldn't have taken it out,

461
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,580
let alone given it to someone else!

462
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,750
Are you out of your mind?

463
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,940
I'm not giving it to a stranger.

464
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,850
It's been collecting dust

465
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,240
in our ancestral hall for a century.

466
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,900
Those old geezers

467
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,260
kept it secret

468
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,460
in case others would steal it.

469
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,260
But however rare it is,

470
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,220
it's still a tool,

471
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,980
so it should be put to good use.

472
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,020
If there's someone

473
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:51,140
who can make the best use of it,

474
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,580
that'll be me

475
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,300
and you.

476
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,710
You know I'm laid-back.

477
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,410
I only care about myself.

478
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:03,580
So it all lies on you to battle demons

479
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,540
and keep the world safe.

480
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,030
My niece!

481
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,720
You trusted my father

482
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,420
so much.

483
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:19,980
I was lazy.

484
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,220
As precious as it is,

485
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,680
it's been broken

486
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:26,980
for as long as I can remember.

487
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:29,600
It could only locate some little demons.

488
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,820
Father tried to fix it, but failed.

489
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,820
What happened to it doesn't matter.

490
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,860
To fix this map,

491
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,580
I need a rarity.

492
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,820
What is it?

493
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,940
There's a demonic creature

494
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,020
called Mysterious Cold Silkworm.

495
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,020
It's only Tier 3

496
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,380
and unenlightened,

497
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,460
but there's something it has

498
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,860
and others don't.

499
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,140
Its silk can

500
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,380
fix everything in the world.

501
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,060
Where can we find this silkworm?

502
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,060
Are there any leads?

503
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,180
That old bamboo,

504
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,320
who is over 1,000 years old,

505
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,180
can spread his power everywhere
from his roots.

506
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,820
That's why he's well-informed.

507
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,300
He once told me

508
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,300
that silkworms and the Silk Soul Flower

509
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,180
always grow together.

510
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,700
Such flowers can only be found

511
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,420
in Cainan now.

512
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,660
Cainan?

513
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,620
You're leaving too?

514
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,500
Yes.

515
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,900
We're going to Cainan.

516
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,660
I'll be left here alone.

517
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:45,750
Hey, little shoot,

518
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,820
when we come back,

519
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,120
if the five of us stick together,

520
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,740
we'll never part again.

521
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,380
- Let's go, Fuyi.
- Sure.

522
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,260
I'll walk you out.

523
00:29:59,060 --> 00:29:59,900
No need.

524
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,940
Stay with your grandfather.

525
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,220
Sister Mu, Brother Liu,

526
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,960
take care.

527
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:12,860
Go back.

528
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,800
Cuicui,

529
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,860
my dear grandson!

530
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:29,820
Are you sad seeing your friends leave?

531
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,300
Yes.

532
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:36,020
We're really good friends.

533
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,440
Grandfather, you called my name right!

534
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,580
Finally!

535
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,220
You're over 300 years old.

536
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,060
At least I have to know your name.

537
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,100
Grandfather,

538
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,140
I'm only a little over 150.

539
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:01,850

Hold on. Almost there.
