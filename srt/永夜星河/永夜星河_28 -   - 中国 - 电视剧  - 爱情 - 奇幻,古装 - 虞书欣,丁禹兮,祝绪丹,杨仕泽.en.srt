=Episode 28=

3
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:05,740
Mu Yao, Mu Yao.

4
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,640
It is you!

5
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,810
Why don't you rest in the village

6
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,250
but track me?

7
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,570
Did you kill this person?

8
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,260
Lady Divine Doctor,

9
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,550
my illness

10
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,030
is completely healed, right?

11
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,500
It won't resume again, right?

12
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,240
That's right.

13
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,240
It won't resume again.

14
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,690
That's great!

15
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,550
Thank you

16
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,400
so much!

17
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,690
It was Shiniang

18
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,340
who cured your illness?

19
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,960
Yes.

20
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,250
Shiniang said,

21
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,220
to cure my chronic illness,

22
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,570
I needed to undergo surgery.

23
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,690
I thought that with one cut,

24
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,150
it might cost me my life.

25
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,380
Unexpectedly, it didn't hurt at all.

26
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,340
Lady Divine Doctor,
you are truly a living deity.

27
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,250
This silk from Cold Silkworm

28
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,810
has already stitched up your wound.

29
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,550
After returning home,
make sure to rest well.

30
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,810
Avoid overworking
and meeting too many people.

31
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,430
Go quickly.

32
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,680
Okay.

33
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,550
Lady Divine Doctor,

34
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,970
you must be attending to other patients.

35
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,250
I won't disturb you.

36
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:06,990
Farewell.

37
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,430
Farewell.

38
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,360
Sorry,

39
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,970
I didn't know this is
how you treat patients.

40
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,470
It doesn't matter.

41
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,800
Our medical skills

42
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,220
differ from ordinary doctors,

43
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,530
so they may seem unfamiliar.

44
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:24,710
Let's go.

45
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:25,790
Shiniang,

46
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,760
is this

47
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,660
the cocoon of the Mysterious Cold Silkworm?

48
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,490
Why is the silkworm so small

49
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,050
yet the cocoon so large?

50
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,900
I obtained this silkworm by chance.

51
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,780
I only know how to use silk.

52
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,020
I'm not sure about the rest.

53
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,840
It's already late at night.

54
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,580
I need to go back to accompany Zhun.

55
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,340
Cultivator Mu, you are a bride today.

56
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,100
On this happy night,

57
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,580
why did you come to such a far place?

58
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:01,900
Hurry back.

59
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,930
What's making such a noise?

60
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,700
Don't you see I'm busy?

61
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,780
Cultivator Mu?

62
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,140
The Astronomical Bureau
gathers the world's classics.

63
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,680
There is something I don't understand.

64
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,820
Please help me check it.

65
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,610
It's my honor.

66
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,640
Wait a moment.

67
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,600
Cultivator Mu, what do you need to check?

68
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,850
Get the ladder.

69
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,530
I want you to help me check

70
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,000
whether Silk Soul Flower

71
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,700
consumed by Mysterious Cold Silkworm

72
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,460
needs to be nurtured with human blood.

73
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,760
Okay.

74
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,900
Hold on.

75
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,910
Cultivator Mu,

76
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,930
I found it.

77
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,040
Hold on.

78
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,460
Let me check.

79
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,540
(Records of Mysteries)

80
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,100
(Silk Soul Flower)

81
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,080
Cultivator Mu,

82
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,930
the Mysterious Cold Silkworm
and the Silk Soul Flower grow together.

83
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,450
The silkworm droppings
nourish the flower roots,

84
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,510
while the petals provide food
for the silkworms.

85
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,580
These two things are neither poisonous,

86
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,900
nor do they harm people.

87
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,070
Let alone what you mentioned about

88
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,390
watering them with human blood.

89
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,290
There's nothing like that.

90
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,220
Hold on a moment,
let me take a look at this record.

91
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,900
(Records of Phantom Demon)

92
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,460
It's just that these two things

93
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:58,140
are very hard to find in the world.

94
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,520
Cultivator Mu,

95
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,050
you happen to encounter both?

96
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,820
What if I encountered them?

97
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:07,050
If so, you must be extremely careful.

98
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,660
Wherever these two things are,

99
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,700
there might be a Phantom Demon.

100
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,000
Phantom Demon?

101
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,850
This

102
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,660
(Stage A)
is a naturally formed strange demon spirit,

103
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,170
born like a baby,

104
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,780
grows alongside silkworms,

105
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:29,220
can use its demonic power to
protect the Silk Soul Flower,

106
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,460
(Stage B)

107
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,730
nurtures the Mysterious Cold Silkworm

108
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,370
so that the silkworm can spin silk

109
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,930
for it to cocoon itself.

110
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:38,730
Cocoon?

111
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,930
(Stage C)
This kind of demon

112
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,820
will cocoon once every few years.

113
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,450
Each time it breaks out of the cocoon,

114
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,630
its body will grow larger,

115
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,340
and its demonic power will increase.

116
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,900
After breaking out of the cocoon four times,

117
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,850
what emerges

118
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,700
is a fully matured Phantom Demon.

119
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,750
If it transforms into a Phantom Demon,

120
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,590
what would happen?

121
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,350
Transforming into

122
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,270
a mature Phantom Demon

123
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:13,290
would be troublesome,

124
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,260
because a Phantom Demon,

125
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,700
after three transformations,

126
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,120
possesses the ability of transforming shapes

127
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,700
and controlling reality and illusion.

128
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,700
After four transformations,

129
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,340
after four transformations,

130
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,100
when it emerges, it will be a

131
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,410
tier-8 Great Demon.

132
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,300
Apart from the tier-9 Demon King,

133
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,890
it is the demon creature that is

134
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,340
the most difficult to deal with.

135
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,490
Oh no, Fuyi!

136
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,390
Chuizi,

137
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,580
hurry up and get up!

138
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,550
Did you hear that?

139
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,610
There is a lot of work today.

140
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,380
Bride,

141
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,230
good morning.

142
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,730
You're out so early.

143
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:07,750
Your scar…

144
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,460
How did you get it?

145
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,650
You mean this one?

146
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:13,750
It's nothing serious.

147
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,600
This was left

148
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,510
by the Divine Doctor

149
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,490
when she saved us.

150
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,650
Everyone in our village has it.

151
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,120
Everyone has it?

152
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,600
Yes. Look, he has it too.

153
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,180
Who are you talking to?

154
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:24,550
Bride.

155
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,490
Quick, wipe it off.

156
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,700
- Bride.
- Bride, good morning.

157
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,920
Have you had breakfast?

158
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,520
If not, come to our house
and have some together.

159
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,370
Bride, why are you up so early?

160
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,870
Where is Maodan?

161
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,180
Why isn't he with you?

162
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,300
Hurry, wash up and get to work.

163
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,820
(Double Happiness)
Fuyi!

164
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,350
Yao,

165
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,510
where did you go?

166
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,700
There's something wrong in this village.

167
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,680
Let's leave now.

168
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,200
Fuyi,

169
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,360
Shiniang deceived us.

170
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,200
She didn't tell the truth.

171
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,300
The people in this village are not alive.

172
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,510
Let's leave now.

173
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,560
Fuyi.

174
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,820
I already know.

175
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,800
Know what?

176
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,540
Someone just told me.

177
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,040
Who?

178
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,300
It's me.

179
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,920
Chuchu?

180
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:36,750
Fuyi.

181
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,970
Don't hurt Chuchu.

182
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,420
She is my most important family member.

183
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,510
Fuyi,

184
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,370
you are under witchcraft, wake up!

185
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,040
Fuyi!

186
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,850
Brother will no longer listen to you.

187
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,420
From now on,

188
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,130
he will only listen to me,

189
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,180
only play with me,

190
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,610
and only belong to me.

191
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,770
No, Sister!

192
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,370
If you cut it off, Brother will die.

193
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,340
Because Brother's heart

194
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,820
is already with me.

195
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:55,990
Chuchu,

196
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,130
come and greet the guests.

197
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,850
Come on, everyone, quiet down.

198
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,160
Listen to me,

199
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,270
there's no time like the present.

200
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,910
Brother, you're back.

201
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,940
There is good wine and food.

202
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,730
Let's have a wedding for them today.

203
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,960
Let's do it.

204
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,890
Maodan is going to have a wife.

205
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,480
(Double Happiness)

206
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,320
Let's go.

207
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,360
Look.

208
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,940
This rascal Maodan.

209
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,490
Take a look.

210
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,580
Today's playtime is over.

211
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,890
Everyone, go back.

212
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,390
You're awake.

213
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,610
Let's go fetch water.

214
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,180
Okay, I'm coming.

215
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,180
It smells so good.

216
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,200
Come and have a taste.

217
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,960
If you like, we can pick more next time.

218
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,800
Sure.

219
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:33,750
Yeah.

220
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,180
Miaomiao, what's wrong?

221
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,490
In my mind,

222
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,820
a person suddenly appeared.

223
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,100
It's so unfamiliar.

224
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,610
Who is he?

225
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,770
He's the one you loved.

226
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,180
The one I loved?

227
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,300
Who did I love?

228
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,560
It's okay.

229
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,180
It's always like this at the beginning.

230
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,100
It'll be fine in two or three days at most.

231
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,610
Yes, we've all been through this.

232
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,110
Come and have some tea.

233
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,200
How is it?

234
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,200
It's really good.

235
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,440
Brother,

236
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,420
you're finally back.

237
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,130
I waited for you for so long.

238
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,890
Now, everyone is alive.

239
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,850
You won't be mad at me anymore,

240
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,610
right, Brother?

241
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,700
I will never let you leave me again.

242
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:23,580
(Mysterious Cold Silkworm)

243
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,490
You shouldn't have come to Jingyang Slope.

244
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,180
It was you who saved me.

245
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,010
I never expected
anyone from the renowned Mu Family

246
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,420
would one day

247
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,420
stumble in front of such a child.

248
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,850
If she truly were a child,

249
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,890
you, a tier-6 Fox Demon,

250
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,770
would not be at her beck and call,

251
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,060
acting as an accomplice.

252
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,270
Phantom Demons are extremely rare

253
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,350
and have extraordinary talents.

254
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,180
You fell into her hands,

255
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,770
it's not unjust.

256
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,130
So the one who needs blood

257
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,540
is not the Silk Soul Flower,

258
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,510
but the Mysterious Cold Silkworm.

259
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,500
The Mysterious Cold Silkworm

260
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,770
only feeds on fresh blood

261
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,370
before spinning its cocoon.

262
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:07,630
That's right.

263
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,770
Three days later,
on the night of the full moon,

264
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,730
it will be her last time
breaking out of the cocoon.

265
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,580
You won't have a chance to stop her.

266
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,490
Moreover, I saved you

267
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,460
just because

268
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,940
she wants your vital blood.

269
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,300
Shiniang,

270
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,610
did Li Zhun know

271
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,540
his daughter Chuchu

272
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,540
died ten years ago?

273
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:30,970
To save him,

274
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,130
you came to Jingyang Slope,

275
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,420
found the Phantom Demon

276
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,650
and made this deal with her,

277
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,920
right?

278
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:42,990
Yes.

279
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,510
He didn't know.

280
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,650
When Chuchu died of illness,

281
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,020
she was not even three years old.

282
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,650
At that time, Zhun

283
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,370
was also critically ill.

284
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,540
Please lend me the Mysterious Cold Silkworm.

285
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,340
Why?

286
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,890
Only with the blessing of its silk,

287
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,410
can I save my husband's life.

288
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,800
Every month,

289
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,260
I only use the silk once.

290
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:22,890
I will not disturb you at any other time.

291
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,060
I can help you,

292
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:26,810
but,

293
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,780
you must also help me.

294
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,650
Help me

295
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,500
bring them

296
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,020
all back to life.

297
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,580
That day,

298
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,210
I intended to take the silkworm away directly,

299
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,740
but the silkworm and
the Silk Soul Flower have a short life.

300
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,480
Without the nourishment of
the Phantom Demon's power,

301
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,650
they would soon perish.

302
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,850
I told her

303
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,650
I could stitch the corpse,

304
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,320
but I couldn't bring the dead back to life.

305
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,060
She extracted her demon core

306
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,930
and divided the demonic power

307
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,890
into the cavity of each corpse,

308
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,300
they came back to life.

309
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,690
I was very surprised at the time

310
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,610
that she could disperse her demonic power

311
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,130
and use the demon core like this.

312
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,780
She had only broken through three times.

313
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,930
Three days later,

314
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,740
her demonic power will be immeasurable.

315
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,500
She injected demonic power

316
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:31,820
into the bodies of the dead,

317
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,930
what exactly is it for?

318
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,740
She is just a little child.

319
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,130
What ambitions could she possibly have?

320
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,160
She just hopes to have a group of people

321
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,690
who can play with her,

322
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,020
make her brother, who dislikes her,

323
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,210
come back to her side.

324
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,340
Everyone has come back to life.

325
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,820
Brother won't be angry anymore.

326
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,410
He will come back and play with me again.

327
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,780
Those who have lost their hearts

328
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,370
were revived because of
the Phantom Demon's power.

329
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,210
What if the Phantom Demon dies?

330
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,210
They would die again.

331
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,670
No,

332
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,610
I should say,

333
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,260
they never truly came back to life,

334
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,100
so they wouldn't die again.

335
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,690
Their intelligence

336
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,980
would remain fixed on the day they died.

337
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:21,950
Fuyi…

338
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,100
Would the patient I saw here that day

339
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,300
die in a few days after

340
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:32,930
leaving Jingyang Slope?

341
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,890
You are right.

342
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,780
After the Phantom Demon takes the heart,

343
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,540
she will listen to what I say

344
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,540
and inject some demonic power

345
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,170
into the cavities of those patients.

346
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,150
It's enough to support them
to leave Jingyang Village

347
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,540
or return home for a few days before dying,

348
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,430
or,

349
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,020
die in the mountains

350
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,980
as if they encountered a wild beast,

351
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,450
or were killed by bandits.

352
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,340
Even if these patients

353
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,890
die after returning home,

354
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,340
everyone would think
they were beyond cure,

355
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,930
and would not blame you,
Lady Divine Doctor,

356
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,980
nor would they think of Liuru Village.

357
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,210
Your fox clan is truly the smartest.

358
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,500
Because of your cover,

359
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,610
the Phantom Demon was able to
kill so many people,

360
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,320
and before long,

361
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,210
it will also become a tier-8 Great Demon.

362
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,740
So what?

363
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,680
As long as the Phantom Demon lives,

364
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,410
my husband Zhun can live.

365
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,610
If your beloved's life were at stake,

366
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,750
wouldn't you do anything to save him

367
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,820
regardless of means?

368
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:38,630
Moreover,

369
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,030
for hundreds of years,

370
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,370
how have you treated demons?

371
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,610
I am merely repaying in kind.

372
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,690
Shiniang,

373
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,130
do you still remember

374
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,980
how you fell in love with Li Zhun?

375
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,350
Because Li Zhun

376
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,540
is not the kind of person you speak of.

377
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,100
If my beloved's life were at stake,

378
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,820
I would do everything in my power
to save him,

379
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,300
but I won't resort to unscrupulous means,

380
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,370
because I know my beloved

381
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,850
does not want me to use unscrupulous means.

382
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,960
This tea is delicious
and the snacks are tasty too.

383
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,610
It was worth all the effort today.

384
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,790
Let's make some different flavors tomorrow.

385
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,630
Okay.

386
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,400
Liuniang, come to have some too.

387
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,850
I helped grind the tea.

388
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,450
Take your time drinking.

389
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,930
I have something to do.

390
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:48,690
What is it?

391
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,300
Something in the garden has ripened.

392
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,850
I need to go harvest it.

393
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,690
Come back early then.

394
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,060
You're still alive.

395
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,300
I thought

396
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,130
you were my sister's child,

397
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,210
and somewhat resemble her.

398
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:44,100
I can't bear to watch you die.

399
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,450
But now,

400
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,210
I can't watch you living a fate
worse than death.

401
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,500
Why exactly do you

402
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,210
want to take my life?

403
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,610
Do you really

404
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,020
hate me that much?

405
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,300
I do hate you,

406
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,500
because it's you who caused her death.

407
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,340
My mother…

408
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,100
Is she really dead?

409
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,580
Do you know what this is?

410
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:54,930
This is her heart.

411
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,350
Sister.

412
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:05,310
Only the purest and sincerest beings

413
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,500
can have a Crystal Heart.

414
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,170
On that day,

415
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,780
her heart shattered,

416
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,580
and thus she shed tears of blood.

417
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,820
After she was taken away
by the Demon Catcher,

418
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,580
I searched for her everywhere.

419
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,580
Until one day,

420
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,650
this piece of Crystal Heart began to wither.

421
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,170
If she were alive,

422
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,410
the heart would not wither.

423
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:35,980
Since then,

424
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:40,100
I have been nourishing it
with my heart blood every day.

425
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:43,580
As long as I have this piece of her heart,

426
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,540
I have a chance

427
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,980
to reconstruct her.

428
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,300
For more than ten years,

429
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,930
I have drawn blood every day,

430
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,450
almost losing my life.

431
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,740
I become gradually weak.

432
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,370
I thought I wouldn't be able to meet you.

433
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,890
Ziqi,

434
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,980
you have come just in time.

435
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,930
Can this method

436
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,450
really save my mother?

437
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,780
I have memories.

438
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,390
Look,

439
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,070
in those Mirages,

440
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:29,540
the highest and most perilous
is Qilin Mountain.

441
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,260
That is the illusion she set up.

442
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,260
I have the power of your demon core

443
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,410
and this piece of Crystal Heart,

444
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,610
I can use my memories

445
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,740
to reconstruct her,

446
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,260
the one from the past,

447
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,790
before meeting Zhao Qinghuan,

448
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,340
before giving birth to you.

449
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,080
Let her,

450
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,170
the former her,

451
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,170
live in Qilin Mountain

452
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,170
lightheartedly.

453
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,020
But this is just a memory.

454
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,740
She is not my mother.

455
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,340
That is her, it is!

456
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:46,890
Considering you are my sister's child,

457
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:49,100
I'll let you die with understanding.

458
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,690
I want you dead

459
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,450
not because I hate you.

460
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,580
Why is it?

461
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,410
My magical power can make people forget.

462
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,210
People can temporarily forget their beloved,

463
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:10,300
but when their beloved is near,

464
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:12,410
my magical power will have cracks.

465
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:13,980
Therefore,

466
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:17,370
I have to make sure
both you and your father are dead.

467
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,260
Only then,
can I reconstruct her as she was before.

468
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,780
I see.

469
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,780
You've been painstakingly
planning for so many years.

470
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:33,210
This is the reason.

471
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,500
What a pity!

472
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,540
I cannot die yet.

473
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:44,020
Now I have someone I deeply love

474
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,850
and something I must accomplish.

475
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,850
What have you done to Miaomiao?

476
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,930
Don't worry, Ziqi.

477
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,580
She is very safe.

478
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,780
I won't hurt her.

479
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,890
In the future, she will live without worries

480
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,980
and forget you.

481
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,790
It's very late.

482
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,930
We should rest too.

483
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,590
Let's go, go back to sleep.

484
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,980
Okay.

485
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:36,750
Nobody moves.

486
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,980
Miaomiao, what are you doing?

487
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,890
Miaomiao, calm down.

488
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,410
Give me back my memory.

489
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,480
Miaomiao!

490
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,650
We all went through this.

491
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,690
- Yes.
- No matter what you care about,

492
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,370
once you let it go, it's gone.

493
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,610
Liuniang is doing this for your good.

494
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,680
Yes, loving someone too much

495
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,210
will certainly bring temporary joy,

496
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,650
but it will also bring sadness and tears.

497
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,270
You may be worried and anxious.

498
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:58,370
- Yes.
- Exactly.

499
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,520
Miaomiao.

500
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,690
Whether it's joy or sadness,

501
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,540
no matter how painful it is,

502
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,780
these are my feelings,

503
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,100
my memories.

504
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,820
If I choose to love someone,

505
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,850
I will bear

506
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,830
the pain of this love myself.

507
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:25,850
I can bear it.

508
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,690
It's not for you to decide.

509
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,210
Give me back my memory.

510
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,480
This…

511
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,350
No one has ever done this.

512
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:47,160
- If you retrieve the extracted memory,
- Yes.

513
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,590
you will suffer from extreme grief.

514
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:49,980
Ordinary people cannot bear it.

515
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,930
Miaomiao!

516
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:58,870
Miaomiao!

517
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,820
Miaomiao!

518
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,000
Miaomiao!

519
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,540
Stop now, you will die.

520
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:08,170
- Stop.
- Miaomiao, stop.

521
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,300
I might let you die quickly.

What a strong power of the inner core!

545
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,020
I really underestimated you.

546
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,370
But you are still too late.

547
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,930
After he dies,

548
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,740
the power of his demon core

549
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,450
will be absorbed by my Formation.

550
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,850
My sister

551
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:11,130
will be able to resurrect in the Mirage.

552
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,650
It's useless even if you kill me now.

553
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,370
As long as this Formation is in place,

554
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,740
my plan has already succeeded.

555
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,280
Liuniang,

556
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,280
I know

557
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,350
the golden pearl in your hand

558
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,480
was Ziqi's mother's

559
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,640
last tear.

560
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,610
It can save Ziqi.

561
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,210
It is mine.

562
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,020
It's because of this child,

563
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:39,060
my sister was doomed eternally.

564
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:43,610
Why should I use her last bit of strength

565
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,410
to protect him?

566
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,020

Liuniang,

568
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,410
I don't want to hurt you.

569
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,820
Give me the golden pearl quickly.

570
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,450
I won't give it to you.

571
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,930
But I can help him a bit.

572
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,890
I'll make his death quicker.

Liu,

577
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,170
if you hear this message,

578
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,690
I might already be gone.

579
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,500
But I know

580
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,850
you must still be thinking of me,
missing me.

581
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,310
Actually, I always knew that Ziqi and I

582
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,340
would eventually part ways.

583
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:02,980
So every day, I give my all to love him.

584
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:07,340
I gave my demon core and my life to him.

585
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,770
I have no regrets towards Qinghuan,

586
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,460
nor towards Ziqi.

587
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,020

For hundreds of years in the mountains,

590
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,980
we were never apart.

591
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,150
We once promised each other

592
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,020
to always stay together like this.

593
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,640
But

594
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,500

You have already lost all your kind.

598
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,130
You only have me.

599
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,650
If there is any regret in my death,

600
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,060
it is that,

601
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,810

According to the regulations,

685
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,650
if we follow the procedure,

686
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,000
it has to be reported
by documents step by step.

687
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Without ten days to half a month,

688
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,380
the documents won't be approved.

689

00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,190

the higher-ups yet,

692
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,030

00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,750
