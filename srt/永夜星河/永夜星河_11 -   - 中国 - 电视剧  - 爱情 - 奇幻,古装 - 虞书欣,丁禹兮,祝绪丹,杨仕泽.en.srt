=Love Game in Eastern Fantasy=

2
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,180
=Episode 11=

3
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,840
Wait, wait.

4
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,190
Douya?

5
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:19,630
Oh, no.

6
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,000
They managed to escape.

7
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,040
But it's fine.

8
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,430
The pure yin blood you need

9
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,120
has been lured into the valley
by Guo Xiu's lies.

10
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,430
With all the blood,

11
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,280
you'll be out soon.

12
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,040
Then we can reunite.

13
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,180
Why wasn't she enchanted
by the Water Demon?

14
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,430
The inner demon's illusion
drives people's obsessions.

15
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,270
Let go.

16
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,860
- The simpler your thoughts,
- Let go.

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,850
the less you'll be trapped
in your obsessions.

18
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,230
No wonder Cuicui wasn't affected.

19
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,480
Let go.

20
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,190
I want to find my father.

21
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,400
Your father is dead.

22
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,800
Ziqi, stop talking nonsense.

23
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,710
My sister isn't here.

24
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,250
Who am I pretending for?

25
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,360
Let go. I want to find my father.

26
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,900
Don't you have a father?

27
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,830
- Douya.
- Doesn't your father care about you?

28
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,610
You stop talking nonsense either.

29
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,710
It doesn't matter.

30
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,310
I never had a father anyway.

31
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,020
If you want to die,

32
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,630
wait until we bring you back

33
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,430
to your mother.

34
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,640
Let's go.

35
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,600
The day my father entered the valley,

36
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,520
I watched him go in.

37
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,120
He risked entering the valley

38
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,870
to gather ginseng
for my mother's illness.

39
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,500
I should have stopped him.

40
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,200
It's all my fault.

41
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,640
It's all my fault.

42
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,440
What are you doing?

43
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,680
Taking her to find her father.

44
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,080
If we leave the valley like this,

45
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,620
this little girl will definitely think

46
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,680
we're making excuses

47
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,180
because we're afraid of the demons.

48
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,200
If we don't find her father,

49
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,820
we'll be just like Guo Xiu,

50
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,240
a useless Demon Catcher
who can only talk big.

51
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,640
What a hassle.

52
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,640
Thank you, Big Brother.

53
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,720
Thank you, Big Sister.

54
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,440
Why are you laughing?

55
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,320
I realize your kindness isn't an act.

56
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,760
You're just pretending
to be cold and cruel.

57
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,680
Don't pretend to know me.

58
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,220
I used to think I knew you well,

59
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,680
but now I realize

60
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,960
I'm just

61
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,960
starting to truly know you.

62
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,000
Father. Father.

63
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,700
Father.

64
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:23,980
Father.

65
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,890
Father, wake up.

66
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,420
Father.

67
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,040
Father.

68
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,780
(Douya's father, Villager)
Father.

69
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,600
Father, wake up. Father.

70
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,280
No heartbeat.

71
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,420
Even though there's no heartbeat,
his body is still warm.

72
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,400
There's still time.

73
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,240
Father.

74
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,320
If only there was a defibrillator.

75
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,240
Defibrillator...

76
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,640
Father.

77
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,600
Father.

78
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,400
Father, wake up.

79
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,440
Father.

80
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,560
Father.

81
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,300
What are you doing?

82
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,880
Saving him.

83
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,860
Save him?

84
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:19,940
He's already...

85
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,840
Father.

86
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,540
Father. Father.

87
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,600
He's really alive.

88
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,660
Father.

89
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,880
Father.

90
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,900
- No.
- Father.

91
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,440
He's too weak, and he can't hold on.

92
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,140
Father.

93
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,600
Father.

94
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,080
This is

95
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,040
the healing magic.

96
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,620
Father, wake up.

97
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,160
Father. Father.

98
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,300
Father.

99
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,020
Father.

100
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,000
Douya, your father is awake.

101
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,460
Father.

102
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,120
Father. Father.

103
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,480
I'm here to take you home, Father.

104
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,940
Father. Father.

105
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,720
The others are long dead.

106
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,420
- Her father is the latest.
- Father.

107
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,760
He still has a faint breath.

108
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,640
If we had come two days later,

109
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,180
I'm afraid
we wouldn't have been able to save him.

110
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,960
This little girl is very stubborn.

111
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:23,840
Father.

112
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,480
What's wrong?

113
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,380
(Wait.)

114
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,460
(I remembered.)

115
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,500
(Sister Mu said)

116
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,260
(that the healing magic is very special.)

117
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,800
(It not only consumes spiritual power,)

118
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,840
(but also harms the body.)

119
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,180
(The heavier the injury treated,)

120
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,880
(the greater the damage to oneself.)

121
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,400
How are you? Is your body all right?

122
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,200
What a fuss.

123
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,660
Father.

124
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,100
(Water Demon Queen)

125
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,640
The Water Demon is here.

126
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,600
What a handsome young man.

127
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,760
If it weren't for the pure yin blood,

128
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,160
I wouldn't want your life.

129
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,960
Cuicui, don't sleep. Wake up.

130
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,820
Wake up.

131
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,840
Take them out.

132
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,220
Miaomiao, you leave too.

133
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,440
I won't.

134
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,560
I won't. I won't leave.

135
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,840
What sweet blood.

136
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,400
You've just consumed your power.

137
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,120
You're already very weak.

138
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,000
You can't beat me.

139
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,620
Hurry and run! Run!

140
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,940
I'm so scared.

141
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,780
Run!

142
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,660
No.

143
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,480
Cuicui, I need to save Ziqi.

144
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,520
That's a Tier 7 demon.

145
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,940
I've lived for over a hundred years.

146
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,880
It's the first time I've seen
a Tier 7 demon besides my grandpa.

147
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,860
But that demon
has gone down a dark path.

148
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,780
She cultivates by feeding
on human obsessions,

149
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,060
so she's making progress rapidly.

150
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,400
Even the best Demon Catchers
can't subdue her.

151
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,460
Come on.

152
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,340
- Slow down.
- It's true.

153
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,180
They're back.

154
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,540
- Are they back?
- They're back.

155
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,380
Hurry, hurry.

156
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,840
- It's true.
- Yes.

157
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,380
You actually made it out alive.

158
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,240
Is he okay?

159
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,700
He's fine.

160
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,320
- Help me support him.
- Okay.

161
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,780
Where is Guo Xiu?

162
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,220
Miss,

163
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,840
why do you need the celestial official?

164
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,400
Just take me to find him.

165
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,860
Alright, alright.

166
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,000
Miss, follow me.

167
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,340
Fuyi.

168
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,740
Fuyi.

169
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,260
You're awake.

170
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,220
What are you going to do?

171
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,240
I think...

172
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,340
I didn't think you should
enter the valley.

173
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,260
You wouldn't listen to advice
or be stopped.

174
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,560
So I had no choice.

175
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,260
All right, stop gesturing.

176
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,100
It's useless.

177
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,640
What you have just inhaled

178
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,360
is ordinary

179
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,580
Softening Powder.

180
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,280
It can only temporarily weaken you

181
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,880
and prevent you from using your powers.

182
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,140
What do you want?

183
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,800
Did you harm those villagers?

184
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,100
Don't talk nonsense.

185
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,180
You really don't understand anything,
do you?

186
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,280
I'm the one who saved this town.

187
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,880
What do you mean?

188
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,840
Want to hear my story?

189
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,580
Fine.

190
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,420
It's very simple.

191
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,260
Just listen.

192
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:49,200
Twenty years ago,
I started learning magic from my master,

193
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,140
but my master always scolded me
for having too many distractions.

194
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,480
(Guo Xiu's Master)
He warned me never to enter the world,

195
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,660
- otherwise
- Come on.

196
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,700
it would bring disaster.

197
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,880
Take your bets. Here we go.

198
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,660
I was like you then,

199
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,160
young and rebellious.

200
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,240
I thought about the prosperous world
below the mountain.

201
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,200
When I mastered my skills,

202
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,320
it would be such a waste

203
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,680
to spend my life stuck in the mountains.

204
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,060
Coincidentally,

205
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,180
at that time,
the Astronomical Bureau was

206
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,280
recruiting Demon Catchers
from the common folk.

207
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,920
I thought it wouldn't be easy

208
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,560
to join the royal Astronomical Bureau.

209
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,160
But I didn't know
that with enough money,

210
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,580
there was no door I couldn't enter.

211
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,420
(Astronomical Bureau)

212
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,940
(Astronomical Bureau)
But I

213
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,440
didn't have any real talent.

214
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,600
- But
- Beginner.

215
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,260
- I was clever.
- Sweep the floors.

216
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,100
I was perceptive.

217
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,760
And I was lucky.

218
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,320
Before long,
I caught the attention of a noble.

219
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,720
The late emperor and the current ruler

220
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,440
disliked cultivators and talismans.

221
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,400
It was hard for the staff
of the Astronomical Bureau to be appreciated.

222
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,160
So the noble you mentioned is

223
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,680
Dowager Consort Zhao.

224
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,380
Clever.

225
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,480
When the late emperor was alive,

226
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,940
the noble was a consort.

227
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,520
On the surface, she had no ties
to the Astronomical Bureau,

228
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,120
but she secretly valued

229
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,760
and supported

230
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,420
a few trusted people.

231
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,280
I was one of them.

232
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,180
Not long after,

233
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,640
I received a secret order.

234
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,300
Only trusted confidants were qualified

235
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,920
to receive such orders.

236
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,220
The order stated

237
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,360
that Qilin Mountain had collapsed

238
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,300
a few days ago.

239
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,840
It was caused
by a great demon in the mountain.

240
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,820
After the demon was subdued,

241
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,140
to stabilize public morale,

242
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,200
the court suppressed the news.

243
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,540
But with the mountain's collapse,

244
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,340
(Qilin Mountain)
other dangerous demons in the mountain

245
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,720
scattered and fled.

246
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,700
The noble ordered

247
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,780
- that all of them must be exterminated
- Stop.

248
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,040
to prevent future trouble.

249
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,640
To help us complete the task,

250
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,680
the noble made an exception

251
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,180
and mobilized the mountain talisman
from the Bureau's Ziwei Pavilion

252
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,240
to aid us.

253
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,960
The mountain talisman?

254
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,400
The talisman
that flattens mountains and seas?

255
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,480
How could you misuse
such a powerful talisman?

256
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,960
Listen to me.

257
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,900
Before setting off, the noble instructed

258
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,680
to leave no trouble behind.

259
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,200
All difficult demons must be eliminated,

260
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,740
even if we had to break the mountain.

261
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,860
Protect the people?
Rather be safe than sorry?

262
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,640
What does that have to do
with Zhijing Town?

263
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,780
Why do you have so many questions?

264
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,420
It's actually quite simple.

265
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,880
Ask questions
after I finish speaking, okay?

266
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,400
Later, I left my fellow cultivators.

267
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,780
I was after a pair of Water Demons

268
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,660
and tracked them
to a valley outside of Zhijing Town.

269
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,780
I thought

270
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,860
I could just use the mountain talisman

271
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,980
to flatten the valley

272
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,240
and go back to report.

273
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,420
Just as I was about to cast the spell,

274
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,300
I noticed that
there was a suspended lake

275
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,880
in the mountain.

276
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:20,480
If I flattened the valley,
the lake would overflow

277
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,560
and flood the small town below.

278
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,440
I tried to persuade them to evacuate,

279
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,700
but they didn't believe me.

280
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,600
They were unwilling to leave.

281
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,320
I'm from the Astronomical Bureau.

282
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,120
But Dowager Consort Zhao's secret order

283
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,640
couldn't be leaked.

284
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,060
Besides, if the common people knew

285
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,840
the whole story,

286
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,160
they wouldn't let me use
the mountain talisman.

287
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,040
So I wondered

288
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,920
if I could use another method

289
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,060
to eliminate the Water Demon

290
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,680
and then report back.

291
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,520
I knew that my cultivation was weak

292
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,560
and that I was no match
for the Water Demon.

293
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,560
So I returned to my sect

294
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,640
and pleaded with my master to help.

295
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,840
But to my surprise,

296
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,700
everyone from my sect

297
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,640
who entered the valley

298
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,360
didn't come back.

299
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,160
Only my master managed

300
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,040
to free himself from his obsession.

301
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,320
He exhausted his last breath

302
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,920
to set up a zone

303
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,240
to seal the Water Demon in the valley.

304
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,680
Since then, the Water Demon hasn't been able
to leave and harm anyone.

305
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,040
But my master,

306
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,760
my fellow brothers,

307
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,840
all of them...

308
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,120
Thank you, Mr. Guo.

309
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,820
Oh, no.

310
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,360
Master!

311
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,760
This zone

312
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,840
can confine demons,

313
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,480
but it can't stop humans.

314
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,460
I can't let my master

315
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,100
and my fellow brothers die in vain.

316
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,680
So I stayed to guard this small town

317
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,920
and try to prevent anyone
from entering the valley.

318
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,400
Then why did you
sell talismans to scam others?

319
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,540
I've been telling you for a long time.

320
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,920
Don't you understand why?

321
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,420
Would it be easy

322
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,160
to hide it from the Dowager Consort?

323
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,260
Over the years,

324
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,700
she has sent people
from the Bureau to check

325
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,780
if the demon has really been eliminated.

326
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,780
If I hadn't used that money

327
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,280
to bribe my colleagues to cover for me,

328
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:03,120
would the Dowager Consort
let this place go?

329
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,220
But you can't avoid it forever.

330
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,680
I'm not avoiding it.

331
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,700
My master and my fellow brothers were

332
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,940
much more skilled than me.

333
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,920
They were more insightful than me.

334
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:16,040
But the Water Demon killed them all.

335
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,920
What can I do?

336
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,880
Forget it.

337
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,040
The Water Demon feeds
on people's obsessions,

338
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,120
and she has likely made
significant progress by now.

339
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,080
The zone set by your master
with his life

340
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,640
can no longer trap her.

341
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,540
How about you let us go?

342
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,080
We'll handle
the Water Demon with you.

343
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,560
There must be a way.

344
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,780
I was just like you back then,

345
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,220
overestimating my abilities.

346
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,440
As it turned out,

347
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,880
all my fellows died

348
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,640
because of me.

349
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,120
But this time,

350
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,680
no one can die.

351
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,460
If the Water Demon leaves the valley,

352
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,000
it will be too late.

353
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,800
There's still time.

354
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,520
It's not too late.

355
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,760
I've already used

356
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,020
the mountain talisman.

357
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:14,860
Are you crazy?

358
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,220
What about the common people?

359
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,800
Don't panic. Look.

360
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,600
Just listen to me.
I've arranged everything.

361
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,920
Over ten years ago,

362
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,020
people here didn't believe me,

363
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,020
but now

364
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,820
I'm like a Living Immortal in the town.

365
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,940
They listen to my every word.

366
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,720
I've told them to evacuate quickly.

367
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,500
Soon

368
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:39,240
the mountain  will collapse,

369
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,280
fill the valley and wipe out everything.

370
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,960
All problems will be solved.

371
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,100
- It should've been done 20 years ago.
- Let me go.

372
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,000
My brother and sister
are still in the valley.

373
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,820
I must save them.

374
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,840
Let me go now.

375
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,580
It's already too late.
Don't tear my clothes.

376
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,440
There's no hope.

377
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,920
I'm doing this

378
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,840
for you guys.

379
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,280
Your brother and sister

380
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,880
are just

381
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,520
playing outside.

382
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,440
My brother and sister are just

383
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,360
playing outside.

384
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,620
Tomorrow,

385
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,200
they'll come back to meet you.

386
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,880
Who allowed you to harm her?

387
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,520
My brother and sister are just

388
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,600
playing outside.

389
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,360
My brother and sister are just

390
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,680
playing outside.

391
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:16,820
Fuyi.

392
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,660
Yao.

393
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,000
Are you okay?

394
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,620
You.

395
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,140
Come on, are you okay?

396
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:29,980
I'm fine.

397
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,500
Guo Xiu, what have you done?

398
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,120
- I...
- It's the mountain talisman.

399
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,800
The valley is about to collapse

400
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,960
and the town will be destroyed
by the suspended lake.

401
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:42,820
What?

402
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,360
You have such demonic power?

403
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,000
Why pretend to be human?

404
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,920
You could've been
a great demon somewhere.

405
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,840
Why do you demean yourself

406
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:09,000
to be a Demon Catcher?

407
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,920
Just

408
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:15,900
die!

409
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:43,860
Stop chasing.

410
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,000
You'll be discovered.

411
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,260
Ziqi.

412
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,120

Alright.

It's okay now.

448
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,460
I...

449
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,320
I really hated how I was just now.

450
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,600
I know.

451
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,120
Was I really scary?

452
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,640
Like a monster?

453
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,420
Not at all.

454
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,320
Not even a little.

455
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:32,900
Really?

456
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,090
♪In this life, I've kissed your brows♪

457
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,080
Really.

458
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,680
You were amazing just now.

459
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,900
You single-handedly
defeated a Tier 7 demon.

460
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,390
You really made her suffer.

00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:51,130
♪The wind and snow aren't cruel♪

462
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,360
But there was something strange.

463
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,300
I don't know why,

464
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,360
but this headband
didn't react

465
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,680
when I touched it this time.

466
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,160
Except for me,

467
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,240
it only harms those

468
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,040
who try to take it off.

469
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:12,350
♪Loving you completes♪

470
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,920
It seems this headband
has been protecting you.

471
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,600
Do you know where it came from?

472
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,680
No.

473
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,190
It's been with me since I can remember.

474
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,300
Be careful.

475
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,520
The earth vein is shaking strangely.

476
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,140
Let's get out of the valley.

477
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:37,990
Go.

478
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,940
Stop the mountain spell.

479
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,020
You're a cultivator too.

480
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,420
Once the mountain spell is cast,

481
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,680
can it be stopped?

482
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,620
Don't you care
about the townspeople's lives?

483
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,700
You can't say that.

484
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,940
How can I not care?

485
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,220
I've been here

486
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,620
for 17 years to protect them.

487
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,120
Besides, I've told them

488
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,740
they shouldn't stay in this town,

489
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,920
and they must leave,

490
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,860
so they'll all survive.

491
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,300
- It's okay.
- Mr. Guo.

492
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,260
Mr. Guo.

493
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,540
- Mr. Guo.
- You...

494
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,980
- Mr. Guo.
- Mr. Guo.

495
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,340
Have the townspeople been evacuated?

496
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,840
- No.
- No.

497
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,500
Why?

498
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,700
Because...

499
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,780
Because of what?

500
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,660
Because...

501
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:22,560
Because I've trapped everyone
in the town.

502
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,920
You...

503
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,800
You two Water Demons.

504
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,420
You were sealed in this valley

505
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,360
by my master.

506
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,880
How did you escape?

507
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,320
Surprised, aren't you?

508
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,560
Because for the past 17 years,

509
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,520
I haven't been in the valley.

510
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,760
Run, Xin!

511
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,900
- 17 years ago.
- Are you okay, Xin?

512
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,480
- It's too late. Run!
- My lover Zhaoxin

513
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,760
(Yingzhen, Water Demon King)
pushed me out at the last moment.

514
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,040
(Zhaoxin, Water Demon Queen)
Run!

515
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,140
Xin!

516
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,400
Zhen, stop.

517
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,220
I've been trapped in the formation.

518
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,600
Whether I can get out in this life

519
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,600
depends on you.

520
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,200
From that day on,

521
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,220
I vowed that one day

522
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,240
I would definitely save her.

523
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,160
Tier 7...

524
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,380
As long as she reaches Tier 7,

525
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,520
she'll have the power
to break the formation.

526
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,280
So for all these years,
you've been hiding your tracks,

527
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,520
luring innocent people into the valley

528
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,820
to feed your partner
and help her cultivate,

529
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,160
hoping to rise in the demon tiers.

530
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,960
You're clever.

531
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,730
That foolish cultivator
has been spreading warnings

532
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:41,680
that the Mitu Valley is

533
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,580
a trap with no way out,

534
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,800
keeping everyone on high alert,

535
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,080
but what does it matter?

536
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,800
Every rainy night,

537
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,660
my power is amplified a hundredfold

538
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,680
by the vast moisture
between heaven and earth.

539
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,240
You humans are

540
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:00,920
weak

541
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,360
and greedy.

542
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,160
With just a bit of temptation,

543
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,660
your obsessions will lead you

544
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,040
to the Mitu Valley.

545
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,000
The evil demons deserve to die.

546
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,780
If it weren't for your misdeeds,

547
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:13,360
would the Astronomical Bureau
chase after you for miles?

548
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,540
Evil demons?

549
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,460
Xin and I are

550
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,160
natural Water Demons

551
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,500
born in the clear spring water

552
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,240
of distant Qilin Mountain.

553
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,860
Since we were born,
we've never seen humans

554
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,180
or left the mountain.

555
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,340
What do you mean by evil?

556
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,120
How can we be evil?

557
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,480
It's a Demon Catcher like you

558
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,240
who suddenly appeared,

559
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,940
claiming that he had to catch
a great evil demon.

560
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:42,180
He destroyed Qilin Mountain

561
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,960
and ruined our home.

562
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,560
After that,

563
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,780
that foolish cultivator
chased us for miles,

564
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,460
forcing Xin and me to a dead end.

565
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,880
What did we do wrong?

566
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,860
Just because we are demons?

567
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,000
Guo Xiu,

568
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,920
is what he said true?

569
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:03,440
I was just following orders.

570
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,200
Since we became evil,

571
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,680
there's no turning back.

572
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,420
Xin has endured many hardships

573
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,120
and has now reached Tier 7.

574
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,800
With the assistance
of the pure yin blood,

575
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,000
she will surely leave the formation.

576
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,960
I can't let all this effort go to waste.

577
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,100
You.

578
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:28,160
Stop the mountain spell now

579
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,420
or the entire town

580
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,590
will die with Xin and me.

581
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,420
Fuyi.

582
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,700
Sheng and Miaomiao
are still in the valley.

583
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,600
I'll try to delay the collapse.

584
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,740
Yao,

585
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,760
go save Sheng and Miss Lin.

586
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:49,700
Guo Xiu,

587
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,760
what are you waiting for?

588
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,460
Go and evacuate the townspeople.

589
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,190
Okay.

590
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:19,840
Don't try to leave.

591
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,260
We'll all die together.

592
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,540
No one can live.

593
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,720
Get out of my way.

594
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:31,760
Mr. Guo, Mr. Guo.

595
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,980
What do we do now?

596
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,140
Think of a way to save us.

597
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,000
Don't shout. Let me think.

598
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,160
This mountain won't collapse right away,

599
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,220
and the Water Demon King is restrained.

600
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,320
We need to hurry to the town

601
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,880
and evacuate the people.

602
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,780
Someone's there.

603
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,240
Someone's there. Look.

604
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,300
Father.

605
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,560
Someone's really there.

606
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:10,020
My Douya.

607
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,400
It's really my Douya.

608
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,400
Mother. Father. Look.

609
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,420
It's Mother.

610
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,500
- It's real.
- Yes.

611
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,280
Douya's father returned alive.

612
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,060
It's her father.

613
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,900
- Hurry and help.
- Be quick.

614
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,480
No, wait. Wait.

615
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:42,760
Douya.

616
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,100
Mother.

617
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:46,880
Let me see.

618
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,220
Are you hurt?

619
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,060
I'm fine.

620
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,990
Where have you been?

621
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,980
We thought you were dead.

622
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:54,820
Cuicui,

623
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,300
what's wrong?

624
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,560
I don't know.

625
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,610
Something invisible

626
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,840
bounced me back.

627
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,640
It hurts.

628
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:14,020
Little demon,

629
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,840
you've been trapped in the formation.

630
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,580
This formation is
shadowless and formless.

631
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,940
You entered without realizing it,

632
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,960
but you can't leave now.

633
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:30,920
Is the mountain

634
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,920
going to collapse?

635
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,340
Cuicui.

636
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,800
Where are you going?

637
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,720
I'm a demon. I can't get out.

638
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:45,360
But Miaomiao and Sheng can leave.

639
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:49,160
I'll tell them the mountain
is about to collapse.

640
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,080
They need to run.

641
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,420
Cuicui!

642
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,420
Cuicui!

643
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,620
Be careful!

644
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,700
Hurry!

645
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,290
Run!

646
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,660
Mu Sheng!

647
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,100
