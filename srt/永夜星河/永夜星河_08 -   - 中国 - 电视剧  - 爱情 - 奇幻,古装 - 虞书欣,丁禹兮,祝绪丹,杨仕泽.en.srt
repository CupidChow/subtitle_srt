(School Motto)

4
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:49,660
(One-line Exercise Book)

5
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,760
You're awake.

6
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,150
You've been unconscious for two days.

7
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,710
My sister has been looking after you.

8
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,560
She's just gone to rest.

9
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,680
Don't worry, you're all right now.

10
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,350
I've healed your wound
with my magic skills.

11
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,190
- Your wound…
- You.

12
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,970
Let me go, what are you doing?

13
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,310
Let me go.

14
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,180
That's not decent.

15
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:12,940
Is your wound healed?

16
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,810
Why are you so shy?

17
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,730
I've seen it that day, haven't I?

18
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:26,950
By the way,

19
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,000
has this rabbit-shaped apple

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,940
been peeled for me?

21
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,900
I don't like apples.

22
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,250
They'll just rot in my room.

23
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,060
Thank you, Mu Sheng.

24
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,920
You…

25
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,410
Why are you always smiling at me today?

26
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,730
It's weird.

27
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,590
I always smile at you.

28
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,530
You're the one who's being weird.

29
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,690
You should rest.

30
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,060
(He looks quite cute when he's shy.)

31
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,710
(Wait a minute.)

32
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,180
(He's shy.)

33
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,410
(He's blushing.)

34
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,900
(Could that mean he likes me?)

35
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,430
Congratulations.

36
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,100
Favorability change detected.

37
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,630
Your target Mu Sheng's

38
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,850
favorability towards you
has increased significantly.

39
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,480
Eighty-five percent!

40
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,330
He's…

41
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:33,290
Unexpectedly, he's about to
fall in love with me.

42
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,570
It's increased
to eighty point five percent.

43
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,920
(Alright,
eighty point five percent is fine.)

44
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,530
(At least it's not negative anymore.)

45
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,100
Why are you coming back ?

46
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,380
Why?

47
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,380
Do you ask me?

48
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,490
My life has nothing
to do with you.

49
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,930
Why did you risk your life to save me?

50
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,800
Why?

51
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:23,990
(Because)

52
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,150
(if you died,)

53
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:29,260
(I could never return to my world.)

54
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,530
And

55
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,730
what you said

56
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,050
that day,

57
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,290
was it true?

58
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,460
(Mu Sheng, you fool.)

59
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,800
(In this world,)

60
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,270
(it's not only Sister Mu Yao
who cares about you,)

61
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,370
(but me, too.)

62
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,930
It's

63
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,220
true.

64
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,460
Why do you care so much about

65
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,610
my life?

66
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,710
Because…

67
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,550
What?

68
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,610
Because you are my master.

69
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,530
Is that all?

70
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,900
Of course.

71
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,970
As the saying goes,
once a master, always a father.

72
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,710
No disciple wouldn't want

73
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,940
his master to live a long life.

74
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,730
You're talking nonsense again.

75
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,720
No, I'm not.

76
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,630
I said

77
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,260
that I don't know your background.

78
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,100
Well,

79
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,850
I still don't know how you do things.

80
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,990
Forget it.

81
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,660
(He took it seriously.)

82
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,100
(This is good for me.)

83
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,100
(But why do I)

84
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,170
(feel a bit guilty?)

85
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,580
(Nanke Inn)

86
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,230
I thought this area was peaceful.

87
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,410
There'd be no trouble.

88
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,430
I didn't expect
that Lin Yu would fall into the water

89
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,700
while learning magic skills
and caught a cold.

90
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,480
Sheng,

91
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,290
I trusted you with Lin Yu.

92
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,970
Why are you so careless?

93
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,930
What kind of a master are you?

94
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,110
Sister Mu,

95
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,630
it's none of Mu Sheng's business.

96
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,440
I was the one who wandered off.

97
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,800
He carefully taught me magic skills.

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,370
I learned how to make sparks.

99
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,780
It's just a little less powerful.

100
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,720
In my opinion,

101
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,390
you shouldn't study magic skills
for the next few days.

102
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,610
Take care of your health first.

103
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,220
I have almost recovered.

104
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,780
Recovery is a gradual process.

105
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,730
You've had a really hard time.

106
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:09,900
This place is remote

107
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,970
and there are no good doctors.

108
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:17,700
Eat more rice.

109
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,780
What are you doing in your room?

110
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,340
I'm doing the laundry.

111
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,260
You're washing my clothes?

112
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,850
Yes, I found it in the wardrobe.

113
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,310
And I found

114
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,220
an invisibility talisman
that can block scents in there.

115
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,660
As soon as I uncovered it,
I smelled blood.

116
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,270
But it's okay.

117
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,440
I'm almost done.

118
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,340
Who allows you to do that?

119
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,580
This dress

120
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,660
should have been dealt with earlier.

121
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,580
Otherwise, Sister Mu will find out.

122
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,930
You could have burned it
by snapping your fingers,

123
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,930
but you hid it secretly.

124
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,050
(You're reluctant to destroy it.)

125
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:30,270
But I've seen the mending traces

126
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:33,230
of Sister Mu Yao for you.

127
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,130
It would be a pity to burn it.

128
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,370
Besides, you look quite handsome
wearing it.

129
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,490
I didn't expect you,
an official's daughter,

130
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,340
to do such hard work

131
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,460
and be so good at it.

132
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,750
That's because

133
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,150
I wanted to be a demon catcher
since I was a child,

134
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,180
and I started training early.

135
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,460
What's that smell?

136
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,370
Doesn't it smell good?

137
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,420
It's my homemade soap.

138
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,420
Soap?

139
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,440
It's made by crushing the soap pods

140
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,560
and mixing them with spices.

141
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,710
It can make clothes cleaner

142
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,000
and remove blood stains easier.

143
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,320
They're just bubbles.

144
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,390
Why are you making such a fuss?

145
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,540
How ignorant!

146
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,130
I have a question.

147
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,940
I don't know if I can ask it.

148
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,520
Go ahead.

149
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,420
You are so powerful
when you take off the hairband,

150
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,540
so why don't you want to take it off

151
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,460
every time you're in mortal danger?

152
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,010
Every time I take it off,

153
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,700
my mind becomes blurred and unclear,

154
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,940
and my heart is filled with anger and pain.

155
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,180
Every time I take it off

156
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:47,700
and put it on again,

157
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:52,850
I feel that my demonic power is increasing

158
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,610
and it's even hard to control.

159
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,650
So you're afraid that one day

160
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,370
even the hairband

161
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,420
won't be able to control
your demonic power.

162
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,100
I don't want to talk about this.

163
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,890
Don't bleed so much in the future, okay?

164
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,770
Blood stains are
much harder to wash off than dirt.

and you saw my demon form.

You're the first person
who isn't afraid of me.

186

But my sister won't accept
that I'm a demon.

And you happen to know my secret.

00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,460
I can never feel safe.

189
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,470
Don't worry.

190
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,300
This is just a control talisman.

191
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,460
Go west and you'll be home.

192
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,650
Once you board the ship
back to Taicang County,

193
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,100
it'll automatically unlock.

194
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,430
You can go now.

195
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,890
Go back to being an official's daughter.

196
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,590
You and I

197
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,490
should never meet again.

198
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,320
♪In this life, I've kissed your brows♪

199
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,130
♪I've been saved♪

200
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,460
♪Don't cry♪

00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,240
♪I've held your hand,

00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,700
♪The wind and snow aren't cruel♪

203
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,650
Go home.

204
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:28,970
Go home.

205
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,420
Go home.

206
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:36,380
♪It's a scene of my rebirth♪

207
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:43,230
♪Loving you completes my life♪

208
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,720
♪Loving you completes♪

209
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,140
♪My life♪

210
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,010
Go home.

211
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,610
Go home.

212
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,370
Lin Yu,

213
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,650
time for breakfast.

214
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,240
Sheng,

215
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,520
why aren't you eating?

216
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,800
What are you thinking about?

217
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,540
Nothing.

218
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,610
Have you seen Lin Yu?

219
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,060
Maybe she hasn't got up yet.

220
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:45,970
I checked her room.

221
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,890
I also checked the front and back rooms.

222
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,060
Where could she be this early?

223
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,010
Dear guests,

224
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,750
the miss who travelled with you

225
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,610
has left.

226
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,070
Left?

227
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,960
This morning before dawn,

228
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,460
she left with her luggage on her back.

229
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,420
I called her,
but she didn't even turn her head.

230
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,550
With her luggage?

231
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,250
Yes, her luggage is gone.

232
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,580
The room is tidy too.

233
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,380
That's right.

234
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,880
I also heard

235
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,060
her mumbling "Go home".

236
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,560
Yes, go home.

237
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,400
Go home?

238
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,920
Sheng,

239
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,340
did Miss Lin say that to you?

240
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,350
No.

241
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,220
How could it be?

242
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,500
Is it because

243
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,200
you were too strict with her
when you were teaching?

244
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,040
Did you scare her?

245
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:43,670
Maybe.

246
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,760
It's my fault.

247
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:50,380
Whatever it is, she can't just leave

248
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,540
without saying goodbye to us.

249
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,380
Miss Lin is the one closest to you.

250
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,660
But she didn't have the courage
to meet you.

251
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,060
Maybe she was afraid you'd be disappointed

252
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,340
if she told you in person.

253
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,220
I will find her and bring her back.

254
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,660
Sister, just let her go.

255
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,580
If she becomes a demon catcher,

256
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,500
she'll have to endure many hardships

257
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,820
and face many more dangers.

258
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,020
If she returns home early,

259
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,580
it might be a good thing.

260
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,140
That's right.

261
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,460
Those who want to leave can't be stopped.

262
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,580
But she hasn't fully recovered
from her cold.

263
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,980
I checked her pulse.

264
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,340
She's fine now.

265
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,620
But you've been

266
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,220
taking care of
Miss Lin these days,

267
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,380
you haven't eaten or slept well.

268
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,820
Come on, eat more.

269
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,820
What if she's in danger on the road?

270
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,780
The road to Taicang County is smooth.

271
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,340
She'll go back the way she came.

272
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,780
There won't be any problems.

273
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,700
Taicang County?

274
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,780
Isn't Taicang County in the west?

275
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,260
That's right.

276
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,260
What's wrong?

277
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,590
I saw her go east.

278
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,380
Go home.

279
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:24,900
Miss,

280
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,420
don't go any further.

281
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,100
Don't enter the bamboo forest.

282
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,740
There is a demon inside.

283
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,500
Miss.

284
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,820
Miss!

285
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,300
This…

286
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,100
Why does your tracking charm
work so slowly?

287
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,740
Can it go faster?

288
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,460
The talisman is still detecting
Miss Lin's aura.

289
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,620
It's already the fastest.

290
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,140
Useless.

291
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,140
Sheng!

292
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,100
There's a response.

293
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,540
It hurts.

294
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,620
Where am I?

295
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,180
My luggage.

296
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,940
I remember…

297
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,100
Mu Sheng,

298
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,540
what are you doing?

299
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,780
What a big bamboo!

300
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:32,580
Another fool comes here.

301
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,780
Help! There's a ghost!

302
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,540
Who's speaking?

303
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,500
The bamboo has become a ghost.

304
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,700
I'm a demon,

305
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,620
a thousand-year-old
Sky-Swallowing Great Demon.

306
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,940
Demon?

307
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,340
You are the Bamboo Demon Lord.

308
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,500
Please let me go.

309
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,020
Please don't eat me.

310
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,500
Please let me go.

311
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,180
A natural, green creature like you

312
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,460
should be a vegetarian.

313
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,300
My birthday is coming up.

314
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,900
I'm looking for someone

315
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,140
to make me some new clothes.

316
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,980
New clothes?

317
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,140
I'm very clumsy.

318
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,540
I can't even sew a seam properly.

319
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,540
I can't do it.

320
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,460
I don't know how to make new clothes.

321
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,940
Why don't you let me go

322
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,700
and I'll find a tailor to help you.

323
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:37,820
The clothes I want are very easy to make.

324
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,660
What clothes?

325
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,140
That idiot!

326
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,780
She really did enter this bamboo forest.

327
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,700
She's nearby.

328
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:16,860
Let's split up and search.

329
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,980
Don't come over here. Stay back.

330
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,340
What the hell is this?

331
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,420
I, I came here with Sister Mu.

332
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,530
I'm telling you,

333
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,380
Mu,

334
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,860
that's right,

335
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,220
the Mu family

336
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,260
are famous for catching demons.

337
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,980
If you catch me,

338
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,300
I'll ask them to come and catch you.

339
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,940
- Those vile demon catchers.
- Let me go.

340
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,420
Even if we demons don't offend them,

341
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,940
they'll never let us go.

342
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,540
Since you're allied with
the demon catchers,

343
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:56,460
I'll definitely turn you into clothes.

344
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,940
Let me go.

345
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,140
This, this is…

346
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,260
What's this?

347
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,300
Why is this a fake scarecrow?

348
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,020
Don't shake it.

349
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,860
Don't break my branches!

350
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,140
Stop shaking.

351
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,220
Don't break my branches.

352
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,180
Who are you?

353
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,020
I am…

354
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:06,380
I'm the Sky-Swallowing Great Demon.

355
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,100
So it was you
who caused all the trouble.

356
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,260
Sky-Swallowing Great Demon?

357
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,940
I think you are
a Sky-Swallowing Great Liar!

358
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,620
Tell me, why are you
treating me like this?

359
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,100
You…

360
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,980
You're so fierce.

361
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,380
Aren't you a demon?

362
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,700
Why are you so timid?

363
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,500
Demon…

364
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,090
Can't a demon be timid?

365
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:33,820
I'm too afraid of humans,

366
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,580
so I hide here.

367
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,660
I set up a

368
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,140
confusion array to
protect the cave entrance

369
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,820
and spread the rumor

370
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,100
of a man-eating great demon
in the bamboo forest.

371
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,940
I thought no one would come.

372
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,540
I didn't expect you to
break into my house.

373
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,900
Who would want to break into your house?

374
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,140
I didn't come here on purpose.

375
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,940
You're so timid.

376
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,380
Why don't you join other demons?

377
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,660
I'm afraid

378
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,820
to talk to other demons.

379
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,980
So you have a social anxiety.

380
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,180
What's that?

381
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,500
What is your name?

382
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,140
(Cuicui, Bamboo Demon)
Cuicui.

383
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,660
Cuicui?

384
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,020
Is this your real body?

385
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,060
No.

386
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,780
This is my grandfather.

387
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,860
Your grandfather?

388
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,260
His real body.

389
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,900
My grandfather

390
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,620
is a thousand-year-old Great Demon.

391
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,060
Great Demon?

392
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,820
In the past,

393
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,820
we both lived here.

394
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,140
In the past?

395
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,860
Where's your grandfather now?

396
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:09,980
I'm sorry.

397
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,540
I shouldn't have asked you
about your family.

398
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,780
This…

399
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,140
This is my real body.

400
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,300
So

401
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,140
you're a bamboo shoot.

402
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,580
I really didn't want to hurt you.

403
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,420
I just wanted to scare you unconscious,

404
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,980
and threw you out.

405
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,340
Please, just leave quickly.

406
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,660
Otherwise,

407
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:46,140
your powerful demon catcher friends
will come.

408
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,140
I…

409
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:57,780
Mu Sheng!

410
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,660
There's a demonic aura.

411
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,340
Show mercy!

412
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,540
He's just a bamboo shoot.

413
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,260
Did he hurt you?

414
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,980
Not at all.

415
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,220
Apart from scaring people
to do some handicrafts,

416
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,540
and bragging,

417
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,660
he'll never do anything harmful.

418
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,420
Little Bamboo Demon,

419
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,780
have you ever hurt anyone?

420
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,340
He's very timid.

421
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,700
He doesn't dare to hurt others.

422
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,380
Little Bamboo Demon,

423
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,780
I'll let you go this time.

424
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,420
Next time, if I see you

425
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,860
creating false impressions to scare people,

426
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,700
I'll kill you.

427
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,700
Get out of here.

428
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,500
This is his home.

429
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,140
Where do you want him to go?

430
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,780
You!

431
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:02,820
You…

432
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,260
Are you all right?

433
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,500
How did you end up in a place like this?

434
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,500
It was you

435
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,780
who put a strange talisman on my back,

436
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,260
and brought me here.

437
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,820
I told you to go home,

438
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,140
not to come here and die.

439
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,860
You can't even find your way home.

440
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,140
Brother, you almost killed me.

441
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,380
Why are you still so self-righteous?

442
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,260
When I see Sister Mu Yao,

443
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,580
I'll make her teach you a lesson.

444
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,450
Let her judge you. Just wait!

445
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,420
Lin Yu, are you alright?

446
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:55,260
Sister Mu Yao, Brother Liu.

447
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,300
Miss Lin, have you really
met a demon?

448
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,460
Where's the demon?

449
00:29:59,100 --> 00:29:59,980
It was a misunderstanding.

450
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,100
It's…

451
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:02,900
It's all right now.

452
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:12,180
If you're fine,

453
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,180
you'd better leave early.

454
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,060
Otherwise you won't make it

455
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,260
to the last ship.

456
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:19,860
Miss Lin,

457
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,740
you're at fault too.

458
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,700
If you think of us as friends,

459
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,940
you should say goodbye

460
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,100
when you go home.

461
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,340
She's frightened and needs to rest.

462
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:36,900
Let's discuss this later.

463
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,260
Sister Mu Yao, don't you want to know

464
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,880
why I ended up here?

465
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,700
Let me tell you.

466
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,660
Actually, the reason I came here,

467
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,420
the reason is…

468
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,060
I wanted to give you a surprise.

469
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,420
What?

470
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,380
I've never been able to

471
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,780
learn the magic skills
my master taught me.

472
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:02,300
So I wanted to find a secluded place

473
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,820
to practice

474
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,660
making sparks by myself.

475
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,900
Unexpectedly, I took a careless step,

476
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,700
and fell into the Bamboo Demon Cave.

477
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,540
Fortunately, there was only a little demon.

478
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,300
If I encountered a Great Demon,

479
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,060
I would have been dead by now.

480
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,140
It doesn't matter.

481
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:19,340
It's me who accidentally
fell in.

482
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,640
Lin Yu,

483
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,540
no matter where you go in the future,

484
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,260
you have to let us know in advance.

485
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,140
Don't be so reckless, okay?

486
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,460
Sister Mu Yao, are you angry with me?

487
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,420
No, I'm not.

488
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,900
Next time, don't be so rash.

489
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,300
We're all worried about you.

490
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,340
Look, what's this?

491
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,780
Dear guests,

492
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,460
here comes the Gourd Chicken.

493
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,940
Guests, please enjoy your meal.

494
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:03,940
It smells so good.

495
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,340
Where did the Gourd Chicken come from?

496
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,660
It's caught by Sheng.

497
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,180
It's made into Capital City Flavor

498
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,180
taught by Fuyi.

499
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,620
You made it especially for me?

500
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,700
Actually, I don't mind the hardship
on the journey.

501
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,420
Being able to travel with you

502
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,820
makes me truly happy.

503
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,300
Besides,

504
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,980
I will never leave in the future.

505
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,500
Got it. Hurry up and eat.

506
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,980
The chicken leg is cooked to perfection.

507
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,180
It's the tastiest part.

508
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,740
Thank you.

509
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,500
It smells so good.

510
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,060
It deserves its fame
in the imperial capital.

511
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,340
It's so delicious!

512
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,780
If you like it,

513
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,220
have more.

514
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,540
Thank you, Sister Mu.

515
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,220
A chicken only has two legs.

516
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,420
She's eating both of them.

517
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,580
She's the youngest.

518
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,780
What's wrong with eating more?

519
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,620
This orange is delicious too.

520
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,580
Have some.

521
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,660
No, Sister Mu.

522
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,940
I don't like fruits that need peeling.

523
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,980
(In the past,
to complete the system tasks,)

524
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,060
(I flattered you every day.)

525
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,800
(Even if the favorability
drops to a negative number,)

526
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,860
(I, Ling Miaomiao,)

527
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,820
(will not show you a friendly face
again today.)

528
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,900
(I mean what I say.)

529
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,020
Favorability change detected.

530
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,700
Mu Sheng's favorability towards you

531
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,180
has increased by one percent.

532
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,020
Miss Lin.

533
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,620
Brother Liu.

534
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,140
Take this.

535
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:19,940
Sachet?

536
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,220
I put the runes I wrote inside.

537
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,340
It can protect you.

538
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,300
Take it with you

539
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,020
and bandits, beasts and little demons

540
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:27,940
won't be able to hurt you.

541
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,540
Amulet?

542
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,820
(Brother Liu is always like this.)

543
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,660
(He's nice to every girl,)

544
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,900
(and doesn't make Sister Mu special.)

545
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,020
(I must correct this for him.)

546
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,540
Brother Liu,

547
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,340
sachets can't be given away carelessly.

548
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,980
Because for girls...

549
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,700
(Attention grabber.)

550
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,180
Because for girls,

551
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,260
this gift is really good.

552
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,180
Thank you, Brother Liu.

553
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,420
I like it very much.

554
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,260
You're too kind.

555
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,140
Companions

556
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,860
should take care of each other.

557
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,540
If you're safe and sound,

558
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,660
Yao can also be at ease.

559
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,220
Brother Liu,

560
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,900
you're very kind to me.

561
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,300
I'm really lucky

562
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,980
to have met you.

563
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,260
(Messed up, messed up.)

564
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,340
Brother Liu, I'll go first.

565
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,820
Miss Lin.

566
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,820
Even though

567
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,140
Sheng doesn't say it out loud,

568
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,660
I can tell that

569
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,220
he really cares about you.

570
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,420
On the way to the bamboo forest
to find you,

571
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,420
he was very anxious.

572
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:54,780
Was he

573
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,860
worried about me?

574
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:57,860
Yes, he was.

575
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,980
He was in the front line.

576
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,540
Except for Yao,

577
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,260
I have never seen him

578
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,420
worry so much about anyone else.

579
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,980
Sheng is becoming

580
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,300
more and more like a master.

581
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:36,940
Master,

582
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,500
are you asleep?

583
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,860
What's the matter?

584
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,020
Nothing important.

585
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,900
I just want to see you.

586
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,500
Do you want to eat an orange?

587
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,020
I want to eat one.

588
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,140
It's none of my business.

589
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,980
I think oranges that you peel taste better.

590
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,020
Can't you peel them yourself?

591
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,220
No, I can't.

592
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,340
You're trying to make conversation now?

593
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,460
I want to ask you something.

594
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,020
Today, why didn't you report me

595
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,220
in front of my sister?

596
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:26,580
You were evasive.

597
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,020
What's your intention?

598
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,140
It was you

599
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,140
who didn't let me tell the truth.

600
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,940
I didn't mind it and I covered for you.

601
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,060
You question me instead?

602
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,020
If I wanted to keep your mouth shut,

603
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,340
would you still be alive?

604
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:53,020
I just wanted you to go home.

605
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,540
Stop being an eyesore in front of me.

606
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,220
Who knew you'd be so

607
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,180
stupid!

608
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:07,020
Now I'm repaying evil with good.

609
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,490
Don't repay kindness with hostility.

610
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,500
Promise me.

611
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:19,380
You won't drive me away again, okay?

612
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:33,900
That's fine.

613
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,860
But if you dare to leak the secret,

614
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,300
I will not forgive you.

615
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,340
Take this.

616
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,380
What's this?

617
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:56,860
A magical weapon.

618
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,820
What a small magical weapon!

619
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,940
I made it that small.

620
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,550
It can transform your spiritual power

621
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,380
from Hegu, Shaoshang,

622
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,460
Shaofu, and Laogong

623
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,700
to integrate and consolidate it

624
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,740
at the tip of your finger.

625
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,540
It will be easier for you to practice.

626
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,500
You're the one who made this.

627
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,060
Come and try to
practice your magic skills.

628
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,580
It's too late. I can't practice anymore.

629
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,200
- I want to sleep.
- Come out.

630
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,020
I really don't want to practice anymore.

631
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,740
Master.

632
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,420
- I don't want to practice anymore.
- Practice.

633
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,700
If you don't master the magic skills,

634
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,020
who can protect you in the future

635
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,540
when you face such danger?

636
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:43,860
But

637
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,740
