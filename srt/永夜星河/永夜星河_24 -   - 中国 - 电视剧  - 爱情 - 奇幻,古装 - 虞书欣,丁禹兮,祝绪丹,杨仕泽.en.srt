=Episode 24=

3
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,150
Did you see it clearly?

4
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,470
Without the barrier talisman,

5
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,240
what kind of thing is he?

6
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,230
Sister.

7
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,240
He's clearly a demon,

8
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,560
but he's hiding his true form.

9
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,710
What are your intentions?

10
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,710
Do you think you are well hidden,

11
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,510
pretending to be a human?

12
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,120
Master, Sheng…

13
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,040
Mu Sheng did not do it intentionally.

14
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,780
It was my fault
for concealing this matter.

15
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,510
Sister Mu,

16
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,710
you must trust Ziqi.

17
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,870
- He…
- Miaomiao.

18
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,200
She is my sister.

19
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,280
Let me handle it.

20
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,710
The Mu Family is
famous for catching demons.

21
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:06,560
How could its reputation
be tainted by a demon?

22
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:07,990
Little girl,

23
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,430
this creature has been hiding
by your side for many years.

24
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,520
Now his behavior has been exposed.

25
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,360
Why don't you kill him quickly

26
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,680
to uphold your family's honor?

27
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,750
Will you kill him or not?

28
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,360
Will you?

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,840
Master,

30
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,590
I know I was wrong.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,840
Master!

32
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,240
Sister…

33
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,750
I deceived you.

34
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,520
I deserve

35
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,080
to die.

36
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:08,850
No!

37
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,750
So what if my brother is a demon?

38
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,240
He grew up with me since childhood.

39
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,310
We are as close as siblings.

40
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,240
Nothing he has done

41
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,800
has ever violated
the Mu Family's instructions.

42
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,480
Even if there were mistakes,

43
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,870
it's not your place as an outsider

44
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,920
to lecture at my brother like this.

45
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:49,750
I originally thought

46
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,160
Mr. Wenxin was a reasonable
and understanding person.

47
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,950
I didn't expect you to be
so narrow-minded and arbitrary

48
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,870
in judging others
with such a trivial status.

49
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,070
Since that's the case,

50
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,430
we'd better not enter

51
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,750
the Liaoran Valley.

52
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,840
Sheng,

53
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,950
follow me.

54
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,590
Be careful!

55
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,920
- Sheng!
- Don't you have divine power?

56
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:41,780
Help him.

57
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,120
I... I still don't know how to use it.

58
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,230
Let's go first.

59
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,470
Yao.

60
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,070
Miaomiao, you try it.

61
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,120
- Are you okay?
- No, I can't do it.

62
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,760
Sheng!

63
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,650
Ziqi!

64
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,880
Sheng!

65
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,150
Come.

66
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,160
Look over there.

67
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,440
How has the shadow changed?

68
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,080
Lotus?

69
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,360
So this is Sheng's nature.

70
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,720
Old man,

71
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,340
you're playing with me!

72
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,850
You tricked me first.

73
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,270
If you hadn't played tricks,

74
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,630
nothing would have happened,

75
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,240
but you had to be sneaky,

76
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,480
there must be something in your heart.

77
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:20,040
So it would be revealed.

78
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,870
Master, you are correct.

79
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,870
I thought I was clever

80
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,070
and made a wrong decision.

81
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:34,680
Young man,

82
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,600
keep more good thoughts in mind

83
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,480
and play fewer tricks.

84
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,480
This way
you won't get beaten for nothing.

85
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,110
Do you understand?

86
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,430
I'm leaving.

87
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,350
Ziqi…

88
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,350
Sister…

89
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,510
Sister Mu Yao,

90
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:33,920
have you eaten?

91
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,720
Sister Mu Yao,

92
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,360
I brought you
your favorite crystal cake.

93
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,510
It's still warm.

94
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,510
Yao,

95
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,320
about today, Sheng…

96
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,160
Stop talking.

97
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,490
Sister Mu Yao,

98
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,750
we didn't mean to hide it from you,

99
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,600
and Mu Sheng…

100
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,440
You too.

101
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:12,910
All of you, please leave.

102
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,840
Sheng, stay.

103
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,720
Sister Mu Yao is still angry.

104
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,600
Now putting them together,

105
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,630
is it good?

106
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,080
I think it should be done this way.

107
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,480
This is

108
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,960
a matter

109
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,200
between siblings

110
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,960
and should be resolved by themselves.

111
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,560
That's right.

112
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,720
I believe Sister Mu Yao.

113
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,200
I think

114
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,870
after we have gone through
so much together,

115
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,630
she is no longer the person

116
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,670
who was merciless towards demons.

117
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,080
It's just that I feel

118
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,360
what is making Sister Mu Yao angry now

119
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,740
is not Ziqi's identity.

120
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,040
What else?

121
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,550
Us.

122
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,960
You see, all of us kept it from her.

123
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:34,670
Everyone knew the identity
of her brother except her.

124
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,720
She was the only one kept in the dark.

125
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,360
Anyone would feel bad in her place,
right?

126
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,800
Sister.

127
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,240
I'm sorry.

128
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,360
Others have only known you
for a few months,

129
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,670
yet they already know your secret.

130
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,080
We've been siblings for so many years,

131
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,720
but I knew nothing about it.

132
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,910
As your sister,

133
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,790

I worry about everything,

but I only overlook you.

140
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:07,710
No.

141

you were introverted since childhood

147

please forgive us.

Sister Mu Yao,

177
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,670
we will never hide anything
from you next time.

178
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:25,030

Let's agree first.

181

No matter what happens in the future,

182
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,360
you can't hide it from me.

183
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,750
Actually,

184
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,270
I've thought about it myself.

185
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,160
It's my prejudice and obsession

186
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,590
that almost caused a rift among us.

187
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,720
Sister Mu Yao, please don't say that.

188
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,150
It's really great
that you can reconcile.

189
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,270
As long as we are united as one,

190
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,150
no matter what happens in the future,

191
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,630
we can get through it.

192
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,920
What's wrong?

193
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,910
Why do I feel like

194
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,200
everything today

195
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,990
seems to be arranged in advance?

196
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,320
That Mr. Wenxin seems

197
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,600
quite knowledgeable.

198
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,120
This time, Mr. Wenxin helped us

199
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:36,150
resolve our inner conflicts.

200
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,120
We should thank him.

201
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,870
Thank him?

202
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,510
That person is all bluster.

203
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,440
He's very suspicious.

204
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,320
Besides, didn't Liu Fuyi say that

205
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:46,840
even he doesn't know
his Master's identity?

206
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,750
Are you all planning to continue chatting

207
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,840
until I finish cooking

208
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,080
and eating?

209
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,920
Come over and help!

210
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,200
Okay.

211
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,280
Fuyi,

212
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,790
rinse the rice and start steaming it.

213
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,890
- Okay.
- Girl,

214
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,120
wash these vegetables too.

215
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,380
- Okay.
- Good.

216
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,850
Senior, are you using this
to cut vegetables?

217
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,920
- Yes.
- Isn't this your magical weapon?

218
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,890
It can be used for subduing demons
and cutting vegetables.

219
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,470
Come.

220
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,600
Go and bring me that tofu.

221
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,510
Tofu, give me tofu.

222
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,200
Mind the blades.

223
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:53,990
Come, give it to me.

224
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,510
Alright, you two, don't just sit around.

225
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,600
Pick some mushrooms over there.

226
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,960
I'll make stewed chicken with mushrooms

227
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,440
- for you. Go.
- Okay.

228
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,960
But I like eating stewed chicken with Cuicui,
you little shoot.

229
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,080
Let's go.

230
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:08,950
We'll be back soon.

231
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:15,880
They all left.

232
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:18,430
You are

233
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,160
full of strength.

234
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,750
Chop all that firewood.

235
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,000
You…

236
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,030
Stop saying a word.

237
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,860
I know you have a lot of questions.

238
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,580
Whatever questions you have,
wait until we're full.

239
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,730
The stewed chicken with mushrooms
needs a strong fire

240
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,120
to taste good.

241
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,400
Hurry up.

242
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,370
No.

243
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,350
Ziqi, Ziqi,

244
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,260
quick, try this cake.

245
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,230
Where did it come from?

246
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,400
I made it myself.

247
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,500
Master Wenxin taught me.

248
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,150
He even praised me for learning quickly.

249
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,680
Aren't you going to eat?

250
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,510
Then I'll eat it myself.

251
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,040
It's really delicious.

252
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,160
You've been won over so quickly.

253
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,880
The true identity and purpose
of that old man

254
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,880
remain a complete mystery.

255
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,240
He appears kind and benevolent,

256
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,070
but surely has some plans.

257
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,480
His true identity is

258
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,750
something we do not know,

259
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,930
but right now,

260
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,960
doesn't he just want us to trust him?

261
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,350
If he is a good person,

262
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,540
what he plans must not be anything bad.

263
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,160
But if he is a bad person,

264
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,720
we should now make him believe us,

265
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,830
so that we can know his final purpose.

266
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,350
That's right.

267
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,070
But I don't know why,

268
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,510
every time I see him, I get annoyed

269
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:45,640
and just want to argue with him.

270
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,960
Help!

271
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,290
Back mountain!

272
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,720
What's wrong with the back mountain?

273
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,340
Back mountain!

274
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,560
I…

275
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,790
I saw...

276
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,270
Come here now.

277
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,790
So many little demons.

278
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,350
Brother Liu,

279
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,480
have they always been residing here?

280
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,030
Liaoran Valley is rich in earth energy.

281
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,550
It's suitable for demons to live.

282
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,350
My Master never disturbs
or drives them away.

283
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,590
So the Senior

284
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,400
does not truly dislike demons.

285
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,830
In front of the Mirror Formation,

286
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,440
he intentionally tested me,

287
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,680
asking about my nature.

288
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,880
For the first time,
I saw demons and humans

289
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,700
staying together so harmoniously.

290
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
This is how the world should be.

291
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,040
It's wonderful.

292
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,750
Since there is nothing at all,

293
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,920
why are you screaming?

294
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,110
I… Who said there is nothing?

295
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,750
I just came to pick mushrooms.

296
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,510
These guys suddenly surrounded me,

297
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,880
asking me this and that,

298
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,350
such as how old I am,
what tier I've reached,

299
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,000
where I'm from and what my name is.

300
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,880
They have no sense of boundaries.

301
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,790
I was scared out of my wits.

302
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,830
They were just welcoming you

303
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:17,720
to say hello.

304
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,350
Cuicui, look,

305
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,830
there is a large bamboo forest
over there.

306
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,270
Aren't you looking for your grandfather?

307
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,750
Go to ask your peers.

308
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,400
Maybe there's some information.

309
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,830
That bamboo forest is really big.

310
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,620
It must be several hundred years old.

311
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,450
It really looks like my grandfather.

312
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,800
No.

313
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,480
This is my grandfather.

314
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,480
Grandfather!

315
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,110
Grandfather!

316
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,310
Grandfather!

317
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,440
Grandfather!

318
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,590
Is that you, grandfather?

319
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,270
Is it you, grandfather?

320
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,880
Is it you, grandfather?

321
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,000
Which family's child

322
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,750
(Qingqing, Old Bamboo Demon)
is disturbing my sleep?

323
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,800
Grandfather!

324
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,960
Grandfather!

325
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,460
- You…
- Grandfather!

326
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,830
It's really you.

327
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,640
I finally found you.

328
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,720
Wait.

329
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,830
Are you calling me grandfather?

330
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:44,960
Grandfather,

331
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:46,180
don't you recognize me?

332
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,350
I am your grandson.

333
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,580
Take a good look.

334
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,110
I think I have a grandson

335
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,240
called Huahua.

336
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,640
It's Cuicui, my name is Cuicui.

337
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,830
Cuicui?

338
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:08,500
Why does Cuicui's grandfather
not seem to recognize him?

339
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,160
I remember I had been looking for
my grandson for a long time

340
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,510
until I forgot.

341
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,640
You've grown up.

342
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,400
It seems not right.

343
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,560
Could it be that tall?

344
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,510
We haven't seen each other
for many years.

345
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,650
How come you

346
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,750
look like a bamboo shoot?

347
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,830
- This…
- Cuicui,

348
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,680
did you mistake someone else?

349
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,070
Is he really your grandfather?

350
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,350
Could it be a mistake?

351
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,400
No, this is my grandfather.

352
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,720
He is getting old.

353
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,070
His memory isn't good.

354
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,440
He has never gotten my name right.

355
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,400
Grandfather,

356
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,240
where have you been all these years?

357
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,200
I waited for you at home for so long.

358
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:56,030
I thought I would never see you again.

359
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,880
You were right.

360
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,240
Where have I been?

361
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,440
I just remember

362
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,880
I had lived in this valley
for a long time,

363
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,270
spending every day
with my little friend Wenxin,

364
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,350
drinking tea and playing chess.

365
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,440
How did I end up here?

366
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,110
Senior Bamboo,

367
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,110
when you were in hibernation,

368
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,240
you were taken away by a Demon Catcher.

369
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,550
At that time, you were deceived by him.

370
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,170
That person said he would take you

371
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,640
to find someone you haven't seen
in a long time.

372
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,590
You believed it and followed him.

373
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,640
Fortunately, you met my Master
on the way.

374
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,000
I remember now.

375
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,560
That young rascal is really vicious.

376
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,990
He lied to me

377
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:43,090
that Yanyan was waiting for me.

378
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,040
Yanyan?

379
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,480
Who is that?

380
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,030
- I was really tricked.
- It was Cuicui's grandfather's first love.

381
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,000
It was a Photinia Serrulata Demon.

382
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,960
If it weren't for Wenxin,

383
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:55,200
I might have already been
turned into a staff.

384
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,350
Liu Fuyi,

385
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,210
did you know long ago

386
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,640
that Cuicui's grandfather was
in the valley?

387
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,030
Why didn't you say it earlier?

388
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,030
I asked him not to say it.

389
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:11,310
Wouldn't saying it in advance
ruin the surprise?

390
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:12,670
Surprise?

391
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,310
I think it's just an excuse.

392
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,110
You hide everything.

393
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,590
What exactly do you want to do?

394
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:19,960
I don't want to do anything.

395
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,200
The meal is ready.

396
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,440
Let's eat first.

397
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:25,870
Here I come.

398
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,590
Delicious.

399
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:06,910
Eat up.

400
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,350
Pick up your chopsticks.

401
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,790
You've been busy all day and not eating?

402
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,350
This stewed chicken with mushrooms

403
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,640
and this fried bacon with bamboo shoots

404
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,030
were your father's favorites back then.

405
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,590
Come, have a taste.

406
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,840
Senior,

407
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,310
you knew my father?

408
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:25,670
Master,

409
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:28,510
all these years
you have always been letting me

410
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,180
keep an eye on the whereabouts
of the Mu siblings,

411
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,160
but never told me the reason.

412
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,750
I wonder if you are an
old acquaintance of the Mu Family.

413
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,550
What old acquaintance?

414
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,990
It's been seven years
since the Mu Family incident.

415
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,440
My sister has been searching the enemies.

416
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,480
Everyone who had a connection
with the Mu Family

417
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,270
knew it.

418
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,830
How come you never showed up?

419
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,350
Instead, you played
quite a few tricks secretly.

420
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,510
What's your purpose?

421
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:57,590
You…

422
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,510
They are asking all sorts of questions.

423
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,160
You have arrived at Liaoran Valley.

424
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,550
Don't you want to ask anything?

425
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,510
I do want to ask.

426
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,030
Senior, I want to ask,

427
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,720
what does the nature's form and shadow

428
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,790
in the Mirror Formation mean?

429
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,030
You ask about everything,

430
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:20,960
but why does no one ask about
the catastrophe of heaven?

431
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,590
Master,

432
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:25,880
Sheng drew out the Crescent.

433
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,320
After reading the Prophecy,
the Astronomical Bureau said

434
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,410
that the Blood Moon in the sky
indicates the catastrophe of heaven.

435
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,640
The catastrophe will occur
in three years,

436
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,000
but it is uncertain
whether this is true or false.

437
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,760
Those fools

438
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,770
at the Astronomical Bureau are

439
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,030
so unreliable.

440
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,590
Within three years?

441
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,350
In three months

442
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,590
there will be a Blood Moon in the sky.

443
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:55,950
Three months?

444
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,680
What is a Blood Moon in the sky?

445
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:00,110
Could it really mean
the end of the world?

446
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,760
Scary.

447
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,070
The end of the world is scary.

448
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,000
Eat!

449
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:18,870
Come on.

450
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,800
Eat now.

451
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,110
Brother Bamboo has lived for 1,000 years.

452
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,070
900 years ago,

453
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,720
he experienced
the catastrophe of heaven.

454
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,440
Now let him

455
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,480
take you into his memories
to have a look.

456
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,150
Brother,

457
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:40,670
go.

458
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,790
Run!

459
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,830
The catastrophe of heaven really exists.

460
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,240
It is not a mere illusion.

461
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,920
If it truly occurs,

462
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:31,000
wouldn't living beings be in misery?

463
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,030
Not only would they be in misery,

464
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:37,550
but all humans, demons, creatures,
and plants in the world

465
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,790
would perish.

466
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,790
Even this world would cease to exist.

467
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,430
Senior,

468
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,270
more than 900 years ago,

469
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,310
how was the catastrophe of heaven
stopped?

470
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:55,350
Finally, someone asked
the right question.

471
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,190
Brother Bamboo,

472
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,160
you tell them.

473
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,240
I remember now.

474
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:08,480
Back then,
both demons and humans were at a loss.

475
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,350
There was a young female cultivator

476
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,200
about your age.

477
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,970
She brought hope to all of us.

478
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:20,790
Was she the ancestor of our family,
Mu Qingshi?

479
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,310
Yes.

480
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,160
So you are one of her descendants.

481
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,790
I have met her before.

482
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,960
But it was just a brief encounter.

483
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,110
I was about his age at that time.

484
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:34,030
I will take you

485
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,630
to have a direct look.

486
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,720
Come.

487
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,110
Miaomiao?

488
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,240
Why does this person

489
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,550
look exactly like me?

490
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:46,920
Miaomiao,

491
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,110
why is it you?

492
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,880
How could the Mu Family's ancestor

493
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,110
be so similar to Miaomiao?

494
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,300
Grandfather,

495
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:01,680
did you remember it wrong again?

496
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:04,830
You used to always mistake

497
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,270
the neighboring birch sapling for me.

498
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,960
How could that be?

499
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,400
When I saw her on the back mountain,

500
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,830
I felt she looked familiar.

501
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:14,400
I started to think about
who she resembled.

502
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,750
After listening to what you said,

503
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,400
I became uncertain.

504
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,200
An old and confused bamboo

505
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,240
might have a bad memory.

506
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,320
He just saw it 900 years ago,

507
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,400
how could he still remember it now?

508
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,510
I think after meeting Miaomiao,

509
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,720
he fabricated it out of thin air.

510
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,880
But Senior Bamboo has never seen

511
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,790
Miaomiao's inner core
and frontal mark.

512
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,550
It is indeed identical.

513
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,350
The pattern on the cloak just now

514
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,880
is the ancient family emblem
of the Mu Family.

515
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,720
Very few people have seen it.

516
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,000
And the inner core and the frontal mark

517
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,400
are only vaguely mentioned

518
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,790
in ancient books and records
of the Bureau.

519
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,480
In the memory of Senior Bamboo,

520
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,680
they were so clear.

521
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,480
If it weren't for seeing it personally…

522
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,680
We should ask

523
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,510
whether what he let us see

524
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,680
was deliberately orchestrated
by someone.

525
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,350
Impossible.

526
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,510
You all know,

527
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:25,200
we bamboos simply cannot lie.

528
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,580
Exactly.

529
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,850
How could I, an old bamboo, deceive you?

530
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,720
Even if someone instructed me,

531
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,550
I can't remember it.

532
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,240
Senior,

533
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,750
the Prophecy said that only the one
who draws out the Crescent

534
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:39,070
is destined to be
the Heavenly Demon Catcher.

535
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,480
But now,

536
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:43,160
the rainbow inner core is
inside my body.

537
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:45,440
Could it be that
the Astronomical Bureau made a mistake?

538
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,880
Is it possible that the Guardian Master
is actually two people,

539
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,240
not just one person?

540
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,520
No.

541
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:54,030
In the same era,
the Heavenly Demon Catcher

542
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,550
can't be two people.

543
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,920
There will only be one person.

544
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,940
Those people
from the Astronomical Bureau,

545
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,020
even if they are muddling through,

546
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,920
have never interpreted
the Prophecy wrong.

547
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,510
So in that case,

548
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,480
the one destined to save the world

549
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:10,870
is still…

550
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,270
You are talking about him?

551
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:21,990
When he entered the valley,

552
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:24,000
he sparred with me
using that ancient artifact,

553
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,270
but his moves were weak and powerless.

554
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,680
He didn't even show

555
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,030
a tenth of the ancient artifact's

556
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:30,310
full potential.

557
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,790
How could he face

558
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:33,590
that great demon
who can tear open the sky?

559
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,770
If you rely on him to save the world…

560
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,110
I don't have high hopes for you.

561
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,030
Don't joke around.

562
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,270
It's too funny.

563
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,030
Ziqi!

564
00:33:59,030 --> 00:33:59,920
I said I won't practice.

565
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,350
I don't care about
any great demon or sky crack.

566
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,270
If it falls right in front of me,
I'll care.

567
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,790
But why should I listen to that old man?

568
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,820
But we don't have any other advice

569
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,670
to listen to now.

570
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,740
Why should I listen to others?

571
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:20,280
Will you listen to me?

572
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,290
Why do you stop practicing?

573
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,480
I've been practicing for so long.

574
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,280
How about taking a break?

575
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,280
Get up.

576
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,240
Take a rest.

577
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,320
Do you want to eat some fruit?

578
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,510
No, I don't.

579
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,000
The weather is nice today.

580
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,400
Let's go to the back mountain
to watch the sunset.

581
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,570
It must be beautiful.

582
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,070
The weather is nice?

583
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,440
I'll stand with you for a while.

584
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,510
Ever since we entered the valley,

585
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,950
we haven't had a proper conversation.

586
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,480
Don't be lazy, keep practicing.

587
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,780
Isn't this something I said to you?

588
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,000
Are you trying to get back at me?

589
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,750
That's right.

590
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,360
Revenge is a dish best served cold.

591
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,240
Hurry up and practice.

592
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,030
Okay.

593
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:42,870
Young man,

594
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:47,190
in Liaoran Valley,
if you use force like this,

595
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,840
you won't make it through.

596
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,550
Old man,

597
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,440
you're shutting yourself in here,

598
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,190
are you trying to trap all of us

599
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,230
in the valley?

600
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,980
You are here as a guest.

601
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:02,170
If you want to come or leave,

602
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,260
just let me, the host, know.

603
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,840
Do you want to leave?

604
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,350
Alright.

605
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,760
It's open.

606
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,510
You are known as Mr. Wenxin.

607
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:26,670
I have a question.

608
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,510
I want to ask you.

609
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,840
Go ahead.

610
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:00,510
You have a good foundation,

611
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,670
but your skill is insufficient.

612
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,680
Here it comes!

613
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,840
My question is,

614
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,600
why are you afraid

615
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:45,840
