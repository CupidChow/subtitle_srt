00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,120
shouldn't affect
your company's ad investment

194
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,250
in our magazine.

195
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,790
Otherwise,

196
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,290
people might think

197
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,000
you mix business with personal stuff.

198
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,200
Lanshan means

199
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,500
you keep things professional

200
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,580
and have a broad vision.

201
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,250
It looks like Editor Gu

202
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,200
is not happy with me.

203
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,660
Is this how you apologize?

204
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,040
Lanshan,

205
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,790
let's just make him happy
and get through this.

206
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,000
Otherwise, we'll lose our ad money.

207
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,660
Mr. Sheng is really impressive.

208
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,250
But

209
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,830
he could be

210
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,290
more professional.

211
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:34,540
Mr. Sheng,

212
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,410
you're the most handsome man
in the world.

213
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,580
Whoever marries you

214
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,700
will be the happiest woman

215
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,200
alive.

216
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,120
Not bad.

217
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:43,660
You've got good taste.

218
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,700
Mr. Sheng, since you're so generous,

219
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,700
how about our ad fee...

220
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,950
You can leave now.

221
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,040
I want to talk to Editor Gu alone.

222
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,660
Uh,

223
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,620
I'll go then.

224
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:57,830
Have a good chat.

225
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,200
Why did you hit her?

226
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,120
She hit my colleague first.

227
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,540
Just for that?

228
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,080
Yes.

229
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,200

What do you think?

237
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:01,910
The article

238
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:03,580
is shallow,

239
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,330
the writing is all over the place,
and it lacks logic.

240
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,000
The layout isn't clean either.

241
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,370
You're such a perfect match for me.

242
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,500
Discussing your husband's scandals

243
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,250
like it's just the weather.

244
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,250
Mr. Sheng,

245
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,040
how can we get our ad fee back?

246
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,700
I can reinstate your ad fee,

247
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,160
but you need to...

248
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,910
make me happy first.

249
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,750
This shameless woman

250
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,500
is trying to seduce Shi.

251
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,000
It's numb.

252
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,160
It's done.

253
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,540
Happy, Mr. Sheng?

254
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,750
Oh,

255
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,120
Not bad.

256
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,000
Editor Gu,

257
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,120
here to apologize?

258
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,120
Shi.

259
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,830
I already heard.

260
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,040
You stopped

261
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,330
the magazine's ad fee for me.

262
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,500
You're going to make me cry!

263
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,500
Ms. Su,

264
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,370
I suggest you

265
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,540
see a doctor.

266
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,870
Being self-delusional is a sickness.

267
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,790
You...

268
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,620
Editor Gu,

269
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,660
I really like

270
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,120
your straightforwardness.

271
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,700
Let's forget about this morning.

272
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,790
Maybe

273
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,450
we can be friends.

274
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,580
I don't need friends.

275
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,040
Who doesn't want more friends?

276
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,120
Tonight, I'm going to a party

277
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,410
with Shi.

278
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,660
You should come.

279
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,000
I can introduce you to some celebrities

280
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,500
for your work.

281
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,330
If there's nothing else

282
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,700
I won't disturb you two.

283
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:11,620
Wait.

284
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,450
I think Jiao is right.

285
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,700
Come to the party with us.

286
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,750
If you do well,

287
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,370
I'll restore your ad fee.

288
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,540
Everyone on your team

289
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,200
might lose their jobs.

290
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,120
Deal.

291
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,370
Hello, sir.

292
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,620
Drink menu, please.

293
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,790
Get a drink for Jiao.

294
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,910
Fan Hua,

295
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,750
do you think Shi is crazy

296
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:17,620
bringing his wife

297
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,410
and his rumored girlfriend
to hang out together?

298
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,250
Childish.

299
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,410
Let's drink.

300
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,160
Mr. Sheng,

301
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,660
the contract is done.

302
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,040
Please have a look.

303
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:37,750
Excuse me.

304
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,700
So, you're the Editor Gu?

305
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:50,790
Have a drink.

306
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,200
Sorry,

307
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,250
I don't drink.

308
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,450
Then have some water.

309
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,950
Are you crazy?

310
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,450
I was being nice to you.

311
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,950
How could you scald me?

312
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,160
Can you afford to compensate?

313
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,450
[Water temperature is below 45 degrees]
The water isn't over 45 degrees.

314
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,410
Are you overly sensitive

315
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:13,910
or just whining?

316
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,410
Who do you think you are?

317
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,620
You're just here

318
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,080
trying to butter up Shi.

319
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:19,250
Too bad.

320
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:20,750
He's only interested

321
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,120
in Jiao.

322
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:24,080
He doesn't care about you.

323
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,000
Whether he pays attention to me

324
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,660
has nothing to do

325
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:29,910
with you accusing me.

326
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,790
You...

327
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,000
You pull the trigger

328
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,290
while someone else handles the ammo.

329
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,700
You need to boost your IQ a bit.

330
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:39,830
Are you calling me dumb?

331
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,910
What's going on?

332
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:56,540
Sheng...

333
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,000
Seems like Shi does care.

334
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,040
Let go!

335
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,250
If you're not scared of
making the front page tomorrow,

336
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,080
I don't mind taking care
of you right here.

337
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,790
I'm not hurt.

338
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,500
I went to the party.

339
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,540

340
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,500
Gu Lanshan,

you're really enduring all this

342
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,200
for your job.

343
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:50,370
I really need money.

344
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,660
I can't afford to lose this job.

345
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,290
I...

346
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,680
[Han Chengchi: Shi,
En and I are coming back tomorrow]

347
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,540
Do you like Han Chengchi that much?

348
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,250
Yes.

349
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,540
I do.

350
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,540
Even if I marry you,

351
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,870
I'll still like him.

352
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,080
I liked him before,

353
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:24,910
I like him now,

354
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,540
and I'll like him forever.

355
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,910
Divorce me if you've got the guts.

356

357

Go crazy liking him.

359
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,330
But you'll always be Mrs. Sheng,

360
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,500
making your love forever out of reach.

361
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:40,500
Don't forget.

362
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,450
He is your sister's man.

363
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:44,790
So what?

364
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,870
I'll still like him,

365
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,160

My sister texted last night.

384
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,910
She and Chengchi are coming back today.

385
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,040
She wants us to go home for dinner.

386
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,580
Do you want me to see
you flirt with him?

387
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,160
I...

388
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:29,890
♪I'm addicted, no cure♪

389
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:33,640
♪The toughest puzzle I endure♪

390
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,140
♪Our problem was clear♪

391
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:41,310
♪I lost myself here♪

392
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,640
♪Missing you, a cruel link♪

393
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,850
♪My voice hoarse, tears in sync♪

394
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:53,680
♪A smile is the classy thing♪

395
00:19:53,680 --> 00:20:00,060
♪I've bet everything♪

396
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:01,620
Mr. Sheng.

397
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,790
This is my business partner,
Liu Zhiyang.

398
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:06,750
Nice to meet you, Mr. Sheng.

399
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:13,790
Nice to meet you, Mr. Sheng.

400
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:16,910
Come on in,

401
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,830
Mr. Sheng.

402
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,250
Lanshan,

403
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,000
I heard the food here

404
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,040
is amazing.

405
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,620
Lots of people recommend this place.

406
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,660
We have to try everything today.

407
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,000
Mr. Sheng, our deal

408
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,330
is done.

409
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:32,000
We'll split the profits fifty-fifty.
You can sit back and wait for the money.

410
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,330
Thanks, Mr. Huang.

411
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,790
Mr. Sheng, why didn't you
bring any of your beauties today?

412
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,950
Where is Su Jiaojiao?

413
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,000
Why?

414
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,700
Do you like her, Mr. Liu?

415
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,540
Who doesn't like a beauty?

416
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,660
But honestly,

417
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:54,040
Su Jiaojiao is nothing

418
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,450
compared to my dream girl.

419
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,330
Back then,

420
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,660
I couldn't even look at her.

421
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,450
Your dream girl?

422
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,750
She must be stunning.

423
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:01,950
We had a connection,
but it wasn't meant to be.

424
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,660
So, who is she, Mr. Liu?

425
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,870
Maybe

426
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,950
we can help you out.

427
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,790
Lanshan, what do you want to eat?

428
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,830
I'll have the Mexican fried rice

429
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,580
and a mushroom soup, thanks.

430
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:15,870
I'll have the same.

431
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,290
Alright, just a moment.

432
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,620
Lanshan, you know what they do

433
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,000
without looking at the menu?

434
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,200
I did some research beforehand.

435
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:25,870
Are you secretly

436
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:26,950
a rich girl

437
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,410
experiencing common life?

438
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,450
No way.

439
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,790
If you were a rich girl,

440
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:34,830
you wouldn't be working

441
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,080
at our little magazine.

442
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,750
Excuse me.

443
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,910
Gu Lanshan.

444
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,540
You are?

445
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,700
It's me,

446
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,830
Liu, I was the head of the Sandbox Club.

447
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:08,910
Hello.

448
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,330
You're still as beautiful as ever.

449
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,660
What brings you here, Mr. Liu?

450
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,370
Just discussing a project.

451
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,580
Since we're reunited,

452
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,660
we can exchange contact information.

453
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,330
Sorry, I didn't bring my phone.

454
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:21,700
Maybe next time.

455
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:22,700
My friend is waiting.

456
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:23,750
Excuse me.

457
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:24,950
Lanshan,

458
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,080
here's my card.

459
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,450
Contact me anytime you need anything.

460
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,180
Hello?

461
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:51,870
Where are you?

462
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:53,750
I'm having lunch with a friend.

463
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:04,950
Why are you here?

464
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:07,160
Yeah.

465
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,410
What a coincidence!

466
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,950
Didn't you text me

467
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,500
saying you wanted to
go back home with me?

468
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,370
So now

469
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,620
you're having lunch
with a friend instead?

470
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,080
Gu Lanshan,

471
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,250
I see you've really improved.

472
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,790
So, is tonight's dinner

473
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,040
also with this friend?

474
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,200
Be careful what you say,

475
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,540
not just what you eat.

476
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,410
Gu Lanshan,

477
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:54,080
don't forget you're still Mrs. Sheng.

478
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:56,370
Of course,

479
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,750
Mr. Sheng

480
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,540
I won't forget.

481
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,200
Miss,

482
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:14,000
do you need any help?

483
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:17,620
No, thank you.

484
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,830
Even when you're harassed,

485
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,290
you won't ask me for help, Chu?

486
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,250
Guess who I just met?

487
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,830
Who did you meet

488
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:45,910
that made you so happy?

489
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,410
My Goddess, Gu Lanshan!

490
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,910
Do you think I'm about to get lucky?

491
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,790
Looks like everyone's almost done.

492
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,290
How about

493
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,660
we head to the court

494
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:57,120
and play some badminton?

495
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,040
Sorry, Mr. Liu.

496
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:19,370
Sorry, Mr. Liu.

497
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,750
Talk to them.

498
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,160
Take a break, Mr. Sheng.

499
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,040
You've been playing for a while.

500
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,000
I'm not tired.

501
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:44,370
I haven't had enough yet.

502
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,080
Mr. Sheng,

503
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,910
what did he do

504
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,950
to offend you?

505
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,450
Be the bigger person

506
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,660
and let it go.

507
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,160
Who's mad?

508
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,370
His character is just bad.

509
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,750
Mr. Sheng, what do you mean by that?

510
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,000
I mean,

511
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:04,580
Gu Lanshan is someone
you shouldn't mess with.

512
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,250
I suggest you get rid of

513
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:08,000
any bad ideas you have.

514
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,080
What bad ideas?

515
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,410
Got it?

516
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:28,750
Hello?

517
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,540
En.

518
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:30,370
Hello?

519
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:31,250
Shan.

520
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,910
Where are you and Shi?

521
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,080
We've been waiting for you two.

522
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,120
En, we're on our way.

523
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:38,870
Alright.

524
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,040
Hurry up.

525
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:46,830
Shi,

526
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,540
you confronted Liu

527
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,120
because he was eyeing Lanshan, right?

528
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:51,410
Eyeing?

529
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,000
He's not even worth it.

530
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,120
You're really a protective husband.

531
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,160
Crazy.

532
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,100
[Chu: Sheng Shi, if you don't come,
I'll head home myself.]

533
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,500
Stop the car!

534
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,120
What now?

535
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,870
Fan Hua, we are

536
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,200
such close friends,

537
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:20,120
and he leaves us

538
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,200
in the cold like this?

539
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,200
As far as I know,

540
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,370
pants only have two legs.

541
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,290
You are

542
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,790
the extra one.

543
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,580
How are we getting back?

544
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,750
Isn't this Mrs. Sheng?

545
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:54,830
What a coincidence.

546
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,080
You're back too.

547
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,580
Why didn't Shi come with you?

548
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,750
Looks like you're not that important.

549
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,870
Enough.

550
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,120
Lanshan is sad enough.

551
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,620
Let's not show off in front of her.

552
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,330
Worry about yourself.

553
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,040
Our relationship
is none of your concern.

554
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:17,160
I don't need to explain
to irrelevant people.

555
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,120
Shi.

556
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:30,080
Chu.

557
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,370
Didn't I tell you to wait for me?

558
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,660
Why didn't you

559
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,080
listen to me?

560
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,700
I thought you were busy,

561
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,870
so I came first.

562
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,160
Let's go.

563
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,790
Why does this car look like mine?

564
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,120
Mr. Qian.

565
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:00,750
Mr. Sheng.

566
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,120
What a coincidence.

567
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:03,580
It's been a while.

568
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:04,830
What do you mean?

569
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,370
We just saw each other.

570
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,830
Why are you here?

571
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,580
Oh, I...

572
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,040
No need to explain.

573
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,870
I get it.

574
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,950
But listen,

575
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,660
take good care of my car.

576
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,660
Don't scratch it.

577
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,910
And fill it up with gas
when you return it.

578
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,500
What's going on?

579
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:32,910
What does he mean?

580
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,330
Just borrowed a car.

581
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:35,410
Nothing happened.

582
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,200
Isn't that normal?

583
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:39,370
You borrowed a car to impress me?

584
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,580
Are you stupid?

585
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:43,120
I'm short on cash,

586
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,160
so I sold my car.

587
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:45,540
Just borrowing one to use for now.

588
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:47,620
You think I'm stupid?

589
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,120
Why not get a mirror?

590
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:51,700
You look like a mess

591
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,450
and think you're a stud?

592
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,620
If you don't have money,

593
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,120
say you don't have money!

594
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:57,870
Why do you make it such a big deal?

595
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,910
Of course, it's a big deal.

596
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,040
You're so broke

597
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,120
you can't even buy a car.

598
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,790
I'd love to interview you.

599
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,580
Did I do something

600
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,080
to make you think I'm interested in you?

601
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,200
Seriously, lady.

602
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:09,000
Come on,

603
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,500
you were the one pursuing me.

604
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,000
Delete me

605
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,000
and all our photos.

606
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,500
Shan.

607
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:25,660
Shi.

608
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:27,500
What took you so long?

609
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,000
I've been waiting forever.

610
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,000
En, you've been gone so long,

611
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,370
I thought you forgot about me.

612
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,950
Never!

613
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,040
You're my little sister.

614
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,040
You're so skinny.

615
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,750
Is Shi giving you a hard time?

616
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,540
Shi, are you?

617
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,120
No way, I wouldn't dare.

618
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,540
Give me a break, will you?

619
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,910
You better not,

620
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,830
or you'll answer to me.

621
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:51,660
En.

622
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:53,700
Chengchi.

623
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:55,330
Chengchi.
