00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,700
be able to afford a few thousand.

192
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,830
I heard Mr. Han has been
looking for investors.

193
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,290
Honestly, don't bother.

194
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,500
I've already told every serious investor

195
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,500
to steer clear of you.

196
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:35,790
Mr. Lu,

197
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,790
sorry to disappoint you,

198
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,500
but I've already found an investor.

199
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,370
Is that so?

200
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,200
Chengchi.

201
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,950
No wonder

202
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,200
we couldn't get investors.

203
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,620
Lu Yifan was sabotaging us.

204
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,240
We've got to get stronger

205
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,580
and show those who look down on us

206
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,660
what we're made of.

207
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:26,700
Exactly.

208
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:36,210
Hello.

209
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,540
Shwenny.

210
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,580
I got the money.

211
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,140
Hmm.

212
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,200
Thank you.

213
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,540
I won't let you down.

214
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,160
Do you think

215
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,410
we did the right thing
to help Shwenny out?

216
00:11:58,910 --> 00:11:59,950
The company's in a rough spot,

217
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,120
and he still insisted on
investing in Chengchi.

218
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:03,200
If this goes south,

219
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:03,870
he might actually

220
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,120
have to step down as CEO.

221
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,910
I'm not saying he shouldn't help him.

222
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,240
Chengchi is our friend,

223
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,080
and I want him to succeed too.

224
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:10,990
But

225
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,490
if it fails,

226
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,330
it'll take Shwenny down with it.

227
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,490
There aren't

228
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,660
many things in life

229
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,830
worth risking everything for.

230
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,410
But Shwenny's got the guts to do it,

231
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,910
and that's something

232
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,700
most of us don't have.

233
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,330
Fanhua, if I...

234
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,620
I mean, if I

235
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,790
ever end up in a crisis,

236
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,580
would you help me out like that?

237
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,370
Of course.

238
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,660
I would.

239
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,240
Chengchi, congrats
on securing that investment.

240
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,330
Your mom's going to be thrilled.

241
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,740
Thanks, Shan.

242
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,240
Shan,

243
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,830
you seem a bit off.

244
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,950
What's going on?

245
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,620
I heard Sheng Shi's company
is in trouble.

246
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,330
I'm worried about him.

247
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,290
Chengchi,

248
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,950
do you know what's happening?

249
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,120
I'm not sure.

250
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,330
Shwenny,

251
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,990
here's the report and the list

252
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,830
of former employees.

253
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,040
I looked into it,

254
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,200
and these three

255
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:32,080
had the most access to the company seal.

256
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,330
Two are still in the country,

257
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,830
but one left for abroad a week ago.

258
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:38,870
He's our prime suspect.

259
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,240
Sounds like it's him.

260
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:42,660
He did this.

261
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:43,870
Colluding with someone

262
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,080
to pull off that loan.

263
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,870
We'll track him down,
even if he's on Mars.

264
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,040
I doubt

265
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:55,410
he could accomplish this

266
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,080
all by himself.

267
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,990
Someone else is behind it.

268
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:01,910
Who could it be?

269
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,870
Lu Yifan?

270
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,040
He's been trying to take down us.

271
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:08,660
Also,

272
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,330
the biggest competitor
for these two properties

273
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,700
is Lu Tian Group.

274
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:13,870
If we

275
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,790
don't pay the deposit in time,

276
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:17,580
those two properties

277
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,540
will end up

278
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,120
with Lu Tian Group.

279
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,330
That would

280
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,040
put them ahead

281
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,700
in the Guangdong market,

282
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,040
tank our stock,

283
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,540
and boost Lu Tian's value

284
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,290
way beyond ours.

285
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:33,990
Shwenny,

286
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,700
didn't you say

287
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,620
you were buying up Lu Tian's shares?

288
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,910
Could we use that to our advantage?

289
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,580
I was planning to

290
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,120
buy up their shares

291
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,830
and take him down.

292
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:47,950
But

293
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,910
I only managed to get 15%.

294
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,240
Lu Yifan still holds 30%,

295
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,160
so it's not enough.

296
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:04,580
Hello,

297
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,580
Mr. Xu.

298
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:08,040
Lanshan, I did some digging.

299
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,330
Sheng Group's accounts

300
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:12,410
are frozen, all of them.

301
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,370
And they're

302
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,410
out of cash.

303
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,790
The problem is

304
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,490
they're trying to bid

305
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,200
on two properties

306
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,200
that are crucial for them.

307
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,620
That serious?

308
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,830
Yep,

309
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,290
and I heard

310
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,080
Sheng Shi

311
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,120
told his shareholders

312
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,660
he'd fix this.

313
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,700
If he doesn't

314
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,240
he'll step down

315
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,580
as CEO.

316
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,540
Is there any way to help him?

317
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,370
In situations like this?

318
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,490
Not really.

319
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,240
Unless

320
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:49,330
some close friends lend him billions,

321
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,200
there's not much anyone can do.

322
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,290
But don't worry too much.

323
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,700
If they end up

324
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,740
losing the properties,

325
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:58,660
it will

326
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,660
slow them down,

327
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,160
but they won't go bankrupt.

328
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:03,790
And even if

329
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,330
Sheng Shi steps down,

330
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,040
he'll still be a major shareholder.

331
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,540
Come in.

332
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,790
Lanshan, Mr. Chu is here.

333
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,700
Lanshan.

334
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,200
Editor Gu.

335
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,200
Mr. Chu, you're here.

336
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,240
What's going on?

337
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,200
You look exhausted.

338
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,540
I'm fine, Mr. Chu.

339
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,870
Should we start with hair and makeup?

340
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,080
Alright.

341
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,990
The makeup artist will
do a quick touch-up.

342
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:52,830
Ye Si,

343
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,080
bring Mr. Chu's clothes over

344
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
for him to choose from.

345
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,540
Got it, Lanshan.

346
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,370
- See you in a bit, Mr. Chu.
- Alright.

347
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,160
Everyone, let's get ready.

348
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,620
We'll start the livestream
in 30 minutes.

349
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,870
- Okay.
- Got it.

350
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,490
Mr. Sheng,

351
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,990
Mr. Lu is waiting for you
in the conference room.

352
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,200
Okay.

353
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:37,200
Alright.

354
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,290
Mr. Sheng finally arrives.

355
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,240
You look worn out.

356
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,660
What brings you here today, Mr. Lu?

357
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,540
Nothing much.

358
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,620
I heard your company

359
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,830
is in trouble,

360
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,040
so I thought I'd drop by.

361
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,910
Here to rub it in?

362
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,740
Of course not.

363
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,120
I would never.

364
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,240
After I heard what happened,

365
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,370
I've been so worried about you,

366
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,790
so I rushed over

367
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,870
to see if you needed help.

368
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,120
Mr. Lu doesn't do anything
without a profit in sight.

369
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,740
Found a business opportunity here,
did you?

370
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,370
Not at all.

371
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,580
Let's get to the point.

372
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,660
I'm guessing

373
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:49,540
your company's out of cash,

374
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,240
and a lot of projects are stalled.

375
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,540
How about...

376
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:54,330
I give you 1.5 billion?

377
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,580
Conditions?

378
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,990
Twenty-five percent equity.

379
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,290
It's a fair deal, 1.5 billion for 25%.

380
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:08,370
With a little more,

381
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,620
you could at least
pay one of the deposits.

382
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,330
Mr. Sheng, I'll spare you the speech.

383
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:16,540
1.5 billion.

384
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,830
Think about it.

385
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,910
What advice do you have for me, Chu?

386
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:39,580
It's not really advice,

387
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,080
more of a chat.

388
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,330
I used to work with your father
when we started out,

389
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,740
but then he moved into real estate,

390
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,370
and I went into cultural media.

391
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,950
So,

392
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,950
you have a history with my father.

393
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,790
Yes, I watched him

394
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,790
grow Sheng Group into a giant

395
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,410
while I pursued my passion

396
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,830
for the arts,

397
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,410
traveling around.

398
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,660
Eventually, we lost touch.

399
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,080
Mr. Chu,

400
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,370
I really admire how you've

401
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,330
pursued your own life.

402
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,370
All those years of traveling

403
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,240
have been quite the experience.

404
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,740
Just last month,

405
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,870
I ran into a young man

406
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,790
from the Lu Tian Group.

407
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,660
Lu Tian Group?

408
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,870
You mean Lu Yifan?

409
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,080
No, his half-brother,

410
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,290
Lu Tianming.

411
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,990
He owns about 16%

412
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,660
of Lu Tian Group.

413
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:36,740
But

414
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,240
with Lu Yifan in charge,

415
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,950
Lu Tianming mostly stays abroad,

416
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,200
out of the spotlight.

417
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,160
Not many people know of him.

418
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:48,490
Mr. Chu,

419
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,790
do you have a way to reach Lu Tianming?

420
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,620
I've got his email.

421
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,540
Let me find it for you.

422
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,370
Please send it over.

423
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,870
Just did.

424
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,580
I got it.

425
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,410
Thank you, Mr. Chu.

426
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:13,660
Mr. Lu,

427
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,870
the deposits for both properties

428
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,410
have been paid.

429
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:19,120
I'm determined to get them.

430
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,990
Who let you in?

431
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,870
Looks like Mr. Sheng

432
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,450
agreed to my offer from yesterday.

433
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:33,700
Mr. Lu,

434
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,540
I'm here

435
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,950
to talk business.

436
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,660
Ready to sell me those shares?

437
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,290
I'll sweeten the deal

438
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,660
with an extra 10 million.

439
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,620
I've got something else in mind.

440
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,790
I've got 15%

441
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:54,620
of Lu Tian Group's shares.

442
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,080
You don't seriously

443
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,410
think 15% is enough

444
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,950
to threaten me, do you?

445
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:02,200
I hold 30%.

446
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,700
I'm not here to threaten you, Mr. Lu.

447
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,200
Just wanted to let you know

448
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,290
that your brother, Lu Tianming,

449
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,950
is interested in my shares.

450
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,660
He's got 16%,

451
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,160
so together,

452
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,620
we'd have 31%,

453
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,950
enough to outvote you.

454
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,490
Sorry about that.

455
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,200
I think Lu Tian Group

456
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:29,290
might be getting a new boss soon.

457
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:37,990
Sell them to me.

458
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,160
Oh, you really want them?

459
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:45,790
They won't come cheap.

460
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,240
Name your price.

461
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,660
Well,

462
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,410
since you're so eager,

463
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,490
I'll give you a deal,

464
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:03,620
forty

465
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,330
billion.

466
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,330
Mr. Sheng,

467
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:22,290
that's daylight robbery.

468
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,870
Yep, and I'm not ashamed of it.

469
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,540
Don't make this tougher
on yourself, Mr. Lu.

470
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,410
But if you're not interested,

471
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,410
I'll just sell them to your brother.

472
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:35,990
Fine.

473
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,410
You've got 30 minutes to decide.

474
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,290
The clock's ticking.

475
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:50,240
Twenty-nine minutes left.

476
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,540
Mr. Lu, make your decision.

477
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,080
Looks like Lu Yifan finally lost.

478
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,700
What's the next move?

479
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,740
Shwenny,

480
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,540
that was incredible!

481
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,620
Did you see Lu Yifan's face? Priceless.

482
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,870
We got him.

483
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,830
We really should thank Mr. Chu for this.

484
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,370
He played a huge part.

485
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,950
Shwenny,

486
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,160
have you known Mr. Chu for a while?

487
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,290
No, never met him before.

488
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,870
I'm not sure why
he suddenly reached out.

489
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,700
Don't you think the whole thing

490
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,240
is a bit fishy?

491
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,120
Yeah, it's odd.

492
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,910
I couldn't figure out

493
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:52,830
why he approached me

494
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:55,200
or why he helped

495
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,290
solve our problem.

496
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,200
Hey, don't stress.

497
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:01,740
The crisis is over,

498
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,620
so let's celebrate.

499
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:06,660
Alright.

500
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,580
My treat. Let's go.

501
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,490
Too bad I couldn't

502
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,830
sell this bracelet to Lu Yifan.

503
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,080
I would've

504
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:18,120
treated you all.

505
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,580
You need to work on

506
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,910
your sales pitch.

507
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,910
Start by selling it to me.

508
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,640
[Mr. Chu]

509
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:30,990
Hello,

510
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:31,600
Mr. Chu.

511
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,390
Hello,

512
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:33,330
Editor Gu.

513
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,580
Sheng Group is out of the woods.

514
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:37,200
I noticed you were worried yesterday,

515
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:38,830
so I wanted to let you know.

516
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:41,220
Really? Everything's okay now?

517
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,270
Yes,

518
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,450
it's all good.

519
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,330
Mr. Chu.

520
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,580
Did you have something to do with this?

521
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,080
I helped a little, nothing major.

522
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,080
By the way, if you want to thank me,

523
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,200
how about dinner?

524
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:54,700
No problem.

525
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,830
Shwenny?

526
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:29,040
Ye Si.

527
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,160
Lanshan.

528
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:31,540
Tell me the truth.

529
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,660
Where did you find this apartment?

530
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:35,490
I told you,

531
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,410
I found it through a friend's post.

532
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,910
Was it Sheng Shi's post?

533
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:42,700
So, you figured it out.

534
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:43,910
Tell me

535
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,330
what's really going on.

536
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,240
Mr. Sheng found out you needed a place,

537
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,040
so he bought the apartment,

538
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:52,580
fixed it up just the way you like,

539
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,660
and rented it to you for cheap

540
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,490
because he was worried

541
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,990
about your safety.

542
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:00,660
He bought the apartment?

543
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,740
Yeah,

544
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:03,290
and he even

545
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,080
personally picked out

546
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,740
all the furniture and decor.

547
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:09,910
Lanshan,
