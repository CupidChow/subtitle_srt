En.

00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,450
Is that you, En?

En.

00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,950
Chengchi,

24
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,160
I've missed you so much.

25
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,750
Chengchi,

26
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,120
are you okay?

27
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,500
Where's Mom?

28
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,370
Oh, Shan.

Hello,

44
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,910
Mom.

45
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Shwenny,

46
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,040
get over to the Gu's house right now.

47
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,290

00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,700
What happened?

00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,750
You'll find out

50
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,250
when you get here.

51
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,200
Ask your precious wife

52
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,370
what she's been up to!

53
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,330
I thought only cats sneaked around,

54
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,040
but I guess people do too.

55
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,790
Guess life's too easy,

56
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,830
so you're looking for thrills, huh?

57
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,040
Jiayi,

58
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,410
stop it.

59
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,620
Don't take it to heart.

60
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,370
Jiayi just says

61
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,080
whatever comes to mind.

62
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,540
Auntie, you're too soft on her.

63
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,790
She's not even your daughter,

64
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,250
but you still defend her.

65
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,330
And now look,

66
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,620
you thought Lanshan was just

67
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,330
fond of her brother-in-law.

68
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,950
But it turns out it's more than that.

69
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,450
What are you saying?

70
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,870
Is that true?

71
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,330
She...

72
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,040
she's always had a thing for Chengchi?

73
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,080
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,830
I thought once she married Shwenny,

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,160
she'd settle down.

76
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,750
Besides,

77
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,000
I raised her as my own daughter.

78
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,200
But clearly,

79
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,370
I failed her.

80
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,830
Gu Lanshan, if you're going to cheat,

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
couldn't you at least
pick someone outside the family?

82
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,200
But no,

83
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,500
you go and kiss your brother-in-law.

84
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,160
If I were you,

85
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,750
I'd be too embarrassed to show my face.

86
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,450
If this gets out,

87
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,080
people are going to laugh at you.

88
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,500
Shi.

89
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,450
Shwenny, come back!

90
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,200
Your dad just got back,

91
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,700
and if he finds out about this...

92
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,660
Mom,

93
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,250
let's talk back at the house.

94
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,950
Too many people here,

95
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,620
it's not the right place.

96
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,830
Chu's my wife,

97
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,450
and I won't

98
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,000
let her be humiliated.

99
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,580
And you,

100
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,790
I'm not having this conversation
with you.

101
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,580
Whatever mistakes my wife made,

102
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,250
it's our family's business,

103
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,450
not yours.

104
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,330
En!

105
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:27,870
En!

106
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,160
En.

107
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,290
Let go!

108
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,290
En, let me explain.

109
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,750
It's not what it looked like.

110
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,580
Nothing's going on between me and Shan,

111
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,910
I swear.

112
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,450
Nothing? You were kissing.

113
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,500
What's next?

114
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,790
In bed together?

115
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,870
En, listen to me.

116
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,250
You're the only one in my heart,

117
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,370
no one else.

118
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,410
Let go!

119
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,120
Han Chengchi,

120
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,330
whether it's emotional

121
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:59,370
or physical cheating,

122
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,750
I can't accept it!

123
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,000
We're done!

124
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,120
Chengchi!

125
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,250
Chengchi.

126
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,080
You don't have anything to say to me?

127
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,500
Shwenny,

128
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,080
bring Shan to the family house now.

129
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,660
I expect

130
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,620
an explanation when I get back.

131
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,790
Give me your phone.

132
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,500
You don't need it right now.

133
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:26,910
Huan.

134
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:28,830
Huan!

135
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:29,750
Yes, sir?

136
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,040
Keep an eye on her.

137
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,330
Lock the door,

138
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,700
don't let her out.

139
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,290
Call me if anything happens.

140
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,250
Understood.

141
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,910
How did it come to this?

142
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,700
How do I explain this?

143
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,160
Shi will never believe me

144
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,910
if I say Chengchi forced the kiss.

145
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,620
I'm sorry, Shi.

146
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,750
I owe Chengchi my life,

147
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,000
I can't hurt him.

148
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,160
Dad,

149
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,080
what's with this gathering?

150
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,540
Is this some surprise wedding banquet?

151
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,330
You should've told me.

152
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,500
I'd have brought a gift.

153
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:33,910
Where's Shan?

154
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,700
Chu?

155
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,790
She couldn't make it.

156
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,250
If you've got something to say,

157
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,450
say it to me. I'll pass it along.

158
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,910
You'll pass it along?

159
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,500
She's disgraced our family,

160
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,000
and you think

161
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,700
you can explain it away?

162
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,500
Chu is my wife.

163
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,040
If she did something wrong,
I'll deal with it.

164
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,870
But there's no need

165
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,450
to drag the whole family into this.

166
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,250
If I had brought her here,

167
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,620
and you made a scene,

168
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,080
how could she continue staying with me?

169
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:04,910
You...

170
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,750
After what she did,

171
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,750
she can't stay!

172
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,160
Shwenny,

173
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,830
after everything,

174
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,080
you still want to keep her around?

175
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:17,040
Wake up.

176
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,080
Do you know how humiliated

177
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,750
I was today?

178
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,450
We overlooked her background

179
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,200
because you loved her,

180
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,790
and we took her in

181
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,700
and treated her like family.

182
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:29,870
But now

183
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,750
look at

184
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,580
what she's done!

185
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,370
Mom...

186
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,620
Alright, alright.

187
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,080
Look at how upset your mom is.

188
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,120
Dad, Mom,

189
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,290
is there some misunderstanding?

190
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,580
Shan seems like a good girl.

191
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,700
I don't think
she'd do anything like that.

192
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,450
I saw it with my own eyes.

193
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,000
What's there to misunderstand?

194
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,370
And besides, Jiayi said

195
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,790
Lanshan had liked Chengchi

196
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,910
for years.

197
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:56,540
Shwenny,

198
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,540
our family

199
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,950
has never faced

200
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,160
such a disgraceful situation!

201
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,330
Shwenny,

202
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm giving you a week

203
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,910
to end this marriage!

204
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,540
Dad,

205
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,620
I chose Chu as my wife.

206
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,660
If she messed up,

207
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,200
I'll take the heat,

208
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,620
but I'm not

209
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,290
divorcing her.

210
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,000
Besides,

211
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,700
if word gets out,
I'm the one who looks bad.

212
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,000
I don't care.

213
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,160
Why should I be worried?

214
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,160
You!

215
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,580
You brat!

216
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,040
Dad.

217
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,830
It's not just your reputation,

218
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,540
it's the whole family's!

219
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,580
Can you think about

220
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,040
the Sheng family for once?

221
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,830
It's Lanshan's fault,

222
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,790
not my son's.

223
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,500
He's already hurt. Leave him alone!

224
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,370
Shwenny,

225
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,950
I'll ask you one last time.

226
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,080
Are you divorcing Lanshan or not?

227
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,200
No, I'm not.

228
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,290
I knew she liked Chengchi

229
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,080
before we got married.

230
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,950
You fool!

231
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,790
You...

232
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,370
you knew

233
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,000
and still married her?

234
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,330
Because I love her!

235
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,790
I insisted on marrying her.

236
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,500
I pressured her with money.

237
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,390
She never loved me,

238
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,560
not even once.

239
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,600
- You're unbelievable!
- Dad.

240
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:30,470
- Dad!
- Please, calm down!

241
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,470
I'm going to kill him!

242
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,680
Fine, I'll come clean.

243
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:33,470
Shwenny, stop talking.

244
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,560
I was going to confess my feelings.

245
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,430
He's our son.

246
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,020
That day, I went to her room

247
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,060
and found her diary.

248
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,310
That's when I learned
she liked Chengchi.

249
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,890
I was scared of losing her,

250
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,560
so I set things up that night

251
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,520
to make her mine.

252
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,560
But you said

253
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,350
you were drunk!

254
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,810
And you believed that, Mom?

255
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:57,640
Anyway,

256
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,020
I'm responsible for her.

257
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,220
And like I said,

258
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,140
I won't divorce her.

259
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,270
Fine.

260
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:05,930
Fine!

261
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,060
If you want to be responsible,

262
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,060
can you take responsibility

263
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,020
for our grandchild's life?

264
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,060
You had a child?

265
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,640
[Consent Form for Abortion
Name: Gu Lanshan]

266
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:29,470
I always thought it was a health issue.

267
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,100
I tried to help her get better,

268
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,060
but instead

269
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,930
she...

270
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,310
she took it out

271
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,810
on my innocent grandchild!

272
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,180
I'll say it again,

273
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,720
no matter what Chu did,

274
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,970
I'm not divorcing her.

275
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,970
As for the child,

276
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,680
go ahead and make another one
if you want.

277
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,310
You can even have two. Fine by me.

278
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,810
You're not my son!

279
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,770
Dad.

280
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:04,520
Dad.

281
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,020
He's our Shwenny.

282
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:10,180
If you want to hit me, go ahead.

283
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,020
But after that,

284
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,470
don't force me to divorce her.

285
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,390
Go.

286
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,680
Kneel.

287
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,020
Get on your knees!

288
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,100
Fine.

289
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:24,850
I'll do it.

290
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,390
There was a traffic accident

291
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,060
on Dongcheng Road tonight.

292
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,310
A young man died on the spot,

293
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,640
- and the driver fled.
- No.

294
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,810
- The police are investigating.
- No.

295
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,310
It can't be Chengchi.

296
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,970
Oh my God.

297
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,640
Sixty-six missed calls.

298
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,930
Good thing I was prepared.

299
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,930
Otherwise, as soon as I took the hit,

300
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,600
they'd be all over Chu

301
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,100
for payback.

302
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:40,890
Hello?

303
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,520
What's the situation?

304
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,350
Mr. Sheng, the surgery just finished.

305
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,220
The doctor says he's out of danger

306
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,890
but needs close monitoring.

307
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,350
Good.

308
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:50,470
Keep me posted.

309
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,850
Mr. Sheng, don't worry.

310
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,100
I'll keep you

311
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,600
updated.

312
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,220
Sheng Shi!

313
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,770
Is Chengchi...?

314
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,060
Still up?

315
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,100
Ready to give me an explanation?

316
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,180
Alright.

317
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,560
Let's hear it.

318
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,930
Take your time.

319
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,350
I've got all night.

320
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,850
But I'll warn you,

321
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,220
if I don't like what I hear,

322
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,930
it's better you don't say anything.

323
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,470
So, how did you two end up kissing?

324
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,470
Go on, explain.

325
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,180
Chu,

326
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:03,850
I just need

327
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:05,180
a reasonable explanation.

328
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,140
Even if it means going against everyone,

329
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,100
I'll believe you

330
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,600
and stand by you.

331
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,810
I'm sorry.

332
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,100
And?

333
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,640
I'm really sorry.

334
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,930
That's all I can say.

335
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,350
You're sorry...

336
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,890
That's it? Just "sorry"?

337
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,180
Is that all you've got?

338
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,470
I need an explanation!

339
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:35,810
Do you understand?

340
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,470
Just tell me

341
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,810
there's nothing going on.

342
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,270
Tell me

343
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,470
Han Chengchi didn't kiss you,

344
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,430
that everyone was lying.

345
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,020
Look me in the eye and say,

346
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,100
"Sheng Shi,

347
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,520
I didn't kiss him!

348
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:50,970
They're all making it up!"

349
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,020
Got it?

350
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,390
Now, say it.

351
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,430
Talk to me!

352
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,640
Shi,

353
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,930
please don't do this.

354
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,470
Don't do this?

355
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,180
You made me

356
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,020
look like a fool

357
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,220
and you're telling me to stop?

358
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,140
Fine, Gu Lanshan.

359
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,220
You're ruthless.

360
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,600
How could you be so heartless?

361
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,770
Why are you doing this to me?

362
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:18,890
You asked

363
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,350
about Han Chengchi.

364
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,520
Well,

365
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,600
he was hit by a car.

366
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,810
Your sister's passed out from crying.

367
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,350
She said if he dies, she'll end it, too.

368
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:30,850
Happy now?

369
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,310
Satisfied?

370
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,470
And you.

371
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,180
"I'm sorry"?

372
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,560
That's it?

373
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:38,640
Sheng Shi,

374
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,020
you're lying, right?

375
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,100
It's all my fault.

376
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,810
Please tell me Chengchi...

377
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,560
Even now,

378
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,640
you're still thinking about him.

379
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,470
Huan.

380
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,390
Mr. Sheng,

381
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,390
you spent the night in the study again.

382
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,310
What's going on?

383
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,600
