be your brother-in-law.

38
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,410
You should congratulate him.

00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,330

Mrs. Gu, you've really planned this out.

64

The Liu family is doing well these days,

65
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,250
which strengthens
the Gu family's position.

66
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,750

Discuss?

71
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,750
I'm mainly here

Still the same as ever.

79
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,250
Yeah.

Try it.

84
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,160
Chengchi can't eat crab.

85
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,620
He's allergic to seafood.

86
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,250
That's right.

00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,160

onions and garlic.

91

how the wedding preparation is going.

Great. I was going to ask you anyway.

95

This crab struggled

96
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,000
when we bought it,

97
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,250
refusing to let go.

98
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,540
See now?

99
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,790
What's the point of struggling?

100
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,250
Some things are just meant to be.

106

I hadn't heard that.

120
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,000
It must be a rumor.

121
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,660
Could be.

122
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,040
Mrs. Gu, you're too smart

123

Huan made a lot of food.

193
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,620
You have to eat all this.

194
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,950
I don't want to waste it.

195
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,160
What's wrong?

196
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,660
You've made enough
for your brother's medical expenses?

197
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,580
No more money problems?

198
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,330
When I brought you back,

199
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,620
I planned for you
to marry into the Xia family.

200
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,000
But they declined so quickly.

201
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,120
I thought raising you was a waste,

202
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,870
but it turns out

203
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,370
Sheng Shi is serious about you.

204
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,620
He's willing to

205
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,500
do so much for you.

206
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,200
You're lucky.

207
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,790
What am I to you?

208
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,410
A commodity?

209
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,250
You took me in

210
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,120
and now you're marrying me
off to Shwenny.

211
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,620
Do you care what I want?

212
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,450
What's wrong with being a commodity?

213
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,290
At least it has value.

214
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,910
I get money,

215
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,700
and you get to be Mrs. Sheng.

216
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,870
That's a big reward

217
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,410
from Shwenny.

218
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,620
Don't look at me like that.

219
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,450
Just be ready

220
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,370
to marry Shwenny.

221
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,240
Hello?

222
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,500
Ms. Gu, Hello.

223
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,750
Just a reminder,

224
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,290
today's the deadline
to pay Mr. Ye Mo's fees.

225
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,500
Is it the 30th already?

226
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:13,580
Yes.

227
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:14,750
Alright.

228
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:15,950
I'll take care of it right away.

231
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,370
Make me a coffee.

232
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,580
Aili,

233
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,750
I have something to do tomorrow.

234
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:34,830
I won't go to your shop.

235
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,160
I'll send Ye Si to pick it up.

236
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:56,960
Hello?

237
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,620
Chengchi.

Shan.

239
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,580
I'm going shopping

240
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,120
in the next town with En this afternoon.

241
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,330
Can you pick up some clothes

242
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,330
from Aili's shop tomorrow?

243
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,700
Aili's shop?

244
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,790
Sure, I'll get them for you.

245
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:08,660
Thanks.

246
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,350
[Sheng Shi deposits 5,000
into your card]

247
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,290
If we finalize the plan

248
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,700
and sell pre-construction units,

249
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,370
we expect completion
in Q3 of the year after next.

250
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:36,910

252
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:38,500
What about the backup plan?

253
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,290
Mr. Sheng,

254
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,160
this is already the third draft.

255
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,580
- We have prepared...
- Mr...

256
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,950
Mr. Sheng.

257
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,500
No matter how many drafts you have,

258
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,790
I want to see

259
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,450
the perfect one,

260
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,250
not some patchwork.

261
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,370
If anyone can't do it,

262
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,120
they can report to HR.

263
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:18,950
- Li.
- Shan.

264
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,250
Let me handle this.

265
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:20,910
Okay.

266
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,580
Mo!

267
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,330
Mo.

268
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,450
Mo.

269
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,410
Mo.

270
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,450
Mo, don't scare me like this.

271
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,330
It's all my fault.

272
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,660
I shouldn't have written all that

273
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,450
in the letter.

274
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,160
If I hadn't,

275
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,540
you wouldn't be lying here.

276
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,500
Mo.

277
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,290
Please wake up.

278
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,120
Shwenny,

279
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,200
the contract looks fine.

280
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,660
Please confirm it.

281
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,910
You scared me, Shwenny.

282
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,370
Who made you this angry?

283
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,200
Why are you like this?

284
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,290
Shut up.

285
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,290
If you're pursuing a girl,

286
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,830
you need to drop the pride.

287
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:51,410
Nowadays,

288

girls love my type.

289
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,790
What are you talking about?

290
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,660
I'm talking about novels.

291
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:59,950
Shi.

292
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,290
Can you come with me

293
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,660
to the launch event
for "Dreams Take Flight" tomorrow?

294
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,700
You're working on a project with them,
right?

295
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,370
You can chat with Mr. Yu
while you're there.

296
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,870
I don't have time.

297
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,450
By the way,

298
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,540
even though
you're the company spokesperson,

299
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,870
you can't just barge into my office.

300
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,000
Got it.

301
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,200
I'll go by myself then.

302
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,080
Wait.

303
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,700
What time is the event tomorrow?

304
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,410
Five in the afternoon.

305
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,370
Do you have something to wear?

306
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,910
Of course.

307
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,830
I have plenty of nice clothes.

308
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,200
I'll buy you something new.

309
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,750
Great, Shi.

310
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,160
You're so sweet.

311
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,700
Shan,

312
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,040
this is yours,

313
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:58,660
and this is your sister's.

314
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,750
Thank you.

315
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,290
You're such a sister's girl.

316
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,910
When I asked you this morning,
you said you were busy.

317
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,040
But when your sister asks,
you're suddenly free.

318
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,790
You put her before your friends.

319
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,950
She's my sister, after all.

320
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,450
Besides, she's getting married soon.

321
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,040
I should help her.

322
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,290
Yeah, yeah.

323
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,700
You weren't this eager

324
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,080
when you were getting married.

326
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,500
Pick whatever you like.

327

I'll buy it for you.

328
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,370
Thank you, Shi. You're so good to me.

329
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,540
Editor Gu, what a coincidence.

330
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,450
Shi brought me here to pick out a dress.

331
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,290
Are you shopping too?

332

333
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,830
Editor Gu is still mad at me

334
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,250
and won't talk.

335
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,450
Ms. Su,

336
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,950
you're here for a dress, right?

337
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,620
Come with me.

338
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,750
The designer sent over

339
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,040
some sketches

340
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,830
for En and Chengchi's wedding.

341
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,120
Help me pick one.

342

Chengchi specifically asked

343
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:53,290
for a piano area

344
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,080
at the wedding,

345
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,830
just for En.

346

00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,200
You're here to pick a dress.

349
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,120
Do you need my help?

350
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,870
Yes, I'm here to pick a dress.

351
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,330
Let me try these two.

352
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,450

They're reserved.

355
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:24,990
What about this one?

356
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,120
Also not available.

357
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,540
Why is nothing available?

358
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:28,540
Sorry.

359
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,290

362
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,540
She's being mean.

363
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,830
Everything I ask for,

364
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,080
she says it's out of stock.

365
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,870
Never mind.

will you still

368
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,240
take me to the event?

369
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,370
Sure.

370
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,040
Let's eat first.

371
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,240
Then I'll drop you off.

372
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,200
Okay.

373
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,120
Let's go.

374
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:12,330
Let's go.

[Wyndham Garden Hotel]

376
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:32,910
Get out.

377
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,910
What's wrong, Shi?

378
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:37,080
I thought we were going to eat

379
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,410
and then you'd drop me off at the event.

380
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,580
I have something to do.

381
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,330
You go on your own.

382
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,990
But you just...

383
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,580
Got it.

384
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,080
What's so great
about that stone-cold woman?

385
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,160
Looks like I'll need to use some tactics

386
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,620
to become Mrs. Sheng.

387
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,660
Shan,

388
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,700
I can handle the tabloid rumors,

389
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,740
but Sheng Shi bringing her here today,

390
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,450
and you have no reaction?

391
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,040
What should I do?

392
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,700
Go down there and make a scene?

393
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,450
Why not?

394
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,700
Sheng Shi still cares about you.

395
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,410
Sometimes, you need
to be a bit vulnerable,

396
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,080
throw a fit,

397
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,700
or even punch him.

398
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,830
That's how you keep the spark alive.

399
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,490
The worst thing for a marriage
is indifference.

400
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,740
What's so bad about indifference?

401
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:33,240
It won't hurt anyone

402
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,910
or make things awkward.

403
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,990
Sometimes, I feel bad for Sheng Shi.

404
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:41,200
His own wife ignores him.

405
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,450
He brings another woman around,

406
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,450
and she doesn't even blink.

407
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,490
Imagine how frustrating

408
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:45,990
that must be for him.

409
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,540
Compared to the hurt he caused me,

410
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,120
his frustration is nothing.

411
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:05,490
You're back

412
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,290
five minutes and twenty seconds earlier
than I expected.

413
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:09,870
So,

414
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,830
Han Chengchi asked her
to pick up clothes,

415
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,410
and she suddenly had time.

416
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:14,910
I brought another woman with me

417
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,370
in front of her,

418
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,950
and she didn't even react.

419
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,620
This woman!

420
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,910
You didn't seriously

421
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,580
bring Su Jiaojiao just to
make Gu Lanshan jealous, did you?

422
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,200
When will

423
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,370
she turn back into

424
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:36,120
the sharp, feisty Ye Chu we knew?

425
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,200
Do you know

426
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,200
when a hedgehog

427
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,450
puts its spikes away?

428
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,870
You've got a client meeting tonight.

429
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,450
Don't wear that grumpy face

430
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,660
and scare them off.

431
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:56,830
I won't.

432
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,580
You underestimate me.

433
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:03,910
You'd better not.

434
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:12,830
Spiky.

435
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,370
Shan.

436
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,910
Look at all this stuff

437
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,580
Chengchi bought me.

438
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,540
So many clothes and cosmetics.

439
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,160
You're really rubbing it in.

440
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,160
Shan,

441
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:24,080
everyone says
this skincare brand is great.

442
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,450
I got you a set too.

443
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,620
I'll bring it over in a few days.

444
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,950
Thanks, En.

445
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,490
It's so late. Where is Shwenny?

446
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,330
He's out with clients.

447
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:35,790
He should be back soon.

448
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:36,700
Shan,

449
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:38,490
if Shwenny keeps coming back this late,

450
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,740
you need to set him straight.

451
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:42,160
You can't let men get away with that.

452
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,120
Alright, Shan.

453
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,740
Get some rest. Talk soon.

454
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:46,660
Okay.

455
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,040
Bye.

456
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,080
To a successful partnership, Mr. Sheng.

457
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,370
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

458
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:01,450
Here's to a successful cooperation.

459
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,870
To a smooth collaboration, Mr. Sheng.

460
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,620
What have you been up to lately?

461
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,080
You sing pretty well.

462
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:10,490
Hello?

463
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,410
Where are you?

464
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:12,120
Honey.

465
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,410
You're married?

466
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:14,790
What's all this noise?

467
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,410
I'm singing with clients.

468
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,120
Look at what time it is.

469
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,080
Wrap up and go home.

470
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,990
- Mr. Sheng.
- Just business friends.

471
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,490
- His wife is checking up on him.
- I promise I'll be home by one.

472
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:23,790
You better be.

473
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:24,790
- Don't mind him.
- If I

474
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,040
- Let's drink.
- don't see you by then,

475
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,330
don't bother coming home.

476
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:28,450
Alright, alright.

477
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,120
Mr. Sheng, I need to take this call.

478
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:32,990
Honey.

479
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:34,540
Do you know how late it is?

480
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:35,620
Don't worry.

481
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,200
I'm on my way.

482
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,660
- Honey.
- Where are you?

483
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,290
I'm out drinking with friends.

484
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:43,240
Drinking?

485
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:44,200
Get home now!

486
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,290
Okay, okay.

487
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,740
Mr. Sheng,

488
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,410
your wife really trusts you,

489
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,330
not calling to nag even this late.

490
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:51,160
Well,

491
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,580
marriage

492
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,080
is built on trust.

493
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:55,370
When I'm out with clients,

494
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:56,700
she never nags.

495
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,330
- Exactly, that's a good wife.
- Your wife is checking up on you.

496
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:00,160
Come on.

497
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,870
To all us guys with wives

498
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,120
- who check up on us.
- Cheers.

499
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,490
Chu.

500
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,450
I'm home.
