00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,450
Yeah.

195
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,790
I brought back some wedding candy.

196
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,580
Look,

197
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,830
it's delicious!

198
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,870
Try it.

199
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:24,950
Mr. Sheng.

200
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,160
The designer called

201
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,870
and said the apartment was all done.

202
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,290
Do you want to go check?

203
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,500
Sure.

204
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,500
Candy!

205
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:44,160
Lanshan.

206
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,580
Didn't you go to see the apartment?

207
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,660
Why are you back?

208
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,910
Yeah, I checked it out. Nothing special.

209
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,870
Find anything you like?

210
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,790
I'm having the agent
look for more options.

211
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:54,700
Bye.

212
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:58,560
Hello.

213
00:10:58,910 --> 00:10:59,700
Auntie.

214
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,870
Hi, is this Lanshan?

215
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:03,950
Yes, who's this?

216
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,200
I'm her neighbor.

217
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,040
She's not doing well.

218
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,370
Can you come over?

219
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,040
I'll be right there.

220
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,500
I told you it's delicious.

221
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,370
Have some for good luck.

222
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,290
Get lost.

223
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,790
Whatever.

224
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,020
[Shengge]

225
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:32,850
Hello.

226
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:34,160
Shengge.

227
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,250
How's uni?

228
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,750
I'm good.

229
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,910
I just sent you some clothes

230
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,700
I designed.

231
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,660
Did you wear the ones I sent earlier?

232
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,500
Clothes? Shengge,

233
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,750
I've never seen him wear them.

234
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:48,660
Wait,

235
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,540
why are you sending him clothes
and not me?

236
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,660
Mr. Ji,

237
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,830
I trust your sense of fashion.

238
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,910
But my brother?

239
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,330
He dresses like an old man,

240
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,750
with no energy at all.

241
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:00,750
You're right.

242
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm definitely better.

243
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,500
Ji, make sure you keep an eye on him.

244
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,750
Don't let him get too boring.

245
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,500
Got it, I'll keep him in check.

246
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,250
Okay.

247
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,540
Who told you to hang up?

248
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,700
Your company is one of the Fortune 500.

249
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:35,830
Bet you're pricey.

250
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,830
That's right.

251
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,250
I hired you,

252
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,660
so I'm not worried about the money.

253
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,370
What color

254
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,000
should we use for the walls?

255
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,040
Gray. It's classy.

256
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,200
Gray's too dull. White.

257
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,160
And the lighting?

258
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,370
Dim,

259
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,580
with candles for a romantic vibe.

260
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,250
Romantic? I want it bright.

261
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,000
Really bright, got it?

262
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,830
And the furniture?

263
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:55,950
Solid wood,

264
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,700
- something sturdy.
- I want something with bounce,

265
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,660
the higher,

266
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,870
the better!

267
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,040
Fine, you're the expensive one,

268
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,040
so I'll let you figure it out.

269
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
Right here,

270
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,580
a big photo of the owner

271
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:07,160
surrounded by flowers

272
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,830
would be perfect.

273
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,770
What's so funny?

274
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:14,680
Sorry, Mr. Sheng,

275
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:17,020
I'm just excited to meet you.

276
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,020
Get out!

277
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,470
Take it easy.

278
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,100
- Thanks, you too.
- It's okay.

279
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,390
Lanshan.

280
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,060
Thank you

281
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,020
for helping.

282
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,220
No problem, Auntie.

283
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,640
Just take care of yourself.

284
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,890
Take care.

285
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:42,680
Shan?

286
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:43,640
Chengchi.

287
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:45,640
Mom.

288
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:46,680
What happened?

289
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,640
Nothing to worry about.

290
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:50,810
Thanks to Lanshan, I'm fine.

291
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,180
She took me to the hospital

292
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,100
got my meds,

293
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:56,020
and brought me home.

294
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,560
Lanshan. Thank you so much.

295
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,100
Thanks, Shan.

296
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,640
No trouble at all.

297
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,640
It's just a stomach bug and a cold.

298
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,310
She'll be fine after taking her meds.

299
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:08,640
This

300
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,520
is the prescribed medication.

301
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,770
Make sure she takes them on time.

302
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,020
Shan.

303
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,100
Thank you, really.

304
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:13,890
Don't mention it.

305
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,310
I'll head out now.

306
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,270
Sure, dear.

307
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,720
Take care.

308
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,270
Chengchi, walk Lanshan out.

309
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,220
No bother.

310
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,270
Take care of Auntie.

311
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,220
See you.

312
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:30,640
See?

313
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,680
Lanshan's such a sweet girl.

314
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,350
Fanhua.

315
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,520
Yeah?

316
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:54,930
Hurry up.

317
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,930
Just leave it there.

318
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:58,850
Okay.

319
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,140
Thank you.

320
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,560
Explain.

321
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,520
I promised Shengge

322
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,770
I'd keep an eye on you,

323
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:16,020
so I thought moving in

324
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,350
would help me do that.

325
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,640
- Spill it.
- So...

326
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,640
My dad's forcing me
to take over the business,

327
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,720
so I need a place to hide.

328
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,220
Stay at a hotel.

329
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,520
I'm broke.

330
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,850
What about your salary?

331
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,350
Spent it.

332
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,270
Mr. Sheng.

333
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,810
Okay, got it.

334
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:51,770
Don't worry.

335
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:54,970
Looks like Mr. Sheng

336
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,390
is still into Lanshan.

337
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,390
Guys like him are rare

338
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,270
these days.

339
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,390
Rare how?

340
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,560
Lanshan!

341
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,600
I mean...

342
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,770
I meant good...

343
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,020
rental properties like this
are hard to find.

344
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,270
Rental properties?

345
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:11,970
Yeah, I...

346
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,060
I just saw one online.

347
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,390
The owner

348
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,600
is in a hurry to move abroad

349
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,390
and wants to rent it out.

350
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:19,520
I checked it.

351
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,310
It's only

352
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,600
a few hundred meters from our office,

353
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,890
fully furnished,

354
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,270
and in a gated community

355
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,470
with great security.

356
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,180
Sounds perfect,

357
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,140
right?

358
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:29,850
Really?

359
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:30,930
Let me see it.

360
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,220
Hello, we're here.

361
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,140
Come on in.

362
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,680
Everything's brand new.

363
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:53,720
Yeah.

364
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,890
I just finished the renovations,

365
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,850
but now I have to move abroad

366
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,680
for a few years.

367
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,600
I wouldn't rent it out otherwise.

368
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,310
So, how much are you asking?

369
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,270
Three thousand.

370
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,560
Three thousand?

371
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Too expensive?

372
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,560
How about fifteen hundred?

373
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,350
No, no.

374
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,890
It's just that

375
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,140
with this location
and these renovations,

376
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,810
it seems too cheap.

377
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,390
Money is not an issue.

378
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,600
I just want someone reliable

379
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,060
to take care of the place.

380
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,850
We're definitely reliable.

381
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:25,560
Don't worry,

382
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,390
we will definitely

383
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,680
take good care of it,

384
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,220
right, Lanshan?

385
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,600
Lanshan.

386
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:33,850

390

391
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,600
Cheap isn't bad.

392
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:45,390
We'll sign a contract

393
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,270

399

413

for next quarter?

414
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,720
The Christmas season is coming up,

415
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:39,520
so we're planning a big discount event.

416

425
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,350

426
