19
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,080
Careful.

20
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,500
Here you go.

21
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,950
Red really suits you.

22
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,660
Hello, Shwenny and Shan.

23
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,160
Look.

24
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,290
- Mom.
- Grandma's back.

25
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:14,910
Grandma.

26
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,200
So that's why

27
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,000
you sent me out today.

28
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,040
So you could sneak in a punishment
for my son

29
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,410
while I was gone.

30
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,080
If you get into another fight,

31
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,250
I'll beat you up again!

32
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,750
Shwenny, you got into a fight?

33
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,540
Are you hurt?

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,700
Mom. Actually...

35
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:36,750
I'm fine.

36
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,750
Some guy was rude to Chu,

37
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,870
so I took care of it.

38
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,620
I was defending the family name.

39
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,080
But you can't go around doing that.

40
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,700
Alright. Since you're here,

41
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,120
stay for dinner.

42
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,370
We should get going.

43
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,250
Chu and I have some things to do.

44
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,870
Shall we leave?

45
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,660
Mom, we're leaving.

46
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,410

you haven't been feeling well.

this herbal remedy for you.

50
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,870
It's good for your health

51

52
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,040
I know it's bitter,

53
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,370
but good medicine usually is.

54
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,370
Stick with it, alright?

55
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,950
Thank you, Mom.

56
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,660
And don't stress.

57
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,870
You're young and will recover quickly.

58

and getting pregnant
shouldn't be an issue.

00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:25,870
Just stay away from alcohol, smoking,

61

00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:30,790
Got it, Mom.

I feel good.

69
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,580
Why didn't you tell Dad

70
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,950
this fight was for me?

71
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,750
Might've saved you a beating.

You don't think Mom and Dad

already put enough pressure on you?

00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,080
The fight's done.

75
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,790
No point explaining.

Listen.

82
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,660
Really?

83
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,250
What's the meaning?

I'm serious.

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,750

Remember what?

92
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,830
Never mind.

93
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,910
You go on.

94
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,330
Chu,

95
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,910
you really don't remember?

96
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,540
This scar

97
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,410
is when I knew I liked you.

98
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,620
Your name is my secret.

You're my Chengchi.

your Lanshan?

102
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,290
So, she's always liked Chengchi.

00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,660
You made me jump.

00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,290
What's wrong with you?

110
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,790
What's wrong with me?

111
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,870
Who are you married to?

112
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,200
Have you lost it?

113
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,660
I've had enough!

114
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,370
- Let go of me!
- I'm telling you,

115
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,830
forget Han Chengchi right now.

116
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,700
Stop thinking about him!

117
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,950
Are you nuts?

118
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,330
And where are you kicking?

119
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,410
I've put up with you

120
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,540
for too long!

121
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,540
I thought you'd matured,

122
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,330
but tearing up my photo?

123
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,790
Didn't Dad beat you enough last time?

124
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,080
I'll teach you a lesson this time.

125
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,250
And stop

126
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,950
bringing up Chengchi.

127
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,450
He's marrying my sister!

128
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,790
Keep pushing me,

129
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,370
and I'll divorce you!

130
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:45,950
Ow!

131
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,660
Chu hit me.

132
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,660
She's back. She's back!

133
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,160
She actually hit me.

134
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,910
I can't believe hit Sheng Shi.

135
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,910
It felt good.

136
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:31,620
I should've done this sooner.

137
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,290
Lanshan.

138
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,250
How's your cold?

139
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,080
Much better.

140
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,000
Good to hear.

141
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,040
By the way,

142
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,370
Xu, our photographer,

143
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,200
got beat up by his wife yesterday.

144
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,000
He took the day off,

145
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,830
so what you needed

146
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,040
will be delayed a few days.

147
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,750
By his wife?

148
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,620
Yeah.

149
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,200
He even sent me pictures,

150
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,580
so it's pretty convincing.

151
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,660
He's really bruised up.

152
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,540
What's he planning to do?

153
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,040
He says he won't budge

154
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,660
until she apologizes.

155
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,950
Apologize?

156
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,790
Aren't couples supposed to

157
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,790
make up after fights?

158
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,160
This is more than a fight.

159
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,660
Domestic violence is serious.

160
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,200
Once domestic violence starts,

161
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,910
it can break trust
or tear a family apart.

162
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,250
I've reviewed the proposal.

163
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,580
It's good.

164
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,120
Nothing more to discuss today.

165
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,700
Go home early

166
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,540
and spend time with your wives.

167
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,290
A word of advice:

168
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,000
it's not worth making them angry.

169
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,080
You can all go home.

170
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
What's going on?

171
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,660
He's acting weird.

172
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,580
Lu Yifan.

173
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,370
You've been reported
for bribing a teacher,

174
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,200
and your entry has been disqualified.

175
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,120
Reflect on your actions.

176
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,750
It was Han Chengchi who reported you.

177
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,120
Goodbye, teacher.

178
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,040
Thank you.

179
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,410
En.

180
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,250
Thank you, Chengchi.

181
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,000
Han Chengchi.

182
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,580
You cost me my freedom

183
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,200
when you reported me
all those years ago.

184
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,330
Now that you're back,

185
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,620
I'll take back everything

186
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,330
you took from me.

187
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,120
What do you think

188
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,410
of that building we just saw?

189
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,580
For an office,

190
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,370
the location isn't great,

191
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,410
and it's not the best deal.

192
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,620
That's a shame.

193
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,750
I really liked

194
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,830
those huge windows.

195
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,660
The view was amazing.

196
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,580
Alright. Get back to work.

197
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,660
We'll talk it over at home later.

198
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,040
Sure.

199
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,540
From now on, just tell me

200
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,620
whatever's on your mind.

201
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,200
Whenever you call,

202
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,000
I'll pick up, no matter how busy I am.

203
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,660
I know. Go ahead.

204
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,200
En.

206
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,370
Wow, long time no see.

207
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,700
Back in town?

208
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,160
I thought you were settled abroad.

209
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,830
Well, you know the saying

210
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,830
that if you don't work hard, you'll
end up inheriting the family business.

211
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,580
That's me.

212
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,580
Always joking.

213
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,910
You've done way better than me.

214
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,830
All just for appearances.

215
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:06,540
So,

216
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,540
you're marrying Han Chengchi?

217
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,080
Yep, we're engaged,

218
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,160
and the wedding's in the works.

219
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:15,830
Excuse me.

220
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:19,790
Hello?

221
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,910
Mr. Lu, the Han family is making a move.

222
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,700
Just as we expected.

223
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:25,700
Congrats, Mr. Lu.

224
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,830
Once we take down the Hans,
then the Shengs,

225
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,580
the Lu family will be on top.

226
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,080
Stick to the plan.

227
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,290
You seem in a great mood.

228
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,580
Of course, perfect weather,

229
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,080
work's smooth,

230
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,040

No way.

239
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,290
Why is apologizing so hard?

240
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,000
Lanshan, heads up.

00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,040
Mr. Sheng

242
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,620
is coming to the office this afternoon.

243
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:33,700
What?

244
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:34,660
Yeah.

245
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,000
He saw

He's coming by to discuss.

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,000
It's a big opportunity.

250
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:44,370
Maybe

251
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,950
we should do a live interview

252
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,910
with him.

253
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,200
No, no.

00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,620
Why not?

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,000
I...

256
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,950
I just think

257
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,660
we're not prepared,

258
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,120
and it might not go well.

259
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,750
Alright.

260
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,790
Never mind.

261
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,540
Let's just focus on the meeting for now.

262
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:05,750
Okay. Good.

263
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,910
Alright, everyone,

264
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:07,620
listen up.

Mr. Sheng's feedback

267
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,620
will be important for our work.

268
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,700
Oh, Ye Si,

269
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,660
come here.

270
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,370
Bring in a couple of photographers
this afternoon

271
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,370
to capture

272
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,540
some behind-the-scenes shots.

273
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,950
Got it, Mr. Xu.

274
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,580
You got this.

275
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,620
Come on!

276
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,250
Mr. Sheng.

277
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,330
Today might not

278
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,330
be the best day for photos.

279
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,870
How about

280
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,160
we keep it to a simple meeting?

281
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,080
Well...

282
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,540
I'm fine.

283
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:55,160
I think I look great.

284
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,160
Why not take some photos

285
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,700
for your cover?

286
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,620
Perfect!

287
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,620
What about this?

288
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,250
Let's make Mr. Sheng

289
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,500
the cover of our next issue.

290
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,910
What are we waiting for?

291
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,120
Let's get the photographer ready.

292
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:15,950
Hurry up!

293
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,620
Thanks, Mr. Sheng.

294
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,910
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

295
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,120
Ye Si,

296
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,290
grab some concealer

297
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:25,950
for Mr. Sheng, please.

298
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:27,790
On it.

299
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,410
Am I looking good?

300
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:43,950
Yeah.

301
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:56,750
What are you doing?

302
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:57,830
What's up, Fanhua?

303
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,910
Feeling good now?

304
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,620
Why?

305
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,200
Because you hit me?

306
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,620
Shwenny got hit by Lanshan
and he's thrilled.

307
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,790
Thought

308
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,080
you'd like it too.

309
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,250
How do you want to die?

310
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,080
Just kidding.

311
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,700
Nothing happened.

312
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:17,790
I'm out of here.

313
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:18,750
See you tomorrow.

314
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,160
Lanshan,

315
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:42,080
I swear Mr. Sheng is staring at you.

316
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,660
You must be seeing things.

317
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,620
I think he is.

318
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,500
Right?

319
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,620
Mr. Sheng,

320
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,750
is something wrong?

321
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,370
I'd like a picture with Editor Gu.

322
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,330
Uh, that might not be a good idea.

323
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,250
If you want a photo,

324
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,200
I'm available too.

325
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,750

366
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,120
it was time

367
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,660
to make it official.

368
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:51,620
I didn't ask,

369
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,120
but I promise

370
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,750
nothing in your life will change.

It's a card for Mrs. Sheng.

00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,580
I thought you said the location

384
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,370
wasn't great.

385
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,290
Leave the decor to me.

386
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:56,620
I promise you'll love it.

387
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,290
No problem.

388
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,790
Look.

389
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,580
This can be your office.

390
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:38,830
You are awake.

391
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,540
Let Huan handle the flowers.

392
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,370
I was just curious.

393
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,750
Time for work.

394
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:47,950
Go get dressed

395
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,410
I'll drive you.

396
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,540
Mr. Sheng is here!

397
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,540
Mr. Sheng! Mr. Sheng! Mr. Sheng!

398
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,330
No wonder you offered to drive me.

399
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,580
I thought you said nothing would change.

400
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,160
Excuse us.

401
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,950
My wife's in a hurry. Sorry.

402
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,000
Mr. Sheng! Mr. Sheng! Mr. Sheng!

403
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,790
Just a few words, Mr. Sheng!

404
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,330
Just a few words, please!

405
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,040
Mr. Sheng! Mr. Sheng!

406
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,870
Just a few words, Mr. Sheng!

407
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:34,910
Bye.

408
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,580

This issue

411

broke all our sales records.

412
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,700
Let's give it up!

413
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,500
Sorry for keeping it a secret so long.

414
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,950
No worries.

415
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:10,080
Everyone's got their own private life.

416
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:11,410
Exactly.

417
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,500
I snore when I sleep.

418
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:15,870
Keep it up,

419
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,040
everyone!

420
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,000

[Mr. Sheng's Wife Revealed]

422
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,700
Gu Lanshan,

423
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,040
you're so fake.

424
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,200
Flirting with your brother-in-law

425
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:32,330
while acting all lovey-dovey with Shi.

426
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,660
Let's see how I expose you.

427
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,500
Huan.

428
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,910
Yes, Mr. Sheng?

429
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,700
Do me a favor.

430
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,660
Make more healthy dishes.

431
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,660
Whatever's good for the body.

432
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,290
Don't worry about my preferences.

433
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,830
Maybe some fish tonight?

434
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:48,910
Perfect.

435
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,000
Okay.

436
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:50,950
I got this.

437
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,700
Good.

438
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,410
What are you doing?

439
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,200
You scared me.

440
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:58,250
You scared me too.

441
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,500
Who were you looking at?

442
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:01,870
Oh,

443
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,500
I dreamed about you last night.

444
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:04,540
Guess what?

445
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,910
Someone was pursuing you.

446
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,330
You might

447
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,750
meet your match this year.

448
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:12,830
I just want to know

449
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,870
when you'll stop hanging around.

450
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,450
Come on, where's the love?

451
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,040
We've been friends forever.

452
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,040
What's she doing here?

453
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,040
Come in.

454
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:37,410
Shi.

455
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:42,750
Yeah?

456
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,410
Shi.

457
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,660
You've been busy lately.

458
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,540
I couldn't find you yesterday.

459
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,080
I'm busy, so leave me alone.

460
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,410
Why bothering me?

461
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,200
I didn't want to say anything,

462
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:58,830
but

463
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:00,580
I have to tell you this.

464
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:11,750
Look.

465
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:13,910
You love Gu Lanshan so much,

466
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,790
but she and Han...

467
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:15,870
Anything else?

468
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,500
Hold on.

469
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,620
Shi.

470
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,620
Look at what she wrote

471
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,540
behind this photo.

472
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,410
It's clear she and Han...

473
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,790
I've got a meeting soon.

474
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,660
If that's all,

475
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,750
you can go.

476
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,250
And remember,

477
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,540
slandering my wife

478
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,910
has consequences.

479
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,750
Wait a second.

480
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,450
Ms. Wang,

481
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:45,330
give me your number.

482
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,500
I'll reach out if needed.

483
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:51,790
Here you go, Shi.

484
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:56,120
No matter what happens,

485
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,000
I'm always on your side.

486
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,620
If you need me, I'm here.

487
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,040
After all these years,

488
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,000
he finally added me on WeChat.

489
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,200
I need to make the most of this.

490
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,910
I'll head out now

491
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,200
then.

492
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,870
Keep in touch.

493
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,160
Ye Chu,

494
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,580
look what you did.

495
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,000
You actually recreated

496
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,160
our childhood clothes.

497
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,540
Mr. Han, you're amazing.

498
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,910
You got the wedding dress measurements

499
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,370
spot on.

500
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,040
It's not perfect,

501
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,200
but En looks great

502
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:51,290
in anything.

503
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:53,410
You like it?

504
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:54,700
I love it.

505
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,950
Thanks for the surprise.

506
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:57,200
I didn't expect today

507
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:58,910
to be our wedding photo day.

508
00:26:59,080 --> 00:26:59,870
You know,

509
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:00,830
when I was three,

510
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,200
I secured my future wife

511
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,200
with just one kiss.

512
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,370
Speaking of that,

513
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,080
you stole my first kiss.

514
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:08,790
That kiss

515
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,410
sealed our fate.

516
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,620
Yeah.

517
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,500
It's amazing how things work out.

518
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,660
Happiness really does surprise you.

519
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,700
Chengchi,

520
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,620
can we be together forever?

521
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,370
I'll always be with you

522
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,160
till the day I die.

523
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,250
Mr. Han, Ms. Gu,

524
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:28,620
let's go take those photos.

525
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:16,620
I've covered Mo's medical bills

526
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,830
for the month.

527
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,040
The rest is yours.

528
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,660
If you don't want it, toss it.

529
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,500
I never take back what I've given.
