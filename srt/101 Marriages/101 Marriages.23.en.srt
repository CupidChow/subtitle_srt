00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,330
I hurt Shwenny

196
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,250
and Shan

197
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,450
because of you.

198
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,580
Do you miss me?

199
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:43,700
I miss you.

200
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,040
Do you really?

201
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,620
Want to marry me?

202
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,000
He's awake.

203
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,870
- Shwenny.
- He's awake.

204
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,040
You nearly scared me to death.

205
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,580
Shwenny,

206
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,870
can you hear me?

207
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,290
Can you see me?

208
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,330
Quiet down.

209
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,580
He's recovering well.

210
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,160
Everything's functioning normally.

211
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,580
He's all good now.

212
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,790
He can go home to rest.

213
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,580
Thank you, doctor. Thank you.

214
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,580
Shwenny, how are you feeling?

215
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,250
Any pain?

216
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,080
Tell me.

217
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:32,910
Mom,

218
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,080
where's Chu?

219
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,410
Don't worry.

220
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,160
Lanshan's just got some minor injuries.

221
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,540
She'll be out of the hospital soon.

222
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,870
Liunian, is Shwenny really awake?

223
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,250
Yeah, Lanshan.

224
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,080
Didn't I tell you he'd be fine?

225
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,450
He's going to be okay.

226
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,250
Good. I'm going to see him right now.

227
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,000
Wait, wait.

228
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,660
His parents are still with him.

229
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,620
Right, I forgot.

230
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,080
They still don't want me to see him.

231
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:10,660
Don't stress.

232
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,330
Fanhua and I will figure out a way

233
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,910
for you to see him soon.

234
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,620
Mr. Chu.

235
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,250
I heard you got hurt.

236
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,620
How are you feeling now?

237
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,540
Thanks for asking.
I'm doing much better.

238
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,660
Lanshan,

239
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,580
if you had the chance

240
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,330
to start fresh, with a new identity

241
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,540
and away from everyone who's hurt you,

242
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,040
would you take it?

243
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,540
If you'd asked me before,

244
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,750
I would've jumped at the chance.

245
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,580
I wanted to get as far as possible

246
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,620
because I felt

247
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,950
abandoned by everyone.

248
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,750
My mother left me

249
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,830
with the Gu family when I was a kid,

250
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,040
and to them,

251
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,040
I was just

252
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,250
a bargaining chip.

253
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,790
When I brought you back,

254
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,330
I planned for you
to marry into the Xia family.

255
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,620
But they declined so quickly.

256
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,000
I thought raising you was a waste,

257
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,750
but it turns out

258
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,200
Sheng Shi is serious about you.

259
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,200
He is willing to do anything for you.

260
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,290
Even

261
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,120
my closest friend,

262
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,040
the sister I respected the most,

263
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,830
left me.

264
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,200
At that time,

265
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,910
I didn't see the point
in anything anymore.

266
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,500
Life just felt

267
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,540
so unfair.

268
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,540
But later,

269
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,830
I realized

270
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,250
life isn't unfair.

271
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,080
It put me through all those challenges,

272
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,080
and then

273
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,330
it brought Shwenny into my life.

274
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,120
Shwenny is a bit immature,

275
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,500
a bit arrogant,

276
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,200
and a bit overprotective.

277
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,870
Chu is my wife.

278
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,950
I really don't like it

279
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:32,830
when my wife has anything
to do with another man.

280
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,750
I used to think

281
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,540
he was impossible,

282
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,580
but then

283
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:46,950
I realized

284
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,700
he'd been loving me

285
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,830
in his own awkward way all along.

286
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,950
He's clumsy, but he's willing
to help people

287
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,080
he doesn't even like just for me.

288
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,410
He's even willing

289
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,040
to take on the world

290
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,370
for me.

291
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,250
Are you divorcing Lanshan or not?

292
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,040
No, I'm not.

293
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,950
You!

294
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,410
You brat!

295
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,500
He's clumsy enough

296
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,620
to keep getting hurt

297
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,500
trying to protect me,

298
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,660
without caring about his own safety.

299
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,330
Watch out!

300
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,830
So,

301
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,370
if you ask me now

302
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,950
if I want to start fresh
with a new identity,

303
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,950
my answer is

304
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,790
no.

305
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,500
Because Shwenny

306
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:42,830
loves me with everything he's got.

307
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,790
Where he is,

308
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,620
that's where I want to be.

309
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,620
I just want a simple,

310
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,500
quiet life with him,

311
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,200
no more guessing,

312
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,250
no more drama.

313
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,870
Kid,

314
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,160
I'm sorry.

315
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,080
Your dad died saving me,

316
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,910
and he entrusted you to me.

317
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,950
It took me so long to find you,

318
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,120
and you've been through so much.

319
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,410
From now on,

320
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,250
I'll protect you

321
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,000
and take care of you,

322
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,620
just like your father would have.

323
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,370
Here, have a sip.

324
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,580
Take in some nutrients.

325
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,870
Have more.

326
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,330
It's good for your recovery.

327
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:32,950
Come on.

328
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:33,830
Shwenny,

329
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,500
what are you doing?

330
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,950
Your mom's arm is getting tired.

331
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,040
Mom, give me the phone.

332
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,370
What do you need the phone for?

333
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,910
Your only job right now

334
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,040
is to get better. Others can wait.

335
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,160
The company has a lot going on.

336
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,160
The company's fine.

337
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,660
Worry about yourself.

338
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,750
At least let me check in

339
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:52,910
with my friends.

340
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,290
Let Liunian and Fanhua handle that.

341
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,500
I need to call Chu!

342
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,910
Give me the phone now.

343
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,830
If it weren't for her,

344
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:04,790
you wouldn't have ended up

345
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,080
in the hospital again.

346
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,750
She's done enough damage.

347
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:08,660
Stay away from her.

348
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,790
That's right.

349
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,660
You're divorced now.

350
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,370
Don't drag this out.

351
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,290
No way.

352
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,250
Did you hear

353
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,290
what he was saying?

354
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,660
Have you forgotten

355
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,750
how much she embarrassed our family?

356
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,160
I saw with my own eyes

357
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,200
how close she was

358
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,290
to that Han kid,

359
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,950
and you still want to be with her?

360
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:27,830
You...

361
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:30,660
What's wrong?

362
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,200
- You're stressing out your mom.
- Here we go.

363
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,950
If something happens to her...

364
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,910
Alright, I'll drop it.

365
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,080
Just calm her down.

366
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,580
Like it's not your fault!

367
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,580
Even if

368
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,000
your mom gets better,

369
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,290
you'll drive her to the edge eventually.

370
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,830
Fine, I won't say another word.

371
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,200
Gu En

372
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,540
is the most beautiful woman
in the world.

373
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,500
Give me a kiss.

374
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,080
Marry me.

375
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,660
Why are you out of bed?

376
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,290
Get back in there.

377
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,040
Mom,

378
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,620
you don't understand.

379
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,950
Walking around helps the recovery.

380
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,580
Fresh air is the best medicine.

381
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,500
Your leg's still injured,
and you're not strong enough.

382
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,370
You're not going anywhere.

383
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,620
I'll be back soon.

384
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:28,950
Shwenny,

385
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,870
stop giving me a hard time.

386
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,500
My chest has been hurting so much.

387
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,500
Alright, I won't go.

388
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,620
Just stop worrying.

389
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:36,040
Shwenny.

390
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:39,200
I've been looking all over for you.

391
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:40,040
Auntie.

392
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,870
You're here.

393
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,750
Look,

394
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,040
I brought you something.

395
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,870
Childish.

396
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,410
How can you be so heartless?

397
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,120
I went out of my way

398
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,830
to bring you something

399
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,660
to help you see the outside world

400
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,870

405
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,950

407
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:00,830
Why wouldn't it be?

408
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:01,580
Lanshan's out there.

409
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,790
Yeah, it's the same.

410
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,500
Liunian's always so thoughtful.

411
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,580
It's not quite the same.

412
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,540
Give it here.

413
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,660
Enough on this side, Shwenny.

414
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,620

and do whatever he wants,

462
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,750
he might help.

after we got married,

466
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,830
he spent every day with other women

491
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,540
go ask him.

see you suffer with him.

502
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,040
You knew, didn't you?

503
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,580
So why didn't you stop me?

504
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,370

505
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,120

506
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,080

00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,330

513
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,580
is Han Chengchi.

00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,290

Mr. Sheng.

517
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,200
Your mom said

518
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:14,370

00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:17,500
I'm in pain.
I need to get some medicine.

521
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,160
I'll inform Madam.

522
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:21,950
Sorry, Mr. Sheng,

523
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:22,870
but your mom said

524
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,160
we can't leave you alone.

525
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:25,500
What do you need?

526
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,790
I can order it online.

527
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,620
Fine, I won't go.

528
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,370
But do you even know what I need?

529
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,950
I don't even have my phone.

530
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:42,040
I thought Madam said no phones for him.

531
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,540
He's just getting medicine.

532
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:45,290
Medicine.

533
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:57,910
And you are?

534
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,620
I'm here to do physical therapy

535
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,000
for Mr. Sheng.

536
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:03,830
Did his mom arrange this?

537
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,830
She said no going out.

538
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,250
She didn't say no one could come in.

539
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,000
That's right.

540
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,160

541
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,330

546
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,660
I haven't even ordered my medicine yet,

547
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,830
and here comes a nurse?

548
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:28,620
Actually,

549
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,870
your mom asked me

550
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:30,950
to check on you.

551
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:31,830
My mom?

552
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,540
Alright, go ahead.

553
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,950
Chu?

554
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,580
Does it still hurt?

555
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,620
Not anymore.

556
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,200
Then it's probably nothing serious.

557
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,500
It hurts.

558
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,580
Where?

559
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
- Here?
- Right there.

560
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,000
Yes, right there.

561
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,080
Massage it for me.

562
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,080
Does it still hurt?

563
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,750
Where did you go to nursing school?

564
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:12,120
You don't even know the basics.

565
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,450
Does it still hurt?

566
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,290
It hurts.

567
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,580
Lower.

568
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,500
Right there.

569
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,700
Keep going.

570
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:24,580
Is this better?

571
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,370
Higher.

572
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,660
Higher.

573
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:27,950
