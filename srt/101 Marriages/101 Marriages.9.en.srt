00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,200
trusting them with the construction.

192
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,040
But it turns out

193
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,830
Mr. Lu cut corners on the materials.

194
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,040
What?

195
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,500
Mr. Sheng,

196
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,290
you can't just straight-up lie.

197
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,660
Relax, Mr. Lu.

198
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,410
Actually,

199
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,000
Mr. Lu has a conscience.

200
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,330
He just downgraded

201
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,580
the insulation materials
for the exterior walls

202
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,410
from A-grade to B2-grade.

203
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,790
As long as nothing major happens,

204
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,790
it should be fine.

205
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,750
Look,

206
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,830
I'm all about honesty,

207
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
and I really can't stand
the way Mr. Lu does things.

208
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,160
After all,

209
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,540
integrity

210
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,700
is what gets you ahead in life,

211
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,290
right, Mr. Lu?

212
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,370
Mr. Sheng,

213
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,000
are you seriously accusing me

214
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,910
just because Aosi chose to work with me

215
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,410
instead of you?

216
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:51,950
Where's your proof?

217
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,950
You think I came here

218
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,660
unprepared?

219
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,370
Sure,

220
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,120
you covered your tracks well

221
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,370
and even bribed the inspectors,

222
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
but don't think

223
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,540
the Sheng Group

224
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,620
is that easy to fool.

225
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,200
Anyway.

226
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,250
Mr. Lu,

227
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,870
once you sign, send it over to me.

228
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,000
Mr. Zhang,

229
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,290
sorry about

230
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,540
that little hiccup.

231
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:35,870
You can go ahead.

232
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,790
We'll see you in court,

233
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,580
Mr. Lu.

234
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,290
You've really disappointed me.

235
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,500
Mr. Sheng.

236
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,790
Hello.

237
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,910
The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable right now.

238
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,620
Please try again later.

239
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,830
Shan.

240
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,040
Chengchi.

241
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,290
It's pouring out here.

242
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,410
- What happened?
- My car broke down.

243
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,700
Don't worry about it.

244
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,370
Just get in my car.

245
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,370
Sure.

246
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,790
Go.

247
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,200
I've got a feeling

248
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,790
Lu Yifan's up to something.

249
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,000
Stay sharp

250
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,160
and get ready

251
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,750
for anything.

252
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,370
Got it.

253
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,040
How did the meeting go?

254
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,160
All good?

255
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,540
From the looks on your faces,

256
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,250
not great.

257
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,290
What did I say?

258
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,160
Your intuition's never right.

259
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,160
Don't trust it.

260
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,160
I'm sure

261
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,290
something's bothering Shwenny today.

262
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,000
Isn't that it?

263
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:22,830
Are you okay?

264
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,660
I'm fine.

265
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,750
Let me make you some cold medicine.

266
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,370
Don't bother, Chengchi.

267
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,580
En?

268
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,580
En.

269
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,040
Why didn't you let me know earlier?
I could've picked you up.

270
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,830
I wanted to surprise you.

271
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,120
Happy birthday.

272
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:40,290
Thank you.

273
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,000
You should dry off.

274
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,500
Shan, take a hot shower

275
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,660
and warm up.

276
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,080
Are you catching a cold?

277
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,370
Next time it rains,

278
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,870
dress warmer.

279
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,910
By the way,

280
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,250
Shwenny called me earlier

281
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,370
looking for you.

282
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,290
I told him I didn't know where you were.

283
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,330
It's fine, En.

284
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,830
I talked to him.

285
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,160
My car broke down on the way,

286
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,540
but luckily Chengchi showed up.

287
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,950
Otherwise, I'd be in a mess.

288
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,500
I was on my way to pick you up

289
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,250
when I ran into her.

290
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,580
I'm going to tidy up.

291
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,080
En, where are your new clothes?

292
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,660
Here.

293
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,910
I'll give them to Shan to wear.

294
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:04,950
Shan.

295
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,120
These are your sister's clothes.

296
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,290
Give you my wet clothes.

297
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,410
I'll dry them.

298
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,540
What's wrong?

299
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,040
Let me run a bath

300
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,540
for you to warm up.

301
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,040
En.

302
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,700
Drink some ginger tea

303
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,540
to keep from getting a cold.

304
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,540
I'm not that delicate.

305
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,500
A little rain won't hurt me.

306
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,410
Actually,

307
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,000
why don't you give the tea to Shan?

308
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,620
She was sneezing earlier.

309
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:17,500
Are you okay?

310
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,660
Chengchi.

311
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,830
I need to know...

312
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:28,580
Do you care about me
because you love me,

313
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,120
or is it out of guilt?

314
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,040
What are you talking about?

315
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,290
Of course, I love you.

316
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,080
You're my fiancée,

317
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,700
my future wife.

318
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,370
Who else would I love?

319
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,660
Or is it because

320
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,000
you feel guilty about Shan?

321
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,700
Has she become

322
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,500
more important to you than I am?

323
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,410
Shan is your sister.

324
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,160
How would she feel

325
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,580
if she heard you say that?

326
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,950
You're worried about her feelings,

327
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,120
but what about

328
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,200
mine?

329
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,790
She's my sister.

330
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,000
How could you treat me like this?

331
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:08,950
I'm taking care of her

332
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,580
because she's your sister.

333
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,080
Fine.

334
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,910
If it bothers you,

335
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,910
I'll keep my distance,

336
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,910
okay?

337
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,040
And please,

338
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,370
let's not talk about this anymore.

339
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,790
Shan is part of the Sheng family.

340
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,540
There's nothing between us.

341
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,250
She likes Shwenny, not me.

342
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,700
So you're saying

343
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,540
you don't know
that Shan has feelings for you?

344
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,080
En,

345
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,580
this is all just a misunderstanding.

346
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,330
Let's get through the party first,
and then we can talk.

347
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:51,830
Just relax

348
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,350
and let me handle this, okay?

349
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:58,100
♪Fixing the cracks in our hands♪

00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,250
did you hurt your hand?

357
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,370
You heard what we were saying,

358
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,250
didn't you?

359
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,580
En,

360
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,040
let's go downstairs.

361
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,080
The birthday party is about to start.

362
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,120
You're still defending her?

363
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,500
The party starts at 7:30.

364
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,830
I think we have time
to finish this conversation.

Shwenny, you're here.

368
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,540
It's cold outside,

369
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,200
so I had some ginger tea made.

370
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,290
Come, warm up.

371
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,120
When did you and Shan get together?

372
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:01,250
En,

373
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,080
Shan is your sister and mine too.

374
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,370
How could I have any thoughts about her?

375
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:08,790
So, my sweet little sister

376
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,870
seduced her future brother-in-law?

377
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,620
No, I didn't.

378
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:17,080
If there's nothing going on,

379
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,910
then why did you

380
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,040
get so nervous

381
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,500
when Jiayi almost revealed

382
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,790
who Shan likes?

383
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,200
I just didn't want it

384
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,370
to get awkward.

385
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,580
Han Chengchi,

386
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,950
you're unbelievable.

387
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,580
I used to trust everything you said.

388
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,000
Even when I heard Mom and Jiayi

389
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
talking about Shan likes you,
I didn't believe it.

390
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,040
But now,

391
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,950
no matter what you say,

392
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,950
it just sounds

393
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,000
like excuses to me.

394
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,950
There's no one else in my heart.

395
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,200
Then why did you

396
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:53,750
say you were coming to pick me up

397
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,540
but ended up getting her instead?

398
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,660
That was an accident.

399
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:57,660
Her car broke down.

400
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:58,870
I couldn't just
leave her there, could I?

401
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,750
En, what Chengchi said is true.

402
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:01,790
My car really did break down.

403
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,080
Here's the proof.

404
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:06,330
En,

405
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:09,410
I've always looked up
to you and Chengchi.

406
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,200
I only see him as
my brother-in-law, nothing more.

407
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,660
I would never even
think of anything else.

408
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:18,750
Even now,

409
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,750
you two are still trying to cover it up?

410
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,370
Fine.

411
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,000
I've got evidence.

412
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:37,250
[Happy birthday. Love you, Miss Gu]
It's written right here.

413
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,500
That's you, isn't it?

414
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,330
En,

415
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,200
isn't this the tie you bought for me?

416
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:47,830
En,

417
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,000
I didn't buy this tie.

418
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,580
You two are really something.

419
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,700
Han Chengchi,

420
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,700
we've known each other
for over 20 years.

421
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,370
Have I ever given you a gift

422
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,580
in this way?

423
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,870
And you, Gu Lanshan,

424
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,950
you're married to Shwenny now,

425
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,290
so why are you still after Chengchi?

426
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,370
Is it because
you want what you can't have?

427
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,830
Or do you just

428
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,750
enjoy seeing me

429
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,540
unhappy?

430
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,660
No, En.

431
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:17,290
I really...

432
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,160
Enough.

433
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,370
Excuse me.

434
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:40,950
I'm looking for

435
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,540
Gu Lanshan.

436
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,540
I think she went upstairs.

437
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,540
Okay, thanks.

438
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,790
I'm so disappointed in you.

439
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,290
En,

440
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,500
let me explain.

441
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,750
I did buy a tie,

442
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,830
but it wasn't for Chengchi.

443
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Please believe me.

444
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,950
Didn't you just say you didn't buy one?

445
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,950
Now, you're saying you did
but didn't give it to him?

446
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,950
What's next? Is Chengchi going to say

447
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,200
he didn't receive it either?

448
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,120
You can deny this tie

449
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,660
all you want.

450
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,160
You can deny loving Gu Lanshan, too,

451
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,830
if that's what you want.

452
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,660
But Gu Lanshan,

453
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:18,950
can you deny

454
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,540
that you love Chengchi?

455
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,910
Otherwise, how do you explain

456
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:25,500
knowing he's allergic to crab

457
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,700
and writing

458
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,750
those cheesy love lines like

459
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,580
"Your name, my secret.

460
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,000
You are my Chengchi.

461
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,080
Am I

462
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,330
your Lanshan?"

463
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,500
And Chengchi, you used those same lines

464
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,910
to confess your love to me.

465
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,120
How ironic

466
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,910
is that?

467
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,910
So why don't you admit

468
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:48,040
you bought this tie?

469
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
En,

470
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,290
I swear, I didn't give him that tie.

471
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,750
Gu En,

472
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,330
I'm telling you,

473
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,620
there's nothing going on
between me and Shan.

474
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,410
Forget about who bought the tie.

475
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,580
Shwenny is my brother,

476
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,410
and Shan is his wife.

477
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,330
Let's just drop this, okay?

478
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,290
If you want me to believe you,

479
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,200
then do it.

480
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,330
Tell Gu Lanshan right now, to her face,

481
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,410
that you'll never love her

482
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,910
and that she should
give up any hopes she has.

483
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:21,540
En,

484
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,250
you're really crossing the line.

485
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:27,410
Me? Crossing the line?

486
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,830
Han Chengchi,

487
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,700
we've been together for over 20 years.

488
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,950
Don't you know

489
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,370
what kind of person I am by now?

490
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,500
I, Gu En,

491
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,200
won't tolerate
any unclear relationships.

492
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:41,120
If you don't say it today,

493
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:44,290
we're calling off the wedding.

494
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,080
Fine.

495
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:53,330
If it will

496
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:54,910
make you happy,

497
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,290
I'll do it.

498
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:06,620
Lanshan,

499
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:10,290
I absolutely...

500
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,410
Shwenny.

501
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,370
Where have you been?
I've been looking all over for you.

502
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,330
Han Chengchi,

503
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:44,000
I just overheard En telling you

504
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,410
to reject Gu Lanshan to her face.

505
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,750
And you went along with it?

506
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,120
Well,

507
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,660
listen up.

508
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,250
Chu is my wife.

509
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,540
I'm not the kind of guy

510
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,580
who tolerates any emotional involvement

511
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,330
between my wife

512
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,000
and other men,

513
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,290
not even a hint of it.

514
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,330
So,

515
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,500
Miss Gu,

516
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,040
if you want to

517
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,950
test your man's love,

518
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,540
find another way.

519
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,120
Don't drag my wife into it,

520
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,410
okay?

521
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,750
Shwenny,

522
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,040
En's just upset.

523
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,700
Don't take it so seriously.

524
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,290
Don't give me that.

525
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:34,700
I heard everything
you all said in there,

526
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,660
loud and clear.

527
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,870
Your excuse

528
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,830
means nothing to me.

529
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,830
And Han Chengchi,

530
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,040
we're not the same.

531
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,620
You've always

532
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,370
tried to be the nice guy

533
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,080
and keep everyone happy.

534
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,660
Me?

535
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,830
I just want to make sure
my wife is happy.

536
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,950
That's it.

537
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,700
Take a look at this. What is it?

538
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,040
This is...

539
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,040
How did you get that tie?

540
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,410
It was a birthday gift from Chu.

541
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:27,120
Don't believe me?

542
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:28,870
Fine.

543
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,930
[Transaction Date]

544
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:36,910
Here's the purchase record.

545
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,450
She bought it from the store,

546
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,660
and it's the only one.

547
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,040
But this tie

548
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,040
was a gift to me.

549
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,200
You think

550
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,620
I would get an identical tie

551
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,200
to cover for Chu?

552
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,000
No husband

553
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,080
would help his wife cheat, right?

554
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:57,830
So if you're saying

555
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,870
this tie has nothing to do with Shan.

556
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,120
That's obvious.

557
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:01,790
If it did,

558
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,000
you wouldn't be
standing here talking to me.

559
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,910
Then who gave this tie?

560
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,950
I don't know who's behind this,

561
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:11,540
but I'll find out

562
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,910
and let you know.

563
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,160
But right now,

564
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:17,750
we need to deal with

565
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:20,160
what's in front of us,

566
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:21,410
don't you think?

567
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,080
Shwenny,

568
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,370
I'm really sorry.

569
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,080
Don't apologize to me.

570
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,580
Just be assured

571
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,200
that Chu doesn't have feelings
for you anymore,

572
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:37,700
right, honey?

573
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,120
Chengchi,

574
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,620
I'm sorry,

575
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:50,500
but I...

576
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,080
I don't like you anymore.

577
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,500
En,

578
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,250
I'm sorry.

579
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,700
But I never had

580
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,040
any inappropriate thoughts about him.

581
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:06,410
Lanshan,

582
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,120
you don't need to apologize.

583
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,540
It's all good.

584
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,160
I'll tell you what,

585
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,330
everyone makes mistakes,

586
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,040
and my dear Chu is no different.

587
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,580
Silly.

588
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,870
When she was younger,

589
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,410
she got her feelings mixed up

590
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:27,290
with her friendship with Chengchi.

591
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,700
Her head was
in the wrong place for a bit,

592
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,950
but she's better now.

593
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,330
Although, back then,

594
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,330
not only was her head messed up,
but her hands were too.

595
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,660
She wrote some sappy love stuff

596
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,830
that got twisted around

597
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:39,950
by someone else.

598
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,750
It's gross just thinking about it.

599
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:47,790
You know,

600
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:49,290
when Chu

601
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:50,620
confessed to me,

602
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,870
she was really clear about it.

603
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,540
She told me she used to think

604
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,040
she liked Chengchi,

605
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,120
but in the end, she realized

606
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:00,200
it was more like a sibling thing.

607
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,660
It wasn't until she met me

608
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,330
that she understood

609
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,290
what real love is.

610
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,250
So,

611
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:19,700
did Shan make the move on you?

612
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,790
Of course!

613
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,290
I mean, have you seen me? Who wouldn't?

614
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:24,870
Anyway,

615
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:26,620
it's getting late.

616
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,500
Since it's my birthday,

617
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:29,790
can we all just get along?

618
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,410
En might've been

619
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:35,370
a bit off today.

620
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:36,620
It's no big deal.

621
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:37,910
I'm not upset.

622
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,580
And then,

623
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,410
just a reminder,

624
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,410
while Chu might be

625
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,790
Gu En's sister,

626
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,250
she's also my wife,

627
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,950
the lady of the Sheng family.

628
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,620
I'd appreciate it if you treat her

629
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:56,080
with the respect she deserves.

630
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,660
Are you done?

631
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:02,080
Almost.

632
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,120
And one last thing,

633
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,830
I'm not being petty here,

634
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,370
I'm just protective.

635
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,330
I've only got one wife,

636
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,040
and if I don't spoil her, who will?

637
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,160
Right, babe?

638
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:13,790
Go.

639
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:15,450
Go.

640
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:19,540
Come on.

641
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,830
Let's go.

642
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,290
Oh, almost forgot something.

643
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:45,580
This tie has really been something.

644
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,000
Great for catching cheaters

645
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,160
and sparking the imagination,

646
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,700
don't you think?

647
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,000
Thanks, babe.
