00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:56,870
Cold...

194
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,080
Cold?

195
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,160
You're burning up.

196
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,910
Are you getting a fever?

197
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,040
Huan.

198
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,250
Huan!

199
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,700
What's wrong?

200
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,540
What happened?

201
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,750
She's got a fever.

202
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,540
I told you to take care of her.

203
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:20,950
Get Dr. Wang.

204
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,750
Okay. I'll go right away.

205
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,250
Hurry up.

206
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,540
Sheng Shi?

207
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,620
PR blocked

208
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,000
all the leaks.

209
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,080
No news got out about last night,

210
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,660
including the fight.

211
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,950
Thanks.

212
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,290
Appreciate it.

213
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,620
Shwenny,

214
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,870
you were too rash.

215
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,870
Liu's working with Lu Yifan now,

216
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,870
and we're in direct competition.

217
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,750
I'm worried they'll

218
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:07,910
blow this up

219
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,580
and try to stab us in the back.

220
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,620
Anyone who messes with Chu

221
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,330
will pay.

222
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,660
Why not

223
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,160
tell that to Lanshan?

224
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,580
It's none of your business.

225
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,750
I'll say it to anyone I want,

226
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,160
just not her.

227
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,200
What are you doing?

228
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,560
Feeling better?

229
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,060
What I said earlier...

230
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,310
What I meant was...

231
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,720
What did you say?

232
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,140
Didn't hear?

233
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,020
That's good.

234
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,600
Let's get you back to bed.

235
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,180
Go, go, go.

236
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:54,520
Lie down.

237
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,560
But I have to work.

238
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,680
Already got you the day off.

239
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,470
Just rest.

240
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,350
Who's calling?

241
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,140
Don't worry about it.

242
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,060
Shwenny, you got a call.

243
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,310
Sorry,

244
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,810
you guys continue.

245
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,100
Get a good rest.

246
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,560
No phones,

247
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,470
okay?

248
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,560
No more calls.

249
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:36,970
Listen.

250
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,060
Anyone who messes with Chu

251
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,140
will pay.

252
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,640
Why not

253
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,970
tell that to Lanshan?

254
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,310
It's none of your business.

255
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,810
I'll say it to anyone I want,

256
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,680
just not her.

257
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:57,810
Huan,

258
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,890
make sure the porridge is nutritious.

259
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,220
Chu is not well. Do you know that?

260
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,060
It's seafood porridge,

261
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,140
light and healthy.

262
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:07,970
But there's

263
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,850
too much rice in there.

264
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:10,970
Don't worry.

265
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,060
It's measured out.

266
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,850
Just one?

267
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,350
How many

268
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:25,770
do you want?

269
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,310
Let me handle it.

270
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,100
Just one?

271
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,970
So stingy.

272
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:40,720
Is there a problem?

273
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:41,520
I mean...

274
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:43,140
You used it all.

275
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,970
You didn't save me any?

276
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,890
I'll make you some.

277
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,390
Should I

278
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,020
cook this on low or high,

279
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,390
and how long does it need?

280
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,060
Do you even know how to cook?

281
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,720
Go sit down. I'll take care of it.

282
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:04,970
Chu.

283
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,220
I made you some porridge.

284
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:11,680
I'll have it myself.

285
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,180
No worries,

286
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,140
I'll feed you.

287
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,810
What happened to your hand?

288
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,270
This...

289
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,270
Might've burned it

290
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,310
while cooking.

291
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,770
Here, have some.

292
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,560
Your phone is ringing.

293
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,600
It's nothing.

294
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:32,720
It's just

295
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,390
background music.

296
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,470
Yeah, background music.

297
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,140
Eat a shrimp.

298
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:48,850
It's still in the shell...

299
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,220
The shell's full of calcium.

300
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,390
Here.

Hello?

309
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,180
Mr. Sheng,

310
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:40,640
it's already afternoon.

311
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,310
When are you coming in?

312
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,850
I told you,

313
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,640
I'm handling something important today.

314
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,310
You guys take care of it.

315
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,100
But the shareholders are waiting

316
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,220
for the meeting.

317
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,470
Mr. Xia.

318
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,180
What's up?

319
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,520
Shareholders are still waiting

320
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,430
for Mr. Sheng.

321
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,180
But he said he's busy
and turned off his phone.

322
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,770
He's not coming in today.

323
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:00,970
What's going on with him?

324
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:01,970
Well.

325
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,520
I just talked to him.

326
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,470
He seemed fine,

327
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,890
just worried about Lanshan.

328
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,390
Everything else seemed great.

329
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,970
Exactly.

330
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,720
That's why he's not coming in.

331
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,890
But this decision is crucial.

332
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,020
If we don't finalize it today,

333
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,180
we'll lose big.

334
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,600
Any ideas, Mr. Xia?

335
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,140
If you're up for it,

336
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,520
try calling the landline.

337
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:32,680
Hello?

338
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:33,520
Hello?

339
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,140
Hello, is Mr. Sheng there?

340
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,560
You want to talk to Mr. Sheng?

341
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:37,520
He's not here.

342
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,140
Perhaps you can call back later?

343
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,680
Who's this?

344
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:41,930
Gu Lanshan.

345
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,140
And you are?

346
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,100
Anything I should pass along?

347
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,270
Oh, hi, Mrs. Sheng.

348
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,020
I'm Mr. Sheng's assistant.

349
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,350
Could you let him know

350
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,220
the shareholders are waiting?

351
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,310
Sure,

352
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,270
I'll tell him.

353
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,270
Why are you here?

354
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,220
I told you to rest.

355
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,560
I've been looking everywhere

356
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:04,890
for you.

357
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,180
And you didn't even put on a coat.

358
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:08,930
Here, cover up.

359
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,220
Is something going on at work?

360
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,140
No.

361
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,970
Your assistant called.

362
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,770
Sounded important.

363
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,890
I'm fine now. You should go.

364
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,470
Are you trying to get rid of me?

365
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,520
Fine.

366
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,390
I'll go.

367
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,140
I'm really leaving.

368
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,720
One more step, and I'm out the door.

369
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,560
Remember to take your medicine.

370
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:12,640
Huan.

371
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,060
Coming.

372
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,850
Show me the menu.

373
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,060
[Menu]

374
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,310
Alright.

375
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,270
Don't forget Chu's meds.

376
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,890
Every six hours.

377
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,350
There are

378
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,390
three hours left.

379
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,350
Got it, I've noted it all down.

380
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,970
Really? You sure?

381
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:34,890
You don't believe me.

382
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,180
Let me ask you.

383
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,270
What's at 1 PM?

384
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,390
Do Lanshan's laundry.

385
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:41,470
And 1:30 PM?

386
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,390
Deliver coffee.

387
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,390
And 3:30 PM?

388
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,470
Afternoon tea.

389
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,680
See?

390
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,310
It's not on the list.

391
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,890
I haven't written it yet.

392
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,390
Okay, check it yourself.

393
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:58,600
Just a heads-up,

394
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,600
you should set an alarm

395
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,640
and jot everything down

396
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,720
so you don't forget.

397
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,520
Got it, I'll do it right now.

398
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,680
Don't worry.

399
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:06,970
She's in good hands.

400
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,470
Other women get clingy

401
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,810
when they're sick.

402
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,470
You, on the other hand,

403
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,850
just want me gone.

404
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,430
You just want me gone.

405
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:26,430
I...

406
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,600
Mr. Sheng.

407
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,140
Mr. Sheng, you finally made it.

408
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,430
The execs are about to blow up.

409
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,560
Call my house again,

410
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,100
and you're out.

411
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,770
Lanshan, your sister's here to see you.

412
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,060
My sister's here?

413
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,720
Could you greet her?

414
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:49,770
I'll be down soon.

415
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:50,640
Sure.

416
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,520
This place is pretty spacious.

417
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:07,930
Shwenny really went all out

418
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:08,810
for Shan.

419
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:09,720
Shan.

420
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:10,930
Hey, guys.

421
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,180
I had a hunch

422
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,470
you were sick,

423
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,560
so I brought everyone to check on you.

424
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,100
Fanhua mentioned it.

425
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,270
Shan,

426
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:22,640
how are you feeling?

427
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,310
Much better, thanks.

428
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,310
That's good.

429
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,310
Let's sit.

430
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,270
Come.

431
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,220
It's my first time here.

432
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:31,850
I heard this is

433
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,560
Sheng Shi's favorite spot.

434
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,390
Yeah.

435
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:35,680
Have you noticed

436
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:36,680
this place is very close

437
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:37,680
to our high school?

438
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:40,850
Shan,

439
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:43,140
since I'm here, can I ask you a favor?

440
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,020
Can I borrow some

441
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,100
old photos?

442
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,180
I want to use them

443
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,270
for the wedding.

444
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,270
Sure, I'll grab them.

445
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,310
Take a seat.

446
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:56,930
Given the projected returns,

447
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,680
we could make a killing

448
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,180
on this land.

449
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,060
Mr. Sheng, the market's shaky.

450
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,850
We should focus on stability.

451
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,060
It's not a good time

452
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,020

If we don't follow,

456
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:16,310
we might lose out.

457
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,600
Mr. Sheng, what do you think?

The meeting's over.

462
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,850
I'm excited to see those photos.

463
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,220
Here they are.

464
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,270
Thank you, Shan.

465
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,020
Thank you.

466
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:45,140
Look at you when you were little.

467
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,810
I'll grab some fruit.

468
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:49,520
Am I in any of these?

469
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:49,890

Are you sick?

472
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,930
No, just a tickle in my nose.

473
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:01,720
Are you sure you're not sick

474
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:02,350
or burning up?

475
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,390
I'm fine.

476
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,850
Don't make a fuss.

477
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:05,810
You don't seem fine.

00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:06,770
Let's get you checked out.

479
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,180
I'm okay. Let's just enjoy the photos.

480
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,850
