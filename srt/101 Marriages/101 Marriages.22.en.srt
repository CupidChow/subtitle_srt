20
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,580
Every step you take

21
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,790
makes me want to
run the rest of the way to you.

22
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,250
But maybe I should

23
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,200
stay out of your life.

24
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,700
So...

25
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,330
did something happen last night?

26
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,330
Otherwise, how do you explain this?

27
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,870
She's got...

28
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,700
a boyfriend now.

Lanshan has a boyfriend?

And you still...

31
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,370
Let me get this straight.

32
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,910
You're here,

33
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,120
Lanshan is here,

34

and here, someone...

35

she's dating now.

36
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,500
You two used to be married,

37
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,950
and they're currently together.

38
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,620
When you saw each other again,

39
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,040
sparks flew.

But now,

42
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,540
you see a chance.

43
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,750
However,

44
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,290
you know you should step back.

45
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,540
You're torn.

46
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,200

is how she feels about him.

53

62

Which one first?

64
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,700
Neither.

65
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,540
Come on, don't be like that.

66

Good news first.

And the bad news?

72
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,200
Our magazine

73
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,660
is shifting focus.

74
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,950
We're covering
more community issues now,

75
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,500
like urban renewal in older districts.

76
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,660
Urban renewal?

77
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,450
Yes.

78
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,160
Look.

79
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,250
Lin County

80
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,540

00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,250
You need to head there right away

82
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:56,750
and nail this report

83
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,330
so we can make the switch.

84
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,950
Alright, I'll go now.

Do you know how hard it was

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,250
for me to walk away from her?

91
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,330
I really want to

92
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,160
knock some sense into you.

93
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,080
I took a huge risk investing in you

94
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,370
because of her.

95
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,120
If it wasn't for her being with you,

96
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,040
you'd be nothing to me.

97
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,040
Absolutely nothing.

98
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:12,790
Get up!

99
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,870
Do you even have a conscience?

100
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,290
When you were down,

101
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,080
En left you,

102
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,660
but how did Chu treat you?

103
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,580
Do you deserve her?

104
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,620
I've wanted to punch you for ten years.

105
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,120
You're not worth her time,

106
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,870
and you'll never make her happy.

107
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,120
If I'd known you were like this,

108
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,700
I'd never have let her go.

109
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,790
He's not involved with your ex-wife.

110
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,330
I've been with Chengchi for a long time,

111
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,750
and I've never seen him

112
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,540
with Gu Lanshan.

113
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,580
There's never been any talk

114
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,200
of them being close.

115
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,700
Is that true?

116
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:00,870
Shwenny,

117
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,160
there's nothing between me and Shan.

118
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,000
Then why didn't you deny it

119
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,330
when I asked?

120
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,250
I was desperate.

121
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,450
I knew there was no way

122
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,870
you would help me

123
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,750
unless it involved her.

124
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,790
So I let you misunderstand

125
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,160
on purpose.

126
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,500

00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,750
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,620
I'm sorry.

129
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,660
You don't need to apologize.

130
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,000
The mistake was mine...

131
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,580
thinking she'd stay with you.

132
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I kept her waiting so long!

133
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,330
I was a fool.

134
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,950
I was a fool!

135

202
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,390
Yeah, a bit.

213
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,600
I've been meaning to say,

214
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,270
but I've always

215
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,890
held back.

224

forcing you

225
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:02,850
to marry me,

226
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,600
and then

227
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,350
not treating you well after.

228
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,930
I'm such a bad person.

229
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,310
If I were you,

230
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,680

That's not true.

I was too proud.

237
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:37,720
I always thought

238
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,810
I was better than him.

239
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,350
But why did you only like him

240
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,970
and not me?

241
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,810
So I married you

242
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,220
out of spite.

243
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,600
But even after we got married,

244
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,350
you never forgot him.

245
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,890
I could see you didn't really

246
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,350
care about me.

247
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,470
So I took it out on you

248
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:07,890
because it hurt.

What I don't regret

253
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,560
