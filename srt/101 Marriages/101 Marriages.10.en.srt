00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,040
Why not?

196
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,330
Because it was a one-sided crush.

197
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,700
He loved someone else.

198
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,040
He loved her very, very much.

199
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,500
Was it Han Chengchi?

200
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,540
Yes.

201
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:06,250
But he's my brother-in-law.

202
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,080
He belongs to my sister, En.

203
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,290
So I've kept my feelings

204
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,330
to myself.

205
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,000
What's so special about Han Chengchi?

206
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,620
Why do you like him so much?

207
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,410
I guess...

208
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,580
it's because he saved my life.

209
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,370
Saved your life? How?

210
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,330
He took a knife for me.

211
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,450
Took a knife?

212
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
When did this happen?

213
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,580
Back when we were in school.

214
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:43,370
I got cornered

215
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,250
- by some thugs.
- Don't go, pretty girl.

216
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,540
Give me your number. Don't leave.

217
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,830
She's got some attitude.

218
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,500
- En, please answer the phone.
- Hello.

219
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:52,660
The number

220
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,120
- Why isn't she answering?
- you dialed is busy now,

221
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,790
- Please pick up.
- please try again later.

222
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,370
Pretty girl.

223
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:02,120
Why are you running? Let's chat.

224
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,830
Where do you think you're going?

225
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,370
Run, go ahead.

226
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,370
Run, little girl.

227
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,290
I swung my school bag...

228
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,410
I...

229
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,410
I tried to fight back.

230
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,910
Put your clothes back on.

231
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,120
And then...

232
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,620
And then I fought back,

233
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,120
but there were too many of them.

234
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,160
They pinned me down

235
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,080
and started

236
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,540
ripping my clothes.

237
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,540
I thought I was done for.

238
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,950
I've only felt true despair

239
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,910
three times in my life.

240
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,910
The first

241
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,000
was when my mom left me.

242
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,830
The second

243
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,290
was that night.

244
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,040
I was sure

245
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,950
I was going to die.

246
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,120
But then

247
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,290
Chengchi appeared out of nowhere.

248
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,700
And he just

249
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,000
kicked them off me.

250
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:14,750
And then?

251
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,080
And then...

252
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,000
Brat.

253
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,700
One of them got really angry

254
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:37,370
and pulled out a knife.

255
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:44,290
I heard someone shout "watch out,"

256
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,790
and I was in someone's arms.

257
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,700
It was Chengchi.

258
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,620
He took the knife for me.

259
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:58,200
The sound of the blade going in...

260
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,870
it's quiet,

261
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,290
but it haunts me

262
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,160
whenever I close my eyes.

263
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,910
I'd wake up in a cold sweat

264
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,830
and think of Chengchi.

265
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,700
You really believe

266
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,700
Han Chengchi saved you?

267
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:17,910
It was him.

268
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,370
He saved me.

269
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,290
He was the only one there.

270
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,250
I remember

271
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,910
the black letters on his white shirt.

272
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,250
When I visited him in the hospital,

273
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,620
he was wearing

274
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,120
that same shirt.

275
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,790
You know,

276
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,370
I was so touched.

277
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,540
It made me feel warm inside.

278
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:40,160
After my mom left me,

279
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:43,040
I felt so alone,

280
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,120
like no one cared.

281
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,160
I felt safe for the first time

282
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,080
in a long while

283
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,250
when he risked his life for me.

284
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,370
So,

285
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,910
even if

286
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,120
he never feels

287
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,580
the same way about me,

288
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,870
I'll always

289
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,750
be grateful.

290
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,500
I, Ye Chu,

291
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,750
owe him my life,

292
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,910
and I can never repay that.

293
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,540
So just because he saved you,

294
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,450
you fell for him?

295
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,200
Right?

296
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,040
Chu.

297
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,540
What are you doing?

298
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,790
Slow down.

299
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,290
Slow down, slow...

300
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,000
What are you doing?

301
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,870
Why are you getting so worked up?

302
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,790
Save it when we're back home,

303
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:51,330
not here.

304
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,290
Who are you?

305
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,160
Who am I? You tell me.

306
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,120
Shwenny,

307
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,200
what are you doing out here?

308
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:05,330
Why didn't you come to find me sooner?

309
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,040
I've been waiting for you.

310
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,250
I missed you so much.

311
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:13,750
How could you leave me for so long?

312
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,290
I don't like Sheng Shi.

313
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,870
I like Shwenny.

314
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,370
Only me, huh?

315
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,910
Let's go inside, okay?

316
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,330
Let's go to bed.

317
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,660
That's enough.

318
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,370
Wait,

319
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,290
you're not Shwenny.

320
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,250
Shwenny is nice to me.

321
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,370
My Shwenny would never hurt me.

322
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,120
I was the one who bullied him.

323
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,620
My Shwenny is gone.
He's never coming back.

324
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,500
Your Shwenny is still here.

325
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,290
He hasn't left.

326
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:36,330
Stop.

327
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,040
Don't call me Chu.

328
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,410
You're not Shwenny.

329
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,540
Don't call me that.

330
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,160
- Chu, take a good look.
- Hey.

331
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,200
Stay away from me. You're not him.

332
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,290
I told you not to call me that!

333
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,160
Okay, okay.

334
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,120
I won't.

335
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,330
I'm not Shwenny.

336
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,910
Let's go inside.

337
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,700
Do you know how much I miss you?

338
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:01,120
I've wanted to tell you how I feel,

339
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,830
but you're not my Shwenny anymore.

340
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,500
You used to be so good to me,

341
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,040
but then you turned on me

342
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,120
just like my foster mom and Wang Jiayi.

343
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:15,660
Do you know the third time

344
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,080
I felt true despair?

told me

348
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,040
you paid 50 million
to get me out of the Gu family.

349
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,040
You once told me

350
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,370
our marriage wasn't a mistake.

351
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:41,160
But instead of helping me,

00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,950
you...

353
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,540
you tried to

354
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,750
get rid of my feelings for Chengchi

355
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,660
by treating me like some object,

356
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,370
just like what they did to me.

357
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,450
You didn't care about
what I wanted at all.

358
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,040
I just wanted to take you away
from that place

359

anything I wanted.

365
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,160
I had to give up.

366
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,580
I gave up on the person I loved

367
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,990
and buried my feelings.

00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,830
The truth is,

385
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,870
the person who took the knife for you

386
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,870
wasn't Han Chengchi

387
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,290
or Sheng Shi.

388
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,160
It was Shwenny,

389
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,950
the one you care about most.

390
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,160
And that night I came to your room,

391
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,540
I didn't do anything.

392
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,410
I was just trying to protect you,

393
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,580
to get you away from the Gu family.

394
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,240
I wasn't planning on

395
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,660
telling you the truth.

396
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,120
You've been loving the wrong person.

397
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,870
Knowing that

398
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,990
would break your heart.

You're right.

402
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,740
Sheng Shi doesn't deserve you.

403
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,240
Shwenny does.

404
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:36,620
I'll bring him back.

405
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,740
Let's go back to how things used to be.

406
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,330
When you wake up,

407
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,910
the Shwenny

408
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,200
who loved

409
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,240
and protected you

410
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,370
will be here.

411
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,120
I promise.

Now, get some rest.

415
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,370
I told you

416
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,160
I've got personal stuff to handle today.

417
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,990
Cancel everything.

418
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,580
Seriously, drop it.

419
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,740
You're awake.

420
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,540
How's your head? Still hurting?

421
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,790
I told you to

422
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:10,740
go easy on the drinks.

423
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,740
It's bad for your memory.

424
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,990
I'm starving. Got any food?

425
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,330
Of course.

426
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,910
Go freshen up.
I'll get everything ready.

427
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,990
I'll get you anything you want.

428
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,540
Here.

429
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,950
Sit down.

430
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:51,620
You can answer it.

431
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,080
It's nothing.

432
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,660
Where do you want to go today?

433
00:23:58,790 --> 00:23:59,580
It's a nice day out.

434
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,240
I'll take you anywhere.

435
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:06,720
Hello.

436
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:07,040
Hello.

437
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,580
Mrs. Sheng, hello.

438
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,410
I'm very sorry

439
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,870
to bother you.

440
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,160
There's an important meeting today.

441
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,330
Mr. Sheng needs to be there.

442
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,160
I see.

443
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:19,700
So, anywhere I want, right?

444
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,950
Anywhere you like.

445
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,330
Let's go to your office, then.

446
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,240
I thought you said anywhere.

447
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:29,740
I heard there's a great shopping street

448
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,410
near your office.

449
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,410
After you're done,

450
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:33,700
you can take me shopping.

451
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,370
Alright.

452
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,660
Let's grab lunch there, too.

453
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:39,950
I've heard there are some great spots.

454
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,290
We'll see.

455
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,620
They've got this place

456
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,580
called Bai Fu Banquet

457
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,950
with tons of options.

458
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,580
Sichuan, Cantonese,

459
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,620
and even Western food.

460
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,620
You're already thinking about
the next meal

461
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,330
before we're done with this one?

462
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:54,990
Alright, I'll stop.

463
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,830
- Let's just finish up here.
- Dig in.

464
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,790
Eat up so we can head out.

465
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,410
- Mr. Sheng.
- Mr. Sheng.

466
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:16,790
So,

467
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,740
what do you think of the renovations?

468
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,240
Not bad.

469
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,160
But

470
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,490
it could use a couple of orange cuties.

471
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:41,870
You heard her.

472
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:43,790
Get some big orange plants in here.

473
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,330
I meant orange cats.

474
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,200
Oh, orange cats.

475
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,580
Sorry. I get you now.

476
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,990
Get some big orange cats in here.

477
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,410
We need some lucky cats.

478
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:57,910
Of course.

479
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,040
What's a place without some lucky cats?

480
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,950
Got it. I'm on it.

481
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:00,990
Hurry up.

482
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,700
Any other suggestions?

483
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,160
If you see anything off, just fix it.

484
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,540
Nope,

485
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,580
too much work.

486
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,790
Alright, alright.

487
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:15,990
We'll do it your way.

488
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,660
Let's head upstairs.

489
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,540
Don't forget

490
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:24,620
the cats!

491
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,240
Mr. Sheng, you're here.

492
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,080
Looks like Mrs. Sheng worked her magic.

493
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:32,990
Lanshan,

494
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,040
this is a surprise.

495
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:35,830
So,

496
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,450
you're actually interested

497
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,700
in our spokesperson now?

498
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,040
So that's what this is about.

499
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:42,700
Yeah.

500
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,700
Why not?

501
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,160
Sure thing.

502
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:47,660
Long time no see.

503
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:48,950
Want me to read your fortune?

504
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:55,040
You're getting clever.

505
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,120
Couldn't call,

506
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,830
so you added my wife on WeChat?

507
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,240
You trying to get fired?

508
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,990
No, Mr. Sheng.

509
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,910
Stop giving your assistant a hard time.

510
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:04,950
Making everyone wait

511
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,160
is on you.

512
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:09,080
I didn't.

513
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:12,330
Just giving her some praise.

514
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,540
Right?

515
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,160
Yes, exactly.

516
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,620
If she's that good,

517
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,450
maybe she deserves a raise.

518
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,740
Thank you, Mrs. Sheng.

519
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,290
No, um...

520
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:24,700
I'm just doing my job.

521
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,990
No need for extra pay.

522
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,830
It's my duty.

523
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,240
You coming to the meeting?

524
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,870
If you get bored,

525
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,410
feel free to leave anytime.

526
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,080
Let's go.

527
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:46,700
Are you sure you're not pregnant?

528
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:49,240
Soaking up all this couple time.

529
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,910
And by the way,

530
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,620
sit next to Lanshan.

531
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,450
You don't want to see anyone

532
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:00,200
lose their job over a seating mistake.

533
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:19,330
En.

534
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:26,290
You didn't need to come.

535
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,330
It's dusty here.

536
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,290
I told you

537
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:32,290
I'd handle the decorating.

538
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:34,910
What?

539
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:36,950
Posting on social media again?

540
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:38,830
Come.

541
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:48,660
Mr. Lu, we've got some intel.

542
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,240
Keep an eye on

543
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:51,990
Han family stocks.

544
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,950
When they move, we'll be ready.

545
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:58,830
Looks like we're close to winning.

546
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:03,240
Mr. Sheng.

547
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,410
the first two phases
of the project are done,

548
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,450
and we're finalizing the third.

549
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,700
Here are the plans.

550
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,290
Okay, I understand.

551
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:11,620
Let me have a look.

552
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:37,660
Lanshan,

553
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,910
why not sit in

554
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,370
as Mrs. Sheng?

555
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,290
The vibe over there is too intense,

556
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,450
not my thing.

557
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,770
Based on the sales data
from the first two phases...

558
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:46,620
Lanshan,

559
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,990
here's a list of potential spokespeople.

560
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:50,290
Take a look.

561
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:52,120
The last thing on the agenda

562
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,790
is picking someone

563
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,450
for the shopping mall.

564
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,620
You've got a great eye,

565
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,240
so I'm sure

566
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,660
you'll make the right choice.

567
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,910
Finally, someone who understands.

568
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,520
[Liu Yiran]

569
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,120
She's perfect

570
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,370
among all of them.

571
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,660
Great rep,

572
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:19,370
huge fanbase.

573
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,080
I pick her.

574
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:23,490
I think she's better.

575
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:27,700
She's too new.

576
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:29,790
I doubt it.

577
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:31,620
We're choosing a spokesperson,

578
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,620
so we need to think about

579
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,450
their future potential.

580
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,700
Liu Yiran's latest song
blew up last month.

581
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,080
Are you serious?

582
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:40,240
She's both expensive and ineffective.

583
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:42,620
I'm betting on her.

584
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:43,830
Did my research.

585
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:44,790
Don't believe it?

586
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:46,120
Let's bet on it.

587
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,580
You're on.

588
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,740
I never lose.

589
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,410
Aili.

590
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,450
En. Chengchi.

591
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,240
What brings you here?

592
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,160
Just pick out some

593
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,290
casual clothes for En.

594
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,620
We're heading

595
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,080
to the amusement park later.

596
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:09,370
Saw your couple post earlier,

597
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,790
and now you're here

598
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,830
showing off in person?

599
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:14,580
We're not.

600
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:16,240
Great timing.

601
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:17,540
I've got some new casual sportswear

602
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,580
that's perfect for you.

603
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,740
Let me grab them for you.
