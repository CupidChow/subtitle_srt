birthdays, parties,

191
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,370
always expecting gifts.

192
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,580
You don't have to.

193
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,250
If I don't,

194
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,120
they'll talk behind my back.

195
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,370
Oh, isn't that Mr. Han?

196
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:52,830
Let me introduce you.

197
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,410
This is my wife, Gu En.

198
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:55,870
Oh wait,

199
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,490
you two already know each other.

200
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,540
Mr. Lu.

201
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:00,830
Pleasure to meet you.

202
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,950
Quite the company you're keeping

203
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,740
with that celebrity.

204
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,330
I have to thank you.

205
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,700
Wouldn't be here

206
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,870
without your help.

207
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,370
Chengchi, let's go.

208
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,240
We've got a party to catch.

209
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,040
Mr. Lu,

210
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,160
see you around.

211
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,410
Take care.

212
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,290
And don't you

213
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:53,200
forget who you are.

214
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,410
Stay in your lane.

215
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,580
Looks like

216
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,200
you could use some sugar.

217
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,160
Sorry, Miss Liu.

218
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,080
Adding anything

219
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,580
would mess with the taste.

220
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,450
You're right.

221
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,410
Blue Mountain coffee
has that perfect balance

222
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,540
of acidity, sweetness,

223
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,910
and richness.

224
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,740
Sugar

225
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,330
would just ruin it.

226
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,370
Do you know

227
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,330
why I ordered this coffee?

228
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,120
I've been abroad,

229
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,330
so I don't really know much about you.

230
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,040
Doesn't matter.

231
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,410
You don't have to know.

232
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,660
I'm just going through the motions.

233
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,160
What do you mean?

234
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,450
It means he's not into women.

235
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,950
Dating, marriage,

236
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,660
it's all just for show.

237
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,910
Hi, I'm his ex-wife,

238
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,040
Gu Lanshan.

239
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,950
She...?

240
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,080
Sorry

241
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,240
for the interruption,

242
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,040
but I couldn't resist.

243
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:10,910
I saw this trash

244
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,410
messing with another girl

245
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,330
and had to step in.

246
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:16,830
Mr. Sheng,

247
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,740
your true love is outside,

248
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:20,950
crying his eyes out.

249
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,870
Shouldn't you be comforting him?

250
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,540
Mr. Sheng,

251
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,580
care to explain?

252
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:38,910
No, I...

253
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,830
You know what?

254
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,620
We were married for years.

255
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,580
Never had kids,

256
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,660
and now we're divorced.

257
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,120
You get it, right?

258
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,160
Is that true?

259
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:09,990
You know,

260
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,540
everyone has things

261
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,700
they'd rather keep hidden.

262
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,080
What?

263
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,080
Miss,

264
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:23,330
some things should be respected.

265
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,240
You're right.

266
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,080
I respect it.

267
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,660
But please,

268
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,830
stop hurting other women.

269
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,580
I'll explain everything to my parents.

270
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:37,830
Miss Liu...

271
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,040
Don't worry.

272
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,120
I will not

273
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:45,870
say a word.

274
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,120
Thanks for today,

275
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,700
you made the right choice.

276
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,660
Sorry about that.

277
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,620
I just happened to be nearby

278
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,950
and saw you on a date.

279
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,620
You didn't

280
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,580
seem into her.

281
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,450
I...

282
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,410
You also

283
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,330
looked stuck,

284
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:18,540
so I...

285
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,370
Consider this

286
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,160
a thank you for helping with Mo.

287
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,620
Shouldn't you be treating me to dinner

288
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,040
to say thanks?

289
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,490
Dinner?

290
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,120
Sure.

291
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,040
There's a new crawfish spot.

292
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,080
It's a 24-hour restaurant. Very nice.

293
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:57,080
So, dinner on you?

294
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,160
Sounds good.

295
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,120
Let's go.

296
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,450
I want solutions,

297
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,490
not excuses!

298
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,740
Figure out how to
get our stock price up.

299
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,740
I don't need you telling me the obvious.

300
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:32,040
We've lost billions.

301
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:33,990
Are you trying to sink this company?

302
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,040
I want a plan or your resignation

303
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,450
on my desk tomorrow.

304
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,490
Mom, what's going on with the company?

305
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,870
You tell me.

306
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,450
I told you to get Lu Yifan

307
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,740
to invest.

308
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,830
Where is the money?

309
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:49,370
Mom,

310
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,700
I don't think Lu Yifan
is going to help us.

311
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,910
Then what kind of wife are you?

312
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,870
Take some time to think.

313
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,490
You need to stop lounging around

314
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,740
and figure out

315
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,490
how to help this company.

316
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:45,830
Do you think

317
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,240
if you can't find anyone else,

318
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,450
you'll blame me?

319
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,830
With my charm?

320
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,700
Finding someone won't be an issue.

321
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,490
So, you're planning on more dates?

322
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,660
No,

323
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,870
I dodge them when I can,

324
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:02,120
but today, my mom insisted.

325
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,450
If it happens again,

326
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,200
I can always step in.

327
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:07,950
Deal.

328
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,830
I'll bring you to all of them.

329
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,080
I'm so full.

330
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:31,870
Let's go.

331
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,790
Where to?

332
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,540
Home.

333
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,200
I'll take you.

334
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,910
You're really eager to send me off, huh?

335
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:45,160
Don't you have anything to say?

336
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:47,200
Actually, yes.

337
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:48,160
What?

338
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,790
Want to pack this up?

339
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,160
feels wasteful to leave it.

340
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,580
Excuse me, can we get this to go?

341
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:04,910
TV advice isn't working.

342
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,580
Maybe I need to be more direct.

343
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,540
This spot's nice.

344
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,200
Want to take a selfie?

345
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:14,910
Sure.

346
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,120

Exactly.

367

Mom.

Finally home.

369

Chengchi.

Mom,

372
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,620
don't worry.

373
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,660
I'll get back

374
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,490
everything we lost, bit by bit.

375
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,240
It's all your fault.

376
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,870
You went too far

377
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,870
and embarrassed me.

378
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:46,790
Fine.

379
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:47,790
My fault,

380
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,330
all of it.

381
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,160
You're not wrong at all.

382
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,080
What's wrong with you today?

383
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:55,240
You were...

384
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:58,620
really forward today,
caught me off guard.

385
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,660
I realized I was too forward.

386
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:06,450
So,

387
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:08,450
what now?

388
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:12,330
Is it too late to apologize?

389
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,950
Wretch.

390
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,830
Stupid Shwenny.

391
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:20,370
Retarded Shwenny.

392
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,160
What's got you

393
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,040
so worked up today?

394
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:27,990
Alright, calm down.

395
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:29,700
I'll take you home.

396
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,240
Home, home,

397
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:33,240
always sending me home.

398
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,580
Back home, huh?

399
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:44,080
I'm not giving up on us yet.

400
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:45,830
What are you mumbling about?

401
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,160
Back home, right now.

402
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:49,450
Now. Right away.

403
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:51,410
Let's go home.

404
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,910
Unbelievable.

405
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,410
I've done so much for them,

406
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,990
and while they're out

407
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:04,790
eating fancy food,

408
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:06,490
I'm stuck with a burger.

409
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,830
Stop the drama.

410
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:23,450
Do you think they'll get back together?

411
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,370
With all the jealousy flying around,

412
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,240
if they don't,

413
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,660
I'll drag him to the eye doctor.

414
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:31,990
You've got your own issues to deal with.

415
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,530
Stop worrying about them.

416
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,620
Since you're home,

417
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,780
I'm out of here.

418
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:44,950
Aren't you coming up?

419
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,530
I'll just leave you here...

420
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,080
this time.

421
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,080
Maybe next time.

422
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,490
You said you'd come home with me today.

423
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,700
Did I?

424
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,120
I twisted my ankle.

425
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,410
At least help a lady out
and walk me home.

426
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,830
Alright, alright, I'll take you home.

427
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:16,950
I'll take you home.

428
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,280
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

429
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,450
Shwenny. Lanshan.

430
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:26,950
Auntie.

431
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:29,450
What happened to your ankle?

432
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:30,950
Nothing.

433
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:32,870
Just a little twist.

434
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,410
Chengchi's been busy,

435
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:36,490
so he asked me

436
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,660
to check on you.

437
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:41,830
Alright, you two talk.

438
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:42,780
I'm leaving.

439
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:43,580
Okay.

440
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,200
Lanshan.

441
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:47,830
- Wait.
- Lanshan.

442
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,450
I've got great news!

443
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,280
Chengchi

444
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:52,490
bought back our villa.

445
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,490
and we've already

446
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,910
moved back in.

447
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,160
Isn't that great?

448
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:57,490
Congratulations, Auntie.

449
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:58,490
Thank you.

450
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:01,450
We really appreciate
everything you've done.

451
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,910
I got you a little something.

452
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:05,280
This skincare brand is amazing.

453
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,530
It was...

454
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,490
Never mind.

455
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,660
My skin feels

456
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,370
so much better after using it,

457
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,780
so I had to get you some too.

458
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:14,910
Thank you, Auntie.

459
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,620
No need to thank me.

460
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:17,660
It's just

461
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,620
a small gift from Chengchi and me.

462
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,120
You have to take it.

463
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:25,030
Why the long face?

464
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:27,200
I'm fine.

465
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:29,030
