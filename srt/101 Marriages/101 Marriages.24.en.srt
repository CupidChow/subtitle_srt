00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,160

and you both,

103
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,700

Please give me another chance.

105
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,790

106
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,580
I saw it with my own eyes.

107
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,000
Are you saying I imagined it?

108
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,370
Lanshan,

109
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,870
we can forgive many things,

110
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,000
but as our family's daughter-in-law,

111
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,540
you need to be above reproach.

112
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,160
You should leave.

113
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,580
What are you doing?

114
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,370

115
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,250
Mom,

116
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,160
at first,

117
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,870
I thought Shwenny forced

118
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,950
and betrayed me,

119
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,250
but I realized

120
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,450
I fell in love with him first.

121
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,200
Only with him

122
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,330
can I be my true self.

123
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,040
But later,

124
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,620
I hurt him

125
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,500
out of my own foolishness,

126
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,910
leading to us falling apart.

127
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,700
I don't want to lose him again

128
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,000
because of it.

129
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,540
Dad, Mom,

130
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,080
I love him so much,

131
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,580
I'd give my life for him.

132
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,870
Chu!

133
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,580
What's going on?

134
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,200
Mom, Dad,

135
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:41,790
Chu means everything to me.

136
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm begging you,

137
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,830
please let us be together.

138
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,700
I can't live without her.

139
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000

The baby was born with severe issues.

144
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,540
Chu didn't tell us because

145
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,870
she didn't want to hurt us more.

146
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,160
She ended her pregnancy

147
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,790
and carried that burden alone.

148
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,250
Mom,

149
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,000
we'll have more children,

150
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,700
lots of them.

151
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,830
Even so,

152
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,370
what happened between you
and Han Chengchi

153
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,290
is still a fact.

Dad,

155
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,290
I just met with En.

156
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,910
You've misunderstood Chu.

157
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,040
Listen to this

158
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,500

159
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,500

My mom drugged him,

163
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,790
and he mistook her for me.

164
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,580
That's why it happened.

165
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,700
Please forgive Shan.

166
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,870
It wasn't her fault.

I'm sorry,

169
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,870
Shwenny.

00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,450
Thank you for telling me.

171
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,700
Shwenny,

172
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,870
do you really

173
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,250
only care about Lanshan?

174
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,040
Yes.

175
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,200
This kid's a true romantic.

176
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,330
Takes after me.

177
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:21,950
Dear,

178
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:23,950
if it was a misunderstanding

179
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,000
and they love each other so much,

180
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,450
it's not right for us

181
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,200
to stand in the way.

182
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,080
Let them be.

183
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,540

184
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,540

185
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,660
I'm packing up to go home.

186
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,750
Let me help you pack.

187
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,790
Thanks, Dad.

188
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,160
Thanks, Mom.

189
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,080
Mr. Han,

190
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,950
there's a Mrs. Gu here to see you.

191
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,080
Mrs. Gu?

192
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,370
What a surprise.

193
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,620

00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,240
when I first met you,

385
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,950
you called me a country bumpkin.

386
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,700
I hated you

387
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,540
for being

388
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,240
so arrogant and cocky.

389
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,370
But that same arrogance

390
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,870
let you put up with my stubbornness.

391
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,450
You told everyone

392
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,740
not to mess with Gu Lanshan.

393
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,080
Why are you picking on Gu Lanshan?

394
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:12,370
She's my wife.

395
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,370
and I won't let anyone
hurt or slander her!

396
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:15,240
Do you understand?

397
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:17,620
Gu Lanshan is someone
you shouldn't mess with.

398
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,290
I suggest you get rid of

399
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:21,080
any bad ideas you have.

400
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,910
Trying to mess with my wife?

401
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,040
Did I ever touch you?

402
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,870
Miss Gu,

403
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,410
if you want to

404
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,290
test your man's love,

405
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,160
find another way.

406
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,740
Don't drag my wife into it.

407
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,910
I thought...

408
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:37,700
you looked pretty cool.

409
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,790
You knew I was afraid of the dark,

410
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,200
so you'd come up with

411
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,540
all kinds of excuses to walk me home.

412
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,120
And it is you

413
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,370
on so many nights,

414
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,990
who lighted the way for me,

415
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,910
pushing away the darkness.

416
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,490
I realized

417
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,620
the brightest light in my life

418
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,240
has always been you.

419
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,330
I used to think

420
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,080
I must've done something incredible

421
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,950
in a past life

422
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,410
to be lucky enough

423
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,370
to have you as a friend.

424
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,950
But then, suddenly,

425
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,290
I became your girl.

426
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,990
And people started saying

427
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,040
you bought me like I was for sale.

428
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,080
That hurt.

429
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,740
I couldn't accept it.

430
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:33,700
How could you treat me like a commodity?

431
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,830
You know I hate that.

432
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,660
It felt like you were
tearing open old wounds.

433
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,120
But then,

434
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,040
when Mo was in the hospital,

435
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,660
you told me

436
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,240
[Inpatient]

437
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,120
you'd only save him

438
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,950
if I married you.

439
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,490
Shwenny,

440
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:57,200
we've been through
so many misunderstandings,

441
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,580
slanders,

442
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,330
and so much hurt.

443
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,240
I almost

444
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:05,330
lost you forever.

445
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,540
But we've grown through it all.

446
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,540
We've learned how to

447
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,700
really love each other.

448
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,830
Without these ups and downs,

449
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,950
I might never have realized

450
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,830
how much you love me,

451
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,290
or...

452
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,990
how much I love you.

453
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,290
Some memories aren't great,

454
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,120
but they're ours,

455
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,830
and they mean everything.

456
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,790
I'm so glad

457
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,410
you're still here with me.

458
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,790
You've been my light,

459
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,410
and now,

460
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,120
I want to be yours.

461
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,040
I'll stay by your side.

462
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,990
You said in your letter

463
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,790
that you've fought for me
a hundred times.

464
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:56,160
Well,

465
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:59,160
this time, the 101st time,

466
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,040
let me fight for you.

467
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,540
Shwenny,

468
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,790
I'm going to steal you away

469
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:14,950
from everyone else.

470
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,410
I want to spend my life with you.

471
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,620
Marry me.

472
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,950
I will.

473
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,700
So, will you finally say yes?

474
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:52,490
Put the ring on.
