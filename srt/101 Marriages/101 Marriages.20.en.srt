00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,870
I begged them to invest,

but none of them responded.

Now, we're doing great,

00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,500
they want to share the cake.

168
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,950

00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,870
Alright.

171
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,000
Used to be,

172
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,790
chasing a girl was tough for a guy,

173
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,370
but easy for a girl.

174
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,580
Now, it's not the same.

175
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,700
You just don't get it.

176
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,290
Back in the day,

177
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,830
when a girl made the first move,

178
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,450
she'd keep pushing no matter what.

179
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,870
But now,

180
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,700
if she doesn't get a reaction,

181
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,870
guess what?

182
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:36,950
What?

183
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,790
She gives up!

184
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,120
That's why nowadays

185
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,040
if a girl wants to get a guy,

186
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,790
she needs to keep at it.

187
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,870
If it doesn't work the first time,

188
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,000
try again.

189
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,750
And again.

190
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,290
And again.

191
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,830

even an iron tree can bloom eventually,

193
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,330
especially with a charming girl
doing the chasing.

194
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,060
So you were eating.

195
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,270
While I was eating,

196
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,220
a big guy sat down at the next table.

197
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,180
[Hotel Hot Spring - Mixed Bath]

198
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,790
I just want to soak in the hot springs.

199
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,000
It's a rare chance,

200
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,580
and missing out would be such a shame.

201
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,750
You've got low blood sugar, right?

202
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:47,040
Going to the hot springs alone
could be risky.

203
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,870
You should really
take a friend with you,

204
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,080
just in case something happens.

205
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,540
But I'm here alone.

206
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,160
I don't have any friends.

207
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,080
Well...

208
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,620
Why isn't he out yet?

209
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,620
Maybe he didn't hear me.

210
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,870
It's fine.

211
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,620
You have security

212
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,330
and first aid on-site, right?

213
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,370
I'll be okay.

214
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,540
I still wouldn't

215
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,250
recommend going by yourself.

216
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,200
Alright, I'll get ready.

217
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:29,540
It's fine, really.

218
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,660
Chu has low blood sugar?

219
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,080
She's going to the hot springs alone?

220
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,790
We don't know

221
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,330
where Lanshan and Shwenny

222
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,700
were staying.

223
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:27,950
You have no idea.

224
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,040
Only someone

225
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,000
as charming and brilliant as me,

226
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,290
with the best instincts around,
could figure that out.

227
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,370
Excuse me,

228
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,370
could you check the room numbers

229
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,200
for Sheng Shi and Gu Lanshan?

230
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:46,410
Sorry, sir,

231
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,580
we can't disclose guest information.

232
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,580
I'll give you another chance.

233
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:52,580
Mr. Ji.

234
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,370
Even if you're Mr. Ji,

235
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,370
we can't break the rules.

236
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,540
It's against the law.

237
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,700
I'm just asking for a room number.

238
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,450
How hard can it be?

239
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,120
Let's go

240
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,830
before we embarrass ourselves further.

241
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,700
It's my dad. Help me.

242
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,660
Uncle Ji.

243
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:13,200
Fanhua.

244
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,660
What are you doing here?

245
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,330
Where's that troublemaker? Is he here?

246
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,040
No.

247
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,700
He's been busy with something else.

248
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,870
He hasn't caused any trouble, has he?

249
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,040
Even if he did, it's no big deal.

250
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,580
Don't worry about it.

251
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,160
That's good.

252
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,950
I'll be on my way then.

253
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,120
Goodbye, Uncle Ji.

254
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:29,370
Goodbye.

255
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,700
He left.

256
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,500
That was close!

257
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,500
Almost got caught by him.

258
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,160
Where's the luggage?

259
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,200
Who are you two?

260
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,250
Don't mess with me on my turf!

261
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,540
You brat.

262
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,200
Think you can fool your old man?

263
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,500
Let's see how you get out of this one.

264
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,160
Dad,

265
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,950
maybe let me go first?

266
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,790
Take him!

267
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,290
No, wait!

268
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,330
Fanhua, help me!

269
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,500
Mr. Lu, weren't we here
to talk business?

270
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,330
Isn't this us talking business?

271
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,200
Lu Yifan.

272
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:47,870
Here you are.

273
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,950
Lu Yifan, it's one thing to fool around,

274
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,910
but bringing it here?

275
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,000
How is everyone going to see me?

276
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:56,870
Gu En,

277
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,700
marrying you

278
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,040
was already a charity on my part.

279
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,830
You think I need your permission

280
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,750
to fool around?

281
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,290
What about all those promises

282
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:11,750
when you proposed?

283
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,290
How old are you?

284
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,700
You actually believed that?

285
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,080
I married you

286
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:21,500
to make Han Chengchi miserable.

287
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,160
And sure, you're pretty,

288
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,540
so I figured I'd see

289
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,950
what his woman was like.

290
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,830
Turns out,

291
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,290
nothing special.

292
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,660
Besides looks,

293
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,500
you've got nothing.

294
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,040
You married me

295
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,540
because Han Chengchi went bankrupt

296
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,080
and couldn't give you a lavish life.

297
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:44,250
So,

298
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,870
you don't have the right to criticize me.

299
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,000
Gu En,

300
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:58,000
if you want to
keep your title as Mrs. Lu,

301
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,830
you better smarten up

302
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,040
and stay out of here

303
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,700
at this time of day.

304
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,000
Mr. Han, it's a pleasure
working with you.

305
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,500
Thanks for trusting us.

306
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,500
We won't let you down.

307
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,290
Alright.

308
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,040
- This way.
- Okay.

309
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,790
What's he doing there?

310
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,540
If I pretend to drown,

311
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,000
he'll definitely come.

312
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,450
No way he wouldn't.

313
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,870
You dressed like this because
you wanted to have fun, right?

314
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,290
Shwenny is over there reading.

315
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,870
What about Lanshan?

316
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,160
She's in the hot springs.

317
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,410
Looks like
we're just third-wheeling here.

318
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,540
I told you,

319
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,000
my instincts are spot-on.

320
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,450
Those two will definitely
get back together.

321
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,950
Finally, you got one right.

322
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:14,660
Let's go.

323
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,580
I'm drowning.

324
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:20,660
Help!

325
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,830
I'm drowning.

326
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:25,120
Oh no.

327
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,450
Help!

328
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,700
Help!

329
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,580
Lanshan, are you okay?

330
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,200
Liunian?

331
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:36,000
Yes, are you...?

332
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,750
What are you doing here?

333
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,250
Why is Ji Liunian here?

334
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,580
Just passing by.

335
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,200
Passing by?

336
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,830
Are you alright?

337
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,200
Enjoy your soak. I'll be going.

338
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:59,500
Are you kidding me?

339
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:04,870
You ruined a perfect plan again.

340
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,290
What plan?

341
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,500
Let's go. You'll catch a cold.

342
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,620
If a girl wants to get a guy,

343
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,330
she needs to keep at it.

344
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,160
If it doesn't work the first time,

345
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,750
try again.

346
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,450
And again.

347
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,870
And again.

348
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,660
Fancy running into you here.

349
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,700
Actually,

350
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,120
I just wanted to say thanks

351
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,500
for helping with Mo.

352
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,120
So

353
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,500
if you ever need anything,

354
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,700
just let me know.

355
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:58,870
Don't mention it.

356
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,620
It's freezing.

357
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,790
It's freezing.

358
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,410
Who dressed like this?

359
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,830
Go change.

360
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,700
Come on!

361
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,200
She's faking it.

362
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,200
Shwenny,

363
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:46,500
I've been so obvious,

364
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,080
and you're still not reacting.

365
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,250
Another one.

366
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,620
Shwenny,

367
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,620
I know you like me.

368
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,410
Tell me, do you like me or not?

369
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,080
Miss, you've got the wrong person.

370
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,120
Shwenny.

371
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,750
Shwenny.

372
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,540
- Lanshan.
- Lanshan.

373
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,080
Take Lanshan back to her room.

374
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,580
Alright.

375
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,290
Miss, this is for you.

376
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,250
Here.

377
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,080
Lanshan, are you okay?

378
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,540
Let's go.

379
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:54,540
The bag.

380
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:07,910
Chu...

381
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,040
Chu?

382
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,250
Are you drunk again?

383
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:19,410
Chu,

384
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,330
wake up.

385
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:28,330
Let's get you back to your room.

386
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,620
Come on, you've had too much.

387
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,250
Let's go.

388
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,790
No.

389
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Back to your room!

390
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,580
No.

391
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,370
Turn around.

392
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,450
Turn...

393
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,950
Turn around?

394
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,660
Turn around.

395
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,080
Why?

396
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,700
Turn around for what?

397
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:50,450
Just do it!

398
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,200
Fine, I'll turn around,

399
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:55,290
but then you're going back to your room.

400
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,750
Turn around.

401
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,580
Alright.

402
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,080
Lower.

403
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,450
Low...

404
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,870
How?

405
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,540
Just lower it a bit more.

406
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,450
A little lower.

407
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,500
Chu, stop messing around.

408
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,160
Okay.

409
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,160
You're drunk.

410
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,540
Let's just go back to the room and...

411
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:39,870
Are we going to eavesdrop?

412
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,160
You trying to get kicked out

413
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,500
and take over the family business?

414
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:45,750
Maybe not.

415
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:47,910
We've done what we can.

416
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,000
The rest

417
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:50,790
is up to him.

418
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,120
Let's go.

419
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:53,160
Hit the hot springs.

420
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,080
We're already here.

421
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,120
Go ahead if you want.

422
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,500
Come on.

423
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,200
I checked.

424
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,540
Today's perfect for a soak,

425
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,450
and good for love vibes.

426
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,870
Go to sleep.

427
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,620
I don't want to sleep alone.

428
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:13,790
Shwenny.

429
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,410
Alright.

430
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,120
I won't leave you alone.

431
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,330
I won't leave you alone.

432
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,040
I'll stay right here.

433
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:25,120
You lie down.

434
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,870
I'll grab something for the hangover

435
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,290
and be right back.
