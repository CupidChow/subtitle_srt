you'll be doing his laundry

284
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,080
and cooking his meals.

285
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,000

286
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,790

00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,250

305

things aren't going well for him.

306
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,580

but can't get funding.

Everyone who used to be
close to the Han family

308
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,660
is ignoring him now.

309
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,160
He's working on a clothing rental app,

310
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,160
but so far, no investors.

311
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,790

312
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,040

for our weekly Q&A.

319
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,950

321
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:42,080

322
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,870

00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,580

334
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:12,200

335
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,700

337
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,000

340
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,910

350
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,790
Come to my office.

351
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,040
Why are you calling the CFO?

352
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:07,830
Mr. Sheng, you wanted to see me?

353
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,120
How much money
do we have available right now?

354
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,790
We've got 200 million we can access.

355
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,540
Another 3 billion is tied up

356
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,450
for the project bids.

357
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,660
Fanhua,

358
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:22,160
draft a venture capital agreement
for 100 million.

359
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,700

360
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,330
Mr. Sheng,

361
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,120
we've got a 100 million payment due

362
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:29,080
for the project renovation in two days.

363
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,040
If we do this,

364
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,000
we won't have any cash left.

365
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,790
Just do what I said.

366
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,200
Alright.

367
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:42,410
Shwenny,

368
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,790
is this really necessary?

369
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:48,580
I just want to make sure
that person's taken care of.

370
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,660
Why does he still want Chengchi

371
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,200
to be taken care of?

372
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,870

373
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,830
Hello.

374
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,450
Yes, and you are?

375
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,290
I'm Chu Peng.

376
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:28,290
We met in Peng City when I was painting.

377
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,080
Remember me?

378
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,540
I like to wander around

379
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,620
and experience

380
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,290
different things in life.

381
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,540
Who knew

382
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,290
we'd cross paths again?

383
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,580
Mr. Chu,

384
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,160
last time you gave me a painting,

385
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,410
I thought you were an artist.
I didn't realize...

386
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,500
Life is

387
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,830
full of surprises.

388
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,620
The unknown is what

389
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,950
makes it exciting,

390
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,620
don't you think, Editor Gu?

391
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,120
Everyone's life is different,

392
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:56,750
so their expectations are different too.

393
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,000
I prefer a quieter life.

394
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,450
Mr. Chu,

395
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,370
I really liked the painting you gave me.

396
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:05,250
Thank you.

397
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,160
Do you also paint?

398
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,450
I often paint alone.

399
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,290
I'm not very good,

400
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,830
but it brings me peace

401
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,910
and helps me

402
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,450
forget the things

403
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,370
that bother me.

404
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:20,620
Mr. Chu,

405
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,410
I'd like to invite you

406
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:24,790
to be a guest
on our magazine's weekly Q&A.

407
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:25,950
I'd love to.

408
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,700
Shwenny.

409
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,660
What brings you here?

410
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,200
How much do you need?

411
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,830
At least 50 million.

412
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,310
[Investment: 100 million RMB]

413
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,540
Shwenny,

414
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,160
that is...

415
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,080
Not enough?

416
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,410
It'll do.

417
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54,700
Alright.

418
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,950
If you're okay with it,

419
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,040
go ahead and sign.

420
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,540
Shwenny,

421
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,910
I appreciate it.

422
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,830
Don't thank me.

423
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:21,500
I'm not doing this for you.

424
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,450
Shwenny,

425
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,410
I'll make sure to treat her right.
