[Episode 7]

19
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,160
Han Chengchi texted me

20
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,000
about going to the lake next week.

21
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,160
You agreed?

22
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,870
I love watching the drama.

23
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,950
Are you wearing these
for your wedding photos?

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,790
Let me see.

25
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,000
Chengchi recreated

26
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,790
the baby outfits from when

27
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,160
we first met.

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,700
He's such a romantic.

29
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,500
Standing around is boring.

30
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,120
Let's gossip.

31
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,410
I know a secret about Lanshan.

32
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,700
Want to hear it?

33
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,120
Nope.

34
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,750
If I wanted to know,

35
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,910
I'd just read my fortune.

36
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,410
So, zip it.

37
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,910
Good call.

38
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,700
Lanshan was a magnet for guys

39
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,450
in high school.

40
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,580
Tons of them tried to win her over,

41
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,250
but she didn't
give any of them a chance.

42
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,200
Ever wonder why?

43
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,750
Turns out, the guy she liked

44
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,410
was right here.

45
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,450
And that person is...

46
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,500
Jiayi,

47
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,330
everyone knew

48
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,000
Lanshan was into Shwenny,

49
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,910
so

50
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,290
there's no surprise there.

51
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,200
Nope, you're off.

52
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,160
Back then, she wasn't into Shi.

53
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,120
I mean,

54
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,540
if she was,

55
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,500
why did she run away from the wedding?

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,790
So you're saying

57
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,000
she didn't like me but you do?

58
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,330

60
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,540
Was that your way

61
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,790
of confessing?

62
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,950
So, Miss Wang, all this talk

63
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,160
was about my husband?

64
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,540
Didn't realize you cared so much.

65
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,500
Shi,

66
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,250
why are you always defending her?

67
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,410
If you hadn't paid

68
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,160
for her brother's treatment,

69
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,040
would she have married you?

70
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,120
It doesn't matter

71
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,660
why I married Sheng Shi.

72
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,160
That's between us.

73
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,120
Just know this:

74
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,290
he's my husband,

75
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,790
which makes him

76
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,660
mine.

77
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,200
I don't care

78
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,450
how much you like him,

79
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,000
but as long as we're married,

80
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,120
hands off.

81
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,370
If I catch you

82
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,660
messaging him again,

83
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,040
or hear

84

about you crossing the line,

85
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,330
don't blame me for what happens.

86
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,330
Putting a mistress in her place
is only right.

87

Do you all agree?

88
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:28,950
Absolutely.

89
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,160
Besides,
she doesn't even count as a mistress.

91
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,790

Auntie, why'd you stop me?

98
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,540
That sneaky witch has always

99
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,700
had a thing for Chengchi.

100
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,330
If I expose her now,

101
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,370
Shi won't have any reason

102
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,580
to protect her.

103
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,950

104
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:15,120
don't ever call me Auntie again.

108
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,660
Don't be mad.

109
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,790
Tell me,

110
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,660
how'd you even find out?

111
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,080
A while back,

112
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,950
when Lanshan was sick,

113
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,160
I went to her place with En
and Chengchi.

Lanshan, you're finally back.

398
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,040
Mr. Sheng couldn't reach you

399
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,040
and was worried sick.

400
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,700
He even called the old house
looking for you.

401
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,490
Sorry for worrying you.

402
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,740
Thank goodness you're back.

403
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:51,540
That's what matters.

404
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,370
Thanks

405
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,540
for turning on the lights, too.

406
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,490
That was Mr. Sheng's idea.

407
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,950
He knows you're not a fan of the dark

408
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,700
and wanted everything lit up

409
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,490
before you got home.

410
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,370
I see.

411
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:02,490
You can go rest now.

412
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,080
Alright.

413
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,120
We're leaving now.

414
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,490
You take care, too.

415
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,620
Mrs. Sheng.

416
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:28,790
How much did you drink?

417
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,200
What are you doing?

418
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,790
My wife's here.

419
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:38,990
Don't touch me.

420
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,240
Don't touch me.

421
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,620
Sorry. He's drunk.

422
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,240
You should head home.

423
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,160
Alright.

424
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,910
Come on, let's get you to bed.

425
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,660
What,

426
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,830
feeling rich with my card now?

427
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,660
You used to care when I came home,

428
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,740
no matter what time.

429
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,040
Are you just acting up

430
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,330
because you're drunk?

431
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,950
Ouch, that hurts!

432
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:11,330
Sit down.

433
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:13,700
Okay.

434
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:20,790
I'll grab your shoes.

435
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:26,660
Change into these.

436
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,080
Sheng Shi!

437
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,740
What are you doing? You're soaked!

438
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:38,990
Taking a shower.

439
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:41,990
Don't...

440
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,540
The water's still on.

441
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:48,700
Stop it.

442
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,160
Sheng Shi.

443
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:53,540
Come here.

445
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,660
Chu,

446
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,330
can I just hold you for a bit?

447
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,410
Just for a moment.

448
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,990
It's all my fault.

449
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,740
I lost you.

450
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,950
I can't find you.

451
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,910
How did we

452
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,370
end up like this?

453
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,950
Sheng Shi,

454
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:23,160
I don't

455
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,160
have feelings for Chengchi,

456
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,120
but I need time

457
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:30,910
to get over what happened.

458
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,330
Can you give me that?

459
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,870
I'll try to bring back
the Chu you remember,

460
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,540
and you'll bring back
the Shwenny I knew.

461
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,870
Sheng Shi?

462
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,790
Sheng Shi?

463
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,660
Sheng Shi?

464
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:03,790
Sprouts.

465
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,740
Garlic.

466
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:17,950
Salt.

467
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,370
Too much again.

468
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,540
Lanshan, what are you doing?

469
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:28,790
Need a hand?

470
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:29,660
Sheng Shi drank too much.

471
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,740
I'm making him some soup to sober up.

472
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:31,660
I'll do it.

473
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,370
No, it's fine. I got it.

474
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,120
Okay, I'll leave you to it.

475
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,540
Get up and drink this.

476
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,910
I'm sorry

477
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,290
I missed your birthday.

478
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:14,870
And...

479
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,040
Happy birthday.

480
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,990
What,

481
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,040
feeling rich with my card now?

482
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,830
You used to care when I came home,

483
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,830
no matter what time.

484
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,040
Are you just acting up

485
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,580
- because you're drunk?
- Ouch, that hurts!

486
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,040
Did I say something

487
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,450
that made Chu leave?

488
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:09,120
No more drinking for me.

489
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,490
This mouth of mine...

490
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,540
This tie

491
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,080
is my favorite!

492
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:38,580
You are awake.

493
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:39,910
Is your head still hurting?

494
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,620
We need to talk.

495
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,990
Think about

496
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,790
who you're living with every day.

497
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,910
What are you talking about?

498
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,080
Sheng Shi.

499
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,200
What?

500
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:57,830
Make it quick.

501
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,370
I'm late for work.

502
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,990
This is your birthday gift.

503
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,700
I didn't know what you'd like,

504
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,950
so I just got something I like.

505
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,290
Though I did use your card

506
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:10,660
to buy it,

507
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,990
I hope you like it.

508
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,330
Take a look.

509
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,120
Maybe I was wrong about her.

510
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:18,290
Also, it's late,

511
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:19,910
but

512
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:21,700
happy birthday.

513
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,870
I'm not happy at all.

514
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,790
You just went out
and bought this, didn't you?

515
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,540
And you used my card?

516
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,660
Where's the thought in that?

517
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:32,790
It's not like that.

518
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:35,290
I got a call from the hospital

519
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:36,700
saying Mo woke up.

520
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:37,910
I rushed over

521
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,830
and missed your call.

522
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,620
Don't be mad.

523
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,620
It's really nice.

524
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,080
Hello,

525
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:09,870
Dr. Wang?

526
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:10,870
Sheng Shi.

527
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,740
I heard Ye Mo woke up.

528
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,080
How's he doing?

529
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:15,990
He woke up yesterday.

530
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,540
Still under observation.

531
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,040
It's a miracle.

532
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,290
Thank you for everything this past year.

533
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,370
It's nothing.

534
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:25,080
If you hadn't kept
getting experts involved,

535
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,870
he wouldn't have recovered this quickly.

536
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,990
But,

537
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,990
don't tell Lanshan.

538
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,870
I don't want her to stress over it.

539
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,660
I don't get why

540
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,790
you keep doing all this

541
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,370
and hiding it.

542
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,120
Just

543
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,080
a little secret between a couple.

544
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,700
Alright, Uncle Wang.

545
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,120
Thanks for looking after Ye Mo.

546
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:49,830
No problem.

547
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,120
Thanks, Uncle Wang.

548
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,080
Take care.

549
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,620
If I'd known it was for me,

550
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:07,160
I wouldn't have drunk so much
for nothing last night.

551
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,120
Got angry for no reason.

552
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,950
Chu's got great taste.

553
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,990
This tie really suits me.

554
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:27,560
Hello,

555
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,620
Shwenny.

556
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,180
Hello?

557
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,240
Nice of you to call.

558
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,290
I wanted to apologize

559
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,700
for leaving yesterday

560
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:38,080
without saying anything.

561
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:39,200
How about

562
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:41,330
I treat you to dinner soon?

563
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,740
No need to wait. How about today?

564
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,740
I'm right by your office.

565
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,220

566
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:49,770
