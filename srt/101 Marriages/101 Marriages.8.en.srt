Sounds like an allergic reaction.

I'm sorry.

215
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,290

Yeah.

385
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,020
[Chu]

386
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,890
Chu?

387
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,310
[Chu]

388
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,390
Mr. Sheng,

389
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,640
your phone is ringing.

390
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,310
Sorry, everyone,

391
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,140
it's my wife calling.

392
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,470
I'll step outside.

393
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:45,970
Alright, alright.

394
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,060
Hello?

395
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,390
Hello?

396
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,100
What's up?

397
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,640
Everything okay?

398
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,770
Why aren't you asleep yet?

399
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,220
I...

400
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,100
I don't feel well.

401
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,390
Are you okay?

402
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,470
Hold on, wait.

403
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:19,930
Hey, Dr. Wang?

404
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:20,970
Sheng Shi.

405
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,180
- No, Sheng Shi!
- What's wrong?

406
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:23,930
What's going on?

407
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,270
Nothing serious.

408
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,600
Don't call the doctor.

409
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,680
I'm just...

410
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,850
I'm just having trouble sleeping.

411
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,220
Most people

412
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,680
ask what's wrong,

413
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:37,720
not call the doctor

414
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,180
right away.

415
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,520
I didn't want to embarrass you

416
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,520
if it's nothing serious.

417
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,970
Embarrassed?

418
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,310
No way.

419
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:47,390
Hello?

420
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:48,810
Are you still there?

421
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:49,180
Hello?

422
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,350
Dr. Wang, sorry about that.

423
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,600
False alarm.

424
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,850
Chu's fine.

425
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:53,970
Sorry to bother you.

426
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:54,970
No problem.

427
00:18:58,890 --> 00:18:59,850
Well,

428
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,890
that's it then.

429
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,140
I'm going to sleep now.

430
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,390
Alright.

431
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:07,680
Get some rest and keep warm.

432
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,180
I...

433
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:12,850
You...

434
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,180
When are you coming home?

435
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,140
You want me to come back?

436
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,720
No, I...

437
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,640
I just...

438
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,890
I just realized
I wanted some soy sauce fried rice,

439
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,600
but we're out of soy sauce.

440
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,020
No worries.

441
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,310
I'm going to sleep. Bye.

442
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,850
Soy sauce... soy sauce...

443
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,140
She's being unreasonable

444
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,770
but kind of cute.

445
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,770
That concert was something else.

446
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:09,270
It was like a time machine,

447
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,520
taking us back

448
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,890
to the height

449
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:18,180
of 19th-century piano music.

450
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,140
You nailed it.

451
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,560
Moments like these

452
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,600
add depth to life.

453
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,560
Great minds think alike.

454
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:33,970
En?

455
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,640
Why didn't you call me when it ended?

456
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,060
Good thing I came early.

457
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,180
Mr. Han.

458
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,470
Lu Yifan?

459
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,180
You still remember me.

460
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,100
Oh, don't be modest.

461
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,930
You've taken over Lu Tian Group

462
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,270
and made it thrive.

463
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,680
I've heard all about it,
even from overseas.

464
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,350
Didn't know

465
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:15,810
you and En stayed in touch.

466
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,100
Small world,

467
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,060
right, En?

468
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,970
Your hands...

469
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:29,930
Well,

470
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,720
I'll leave you two to it.

471
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,520
Let's grab a meal sometime.

472
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,520
That won't be necessary, Mr. Lu.

473
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,720
Chengchi,

474
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,770
are you mad?

475
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:57,970
Lu Yifan and I

476
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,810
just happened to run into each other.

477
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,520
He had an extra ticket,

478
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,640
so he invited me to the concert.

479
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,470
How could I be mad at you?

480
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,890
Just try to keep some distance

481
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,640
from him in the future, okay?

482
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,310
Got it.

483
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,270
So much for romance novels.

484
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,310
What's this?

485
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,720
Your soy sauce.

486
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:43,060
Soy sauce?

487
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:45,180
Yeah, I figured black stones

488
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,850
usually aren't that pretty,

489
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,640
but this one,

490
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:51,060
designed and worn by you,

491
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,680
looks unique.

492
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,060
Designed?

493
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,310
Who designed it?

494
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,390
I did.

495
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,640
You mentioned soy sauce,

496
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,100
and I thought

497
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,220
this might be

498
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,890
a creative twist.

499
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,140
Wait, you turned that black gemstone

500
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,890
from the auction into this?

501
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,180
You knew?

502
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,180
Do you like it?

503
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,850
Where's my fried rice?

504
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,520
Two minutes away.

505
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,100
Wasting a precious gem like that...

506
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,850
But it's actually nice.

507
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,680
Honestly,

508
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:36,060
I thought stir-fried liver
sounded better,

509
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,140
so I got some.

510
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:41,060
From Gulou?

511
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:41,930
Yes.

512
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,560
I also found this.

513
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,770
Strange.

514
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:50,100
I couldn't find it earlier.

515
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,270
Yeah, pretty strange.

516
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,310
Funny how I found it right away.

517
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,470
Enjoy.

518
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,640
Soy sauce liver.

519
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:02,890
I suddenly lost my appetite.

520
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,770
You wanted soy sauce,

521
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:05,220
so here it is.

522
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,890
Too salty. I don't want it anymore.

523
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,100
It's not salty, just try it.

524
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,640
You can eat. All yours.

525
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,930
I'm full. I just ate.

526
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,220
You, you eat.

527
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,390
I just ate.

528
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,350
I came all this way

529
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,770
to make this for you.

530
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,640
I don't want it. I want to sleep.

531
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,680
I know you well.

532
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,810
Soy sauce?

533
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,060
It's not my perfume.

534
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:43,220
How's it raining?

535
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,720
The sun's still out.

536
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:48,850
Huan!

537
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,020
Grab an umbrella.

538
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:55,970
Huan, where's the umbrella?

539
00:25:58,810 --> 00:25:59,560
Chu,

540
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,970
stop watering. It's raining.

541
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,060
You're silly.

542
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,600
Let the rain wash it away.

543
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,180
