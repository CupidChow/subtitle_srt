Yes.

53
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,080
Sorry, Ms. Ye,

54
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,290
Mr. Sheng never does

55
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,450
interviews.

56
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,370
I understand,

57
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,200
but we're very professional.

58
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,540
You might want to check with him first.

59
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,540
He might say yes.

75
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,790
no interviews?

76
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:40,700

00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:43,870

108
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,080
and wardrobe team

109
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,450

110
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,790
Of course. That's perfect.

128

129
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,790
Lanshan, Mr. Sheng is so hot.

Handsome and charming.

131
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,290
From now on,

132
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,330
he's my new crush.

133
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,750
Don't be fooled by looks.

134
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,700
Get back to work.

135
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,160
But he's so dreamy.

136
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:33,950
Mr. Xu,

137
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,700
here's the confirmed outline
from Mr. Sheng's assistant.

138
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,250
Alright, let me see.

139
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,040
Lanshan,

140
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,160
are you out of your mind?

141
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,910
Who cares about these questions?

142
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,830
For someone like Mr. Sheng,

143
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,080
we need him to share

144
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,370
valuable business insights

145
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,950
and success stories

146
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,580
for aspiring entrepreneurs.

147
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,830
You're right,

148
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,250
but we can't

149
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,750
just focus on business.

150
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,250
We need to dig into
his personal life too.

151
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,660
There are always rumors

152
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,910
about his marriage.

153
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,500
We need to explore that.

154
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,120
Why dig into his personal life?

155
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,000
Because readers love those

156
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,500
hidden marriage stories
about wealthy men.

157
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,290

159

161
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,700
Go on. Get moving.

162
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,910
I'll add

163
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,290
a few impromptu questions.

164
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,450
Stick to my outline

165
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,370

166
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,620
Go on.

167
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,620
Mr. Sheng, you wanted to see me?

168
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:44,620
Yes.

169
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,040
Editor Gu,

170
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,790
How's my makeup?

171
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,750
Is it a bit too heavy?

172
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,410
Could you check?

173
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,250
Yes, the shading on the sides
is a bit much.

174
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,290
Makeup artist,

175
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,250
could you lighten the shading
on both sides?

176
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,500
My stomach hurts, Editor Gu.

177
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,580
Could you help Mr. Sheng
with his makeup?

178
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,500
Wait!

179
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:25,750
He has a stomachache.

180
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,080
Sorry.

181
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,660
Editor Gu, can you handle it?

182
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,120
Done.

183
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,000
Who tied this tie?

184
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,580
It looks terrible.

185
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:10,200
Can you help me fix it?

186
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,870
Don't overdo it...

187
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,580
Alright, everyone's ready.

188
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,500

189

194
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,330
For our first episode,

195
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,790
we're honored to have Mr. Sheng,

196
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,250
the CEO of Sheng Group.

197
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,700
Hello, everyone,

198
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,200
I'm Sheng Shi.

199
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,750
Mr. Sheng, in the years
you've been in charge,

200
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,660
you've turned the group
into a Fortune 500 company.

201
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,660
Any unique business philosophies

202
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,540
you can share with us?

203
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,330
Nothing special, really.

204
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:34,250
Just keep learning,

205
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,160
embrace new things,

206
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,620
stay ahead

207
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,700
of the trends,

208
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,330
and be the trailblazer.

209
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,200
Sometimes that means taking risks,

210
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,750
but with risk

211
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,080
comes opportunity.

212
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,930
[I heard Mr. Sheng is married,
is that true?]

213
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,410
Lanshan.

214
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,870
I heard Mr. Sheng is married.

215
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,290
May I ask

216
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,500
if that is true?

217
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,540
Yes, it is.

218
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,470
[Where was the wedding held?
There was no news about it.]

219
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,500
Where was the wedding held?

220
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,410
There was no news about it.

221
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,870
The wedding day was unforgettable.

222
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,750
She was in such a rush.

223
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,580
Please pay for the surgery now.

224
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,200
The patient is in critical condition.

225
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,290
You need to be prepared.

226
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:58,560
[Inpatient]

227
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,120
Why did you run away?

228
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,120
Where did the blood come from?

229
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,870
What happened?

230
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,120
Are you hurt?

231
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,540
It's all Mo's blood.

232
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,040
Shwenny,

233
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,620
if it weren't for me, Mo...

234
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,830
I don't have enough money right now.

235
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,250
Can you help me?

236
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,410
He helped you escape the wedding?

237
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,870
Do you really not
want to marry me that badly?

238
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,160
I'm begging you.

239
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,540
For the sake

240
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,200
of our years of friendship,

241
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,910
please save Mo.

242
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,500
You will save him, right?

243
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,750
I won't save him!

244
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,040
Shwenny!

245
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,330
Shwenny!

246
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,120
Please.

247
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,410
It's my fault for running away.

248
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,370
Punish me however you want,

249
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,000
but please save Mo.

250
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:07,660
I'll do anything!

251
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,080
Alright.

252
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,830
You said it.

253
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,120
We'll go to the registry office now

254
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,750
and get married,

255
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,580
and I'll save him.

256
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,080
In the end,

257
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:45,790
she ran into my marriage.

258
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,910
So romantic.

259
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:09,890
[What's the most precious gift
you've given your wife?]

260
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,910
Mr. Sheng,

261
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,200
what's the most precious gift

262
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,160
you've given your wife?

263
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,450
Mr. Sheng,

264
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:22,660
Bustling Sheng Shi Avenue

265
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,790
has been built

266
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,750
exactly

267
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,080
as per your painting,

268
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:27,580
even better

269
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,500
with added colors.

270
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,660
Chu,

271
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,580
your painting is now a reality.

272
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,950
Don't be too moved.

273
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,470
[Today is the first day
Chengchi and En are abroad]

274
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,790
Chu, you keep a diary?

275
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,620
Today is the first day Chengchi

276
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,250
and En are abroad,

277
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,790
and the first day I miss him.

278
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,950
He has all the qualities I like.

279
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,410
He always smiles gently

280
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,000
and is the first to help me

281
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,870
in a crisis.

282
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,500
I like him.

283
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,540
I miss him.

284
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:29,700
But for

285
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,660
my beloved sister,

286
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,950
I will

287
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,750
keep these feelings

288
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:38,660
hidden

289
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,290
forever.

290
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,580
I gave her a very special gift.

291
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,950
A gift

292
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,540
she'll never forget.

293
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,620
The Gu family has a project starting

294
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,120
with a funding gap

295
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,790
of about 50 million.

296
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,040
Consider it a wedding gift.

297
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,120
To me,

298
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,620
she's worth that much.

299
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,410
You're so generous.

300
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,160
I'm sure Mrs. Sheng

301
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:23,200
will never forget it.

302
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:34,430
[When will you reveal
your wife's identity?]

303
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,040
Mr. Sheng,

304
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,580
no one knows

305
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,370
who Mrs. Sheng is.

306
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,120
When will you

307
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,660
reveal your wife's identity
to the public?

308
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,910
She's right in front of me...

309
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,700
watching through the camera.

310
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,700
Mr. Sheng, you're quite the joker.

311
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:19,750
Editor Gu,

312
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,580
you're so professional and talented.

313
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,910
If my wife's identity is ever revealed,

314
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,950
you'll be the first to know.

315
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,750
Thank you for your trust.

[Do you and your wife
plan to have kids?]

318
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,370
Alright, folks,

319
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,870
that's it for today.

320
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,580
See you next time.

321
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,200
What were you doing?

322
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,120
Why didn't you ask

323
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,200
the last question?

324
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:33,540
Ending the interview early

325
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,200
is a big mistake! You know that?

326
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:38,080
You...

327
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,500
Mr. Sheng!

328
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,660
Are you okay?

Ye Si did.

331
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:50,540
I...

332
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,370
I'll talk to her.

333
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,910
It doesn't matter.

334
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:57,200
You should be glad
Editor Gu didn't ask it.

335
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,870
Otherwise, this interview

336
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,660
would've been a disaster.

337
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:01,790
Yes, yes.

338
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,620
You're absolutely right.

00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,330
I was just angry earlier.

385
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,950
I promised

386
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,700
to do whatever it takes
to save your brother.

387
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,580
As for the baby,

388
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,870
if you don't want it, we won't have it.

389
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:08,790
Why did you do this?

390
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:12,580
I'll do anything

391
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,950
to make you happy.

392
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,450
Okay?

393
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,080
When you wake up,

394
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,750
I'll give you this card.

you said

399
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,950
we'd change the terms.

400
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:40,830
Don't forget that.

401
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,500

Mr. Lu, you can't go in!

414
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,350
Mr. Lu!

415
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,180

Mr. Sheng.

Sheng Shi,

422
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,140
are you messing with me?

423
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:39,970
Mr. Lu,

424
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,430
that's really rude,

425
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,180
barging in like this.

426
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,140
Business is like war.

427
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,430
You should know this.

428
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:49,310
Also,

429
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,770
wins and losses are part of the game.

430
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,430
Acting so frantic

431
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,930
isn't a good look.

432
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,180
You should know,

433
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:00,390
that actions like this

434
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,560
have consequences.

435
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:05,810
Alright.

436
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,600
We're done here.

437
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,060
I have to get to

438
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,140
the Han family's engagement party.

439
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,430
See Mr. Lu out.

440
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,270
Yes.

441
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,640
Mr. Lu, please.

442
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,100
The Han and Sheng families,

443
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,680
I won't spare either of you.

444
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,970
I never wanted to do this!

445
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,270
Wait for me!

446
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,310
En, you look amazing today.

447
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,220
The most beautiful bride in the world.

448
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,430
You're such a sweet talker.

449
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,310
Here's a gift for you.

450
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:05,810
Congratulations on your engagement.

451
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,350
What did you get me?

452
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:09,520
En,

453
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,310
I made this bracelet myself.

454
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:13,390
It might not be the prettiest,

455
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,680
but it matches with mine.

456
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,180
It's the thought that counts.

457
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,180
Thanks, Shan.

458
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,100
I love it.

459
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,100
Help me put it on.

460
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,600
Shan,

461
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,810
how are things with Shwenny lately?

462
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:27,220
He's giving you money, right?

463
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:29,970
Yeah,

464
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,180
he gave me a card

465
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,350
and told me to spend as I like.

466
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,220
But you know me,

467
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,890
I don't like spending money
I didn't earn myself.

468
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,310
That's good.

469
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,770
If he ever mistreats you,

470
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:40,810
let me and Chengchi know.

471
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,770
We'll handle him.

472
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,310
Don't worry,

473
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,350
he wouldn't dare.

474
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,100
Let me help you with the bracelet.

475
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,390
It looks nice.

476
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:57,850
Lanshan,

477
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,640
come with me.

478
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,640
I'll be right back.

479
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,220
Make sure the balloons

480
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,140
are arranged nicely,

481
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,390
different sizes apart

482
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,310
for a better look.

483
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,270
Mr. Han.

484
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,520
- Here, too.
- Is there

485
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,060
an issue with the lighting?

486
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:21,680
Yes, when I checked this morning...

487
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:24,220
He is so romantic.

488
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,810
No wonder Chengchi and En

489
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:28,850
have been so sweet for years.

490
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,220
Does romance even work?

491
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,560
Of course, it does.

492
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:33,680
Haven't you

493
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,890
seen TV dramas?

494
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,720
You should try it sometime.

495
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,770
Be romantic.

496
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,470
Mom.

497
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,310
You really dressed up.

498
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,680
Trying to outshine En?

499
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,060
No, I'm not.

500
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:02,810
Let me warn you.

501
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,680
Today is En's big day.

502
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:06,350
Don't try anything funny.

503
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,390
If I hadn't seen

504
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:10,020
that disgusting diary of yours,

505
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:12,680
I wouldn't have known
the filthy thoughts

506
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,390
behind your innocent look.

507
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,890
From today on,

508
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,430
he's your brother-in-law.

509
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,520
If you do anything

510
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,060
to embarrass the Gu family,

511
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:22,970
I won't forgive you.

512
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:23,720
Mom,

513
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,970
I sincerely wish them the best.

514
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,640
I've never had any improper thoughts.

515
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,060
You'd better not.

516
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,890
Ji Lang!

517
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,520
You brought him here?

518
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:43,060
Oh my.

519
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:45,100
Am I dreaming?

520
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:46,560
Ms. Gu,

521
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:48,640
would you honor me with a duet?

522
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,140
I'd be delighted.
