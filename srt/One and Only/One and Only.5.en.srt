[Episode 5]

4
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,120
Why did you pour the tea?

5
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,600
Follow me.

6
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,200
Master.

7
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,760
Why don't you allow Eleven to go enjoy the music?

8
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,560
It's rare to hear the music played by musicians from Nanxiao.

9
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,360
She poured a pot of tea.

10
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,079
I'm punishing her by asking her to copy tea names.

11
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,360
Master.

12
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:40,079
Are you teasing her

13
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,400
because she can't speak?

14
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,160
Famous tea is expensive.

15
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,560
But she wasted it at will.

16
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,680
Shouldn't she be punished?

17
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,880
Do you feel grieved?

18
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,360
You should know the value of a cup of tea

19
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,840
worth days of,

20
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,520
even a month of food for common people.

21
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,800
You like to drink tea.

22
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,800
So I bought you tea.

23
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,920
But I don't want you to be arrogant

24
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,640
and unaware of how hard common people's life is.

25
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,880
You should cultivate virtue by staying thrift.

26
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,640
You are the future Crown Princess.

27
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,040
You should set an example.

28
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,040
What's wrong?

29
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,520
As the junior Prince of Nanchen's disciple,

30
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,080
I should remember it, but it has nothing to do with the name of Crown Princess.

31
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,920
I'm willing to be punished.

32
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,280
Most of the tea comes from Nanxiao

33
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,880
and the Jiduo Kingdom.

34
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,920
I handled that from Jiduo.

35
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,880
Wait. Let me find it out.

36
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,240
This one.

37
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,920
Yes, that's it.

38
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,880
Look, there're words on it.

39
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,120
Abstruse writing.

40
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,120
But it says cinnamon.

41
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,560
Cinnamon is not tea?

42
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,120
Then where's the tea?

43
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,240
When did you learn Jiduo's language?

44
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,320
When I went to the temple

45
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,440
to pray for you these two years,

46
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,080
I met monks from

47
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,640
the Jiduo Kingdom

48
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,560
and I learned it from them.

49
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,560
Since you can learn their language,

50
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,960
you must go to the temple very frequently.

51
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,840
I would go there when I miss you all.

52
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,840
No wonder Xie Yun always became wordy

53
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,080
when he went to the battlefield.

54
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,880
He said there was a little sister

55
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,760
waiting for us at home

56
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,040
and we should not lose our lives.

57
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,600
He knows you best.

The four of them are guards from the imperial palace.

60
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,640
They follow to protect me.

Greetings, Your Highness.

64
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,080
I know you.

65
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,960
You are a meritorious general following the junior Prince of Nanchen

66
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,800
to suppress the Six-garrison Rebellion.

67
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,800
Where is my uncle?

68
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,560
Master is in the camp.

69
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,040
He left us to entertain Your Highness.

70
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,720
Uncle really loves soldiers as if they were his children.

71
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,000
It seems he is going to spend

72
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,880
the New Year's Eve with generals and soldiers.

73
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,120
Is there any scenic place

74
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,360
in his mansion?

75
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,800
I don't want her

76
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,440
to feel chained when we meet for the first time.

77
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,720
There is a garden

78
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,120
with pavilion, pond and beautiful scenery.

79
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,520
Shiyi often practices instrument there.

80
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,840
Then I'll go there.

81
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,560
People in the mansion

82
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,760
are talking about the Prince of Guangling.

83
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,400
They said he has been good-looking since he was a child

84
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,200
and he is famous outside the palace.

85
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,880
What they said is true.

86
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,440
He is a quite handsome man.

87
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,120
Why should we judge people by appearance?

88
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,080
Well, being good-looking is definitely not a disadvantage.

89
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,160
A hundred years ago, the emperor of Xiyan Kingdom,

90
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,040
Murong Chong,

91
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,000
was imprisoned as a toy-boy and suffered humiliation

92
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,000
when he was young

93
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
because he looked even better than women.

94
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,280
Isn't it all because of his appearance?

95
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,360
It was really a pity for you

96
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,600
to lose ability to speak these years.

97
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,440
No matter he is your future husband

98
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,520
or just a guest from afar,

99
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,560
you should show hospitality.

100
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,120
You are more like the descendant from the Cui family than I am.

101
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,520
How I wish

102
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,840
you were me.

103
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,960
Greetings, Your Highness.

104
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,360
Your Highness.

105
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,240
We're not in the Central State.

106
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,080
No need to be too polite.

107
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,240
Get up.

108
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,040
Thank you, Your Highness.

109
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,280
I finally don't need to

110
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,200
see you through portrait.

111
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,960
In the Central State, I often heard that

112
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,600
Nanchen Royal Mansion is magnificent.

113
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,160
But I didn't take it seriouly.

114
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,920
Now when I'm here,

115
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,360
I realize it is true.

116
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,180
Your Highness, don't be misled by the public.

117
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,020
For what?

118
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,500
My master is not extravagant.

119
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,980
But as the prince guarding the borders,

120
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,780
his residence must be magnificent

121
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,300
to win the hearts of the people.

122
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,780
You are afraid that I will think

123
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,220
he is disloyal like other princes?

124
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,300
I dare not think so.

125
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,540
I'm not that blind and stupid.

126
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,340
Other royal families and fierce generals

127
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,740
might be rebellious

128
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,900
or wait for an opportunity

129
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,380
to rebel

130
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,460
when they take control of

131
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,300
thousands of military soldiers.

132
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,220
But he won't.

133
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,980
Beichen is so lucky to have him.

134
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,380
It's against the rules.

135
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,680
Are you all right?

136
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:29,960
I'm fine.

137
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm just caring about you.

138
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,000
Show me your hand.

139
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,760
There are doctors in the mansion.

140
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,760
I'll see them by myself.

141
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,760
Send an imperial doctor to check her hand.

142
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,480
Now!

143
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,360
Yes.

144
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,420
Why did you get hurt for the first time you met him?

145
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,860
Is it an arrangement of the fate?

146
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,700
He was closely surrounded by

147
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,540
four guards with knives.

148
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,660
Even after the maids and chamberlains had left,

149
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,780
they guarded him also.

150
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,780
Is he afraid there would be

151
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,980
assassins even in Nanchen Royal Mansion?

152
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,940
That's the strange point.

153
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:23,860
Your Highness.

154
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,580
How is she?

155
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,140
Miss Cui is all right. Don't worry.

156
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,620
As soon as I saw her...

157
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,220
I had a mood

158
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,300
that I won't understand.

159
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,340
Although I'm have been castrated,

160
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,140
I'm still a human.

161
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,460
Since I'm human, I have emotions.

162
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,900
She is different from that on the portrait.

163
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,980
She won't stand still to let me gaze at her.

164
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,700
She will be afraid

165
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,700
and then get away from me.

166
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,620
Uncle is not in the mansion.

167
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,420
I have to find a good reason to see him.

168
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,980
Today is your birthday.

169
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,060
What's your wish?

170
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,860
Let me tell you what gifts I've prepared for you.

171
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:34,980
Your Highness is a guest.

172
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,140
No need to spend money on me.

173
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,660
Greetings, Your Highness.

174
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,620
You two generals finally came.

175
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,620
Thank you, Your Highness.

176
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,700
Your Highness, what can we do for you?

177
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,820
I've prepared good wine and food.

178
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,620
I want to go to the army barracks with you

179
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,900
to celebrate Shiyi's birthday.

180
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,260
It feels like home in the royal mansion.

181
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,700
I think

182
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,460
Shiyi must want to celebrate her birthday

183
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,580
with her family.

184
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,460
But the Royal Army has strict rules.

185
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,500
Outsiders are not allowed to enter the camp without permission.

186
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,300
Am I an outsider?

187
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,500
I mean those without military status.

188
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,540
What if I have an imperial edict

189
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,780
to reward the army on behalf of His Majesty?

190
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,620
In this case,

191
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,940
I'll make an arrangement right now.

192
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,740
I just wanted to give you a birthday present.

193
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,300
I didn't know you have an edict.

194
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,740
I'm sorry for embarrassing you.

195
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:52,700
Never mind.

196
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,460
It's okay because it is you.

197
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:10,820
Your Highness.

198
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,340
The poison has been completely cleared.

199
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,340
Master.

200
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,140
Eleven comes.

201
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,620
Isn't she in the mansion?

202
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,340
The Prince of Guangling brought her here.

203
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,460
He said he wanted to hold a birthday party for her

204
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,420
and took this opportunity

205
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,980
to reward the army on behalf of His Majesty.

206
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,780
Let's go and welcome them.

207
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,060
Uncle.

208
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:39,980
Zixing.

209
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:46,940
Are you injured?

210
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,340
Xie Yun, take Eleven to see the military doctor.

211
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,220
Yes.

212
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,540
Zixing.

213
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,820
Take a break in the tent.

214
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:04,860
No hurry.

215
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,100
It's a rare opportunity for me to enter the army barracks.

216
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,580
I wonder if you are free

217
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,860
to show me around.

218
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:12,780
All right.

219
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,100
Come with me.

220
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,740
Show me your hand.

221
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,680
Master would be worried

222
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,720
if the military doctor didn't check your hand.

223
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:28,940
Although imperial doctors

224
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,700
have high official titles and read a lot,

225
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,300
they have less experience than

226
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,220
our military doctors.

227
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,420
I'm flattered.

228
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,540
They have already used

229
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,620
good medicine for treating wound.

230
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,620
But I have

231
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,740
folk prescription

232
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,300
which is better than this medicine.

233
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,500
I'll get it right away.

234
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,300
How did he treat you?

235
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,940
With courtesy and integrity.

236
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,140
You are shy.

237
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,220
I've brought Tusu Wine.

238
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,420
Okay.

239
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,860
Since you don't want to say,

240
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,500
forget my question.

241
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,860
Be careful.

242
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:19,740
Place everything well.

243
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,100
Yes.

244
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:20,540
Yes.

245
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,340
It smells good.

246
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,780
It's all your favorite dishes.

247
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,260
Master, I've brought Tusu.

248
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,220
Tusu?

249
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,980
Dinner prepared tonight

250
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,180
looks a little shabbier

251
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,080
compared with Tusu, Xie Yun.

252
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,940
I'll kill some fat sheep.

253
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,380
Give me a knife.

254
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,020
Here.

255
00:17:02,819 --> 00:17:03,859
This cup of Tusu

256
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,660
is for our guest from afar,

257
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,540
Zixing.

258
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,140
Thank you, Uncle.

259
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,700
I also take this cup of wine

260
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,339
as a toast to all of you on behalf of His Majesty.

261
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,579
With a general who can win every battle,

262
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,980
the emperor doesn't have to build the Great Wall.

263
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,540
Thank you, Your Majesty.

264
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,140
Thank you, Your Highness.

265
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,380
This toast is for

266
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,500
the generals and soldiers

267
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,820
who sacrificed in the rebellion suppression.

268
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:24,980
Let's celebrate the New Year.

269
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,700
I hope there would be

270
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,300
no flames of war in our country.

271
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,140
May the people of Beichen live and work in peace and contentment

272
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,740
May the wide territory of our country

273
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,020
enjoys prosperity.

274
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:39,060
May the people of Beichen live and work in peace and contentment

275
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,820
May the wide territory of our country

276
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,260
enjoys prosperity.

277
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,180
[Tusu Wine]

278
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,340
Finally, I want to say that

279
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,540
today's Eleven's birthday.

280
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,300
I hope

281
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,260
she could be happy every day here.

282
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:13,960
Eleven.

283
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,600
Happy birthday.

284
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,920
Thank you, Master.

285
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:34,640
Okay.

286
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,200
Everybody, have a seat.

287
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,220
Here, Chen.

288
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:55,500
Sit here.

289
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:55,840
Okay.

290
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,190
Thank you, adoptive father.

291
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,850
Eleven, who is that?

292
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,290
It's the military advisor, Xie Chong.

293
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:34,700
Your Highness.

294
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,860
The climate of the Western State is different from that of the Central State.

295
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,540
Please drink this bowl of medicine while it is warm

296
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,900
and rest early.

297
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,660
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

298
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:05,620
Shiyi.

299
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,780
Feng.

300
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,100
You…

301
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,620
I can speak.

302
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,360
Great, great!

303
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,840
If your mother knows

304
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,840
you can speak again,

305
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,400
she would be quite happy.

306
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,920
All right, don't stand there all the time.

307
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,880
Have a seat.

308
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,080
Here...

309
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,120
Hey,

310
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,280
make room for me.

311
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:41,920
Come on.

312
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,320
Xiaoyu.

313
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,120
Everybody.

314
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,480
Today is my cousin's birthday.

315
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,560
And she finally

316
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,600
can speak.

317
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,160
I take this opportunity

318
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,880
to propose a toast to you all!

319
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,320
Cheers.

320
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,040
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

321
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,240
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

322
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,440
All the way here,

323
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,880
I often hear a passage.

324
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,640
I specially recited it

325
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,880
and want to read it for you, Master.

326
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,760
What is it?

327
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,560
In this world, very few people have got great bone structure.

328
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,020
Some may have good bone structure, but not beautiful facial features;

329
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,870
many have beautiful facial features, but not good bone structure.

330
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,700
But the Prince of Nanchen

331
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,340
is the only one

332
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,340
who has got perfect facial features and bone structure.

333
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,780
It is said that

334
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,980
his bone structure is even more dignified than an emperor.

335
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,820
Yeah, yeah.

336
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,020
Xiaoyu,

337
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,060
there are outsiders in the army.

338
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,820
Don't talk nonsense.

339
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,060
How could there are outsiders in the camp?

340
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,020
The Prince of Guangling is right here.

341
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,140
Cui Feng, how's everything going on in Shouyang?

342
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,380
It's all right in Shouyang.

343
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,260
But soldiers are missing you

344
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,660
and looking forward to your coming.

345
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,380
Why are you hiding there?

346
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,820
I come to apologize.

347
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,540
Come and have a seat first.

348
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,420
What did you do wrong?

349
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,620
I know the military rules are strict.

350
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,540
But I didn't stop the Prince of Guangling.

351
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,900
He is a prince.

352
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,020
You are just a minister's niece.

353
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,140
How could you stop him?

354
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,020
But we are all happy that

355
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,700
we can celebrate your birthday together

356
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,660
in the army barracks.

357
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,940
Here you are, Pepper Wine.

358
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,500
I'll drink alone?

359
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,380
OK, I'll accompany you.

360
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,380
Tusu bids farewell to the old and Pepper Wine welcomes the new.

361
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,100
Let's take it for celebrating the New Year in advance.

362
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,420
Are you afraid of getting drunk?

363
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,380
God.

364
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,220
This cup of Pepper Wine

365
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,780
is not for my future

366
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,020
or wealth.

367
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,860
I only wish you could bless my master,

368
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,140
senior brothers

369
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,860
and sisters safety

370
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,420
every year.

371
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,500
News of victory.

372
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,860
Where is Master's news of victory?

373
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,340
It has been two months.

374
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,620
Why hasn't there been news of victory yet?

375
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,740
It's never been that long.

376
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,740
Where are the six garrisons?

377
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,860
I don't even know that.

378
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,100
Where can I find Master

379
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,700
if he dies?

380
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,820
The six garrisons are in the north,

381
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:16,080
♫Sing the private talks while I'm slightly drunk♫

382
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:13,740
north of the Central State

383
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,220
and northeast of the Western State.

384
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,490
♫Listening carefully, do you know I'm missing you♫

385
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,740
If he dies,

386
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,260
he wouldn't want you to go find him.

387
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,300
He will be buried

388
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,700
where he dies.

389
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:39,460
♫The snow is falling in front of the yard♫

390
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:45,200
♫Thinking of your every twinkle and smile, I don't want to wake up♫

391
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,940
You didn't fall asleep?

392
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,260
You will be buried

393
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,180
where you die.

394
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,660
Why don't you let me find you?

395
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,540
Once I die,

396
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,540
everything I leave will be empty.

397
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,200
Even if you find and see me,

398
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,800
you would feel nothing

399
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,240
but sad.

400
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,120
Sleep tight.

401
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,360
Master.

402
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,680
Have you seen Shiyi?

403
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,880
She is in my tent.

404
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,440
It's late. She still stays in your tent?

405
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,200
Making you stand outside here.

406
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,680
Why don't you stay with her?

407
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,440
What about you?

408
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,560
I'll just walk around.

409
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,440
Never mind.

410
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:31,680
Do you…

411
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,440
You used to sleep in Master's study

412
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,200
when you felt tired after practicing instrument in the past.

413
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,680
Only you

414
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,400
dare to do this.

415
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,320
Xiaoyu.

416
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,480
What's wrong?

417
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,360
Where have you been these two years?

418
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,920
Master, Tianxing

419
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,040
and I went to the North.

420
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,000
After pacifying rebellions in the six garrisons,

421
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,160
we went to Pingzhou and Shanggu.

422
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,440
Xie Yun

423
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,920
and Feng Qiao are in the West.

424
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,520
Your cousin is in Shouyang.

425
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,280
We seldom meet.

426
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,680
My cousin

427
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,440
is going home, too.

428
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,360
Then we won't talk about him.

429
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,320
It reminds me that

430
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,360
I have something for you.

431
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,560
This is a soft armor

432
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,960
a princess wore before.

433
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,600
I was afraid I would lose it,

434
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,120
so I wore it all the time.

435
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,520
It's for you.

436
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,800
I'm not going to the battlefield.

437
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,720
I don't need this.

438
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,840
Take it.

439
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,920
Don't refuse me.

440
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,880
Everything on me

441
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,800
is all from Master.

442
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,400
I have nothing myself.

443
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,360
It's not easy for me

444
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,440
to get such a treasure.

445
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,560
You must take it.

446
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,800
In my heart,

447
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,760
you are the princess

448
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,800
of our Nanchen Royal Mansion.

449
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,280
This suits you.

450
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,560
What's good to be a princess?

451
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,040
Princesses are royal and noble.

452
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,080
Everyone envies them.

453
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,680
But I don't.

454
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:19,840
I envy you.

455
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,400
Envy me?

456
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,720
You joined the army with Tianxing in early youth

457
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,440
and suffered a lot with Master.

458
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,520
But I just came to enjoy the fruit

459
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,640
and contribute nothing.

460
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,280
Actually, we're all late.

461
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,880
In Master's most difficult times,

462
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,920
he got it through by himself.

463
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,960
You know how many

464
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,040
troops the late emperor gave him back then?

465
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,560
In those years,

466
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,040
the imperial clan took control of the army to protect their own interests

467
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,800
and refused to give up the leadership of any troops.

468
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:02,340
[Taiji Palace]

469
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,080
When Master left the Central State,

470
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,480
he had cavalry of only 20,000 people

471
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,480
and infantry of 10,000 people.

472
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,920
How could he win with such few soldiers?

473
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,880
He brought a box of official seals

474
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,680
and an edict with him

475
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,680
when leaving the capital.

476
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,480
He could be able to appoint

477
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,000
any official below the sixth grade along the way.

478
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,440
Master went all the way south

479
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,480
and used these official seals to recruit soldiers and horses

480
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,320
and formed a hasty army.

481
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,480
He made his name

482
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,840
resounded all over the world

483
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,560
by successively winning battles

484
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,040
and recovering territories.

485
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,360
Tianxing and I

486
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,320
were orphans escaping

487
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,360
to the temple.

488
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,880
After Master recovered the lost land,

489
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,840
we decided to join the army together.

490
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,320
The junior Prince of Nanchen you want to see

491
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,120
is him.

492
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:05,960
Your Highness.

493
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,120
These two children had been yelling to

494
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,760
see you outside the military camp.

495
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,840
What's up?

496
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,560
We want to join the army.

497
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,400
You look young.

498
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,680
Why do you want to join the army?

499
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,880
You're not old.

500
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,040
I'm not young.

501
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,200
I just look young.

502
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,000
You know what?

503
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,280
Your Highness looks

504
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,000
similar to your age,

505
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,640
but he's been through many battles.

506
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,600
I never refuse a volunteer.

507
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,280
I'm only afraid that no one will join the army.

508
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,800
The Royal Army will return to the Western State tomorrow.

509
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,720
I'll give you a night to think about it.

510
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,480
If you are not afraid of death,

511
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,720
then follow me.

512
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,080
Since then,

513
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,560
many years have passed.

514
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,640
I think

515
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,960
we would be killed on the battlefield

516
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,120
or die of old age in the barracks.

517
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:05,639
What can you do when you are old?

518
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,400
Feed and wash horses.

519
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,280
Or clean the barracks.

520
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,040
As long as I can stay in the army,

521
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,280
I'm willing to do anything.

522
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,520
Yeah.

523
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,280
As long as you are here.

524
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,320
Let's find something to eat.

525
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:34,880
Over there.

526
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,480
Let the cook

527
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,560
make something warm for General Hong.

528
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,320
Yes.

529
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,600
Wait.

530
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,160
General Hong

531
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,080
is a bit shy.

532
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,400
Tell the cook that

533
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,240
it's because I'm hungry.

534
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,600
Yes, Your Highness.

535
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,080
Do you all have wives and children?

536
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,040
Will anyone bury you if you are dead?

537
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,520
I dare not to get married.

538
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,800
I could die on the battlefield at anytime.

539
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,160
Even if you want to get married,

540
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,520
they dare not marry to you.

541
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,320
Xie Yun

542
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,680
always looks for food at night.

543
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,280
He told me

544
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,240
the cook always secretly

545
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,360
leaves some pancakes for him.

546
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,080
Why is there nothing left today?

547
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:45,800
General Hong.

548
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,040
General Hong.

549
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,400
I patrol with Eleven tonight

550
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,440
and heard some noise here.

551
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,360
So I came to have a look.

552
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,320
His Highness is hungry.

553
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,320
He asked me to cook some food.

554
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,360
If you like,

555
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,640
I can cook some for you as well.

556
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,000
I'm okay.

557
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,680
But I'm afraid Eleven will be hungry.

558
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,920
So you can cook some as well for her.

559
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,280
Send it to my…

560
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,560
no, to the main tent later.

561
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:12,840
OK.

562
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,160
General Cui.

563
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,320
Who's inside?

564
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,640
It's His Highness.

565
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,960
He used to come to light a fire

566
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,000
before a war.

567
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:41,640
But I've never

568
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,880
heard of an expedition this time.

569
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,240
Go get my reed flute.

570
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,240
Yes.

571
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,480
I aroused your interest?

572
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,680
No one in Shouyang understands me.

573
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,640
It's an rare opportunity to come back.

574
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,160
I want to play a song with you.

575
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,080
Okay.

576
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,480
Our first Confucian general in Shouyang.

577
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,960
Who said this?

578
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,440
Who do you think would say this?

579
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,040
It must be General Hong.

580
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,680
You are awake.

581
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:06,920
Xiaoyu.

582
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,680
Who plays the music?

583
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,680
Master likes to play music before war.

584
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,880
It's rare that he plays music not for war

585
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,560
but for pleasing himself.

586
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,600
Master.

587
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,680
General Hong.

588
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,040
You got up late today.

589
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:48,920
It's Eleven's fault.

590
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,540
Then I'll leave her to you.

591
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:53,940
In this camp,

592
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,340
only you two are idle.

593
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,180
Then I'll train the soldiers.

594
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,380
I'm idle?

595
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,620
Scouting camp.

596
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,020
Military training.

597
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:04,700
Yes.

598
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,340
How did you two take the swords?

599
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,420
Take them well.

600
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,420
Line up.

601
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,100
Yes.

602
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,540
They seem to be afraid of Xiaoyu.

603
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,740
In the barracks,

604
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,020
it's much harder for a female general

605
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,260
to convince soldiers

606
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,220
than the male generals.

607
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:29,820
I'm sorry for

608
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,060
losing my courtesy last night.

609
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,140
Never mind.

610
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,820
Let me show you around

611
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:39,900
the barracks.

612
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,540
Pay attention to the action.

613
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,220
When the army comes to a place,

614
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,140
Xiaoyu's scouting camp

615
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,820
will choose a place for the army to be stationed.

616
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:57,020
The infantry will cut down trees and build wooden walls

617
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,420
to form a military camp.

618
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,420
Tighten your thighs and clamp the horse's back.

619
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,620
Stop shivering.

620
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,740
Look at you.

621
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,340
Get up.

622
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,140
Yes.

623
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,220
Why are there wooden horses in the stable?

624
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,180
It's much more expensive to raise a war horse

625
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,820
than raising a soldier.

626
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,460
So when they train at ordinary times,

627
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,660
they all use fake horses.

628
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,020
Xiaoyu said

629
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,220
our country conquers land with cavalry.

630
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,300
War horses are the most precious.

631
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:36,860
Continue.

632
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,980
I'll eat if you don't eat.

633
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:58,900
Master.

634
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,300
What is it?

635
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,860
You don't like the food?

636
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:07,300
I…

637
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,820
He's still that ungrateful, just like how he was

638
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:09,580
in the Buddhist Tower of the Mansion.

639
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:11,620
Don't you

640
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,780
underestimate him.

641
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,300
Back to the days in Nanxiao,

642
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,620
he was well-versed in both literature and martial arts.

643
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,340
He once tamed

644
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,980
a running battle steed with just one hand.

645
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:22,260
His martial arts skills are much better than yours.

646
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,780
It's already in the past, not worth mentioning.

647
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,940
In that case, I wanna compete with you again.

648
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,580
I surrender.

649
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,740
Surrender or not, you can't say that

650
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,260
until we have a competition.

651
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,140
This disciple of mine

652
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,580
once stayed half a month

653
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,740
along the riverside to learn how to swim.

654
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,940
You don't have much going on right now anyway.

655
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,140
It's not a bad idea

656
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,700
to practice a little after chanting sutras.
