4
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,420
Your Highness.

5
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,060
Your Highness.

6
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,180
You must've been worried

7
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,380
for the past few days.

8
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,820
What exactly happened?

9
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,660
Jin Rong attacked Henei.

10
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,060
My uncle led an army to suppress the rebellion.

11
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,340
What about my brother Cui Feng?

12
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,220
How is he?

13
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:55,940
According to the spies,

14
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,980
Governor Cui left

15
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,420
Taiyuan County earlier.

16
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,140
We still have no idea where he is now.

17
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,860
If he left early,

18
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,340
he's probably hiding somewhere,

19
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,100
waiting to meet up with my Master.

20
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,700
When my uncle returns,

21
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,500
he may have news about him.

22
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,260
If he attacked Henei,

23
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,660
why is the Eastern Palace locked up as well?

24
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,060
The Royal Guards joined the Qi family in rebellion.

25
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,740
After my uncle led the army out,

26
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,579
they took the opportunity to kidnap His Majesty

27
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,860
and went to Jin Rong for shelter.

28
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,780
His Majesty was kidnapped?

29
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,660
After my uncle left,

30
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,140
he ordered General Zhou and the Royal Guards

31
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,420
to protect the city together.

32
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,980
General Zhou...

33
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,780
What happened to him?

34
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,980
He is seriously injured

35
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,260
and hasn't woken up yet.

36
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,060
Shiyi.

37
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,900
He's in my uncle's chambers.

38
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,140
If you want to go…

39
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,500
Meng Luan, summon the imperial doctor.

40
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,060
The imperial doctor has already seen His Highness.

41
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,580
His Highness hasn't slept for days

42
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,620
and said that

43
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,820
he would only go to rest

44
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,060
after seeing you.

45
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,500
Let me bring you to your room.

46
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,460
Get some shut-eye.

47
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:26,220
Rest for a while.

49
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,940
Don't go.

51
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,020
I'm actually no different from you.

52
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,260
I'm not close

53
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:06,940
with my family.

54
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:13,760
Tonight,

55
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,399
let's guard here

56
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,040
and send Zizhen's soul off.

57
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,200
Are you feeling better?

58
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,240
Am I having a fever?

59
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,200
I'll get the imperial doctor.

60
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,360
I'm showing you my weakness.

61
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,320
Can't you see?

62
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,640
I'll ask Meng Luan to come.

63
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,600
I've been waiting for a long time.

64

Attendant Cui is outside the palace

65

waiting to see Your Highness.

66
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,120

67
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:52,880
Yes, Your Highness.

68
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,440
I'll go back to Xuanguang Palace first.

69

70

72

to the Central State in three days.

73
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,200
Jin Rong has shown me his sincerity

74
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,240

How will you show your loyalty?

77
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:53,800

78
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,520
I'll show my loyalty

Zhousheng Chen

81
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,720
is a great threat.

82
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,360
If you don't get rid of him,

83
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,800
it'll be hard for you to rule.

84

85
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,680

Yes, Master.

89

Cui Feng is now in the hands of Jin Rong.

90
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,320
Only a few generals know about this.

Be patient.

95

It's not the time yet.

00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,640
I can wait.

97
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,760
You and her haven't even gone through the ceremony yet anyway.

98
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,520
Why did you make the move early?

99
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,280
I have no idea either.

100
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,560
You gave the order

101
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,920
to make the move early?

102
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,240
She's a member of the Cui family.

103
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,200
If the two of you got married,

104
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,080
who would recognize me as the Empress?

105
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,120
Whatever the case,

106
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,920
as long as you're not on the throne,

107
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,320
you can't marry her.

108
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,680
You are Liu Hui's Honored Concubine.

109
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,760
I must first find a good reason

110
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,960
to marry you,

111
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,640
let alone the serious task of making you the empress.

112
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,720
Even if you list hundreds of reasons,

113
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,240
you can't convince me.

I hope you don't let us down.

118

123
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,480
No need.

His Majesty has passed away.

127
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,600
When?

128
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,720
Nanchen Royal Army reported it secretly today.

129

He was still a child.

130
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,120
Your uncle has submitted a letter,

131
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,600
wishing I'd take the throne.

132
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,840
Do you disapprove?

133
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,320
You and I are destined to be married.

134
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,040
You can tell me anything.

135
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,080
Do you wish to hear the truth, Your Highness?

136
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,240
The emperor's career is unpredictable and always changing.

137
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,280
In a short period of time,

138
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,080
two young masters have been replaced in the Central State.

139
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,400
The people's support accumulated over the years

140
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,880
has been depleted.

141
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,840
The choice of the next emperor

142
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,320
must be chosen with great scrutiny.

143
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,400
Not to mention,

144
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,560
Your Highness is not the Crown Prince.

145
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,480
I was

146
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,000
once considered the future emperor.

147
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,560
I was considered the future emperor.

148
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,240
I was considered the crown prince.

149
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,320
I don't blame you for forgetting it.

150
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,160
No one has ever taken it seriously

151
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,280
except for me.

152
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,920
When I was brought into the palace,

153
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,040
my father had no army to command and no power to win.

154
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,680
That was why he had no capacity to fight power for me.

155
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,280
What I've achieved thus far

156
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,200
is all my own efforts.

157
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,360
Perhaps in your mind,

158
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,080
my uncle is the best candidate.

159
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,840
I've never thought so.

160
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,320
My master has little interest in the throne…

161
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,040
You should call him “uncle”

162
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,720
as I do.

163
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,480
Do you know why

164
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,360
your maid wasn't allowed to enter the palace?

165
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,240
She has been with you for nearly ten years in the Western State.

166
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,120
Her presence

167
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,840
would remind you of the Western State,

168
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,570
thus you'd talk about it

169
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,360
and forget

170
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,000
who you belong to.

171
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,720
I had no selfish intent

172
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,360
when I said those things.

173
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,080
It's not appropriate to

174
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,080
talk about marriage for the time being.

175
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,160
Let's postpone our marriage

176
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,760
for now.

177
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,600
It's just a show

178
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,720
to appease the Jin family.

179
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,000
Your Highness, why are you so distressed?

180
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,560
My heart is tormented more than hers

181
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,840
when I see her suffer.

182
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,440
Take them all away!

183
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,360
Stop!

184
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,920
Xinghua.

185
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,800
They are my parents

186
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,760
and siblings.

187
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,240
Don't you know that?

188
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,520
The Qi family is guilty of the most heinous crimes.

189
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,920
Nine generations of its clan shall be executed,

190
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,240
including you, Princess.

191
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,400
You dare to hurt me?

192
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,760
Why don't I?

193
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,080
If it weren't for your high status,

194
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,840
I wouldn't have come to get you myself!

195
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,480
How dare you! Let me go!

196
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,840
General Li! General Li!

197
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,560
Hold on, General Li!

198
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,040
General Li!

199
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,280
May I have a word?

200
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,240
General Li!

201
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,600
The Prince of Guangling had given orders.

202
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,880
Seeing how loyal the Cui family has been,

203
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,240
the wife of Governor Cui,

204
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,080
Qi Xinghua shall be pardoned.

205
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,160
To execute the Qi family

206
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,760
is the consensus of all ministers.

207
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,280
Do you

208
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,560
want to protect her?

209
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,480
Yes.

210
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,120
I want to protect her.

211
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,960
She is not only from the Qi family.

212
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,880
She's also our Cui family's daughter-in-law.

213
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,240
General-in-chief.

214
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,200
Can you let a member of the Cui family go?

215
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,280
Since you said so,

216
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,680
I'll accept this royal order.

217
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,560
Take them away.

218
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,240
Go! Go!

219
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,400
Let them go!

220
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,880
Xinghua! Xinghua!

221
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,800
Xinghua!

222
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,800

223

224
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,760
Mother!

225
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,600
Xinghua!

226
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,440
You can't save them.

227
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,840
I…

228
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,440
I'll go beg the crown prince.

229
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,200
Wenjun.

230
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,240
Princess Xinghua…

231
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,440
The Residence of Cui is not seeing any guests today.

232
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,520
Ask this guest to leave.

233
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,680
Yes.

234
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,040
This way please.

235
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,080
Brother Zixing.

236
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,280
I beg you to giver orders

237
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,140
to release my parents and other families.

238
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,540
Why did you barge into the palace?

239
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,500
They wouldn't let me see you.

240
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,420
They said it was your order.

241
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,220
I did give the order.

242
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,140
I have my own reasons

243
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:09,780
for not seeing you.

244
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,180
Executing the Qi family to calm the people's anger

245
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,500
is already a foregone conclusion.

246
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,819
You should stay in the Residence of Cui

247
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:17,900
for your own sake.

248
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,099
You...

249
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,140
You want to pave your way to the throne

250
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,660
with the blood of the Qi family?

251
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,860
Qi Zhenzhen has done evil for more than ten years.

252
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,020
She has offended everyone.

253
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,980
It's not that I want them to die.

254
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,980
It's that no one wants them to live.

255
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,820
Stay at the Residence of Cui.

256
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,780
After things have settled,

257
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,420
I'll find a way out for you.

258
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,180
But they are my own parents,

259
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,900
how can I hide?

260
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,740
I can't just stand by and

261
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,260
watch them die.

262
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,140
Brother Zixing.

263
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,820
Please help me.

264
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,500
Can you do something?

265
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,180
Brother Zixing!

266
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,660
I can only protect you.

267
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,060
I'll send her back to the Residence of Cui.

268
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:40,780
Your Highness.

269
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,020
Did the cold wake you?

270
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:45,940
I'm feeling fine.

271
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,380
Come sit down.

272
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,900
Where's Shu?

273
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,100
I came here in the morning

274
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,860
and saw that the fire was burning weak.

275
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,580
Go and prepare breakfast.

276
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,900
Since I entered the palace,

277
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:30,700
I've never had breakfast

278
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,980
with Your Highness.

279
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,700
Go now!

280
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:43,100
[Xuanguang Palace]

281
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,140
Yes.

282
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,340
Let's go inside.

283
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,380
It's cold outside.

284
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:12,780
You're cold.

285
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,820
I was wrong, Shiyi.

286
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,060
I'm used to being alone in the palace,

287
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,260
so I don't know how to get along with people.

288
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,060
I mean...

289
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,540
Get along in a normal way.

290
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,420
Give way.

291
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:07,980
Give way.

292
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,860
What's going on now?

293
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,100
Is the enemy already here?

294
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,460
Don't panic!

295
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,980
I bring news of victory from the Junior Prince of Nanchen.

296
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,500
His Highness conquered Taiyuan County

297
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,620
and has won every battle.

298
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,260
The rebels are defenselessly

299
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,340
and fleeing in disarray.

300

[Central State]

303
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,340
If Master refuses to enter the city,

304
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,260
I'll have no reason to see Shiyi.

305
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,300
General Feng.

306
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,860
Are you worried about Miss Cui?

307
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,420
Why do you say I'm worried?

308
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,820
Though I can't see

309
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,260
the sun or the moon,

310
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,900
I am able to see through people's hearts.

311
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,340
The night before Shiyi got married,

312
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,660
we talked all night.

313
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,780
I felt upset for her.

314
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,100
Xie Chen.

315
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,860
Would you perform a divination for me?

316
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,260
About Shiyi's marriage.

317
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,380
I have done so already.

318
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,260
How is it?

319
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,060
Not very good?

320
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,060
It wasn't accurate.

321
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,900
How can you not be good at divination?

322
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,540
In the horoscope,

323
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,980
she's not destined to get married.

324
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,340
That does sound inaccurate.

325
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,140
Actually, that Liu Zixing

326
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,580
treats her very well.

327
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,340
I can tell.

328
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,940
What you see may not be true.

329
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,380
Where is the royal army now?

330
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,660
Just outside the Central State.

331
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,780
They're already back?

332
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,380
That's right.

333
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,180
They came back to recuperate for a few days before heading out again.

334
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,140
Why didn't they enter the city?

335
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,500
It's my master's habit.

336
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,260
They prefer to station their troops outside the city.

337
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,900
They did the same thing in the Western State.

338
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,980
What a pity.

339
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,740
The people were eager to see the royal army.

340
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,500
What else did you overhear?

341
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:55,780
They say

342
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,820
the Junior Prince of Nanchen wants to

343
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,100
completely eradicate the Jin rebels.

to have all the county governors to send troops.

346
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,060
Does that mean

347
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,460
the Prince of Pingqin is coming too?

348
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,260
Help me ask around again.

349
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,820
I want to see if the Prince of Pingqin is coming to the capital this time.

350
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:10,940
What are you laughing at?

351
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,700
If you want to know these,

352
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,060
just ask His Highness.

353
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,820
They came to the capital to quell the rebellion,

354
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,700
yet all I think about is catching up with an old friend.

355
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:21,940
It wouldn't be appropriate.

356
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,140
Forget it, ignore my request.

357
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,940
[Central State]

358
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,460
Hold it!

359
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,940
Where are you from?

360
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,100
What's your intention?

361
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,060
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

362
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,820
Prince of Pingqin, don't be angry.

363
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,740
He's a newcomer.

364
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,580
He doesn't know the rules.

365
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:46,140
Come here.

366
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,060
Well…

367
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,140
What are you afraid of?

368
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,540
Yes, yes.

369
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:54,980
Your Highness.

370
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,500
How do you know me?

371
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,180
[Ping]

372
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,620
You saw the flag.

373
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,580
Yes.

374
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,940
So anyone

375
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,620
who has a piece of cloth and makes a flag

376
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,180
can pretend to be me?

377
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,020
What if I'm a fake?

378
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,220
What if you let me in the Central State

379
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,100
and I have all the dignitaries

380
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,140
beheaded?

381
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,420
I was wrong.

382
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,660
Get up.

383
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,540
Thank you, Your Highness.

384
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,660
Whose soldiers are you?

385
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,140
Replying to Your Highness,

386
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,540
I'm a member of the Royal Guards.

387
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,380
Who does the Royal Guards obey?

388
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,460
The Prince of Guangling.

389
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,260
The Prince of Guangling?

390
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,100
How old is he?

391
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,820
Has he ever led an army?

392
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:43,380
He dares to take over the government now?

393
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,580
Your Highness.

394
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,660
Prince of Guangling.

395
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,540
The Prince of Guangling is a member of the Liu clan.

396
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,460
Shut it!

397
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,580
You can tell what a general is like by observing his soldiers.

398
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,100
Seeing how weak you are,

399
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,900
I know he's never fought before.

400
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:57,820
Let's go!

401
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:12,060
[Central State]

402
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,020
Go, go, go!

403
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,700
I've been vexed all the way.

404
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,980
Tell me

405
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,220
why did you give up my sister-in-law to someone else?

406
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,020
We're not

407
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,460
in that kind of relationship.

408
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,660
You won't tell me the truth, huh?

409
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,580
Monk, you say something.

410
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,140
I don't know secularities.

411
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,500
You don't know secularities?

412
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,900
When you were in Nanxiao,

413
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,420
you had a bunch of wives and concubines.

414
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,540
There were girls throwing flowers at your carriage

415
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,540
when you went out.

416
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,140
You were a flirtatious prince.

417
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,660
You don't know secularities?

418
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,780
It seems that the Prince of Pingqin

419
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,580
knows a lot about me.

420
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,220
You follow my sworn brother,

421
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,380
shouldn't I investigate your background?

422
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,140
You should.

423
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,580
Well...

424
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,940
In my opinion,

425
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,340
since your last name isn't Liu anymore,

426
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,140
you're no longer in chains.

427
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,020
Why not…

428
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,060
What have they given you?

429
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,900
Aside for making you vow

430
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,420
to fight for them,

431
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,020
what else did they give you?

432
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:17,460
They only gave you this.

433
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,380
But even that you gave to me.

434
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,160
It's a precious thing.

435
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,320
Of course it's precious.

436
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,000
With this,

437
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,800
the government gave me a thousand war horses.

438
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,280
In Beichen,

439
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,640
only with war horses could I recruit soldiers.

440
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:35,280
This is how

441
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,920
I worked my way up.

442
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,280
He is my sworn brother

443
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,320
and more importantly, my confidant.

444
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,560
Most of His Highness' friends

445
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,440
were once helped by him.

446
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,720
Don't you think it's a pity?

447
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,880
Don't you have regrets?

448
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,360
How about we talk business first?

449
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,200
Go ahead.

450
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:57,800
Go ahead.

451
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,000
Business... business...

452
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,040
Tomorrow, my royal army

453
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,470
and the reinforcements from the regional princes will go first.

454
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,270
I'll leave the Central State to you.

455
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,080
I'll guard the Central State?

456
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,040
Yes.

457
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,610
I've brought

458
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,420
all the best soldiers.

459
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,480
Those Regional Princes are all

460
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,200
slimy characters.

461
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,050
There is no way

462
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,370
they would give you their elite.

463
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,440
That's precisely why

464
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,260
you need to defend the city.

465
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:24,880
I don't understand.

466
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,210
If you were only called to the capital,

467
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,690
someone would surely suspect

468
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,160
you and I were joining forces

469
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,530
to take over the empire.

470
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:32,920
That's why I've summoned

471
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,720
reinforcements from all the Regional Princes

472
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,480
to make it not so suspicious.

473
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:39,560
What…

474
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,480
It's just an expedition…

475
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,640
You've really thought about everything.

476
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Once we leave tomorrow,

477
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,880
the people of the capital

478
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,120
will go under your protection.

479
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,600
And her?

480
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,680
Well.

481
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,960
Before you go on your expedition,

482
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,880
let's go see Eleven.

483
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,480
It's not proper.

484
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,680
What's so improper about going to see your disciple?

485
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,480
Are you kidding?

486
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,480
I will take you there.

487
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,880
Forget it.

488
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,560
You're asking me for help,

489
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,000
and not the other way around.

490
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,560
You entrusted me with the Central State.

491
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,840
So, you have to do

492
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:40,750
whatever I want you to do.

493
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,800
Good timing, Feng Qiao.

494
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:44,190
Feng Qiao, go with us

495
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,040
to the place we're going later.

496
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,280
You can avoid suspicion

497
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,680
with a female disciple there.

498
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,600
Monk! Monk!

499
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,000
You'll come with us too.

500
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,360
It'll be better with the monk there too.

501
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,360
Let's go.

502
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,960
Come with me! Let's go!

503
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,000
Come on, come with me!

504
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,080
Let's go!

505
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,840
Eleven!

506
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,560
Cui Eleven!

507
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,920
Your sworn brother is here!

508
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:17,800
Come out!

509
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,880
Master.

510
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,920
I was wondering

511
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,480
who here in the palace would call me Eleven.

512
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,040
In my eyes, you are

513
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,520
always that little girl who couldn't speak

514
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,370
in Nanchen royal mansion.

515
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,760
Shu, prepare some tea.

516
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,320

Half an hour ago.

They said it was improper to see you.
