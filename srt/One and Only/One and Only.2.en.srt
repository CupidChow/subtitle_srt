00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,780
Your Highness, someone from the palace has arrived,

343
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,180
saying they've brought gifts from His Majesty.

344
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,500
Let them in.

345
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,420
Yes, sir.

346
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,500
Greetings, Your Highness.

347
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,140
Congratulations, Your Highness.

348
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,300
Congratulations, Miss Cui.

349
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,740
Someone!

350
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,580
These two pieces

351
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,180
are the royal gifts from His Majesty.

352
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,900
What if I

353
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,180
still won't accept them this time?

354
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,300
His Majesty said

355
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,060
he is the emperor.

356
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,340
You're supposed to accept the gifts.

357
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,500
His Majesty also said

358
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,060
these two pieces were given to

359
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,540
you and your disciple.

360
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,980
Choose the ones you like

361
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,340
and just take them.

362
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,020
Then I will have to thank His Majesty.

363
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:54,780
Tianxing.

364
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:55,380
I'm here.

365
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,060
Take these

366
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,340
to Eleven's courtyard.

367
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,020
Yes.

368
00:24:59,100 --> 00:24:59,540
Please.

369
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,380
His Majesty

370
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,220
also sent a painter this time,

371
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,380
meaning to make a portrait of Miss Cui

372
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,860
which is to be sent to the Eastern Palace in the future.

373
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,140
Xiaoyu.

374
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,980
Take Eleven and the painter

375
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,020
to my study.

376
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:19,940
Yes.

377
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,420
Gentlemen, this way please.

378
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,140
I have something

379
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,740
to talk to Your Highness.

380
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,740
All of you, please leave.

381
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,020
Yes.

382
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,380
Mrs. Cui, please.

383
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,100
This is Cui Shou.

384
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,020
This time

385
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,500
he has led the 2,000 soldiers of our family

386
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,060
and wanted to stay in Western State to protect my daughter.

387
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,380
I hope Your Highness will allow him to do so.

388
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,540
All right.

389
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,940
I will order someone to place them.

390
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,420
Thank you, Your Highness.

391
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:29,820
General Cui.

392
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,220
Do you want to cultivate the fields?

393
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,220
Fields?

394
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,620
My army do farming normally.

395
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,220
When it's not war time, they cultivate their own fields.

396
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,460
Then General Cui shall follow the custom.

397
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,060
Yes.

398
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,900
There's one more thing.

399
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,780
Cui Feng has admired you since he was a child.

400
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,700
He wants to follow you into battles.

401
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,500
I have a letter of recommendation

402
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,100
from my brother.

403
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,460
No need to show me the letter of recommendation.

404
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,700
As long as the young lord is not afraid of death,

405
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,860
he can join the army at any time.

406
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,620
I thought I'd have to go through a lot of trouble

407
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,620
talking about this.

408
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,620
I never refuse someone

409
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,300
from a famous family who wants to join the army.

410
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,780
As for whether he can stay or not,

411
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,620
it depends on his own ability.

412
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,660
There is one last thing.

413
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,060
It's about Eleven?

414
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,100
Your Highness, you've met her.

415
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,100
Shiyi has been like this since she was a child.

416
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,540
She can't speak.

417
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,620
Is it a disease or...

418
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,140
Since her father left home,

419
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,900
she has been ill.

420
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,900
Maybe it's a real illness.

421
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,780
Maybe it's a heart disease.

422
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,420
It's so lifelike.

423
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,540
Good.

424
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,100
You've done a great job, Miss. Cui.

425
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,100
Shiyi,

426
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,580
say goodbye to your mother.

427
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,340
Study hard.

428
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:57,260
Once a teacher, always a teacher.

429
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,860
Listen to your master.

430
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,340
Remember.

431
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,540
Your Highness, farewell.

432
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,980
From now on,

433
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,100
I will not be by your side anymore.

434
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,420
You must get used to it.

435
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:51,820
[Nanchen Royal Mansion]

436
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,300
At the same age as her,

437
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,020
Master is already a great general.

438
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,660
She still can't let go of her mother.

439
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,180
You've come a long way.

440
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,580
Rest for a few days.

441
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,500
Master.

442
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,980
Why don't I take her back to the courtyard first?

443
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,340
Go.

444
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,300
Yes.

445
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:25,070
Wait.

446
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,980
You just came to the royal mansion.

447
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,380
I'd better take you there myself.

448
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,700
If anyone dares to bully my sister again,

449
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,580
I'll hunt him down.

450
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,260
Two pieces of news.

451
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,140
His Highness has agreed to let me join the army.

452
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,620
I can go with the army now.

453
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:33,920
Second.

454
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,520
Tonight

455
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,960
I will patrol the camps outside the city

456
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,440
with General Hong.

457
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,560
I won't be able to accompany you.

458
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,760
I can be alone.

459
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,480
Don't worry, brother.

460
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,360
If you feel lonely,

461
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,840
and like to read books,

462
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,000
there is a library in the backyard of the royal mansion.

463
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,480
You can go there and take a look.

464
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,040
Thank you, Feng Qiao.

465
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,920
Then take care of yourself.

466
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,040
We'll leave now.

467
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,640
Let's go, General Hong.

468
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,600
No trespassing

469
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:19,280
to His Highness' study.

470
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:21,960
What is it?

471
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,520
I...

472
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,400
You may leave first.

473
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:32,890
Yes.

474
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,800
Your Highness, Miss. Cui is missing.

475
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,160
The daughter from a powerful family is missing at night.

476
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,040
If word gets out, it will sabotage her reputation.

477
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,000
I dare not say anything.

478
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,480
I can only come to you.

479
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,040
Don't panic.

480
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,980
She'll be fine in the royal mansion.

481
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,510
I'll go and look for her now.

482

[Library]

483
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,140
Why did you come to the library?

484
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:00,820
You're homesick?

485
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,659
Your senior brothers and sisters

486
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,540
always treat the royal mansion

487
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,860
as their own home.

488
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,100
Although they call me "Master",

489
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,820
we all treat each other as family.

490
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:13,300
You don't have to be so reserved.

491
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,860
I don't usually live in the royal mansion

492
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,699
for a long time.

493
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,659
When I was not in the royal mansion,

494
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,460
the library was always locked.

495
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,260
Since you like it,

496
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:33,179
I'll leave this key to you

497
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,340
from now on.

498
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,699
Consider it a gift for today's master worship.

499
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,780
You forget what I said during the day?

500
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:52,420
No need to be overcourteous.

501
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,500

00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,800
To Your Highness.

515
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,840
As a disciple,

516
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,880
she must not neglect her morning and evening visits.

517
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,080
Have to be once in the morning, once in the evening?

518
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,640
Not once can be saved?

519
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,760
It's a must.

520
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,440
What else?

521
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,080
What?

522
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,640
I'm asking

523
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,680
how many manners

524
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,440
her mother has taught her?

525
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,400
That's a lot.

526
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,720
There are many things in terms of

527
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,560
words, food, washing, traveling,

528
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,880
sitting and lying down.

529
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,080
If...

530
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,440
If she wants to see me in the study,

531
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,760
how many rules does she have to go through?

532
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,600
Before entering, she should knock three times

533
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,480
to inform the master.

534
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,560
She shall not sit inside

535
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,520
but stand respectfully to the left of the master.

536
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,320
When the master asks her to sit, she shall resist.

537
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,760
She can only sit down

538
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,040
after the master asks her to sit three times in a row.

539
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,040
Forget about these.

540
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,120
As the old saying goes,

541
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,440
"A disciple serves his master with the same respect as his father."

542
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,400
How can I forget?

543
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,960
There is only one rule here.

544
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,440
That is, to carry out military orders.

545
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,360
Forget about everything else.

546
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:49,110
If you teach her that,

547
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,890
the Cui family should detest you.

548
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,320
Now that they're in Western State,

549
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,170
Cui can't control it anymore.

550
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:07,060
[Library]

551
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,280
Shiyi.

552
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,130
What are you doing?

553
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,400
Sorting out the ancient books.

554
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,680
Who told you to do that?

555
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,360
Wasn't it you?

556
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,560
Master asked me to manage the library.

557
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,280
Naturally, I have to take care of the books.

558
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,040
I gave you the key,

559
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,800
so that

560
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,480
you can come here whenever you want.

561
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,960
There is no other good place in the mansion.

562
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,640
Only the library left by my aunt

563
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,760
is somewhat interesting.

564
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,040
I came here to learn from you,

565
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,400
not to have fun.

566
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,800
I know.

567
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,120
Then why didn't you teach me?

568
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:14,810
I haven't figured out how to teach you yet

569
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,440
because you are the first pupil

570
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,760
I've ever had literally.

571
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,760
What is it, Your Highness?

572
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,320
You're unsettled?

573
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,550
I've never had a pupil before.

574
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,240
Aren't Xiaoyu and the others

575
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,020
all your disciples?

576
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,480
They call me "Master"

577
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:45,720
because

578
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,280
I want to give them a home

579
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,080
so that they have an excuse to stay

580
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,480
in the royal mansion.

581
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,920
I never

582
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,840
preached and taught.

583
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,640
In that case, it's true.

584
00:39:59,260 --> 00:39:59,730
So...

585
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,240
You were once Grand Mentor.

586
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,360
Your Highness.

587
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,680
That was 20 years ago.

588
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,200
You should have something to pass on anyway.

589
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,520
No.

590
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,720
The ones I taught were royal sons.

591
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,280
I didn't once teach

592
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,800
daughters of noble families.

593
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,690
No, no.

594
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,120
In the residence of Cui,

595
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,520
what did she learn already?

596
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,880
To Your Highness.

597
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,520
Other than etiquette,

598
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,000
she didn't learn anything else.

599
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,560
But she likes to read.

600
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,160
She always studied at the academy since she was young.

601
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,760
Did her uncle once say

602
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,360
what he wanted her to learn?

603
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,680
No martial arts, but anything else works.

604
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,400
She doesn't want to learn martial arts in the royal mansion.

605
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,400
Does she just want to get a title

606
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,720
of disciple?

607
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,760
Have someone prepare the zither in the study.

608
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:03,960
Prepare the zither?

609
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,320
Master, you can play this?

610
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,640
What?

611
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,040
You think I don't know how to play?

612
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,800
We really thought

613
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,480
you were only good at martial arts.

614
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,400
In the past, in Central State,

615
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,720
His Highness was often criticized

616
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,540
on etiquette.

617
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,040
But in terms of talent,

618
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:24,290
no one was as good as His Highness.

619
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,960
You.

620
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,480
Watch and learn.

621
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:39,560
The instruments here are all heirlooms.

622
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,840
One of them

623
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,360
was used by His Highness when he was a child.

624
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,980
After the late emperor passed away,

625
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,840
it was sent to Western State.

626
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,620
His Highness asked

627
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,740
you to choose for yourself.

628
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,500
Which is the one Master once used?

629
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,060
Are you asking me which

630
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,060
is the one His Highness used?

631
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:12,640
This one.

632
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,500
It's called the High Wind.

633
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,220
The high wind raises the waves,

634
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,620
like the rising fields in the mountains.
