[Episode 10]

4
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,479
It is really heartbreaking

5
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,640
to see him leave alone.

6
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:42,600
You did that for me.

7
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,720
It snows.

8
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,000
And these.

9
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,920
My Lady,

10
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,000
you have taken a lot of books.

11
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,520
My brothers said

12
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,040
no one would read these books.

13
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,480
It's fine that I take them away.

14
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,200
These are not enough.

15
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,380
Your Highness, you're in a good mood.

16
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,980
What happened?

17
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,460
Shiyi's mourning has ended

18
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,860
and she is about to set out to the Western State.

19
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,380
Master just received the letter.

20
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,060
Your beloved disciple is coming back.

Are you going to

23
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,420

24
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,460

26
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,560
There are some changes in Nanxiao.

27
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,880
I need to go back to Shouyang ahead of schedule.

28
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,460
So I can't escort you to the Western State.

29
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:56,860
It doesn't matter.

30
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,100
General Cui will protect me.

31
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:58,980
Don't worry.

33
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,220
I'm waiting for him in Shouyang.

34
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:06,820
Take care.

35
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,620
It seems he has lost much weight.

36
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,180
And he looks blue.

37
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,900
The servants in their mansion said

38
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,580
the princess often

39
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,940
forces him to marry

40
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,580
those two remote cousins of

41
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,380
the Qi family.

42
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,900
Why do they force him to take a concubine?

43
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,260
Empress Dowager Qi ordered that

44
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,620
the princess must give birth to

45
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,460
a son of the Qi family and the Cui family.

46
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,500
The princess seems reluctant to have a child,

47
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,380
so she came up with this idea.

48
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,260
How many books do you want to take?

49
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,580
They must be carried by several carriages.

50
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,580
Others might think

51
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,340
I am sending your dowries.

52
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,580
Load the carriages.

53
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,820
I'm afraid it'll be too late tomorrow.

54
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,780
Miss Cui can't bear any delay.

55
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,020
She's eager to set out.

56
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,460
After Shiyi left,

57

Why don't you ask her to stay?

60
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,300
At her age,

61
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,620
she should have finished her training.

62
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,740
She doesn't need to go back to the Western State.

63

If possible,

64
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,260
I hope she won't follow our

65
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,659
or Feng's path.

66
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,900
Since her engagement with the royal family

67
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,659
was broken off,

68
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,820
they have been trying to

69

seek marriage.

70
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,820
She has to go back to the Western State

71

I'm yours.

I won't kill you.

80

Only His Majesty

81
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:23,600
can kill you.

82
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,600
What are you sighing at?

83
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,360
I'm thinking

84
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,560
how my ancestors would feel

85
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,960

fighting each other.

87
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,440
It's tiring to suppress the rebellion.

88
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,159
You'd better think about

89
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,000
whether it will rain these days.

90
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,400
Why?

91
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,480
Does it matter?

92
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,960
If it rains,

93
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,520
march is slow

94

you can see her earlier.

I had a royal mansion before I became a monk.

99

I also had a wife and concubines.

00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,740
Yongcheng is being encircled.

178
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,020
Please help us!

179
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,060
Why don't you dispatch a letter of emergency to

180
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,020
the regional princes?

181
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,300
We did, to all of them.

182
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,540
the prefectural governor of Yongcheng wrote

183
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,740
nine letters of emergency.

184
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,740
Nine persons were sent to dispatch the letters.

185
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,300
I'm the one dispatched to seek help from the Prince of Beihai.

186
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,940
What did he say?

187
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,660
He invited me to drink tea.

188
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,140
but refused to dispatch troops.

189
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,260
And he said

190
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,140
he did want to help us,

191
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,060
but it was most important to

192
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,620
protect his own fief

193
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,020
at this time.

194
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,420
What about other regional princes?

195
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,860
Did they also refuse to aid?

196
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,300
Among the nine of them,

197
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,500
only the junior Prince of Nanchen and the Prince of Pingqin

198
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,420
did not reply

199
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,540
as they were out of their fiefs.

200
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,300
Other regional princes

201
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,940
all refused to help.

202
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,020
I saw several thousand soldiers and horses of the Cui family

203
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,180
at the foot of the mountain.

204
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,420
I guessed you were here

205
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,700
so I broke in.

206
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,300
Please save Yongcheng.

207
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,340
Cui Shou.

208
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,460
Miss Cui,

209
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,700
we have only 3,000 soldiers.

210
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,980
There are less than 2,000 soldiers

211
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,540
but tens of thousands of people in Yongcheng.

212
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,100
Even if we have only 300 soldiers,

213
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,220
we can't abandon our people

214
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,300
and peers.

215
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,140
Set out to Yongcheng now.

216
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,420
I got it!

217
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,940
Thank you, Miss Cui.

218
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,300
I'm going to select a horse for you.

219
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,620
No, you can't go.

220
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,580
I will follow you wherever you go.

221
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,220
You hide the books in the temple

222
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,500
and pick a horse. You go back to the Western State

223
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,540
and wait for my master.

224
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,380
Tell him

225
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,700
I'm waiting for him in Yongcheng.

226
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,220
Go.

227
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,180
[Yongcheng]

228
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,900
The enemy army has withdrawn.

229
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,820
Miss Cui?

230
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,740
Go into the city.

231
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,140
Miss Cui, why do you come here?

232
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,220
You don't know how to fight.

233
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,180
I met General Yang Shao

234
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,020
and come here to reinforce you.

235
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,380
With you here,

236
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,860
I feel uneasy as I am worried about your safety.

237
00:13:58,980 --> 00:13:59,700
The enemy's reinforcements

238
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,940
are five li away from us.

239
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,580
Do you want to put her into danger?

240
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:05,980
I've never fought a battle,

241
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:06,820
but my escorts

242
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,140
are all battle-scarred.

243
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,500
Let's stop talking about this.

244
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,900
When did you come?

245
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,460
Why did the enemy army retreat?

246
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,580
I beat them back.

247
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,060
I set out as soon as I received the message.

248
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,060
The Royal Army of Nanchen has never been defeated.

249
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,300
We're not like these weak scholars.

250
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,140
Do you have training at ordinary times?

251
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,420
Why are you so weak?

252
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,540
General,

253
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,700
why don't you ask

254
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,820
how many soldiers

255
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:28,540
we had

256
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,460
when we were trapped these days?

257
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,100
You are famous indeed,

258
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,700
but we are not weak.

259
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,300
I…

260
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,740
Generals, stop quarrelling.

261
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,180
Where's the prefectural governor of Yongzhou?

262
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:38,940
He died in the battle.

263
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,900
Let's first check the defense of the city.

264
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:45,660
We're not in the Western State.

265
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,540
Both you and I are not familiar with it.

266
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,820
Let's go up to the city wall.

267
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,420
Miss Cui,

268
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,340
are you familiar with the defense of the Western State?

269
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,660
The Western State is my hometown.

270
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,700
I should be familiar with it.

271
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,260
Be careful. Be careful.

272
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,220
Come on.

273
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:07,780
Come on.

274
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,420
The defense is too bad.

275
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,460
Call all bowmen up here.

276
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:11,940
Yes.

277
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,060
Prepare catapults.

278
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:14,900
What do you mean?

279
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,460
Do you want to go against me?

280
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,060
I dare not.

281
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,220
Their army is coming.

282
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,780
Archers, get ready.

283
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,020
Miss Cui, go inside.

284
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,260
It's very dangerous here.

285
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,540
Miss Cui,

286
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,780
please go inside.

287
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:00,260
Fire up.

288
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:04,940
Shoot.

289
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:22,579
Charge.

290
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,380
Master, Tianxing.

291
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,540
No, thanks.

292
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,740
No, thanks.

293
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,900
Has the advisor sent the order?

294
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:50,860
Yes.

295
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,180
Here you are. Eat something.

296
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:52,980
Don't worry.

297
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,700
Did you really marry?

298
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,540
You must have had

299
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,460
a wife

300
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,980
and many concubines.

301
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,300
Yes, I had some women.

302
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,700
Where did they go

303
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,020
after you became a monk?

304
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,740
They were dismissed.

305
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,620
So ruthless.

306
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,740
Master.

307
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,540
Master, Yongcheng has been surrounded.

308
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,300
Shiyi and General Gan

309
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,340
went there with reinforcements.

310
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,180
Who?

311
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,780
Shiyi, master.

312
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:44,780
Master,

313
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,300
I'll first go reinforce them with the cavalry.

314
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,540
Cavalry, get ready.

315
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,260
Yes.

316
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,340
I'll first go with the cavalry.

317
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,300
Xiaoyu, Tianxing,

318
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,500
go cut off the enemy's route of retreat.

319
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,300
Feng Qiao,

320
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,660
go reinforce us with the infantry later.

321
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,060
Yes.

322
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,900
General Yang, the gate is in danger.

323
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,820
Defend it to death.

324
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:40,700
Yes.

325
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,660
Quickly. We're the closest to Yongcheng.

326
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,140
The Royal Army is coming.

327
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,900
It's Xie Yun's cavalry.

328
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:41,780
General,

329
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,100
will we enter the city?

330
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,980
It's very dangerous to open the gate now.

331
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:45,980
First repulse the enemy.

332
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,700
Xie Yun.

333
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,260
General Yang, open the gate quickly.

334
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,300
If we open the gate,

335
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,180
we can't block

336
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,660
the coming enemy.

337
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,420
Miss Cui,

338
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,700
there're no military forces in the city,

339
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,140
so we can't open the gate.

340
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,820
Do you want me

341
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,380
to leave Xie Yun in the lurch?

342
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,500
General, I'm late.

343
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,140
My leg was broken.

344
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,100
Leave quickly.

345
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,100
Leave.

346
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,300
Let's live

347
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,780
or die together.

348
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,820
General Gan.

349
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,620
Master is coming.

350
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,220
Go kill the enemy's generals.

351
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,420
Retreat.

352
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,300
Retreat.

353
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,140
Xie Yun.

354
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:44,370
♫The snow is falling in front of the yard♫

355
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:50,120
♫Thinking of your every twinkle and smile, I don't want to wake up♫

356
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:59,640
♫Going through the four seasons on the horse, how shall I greet you♫

357
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:08,040
♫I will never change my love for you♫

358
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:13,800
♫I'll share all the tears and laughter with you♫

359
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:23,760
♫Even if we have a rootless life, I'm devoted to you♫

360
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,780
Sorry, I'm so incompetent.

361
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,860
General Gan was killed.

362
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,420
You've done a good job.

363
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,820
It's I who came late.

364
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:39,180
Thank you for saving me.

365
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:57,900
Gan,

366
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,140
thank you for saving Yongcheng.

367
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:18,140
[Residence of the Prefectural Governor]

368
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,540
How long haven't we met?

369
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,780
One year and seven months.

370
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,420
During this period,

371
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:37,020
the Royal Army went north

372
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,320
and regained 13 cities.

373
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,060
As usual,

374
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,020
I've kept the vanquished generals' seals

375
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,540
for you.

376
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,940
I didn't experience any seizure battle,

377
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,940
so I thought it's interesting

378
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,140
to keep them.

379
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,180
But today,

380
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,660
I know

381
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,340
what you've experienced these years.

382
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:03,620
Master.

383
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,380
This general wants to see you.

384
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,580
Greetings, Your Highness.

385
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,540
Have you helped the city people settle down?

386
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,700
Yes.

387
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,400
I'll go back to the Western State tomorrow.

388
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,480
I'll leave 20,000 troops for you.

389
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,760
I'll also leave.

390
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,760
As a guarding general,

391
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,760
why do you leave?

392
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,040
Do you worry about the city

393
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,080
or me?

394
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,080
Both.

395
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,680
With His Highness' Royal Amy,

396
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,280
the city will be strongly fortified.

397
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,320
I'm disappointed

398
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,720
about Beichen,

399
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:48,280
so I don't want to defend the city here.

400
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,680
Miss Cui,

401
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,600
I owe you a life

402
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,000
forever.

403
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,640
Please take care.

404
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,960
What does he mean?

405
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,320
The prefectural governor died at his post.

406
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,960
Nine people who were sent to ask for aid,

407
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,160
but only he survived.

408
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,120
Why did

409
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,200
only he survive?

410
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,640
It's because

411
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,860
Shiyi saved

412
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:19,620
him.

413
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,300
Since ancient times,

414
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,660
the beauties have liked to marry

415
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,300
the heroes who saved them.

416
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,860
I'm afraid

417
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:26,860
he has fallen

418
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,220
in love with Shiyi.

419
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,660
Xiaoyu, stop kidding.

420
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,580
I'll go to see Xie Yun.

421
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,820
Send people to keep an eye on Yang Shao

422
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,460
and see whom

423
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,180
he'll surrender to.

424
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,940
Yes, Master.

425
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,740
Why does Master want to

426
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,620
keep an eye on a petty guarding general?

427
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,260
He must have his own reasons.

428
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,420
You asked me

429
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,300
to explain the march strategies

430
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,380
south of the Yangtze River to you,

431
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,860
but you didn't

432
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,540
hear a word.

433
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:26,560
How do you

434
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,460
know that?

435
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,140
I've seen through the mortal world.

436
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,900
Obviously,

437
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,300
you're watching the sand table,

438
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,220
but you're thinking your girl.

439
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:48,900
Your Highness.

440
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,540
How is Xie Yun?

441
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,540
General Xie,

442
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,140
General Xie…

443
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:54,940
Go ahead.

444
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,580
I'm afraid

445
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,660
he can't ride forever.

446
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,180
It's lucky

447
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,580
for you to escape with bare life every time.

448
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,100
Feng Qiao,

449
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,540
are you praising me or laughing at me?

450
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:21,540
I've fought hard

451
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,340
and never thought to escape every time.

452
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,860
It sounds

453
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,100
I am only good at escaping.

454
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,100
Let me check your injury.

455
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,540
You must be crazy.

456
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,860
Am I your enemy or your senior brother?

457
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,660
I'm worried about you.

458
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,380
It hurts.

459
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,020
Shiyi.

460
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,180
Shiyi,

461
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,780
ask Feng Qiao to leave now.

462
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,180
Have some noodles.

463
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,140
Look.

464
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,060
This is my good junior sister.

465
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:51,860
I'll go and ask

466
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,500
whether the monk, a prince of Nanxiao,

467
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,100
has any good medicine.

468
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,140
Maybe he has some miraculous medicine

469
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,660
which can't be found in our place.

470
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,180
No need.

471
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,340
Our medicine is effective.

472
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,860
Don't bother him.

473
00:34:04,659 --> 00:34:05,219
Here you are.

474
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:12,860
Why do you all

475
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,540
trust this monk?

476
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,060
I think

477
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,659
he is a spy in our army

478
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,500
and gained our sympathy by schemes.

479
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,179
Master trusts him,

480
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,020
so do I.

481
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,060
Why do you all

482
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:28,659
trust an enemy from Nanxiao?

483
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,340
Does it hurt?

484
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:43,940
As your senior brother,

485
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:45,420
I can endure it.

486
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,340
Xie Yun,

487
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,980
do you blame me?

488
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,460
Why do I blame you?

489
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,580
I didn't open the gate for you.

490
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,420
Luckily, you didn't do it.

491
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,780
Though you've read military books,

492
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,460
you know little about the seizure battle.

493
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,340
The gate is of vital importance.

494
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,580
Once it's broken by the enemy,

495
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,220
the city

496
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,380
will be lost for sure.

497
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,460
What Xie Yun said is right.

498
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,860
Leave us alone.

499
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,140
I'll say something with him.

500
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,500
Why are you standing here?

501
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,980
Master is talking with Xie Yun,

502
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,340
so he asked me to come out.

503
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,820
What are they talking about secretly?

504
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,140
I don't know.

505
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,700
Master.

506
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,140
Go inside.

507
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:02,780
Shiyi, I…

508
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,580
Feng Qiao, go inside first.

509
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,380
I'll go with Master.

510
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,180
Did you make master angry?

511
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,420
I fetched you medicine,

512
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,660
but the monk said it's not that effective

513
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,780
as your bone was hurt.

514
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,300
This medicine is more effective for injuries.

515
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,340
Xie Yun.

516
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,300
If you don't like the monk,

517
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,540
I won't mention him.

518
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,900
Do you like him?

519
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:56,900
I…

520
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,580
I was kidding.

521
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,340
Never mind.

522
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,740
I am

523
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,260
sad

524
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:12,860
about something.

525
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,060
Master, what's the matter?

526
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:52,780
Nothing.

527
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,500
I need a walk.

528
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,340
You're obviously worried about something.

529
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,460
It flashed

530
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,140
through my mind that

531
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,020
you've accompanied me to fight hard

532
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,780
these years.

533
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,140
You're lying.

534
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,140
I failed to live up to Adviser Xie

535
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,380
and his instructions.

536
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,940
I failed to take good care of you.

537
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,780
I'll be on duty tonight.

538
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,940
Go back to the prefectural governor's residence.

539
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,180
Yes.

540
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,460
You and your master

541
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,620
are about the same age,

542
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,260
but he has to take his responsibility

543
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,220
as your master.

544
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,740
He blames himself

545
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:17,820
for General Xie's injury.

546
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,820
Master hasn't come back.

547
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,700
Has he had breakfast?

548
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:22,580
General Hong.

549
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:24,820
Master.

550
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,340
Has Shiyi had breakfast?

551
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:31,780
Yes.

552
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,460
But she had no appetite.

553
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,820
The city has been surrounded for several months,

554
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:37,500
so there's

555
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,700
no good food.

556
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:40,660
After going back to the royal mansion,

557
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:41,820
find someone to make

558
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,100
her favorite dishes.

559
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,340
Yes, master.

560
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,940
Master has been on duty for three days,

561
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,020
and Xie Yun has locked himself in the room for three days.

562
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,260
Yang Shao, what are you doing?

563
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:08,500
Freeze.

564
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:10,620
Yang Shao,

565
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,540
let go of Feng Qiao.

566
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,660
Shiyi, don't come over.

567
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,740
I have only one request.

568
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,300
Let me take away Liu Changshan.

569
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,660
Why do you want him?

570
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:18,540
It's none of your business.

571
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,660
Get him to me.

572
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,100
Go get him.

573
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:21,900
Yes.

574
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,300
Don't come over.

575
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:29,500
Yang Shao,

576
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,300
if I had known

577
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,820
you were so ungrateful,

578
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,260
I wouldn't have helped you.

579
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,300
Miss Cui,

580
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,900
I have my reason to save him.

581
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:43,820
Freeze.

582
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:46,940
If you don't force him,

583
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,460
he won't hurt Shiyi.

584
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:54,660
General Yang,

585
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,220
do you come to save me?

586
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,700
Cut the cackle. Go with me.

587
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:01,780
Prepare a carriage for me

588
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:02,780
outside the city.

589
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,180
Prepare a carriage.

590
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:04,940
Yes.

591
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,180
Miss Cui, sorry.

592
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,260
Since you can't do martial arts,

593
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,660
I can leave here more safely.

594
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,100
Go.
