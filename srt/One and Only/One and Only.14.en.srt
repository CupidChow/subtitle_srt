[Azure Dragon Temple]

4
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,840
Last time I was here,

5
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,640
the hall here had been completed.

6
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,680
The person who first found this place

7
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,920
was Tianxing.

8
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,680
The last time he left you

9
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,720

10
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,760
he came here.

[Azure Dragon Temple]

12
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,140
The name is nice.

13
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,740
It was Master's idea.

14
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,139
It was Shiyi's idea.

15
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,500
I was

16
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,660
merely speaking for her.

17
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,820
No wonder Shiyi wanted to

18
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,220
hide the dowry here.

19
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,540
Go up the mountain now.

20
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,020
I'll wait at the foot of the mountain.

21
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,660
Let me carry you.

22
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,940
No way.

23
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,820
Tianxing, give me a hand.

24
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,579
Let's go.

25
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,180
When everything is done,

26
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:52,980
this would be an excellent place

27
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,940
to cultivate and train.

28
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,620
Why do you insist on becoming a monk?

29
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,300
Can't you stay in the royal mansion?

30
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,180
I'm asking this for Master.

31
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,620
He treats you as a military advisor

32
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,140
while the only thing you care about is cultivating.

33
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,620
That would break his heart.

[Nanchen Royal Mansion]

35
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,260
Since you returned,

36
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,780
you've been packing books.

37
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,020
Did something unpleasant

38
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,060
happen to you in Nanxiao?

39
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,700
Or was there a problem with His Highness?

40
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,460
What does it have to do with Master?

41
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,700
When His Highness was not in the royal mansion,

42
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,020
you would long for news from the royal army

43
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,340
and hope that His Highness returns victoriously.

44
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,900
Now His Highness is here in the mansion.

45
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,700
But you hide here and won't see him.

46
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,220
There must be a rift

47

48
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:12,420
Half of the books were given away.

If I don't count them,

50
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,420
I won't feel at ease.

You have a lot on your mind.

Do you want me to read your fortune?

They say you only perform divinations for wars.

54

Why do you suddenly want to read my fortune?

00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,020
You're an exception.

56

During His Highness' expedition to the north,

57
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,260
he came across a city that was under attack.

58
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:16,620
The people he saved

59
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,380
were all sent back to their homeland.

60
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,780
I didn't know where I came from.

61
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,580
I should have been sent to the nearby Taiyuan County.

62
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,340
But because I am blind,

63

His Highness took me in.

64
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,220
I was even lucky enough

to be adopted by Advisor Xie as his son.

66
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,060
I know.

67
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,300
That's why you were given the name Xie Chen by the advisor

68
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,860
to thank Master for taking you in.

69
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,740
Aren't you curious

70
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,180
why His Highness only took me in?

71
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,500
Is there a special reason?

72
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:51,340
His Highness told me

73
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,980
there was a girl in the royal mansion

74
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,540
suffering from aphasia.

75
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,020
He was reminded of the girl

at the sight of me.

00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,980
I'll take your silence as a yes.

81

Then let's check out your marriage.

00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,380
Okay.

85
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,060
You stay and look after Xie Chen.

86
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,100
Are you performing divination?

No.

88
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,420
No, I'm not.

89
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,620
Go get ready.

90
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,460
Yes.

91
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,740
Two guests have arrived at the royal mansion.

92
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,500
Both of them have a connection with you.

93
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,900
Back then,

94
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:43,820
I thought you

95
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,100
were the Princess of Nanchen.

96
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,460
Do you remember?

97
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,460
Yes, I do.

98
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,100
You...

99
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,420
You can talk now?

100
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,460
This...

101
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,540
She began speaking years ago on New Year's Eve.

102
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,180
That's great news!

103
00:07:59,300 --> 00:07:59,780
Since...

104
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,220
you couldn't speak,

105
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,820
you master worried you a lot.

106
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,100
You must not know about this.

107
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,620
In the first two years when he took you as his disciple,

108
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,420
he visited all the

109
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,540
renowned doctors.

110
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,820
He also said

111
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,100
you had a fear.

112
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,060
He was afraid that you'd be terrified

113
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,420
seeing those doctors.

114
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,620
So he went to see those doctors himself.

115
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,220
He learned all his medical skills

116
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,900
secretly from those doctors.

117
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,300
What brings you here

118
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,620
this time?

119
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,419
I'm here to discuss something serious.

120
00:08:31,059 --> 00:08:32,140
The royal court has

121
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,860
given me the mandate to govern Yongcheng.

122
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,500
Yongcheng was once under your protection.

123
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,659
I should thank you, Miss,

124
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,900
on behalf of the people of Yongcheng.

125
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,300
No need to be so courteous.

126
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,380
That's one thing.

127
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,980
The other is,

128
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,940
I've brought Huaiyang with me.

129
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,340
To deliver the wedding fruits?

130
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,940
You're right.

131
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,260
It's a long way.

132
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,340
I didn't want her to come.

133
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,180
But she said she wanted to see her old friends

134
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,260
after hearing we were passing through the Western State.

135
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,900
She has no family.

136
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,900
So she said you are her family.

137
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,220
We're getting married next month.

138
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,100
Congratulations in advance.

139
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,780
Congratulations to Your Highness.

140
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,540
Thank you, Miss.

141
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,580
I'll be back from Yongcheng

142
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,380
in three days' time.

143
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,500
Please take care of Huaiyang for me.

144
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,940
Farewell.

145
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,140
Life

146
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,660
is full of surprises.

147
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,300
Who would have thought

148
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,700
the person once trapped in the palace's nunnery

149
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,940
by the empress dowager,

150
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,380
would later escape

151
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,340
to become the Princess of Pingqin?

152
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:58,620
-Master.
-Master.

153
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,420
Your Highness.

154
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,060
Master, I'll stay behind.

155
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,300
There's an old grudge

156
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,500
between her family and my family.

157
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,780
It would be awkward for us to meet.

158
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,340
Come with me.

159
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,380
Me?

160
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,660
She's practicing Buddhism without cutting her hair,

161
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,620
while you're a half practitioner yourself.

162
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,460
You two may have something in common to talk about.

163
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,700
What are you afraid of, Your Highness?

164
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,140
What possibly can I be afraid of?

165
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,620
Are you afraid of being alone with a beautiful woman?

166
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,500
Or are you afraid

167
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,980
of causing another beautiful woman to misunderstand you?

168
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,940
You really understand people's emotions.

169
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,980
Well, I've experienced many things

170
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,500
for the past decade.

171
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,860
Your Highness.

172
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,900
Prince of Fengyang.

173
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,820
Princess of Pingqin.

174
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,860
Would you

175
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,340
allow me to

176
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,940
talk with His Highness alone?

177
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,380
I...

178
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,980
A man and a woman should not speak alone.

179
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,180
It would be more appropriate

180
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,300
with another person being here.

181
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,700
I remember you hated rituals the most.

182
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,140
But you're now also burdened by it.

183
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,420
Rituals are sometimes a burden,

184
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,620
but at other times

185
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,380
it is a sure way to avoid gossip.

186
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,620
Is it your first time being in the Western State?

187
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,300
Yes.

188
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,060
Then you should take a walk around.

189
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,460
This is the ancient capital of several dynasties.

190
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,740
The scenery here is like no other.

191
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,860
I'd like to see

192
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,900
the place that His Highness has been guarding all these years.

193
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,460
The Princess of Pingqin would like to take a night tour of the Western State.

194
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,220
His Highness asked you two to make arrangements.

195
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,420
Will Master go as well?

196
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:58,980
His Highness...

197
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,820
I have a collection of books that needs sending tomorrow.

198
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,220
I'll go count them again.

199
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,100
You've already given away thousands of volumes.

200
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,340
Why are you giving more away?

201
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,300
I've read all these books.

202
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,260
Having them here would only serve as a book collection.

203
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,700
There are many poor students in the academy

204
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,860
who love books as much as their lives.

205
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,380
It would be more meaningful to give these to them.

206
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,220
The generals are with the guests

207
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,180
while you're hiding here.

208
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:25,820
Someone who doesn't know what's going on

209
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,620
may think you're having a fight with His Highness.

210
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,940
The caravan is still outside.

211
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,340
It's not too late to go now.

212
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,740
I don't want to go.

213
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,430
Huan Yu loves books as much as his life.

214
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,820
He's lucky to have met you.

215
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,260
Why aren't you going with them, Master?

216
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,820
I was going to go.

217
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,260
Have a good time.

218
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,500
They've already left.

219
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,380
I was waiting for you.

220
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,620
I saw you didn't come down.

221
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,820
So I came up here to hurry you.

222
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,900
Why are you waiting for me?

223
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,620
For a night tour of the Western State.

224
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:34,740
[Nanchen Royal Mansion]

225
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,740
Where to?

226
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,560
To the famous Weiyang Palace,

227
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,060
Changle Palace, and Mingguang Palace

228
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,060
of the Western State, of course.

229
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,260
What's there to see when there's no one there?

230
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,940
That's exactly why

231
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,140
it would be nice to go now.

232
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,300
Leaving the Weiyang Palace,

233
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,660
we'll take the road to Xi'an Gate

234
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,980
to sightsee the ruins

235
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,380
of the world-famous E-pang Palace.

236
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,300
It's all burnt down. What's there to see?

237
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,460
Though it's burnt down,

238
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,260
it was once the most famous palace in the world.

239
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,020
It's a pretty special experience

240
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,380
to gaze upon the moon at the ruins.

241
00:13:59,100 --> 00:13:59,820
Let's go.

242
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,300
Are we not waiting for Master?

243
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,100
Is he going?

244
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:05,820
Is he

245
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,740
not going?

246
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,540
He's not going.

247
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,140
He has his own plans.

248
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,340
We are the only ones to accompany the guests tonight.

249
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,700
Your Highness.

250
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,180
Where are you going?

251
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:24,980
Open the door.

252
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,220
Yes.

253
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,460
Why didn't you go with her?

254
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,300
Who said I would go with her?

255
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,100
The Prince of Fengyang said so.

256
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,340
He said that, so he go accompany her.

257
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,980
They're people from Nanchen Royal Mansion.

258
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,060
That's General Zhou.

259
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,140
General Zhou!

260
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,340
Where are they going?

261
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,660
Xi'an Gate.

262
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,860
What about us?

263
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:23,780
Chucheng Gate.

264
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,180
We're going the exact opposite direction.

265
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,380
Let's get going.

266
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,980
What are you looking at?

267
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,860
Nothing.

268
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,260
It's really lively tonight.

269
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,860
It's as if they are celebrating the Lantern Festival.

270
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,460
You're not answering my question.

271
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,460
You must be hiding something.

272
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,580
The Western State used to be the capital city

273
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,900
where the imperial chefs used to live.

274
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,660
As time went on and this place became well-known,

275
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,900
many vendors from all around the kingdom

276
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,100
came to this street selling all kinds of food.

277
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,300
Do you come here often?

278
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,180
I came here often for food

279
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,180
when I first arrived in the Western State.

280
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,260
Do you want to have that?

281
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,500
Let's go.

282
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,060
I'll take you to eat

283
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,060
something even better.

284
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,180
Come and have a look!

285
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,060
Take a look!

286
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,140
Freshly slaughtered sheep!

287
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:43,700
This is it.

288
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,180
Roasted, stewed, fried, and braised!

289
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,180
Lamb soup is provided to all customers!

290
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,700
Come and have a look!

291
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,140
Fresh lamb feet!

292
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,140
Lamb head, lamb meat!

293
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,980
We have enough for everyone!

294
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,940
Come and have a look!

295
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,740
Sir,

296
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,380
could we share the table with you?

297
00:17:01,099 --> 00:17:02,300
We have our weapons with us

298
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,940
and have been looking around for seats,

299
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:05,300
but everyone has refused us.

300
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,060
Please have a seat.

301
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:08,900
Thank you.

302
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,540
You've also come from outside the city

303
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,940
to eat at this restaurant, right?

304
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:18,500
Yes, that's right.

305
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,380
And you?

306
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,220
We're looking for a good master

307
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,260
and build up our careers.

308
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,460
Have you found such a person?

309
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,180
We came to the Western State

310
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,500
intending to join the Junior Prince of Nanchen.

311
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:30,820
But unfortunately...

312
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,740
Here's the lamb soup!

313
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:32,980
Here's your lamb soup!

314
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,540
Thank you.

315
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,460
Brother, here.

316
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,220
Thank you.

317
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,980
Enjoy your meal.

318
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,100
Unfortunately what?

319
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,620
If we follow him in the Western State,

320
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,140
we would have to work hard

321
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,580
just to gain a reputation.

322
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,380
However, that is not what we want.

323
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,940
We struggle

324
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,420
not for fame

325
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,020
but for wealth, prosperity, and a future.

326
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,420
That's right.

327
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,820
The Junior Prince of Nanchen doesn't love gold and silver.

328
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,900
He has no ambitions.

329
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,180
He doesn't even love women.

330
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,180
I heard from people here that

331
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,420
the generals who follow him are all like this.

332
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,290
They don't want to be rewarded, they just want to serve their country.

333
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,680
We can't be

334
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:15,860
such people.

335
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,050
So what's the alternative?

336
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,820
Who do you want to follow?

337
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,020
Jin Rong of Taiyuan Army.

338
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,380
If we follow him, at least we'll be well fed, well clothed,

339
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,380
and well paid.

340
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:39,780
Thank you, brother.

341
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,020
Here.

342
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,500
The bread tastes better in the soup.

343
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,260
Among the 13 counties in Beichen,

344
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,500
only the Nanchen Royal Army

345
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,860
is invincible

346
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,220
and wins every battle.

347
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,540
That is because their chief commander is good.

348
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,740
Though he defends this land,

349
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,060
he wants not a royal name,

350
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,200
has no interest in amassing wealth and the supreme power,

351
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,560
nor does he lust for women.

352
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,600
Under the heavens,

353
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,880
he is the only one who deserves

354
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,360
the reputation of "beauty bones".

355
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,080
That's right, that's right!

356
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,980
[Daxing Gate]

357
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,360
Your Highness.

358
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,320
I was wondering who His Highness would...

359
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,480
It turns out to be Miss Cui.

360
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,000
Don't talk nonsense.

361
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:56,720
Be careful not to ruin

362
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,960
the reputation of His Highness and the royal army.

363
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,800
His Highness is going to the Wei River again?

364
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,240
Open the gate.

365
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,360
Bring me a horse.

366
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,000
Yes.

367
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,400
Do you often come here, Master?

368
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,280
The first time I suffered severe injuries

369
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,880
was at this place.

370
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,160
It was when I was a teenager.

371
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,320
We won that battle by a narrow margin,

372
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,800
suffered many casualties,

373
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,040
leaving behind a mountain of bloody corpses.

374
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,520
That victory did not please me.

375
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,680
So I got drunk here.

376
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,640
In fact, there is no good

377
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,360
following me.

378
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,160
For many years,

379
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,040
the Nanchen Royal Army has made countless achievements.

380
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,400
But the royal court is still suspicious of me.

381
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,760
Thus I've never been able to seek the reward

382
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,320
my subordinates deserve.

383
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,720
I'm sorry for them.

384
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,880
We never

385
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,600
wanted a reward.

386
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,680
People of the royal army and the royal mansion

387
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,040
aren't the only ones who understand you.

388
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,160
When I was in mourning for my uncle,

389
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,480
Mother and I often talked about you.

390
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,840
I told my mother,

391
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,760
in the eyes of outsiders,

392
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,520
there were 700,000 capable men

393
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,080
in Nanchen Royal Army.

394
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,400
However, their numbers kept decreasing with each war

395
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,240
and not many people wanted to join them.

396
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,120
If things continued like this,

397
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,120
even the strongest royal army

398
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,150
would disappear one day.

399
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,760
Mother said,

400
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:15,600
it doesn't matter if the soldiers are gone.

401
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:19,660
Zhousheng Chen of the Western State has been guarding the people in the city

402
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,180
for half his life,

403
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,740
if one day he is no more in power,

404
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,660
the Cui family will give him the academy.

405
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,260
Mother also said

406
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,700
that kingdoms changed hands easily

407
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,100
but a hero did not appear often.

408
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,180
I'm not a hero.

409
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,020
I'm also selfish.

410
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,820
I also have some things I want to do

411
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,060
but can't.

412
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:12,920
It's going to rain soon.

413
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,010
I'll go get the horse.

414
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,060
I don't want to go back to the city.

415
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,220
I mean

416
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,180
the city gate is too far.

417
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,540
Let's find a place to take shelter

418
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,940
and go back when the rain stops.

419
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:31,190
No matter where we go,

420
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,990
we have to get the horse, right?

421
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:57,820
This rain

422
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,500
came just in time.

423
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,760
Why are you monks

424
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:01,940
so difficult to understand?

425
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,380
When was this palace locked?

426
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,620
As soon as Master entered the Western State,

427
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,100
he gave orders to

428
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,300
lock all the palaces.

429
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,260
Do you believe it?

430
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,740
He never came here.

431
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,620
The locking was all done

432
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,060
by my eldest sister.

433
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,220
He didn't come

434
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,660
because he's afraid people would say

435
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,300
he wanted to be an emperor.

436
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,660
Master doesn't

437
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,820
care about the gossip of others.

438
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,420
He once said

439
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,060
if a general

440
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,660
lost his reputation,

441
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,540
the army would surely get lax.

442
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:48,180
Of the 13 counties in Beichen,

443
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,700
the Western State

444
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,700
is the only one that no one dares to invade.

445
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:54,460
This is all because of Zhousheng Chen.

446
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,020
How dare you!

447
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,220
No one has ever

448
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,420
said that to me.

449
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,620
Though you say you want to be a monk,

450
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,340
inside, you still want to be a prince.

451
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:37,900
Where are you going?

452
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,380
Going somewhere else for shelter.

453
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,580
Let's go inside.

454
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:14,290
Sit here.

455
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:22,980
How do you know

456
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,420
there are abandoned houses here?

457
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,540
I gave the order to

458
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,300
evict the villagers here.

459
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,220
In the past, soldiers were recruited here.

460
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,860
Most of the men died in the war.

461
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,740
What's left here were

462
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,740
the old, weak and young.

463
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,780
Xiaoyu helped them move a few years ago

464
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,260
and relocated them in the Western State.

465
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,740
Thank you. Thank you.

466
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,140
Thank you.

467
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,020
I say, young man.

468
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,340
Dry her hair first.

469
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,820
Why do you keep wiping her face?

470
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,020
She'll get sick

471
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,180
with hair being wet all night.

472
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,140
We found a good place.

473
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,420
There's even a fire.

474
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,140
Come here.

475
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:52,820
Come and sit down.

476
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,020
You know her?

477
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,780
She's a beautiful lady.

478
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,900
If you like her,

479
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,300
take her with you.

480
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,900
We're not far from the Western State.

481
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,220
Don't cause any more trouble.

482
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,780
I'm afraid of

483
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,180
the Junior Prince of Nanchen.

484
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,620
Sit here and rest for a while.

485
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,180
Should we leave?

486
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,580
We don't know what's going on outside.

487
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,500
Let's wait for a while.

488
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,340
Friends outside the house,

489
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,780
do you guys want to come in to warm up by the fire?

490
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,700
There is an empty room here.

491
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,180
We'll get a fire started.

492
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,020
All right then.

493
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,700
It's too close to the Western State.

494
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,420
It's better we leave early.

495
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,740
Leave at dawn.

496
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,100
What are you afraid of?

497
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:50,940
If we run into the Nanchen Royal Army,

498
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,580
just say we were defeated soldiers.

499
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:55,150
War is going on everywhere.

500
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,700
No one would know which county we're from.

501
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,940
I didn't know what was going on inside the house

502
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,020
and was afraid of hurting Miss Cui.

503
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:16,780
For my failure to come in and save you,

504
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,580
I beg for your mercy, Your Highness.

505
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,580
Who are these people?

506
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,980
They are deserters from the siege of Yongcheng.

507
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,140
According to them,

508
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,020
there was a general who collaborated with the enemy in the house.

509
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,500
There are commoners in the house.

510
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,460
Don't hurt them by mistake.

511
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:29,620
Yes.

512
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,340
Greetings, Your Highness.

513
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:49,980
Forgive me for not recognizing you.

514
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,660
It's all right.

515
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,740
Zhangsun Jie.

516
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,820
Boil a pot of hot water

517
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,620
and get some meat and wine

518
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,660
for the people here.

519
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,500
Serve them well.

520
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,020
Yes, Your Highness.

521
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,460
-Thank you, Your Highness.
-Thank you, Your Highness.

522
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,540
Thank you, Your Highness. - Thank you, Your Highness.

523
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,580
Why did you save Liu Changshan?

524
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,300
He put in a good word for me

525
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,060
when I was down and out.

526
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,700
Then why did you kill that man?

527
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,020
When Yongcheng was under siege,

528
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,380
he was in league with the enemy

529
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,780
and sold out the prefectural governor

530
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:32,820
and the people.

531
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,580
So...

532
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,020
Though you knew you would offend me,

533
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,980
you risked your life to sneak back here anyway

534
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,540
just to kill him?

535
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,540
That's right.

536
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,140
You can go now.

537
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,420
I threatened you.

538
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,580
Don't you want to kill me?

539
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,100
Tonight,

540
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,340
you killed him out of loyalty.

541
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,700
If I seize the chance

542
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,980
to take you to the Western State,

543
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,740
I'm afraid I won't be able to console

544
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,140
the dead prefectural governor

545
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,980
and the soldiers who died in Yongcheng.

546
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:04,820
Come.

547
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,340
Thank you for not killing me, Your Highness.

548
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,540
But I still hope Your Highness

549
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,440
won't easily let your enemy go

550
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,290
in the future.

551
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,900
You'd better run far away

552
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,460
and stop doing bad deeds.

553
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,540
Let him go.

554
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,980
We'll leave at dawn and go back to the Western State.

555
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:11,700
Yes.

556
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,140
You should rest.

557
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,580
I'll watch the fire.

558
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,100
Are you not tired?

559
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,420
It doesn't feel right, letting him go.

560
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,220
Let me teach you a lesson.

561
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,420
Everything that has happened

562
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,580
is inevitable.

563
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,300
It's useless to overthink about it.

564
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,420
Since you don't want to sleep,

565
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,820
why don't I draw a chessboard

566
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:58,980
and let's play chess.

567
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,820
My junior sisters and I always talk about you.

568
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:19,900
Really?

569
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:21,739
What do you talk about?

570
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,100
Many things.

571
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,420
All kinds of things.

572
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,940
For example,

573
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:29,060
you inherited the title from your uncle

574
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:29,940
and took the liberty of

575
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,420
adding "Junior" in front of it

576
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,420
as a sign of being a subject.

577
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:34,060
The late emperor wrote a letter to criticize you

578
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,980
because of this,

579
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:37,659
saying you changed your title without permission

580
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,620
and that you showed no respect for the emperor.

581
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,980
The emperor did that

582
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,139
for the others to see.

583
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,380
Was it because of your merits?

584
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,020
Did the late emperor

585
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,500
really not suspect you?

586
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,980
It doesn't matter.

587
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,740
Why doesn't it matter?

588
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,860
You've been leading the army for many years

589
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:07,900
with no wife and no children.

590
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,540
If they are still suspicious of you

591
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,060
then even I would feel sorry for you.

592
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,100
I've been away with the army

593
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,780
not for the sake of protecting the kingdom.

594
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:17,780
It is for the sake of peace

595
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:19,070
in the country.

596
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,860
I only hope

597
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:22,870
that people can live in peace.

598
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,940
General, the rain has stopped.

599
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,700
His Highness and Miss Cui really get along well.

600
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,620
Those who don't know would think they are a couple.

601
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:41,980
They've been playing chess for two hours

602
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:42,820
and still haven't gotten tired of it.

603
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,420
I was afraid you'd say something like that.

604
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,660
His Highness opened the door half way.

605
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:49,140
In doing so,

606
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,940
he hopes to protect

607
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:52,800
the reputation of Miss Cui.

608
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,760
You've won again.

609
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,380
If I can't beat you, how am I your master?

610
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,380
You must have not

611
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,300
taught me all your chess skills.

612
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,140
You admit it?

613
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:18,900
I do.

614
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,260
Don't you want to rest?

615
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,500
One more round.

616
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,180
One more round?

617
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,460
Then I'm going to win

618
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,980
the next round more slowly.

619
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,820
Drawing the chessboard

620
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,580
is much more difficult than playing chess.

621
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,250
Zhangsun Jie!

622
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,700
What's your order, Your Highness?

623
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,020
Can you draw a chessboard?

624
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,060
Well...

625
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,540
Forget it.

626
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:53,740
Bring us some food.

627
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:54,900
Yes, Your Highness.

628
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:30,970
I'm ready.

629
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:32,970
Let's go.

630
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:34,720
Hold on.

631
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,820
You'll meet many people

632
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,460
when returning to the city later.

633
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,260
Your Highness, we are ready to leave.

634
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,060
Good.

635
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,980
There's no breeze at all.

636
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,620
Come and help me.

637
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,140
Me?

638
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:55,980
Yes.

639
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,380
I can't see.

640
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,340
What can I do for you?

641
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,540
Can you come to me by hearing my voice?

642
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,260
Come here for a moment.

643
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,940
Be careful.

644
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,460
Yes, you've got the right direction.

645
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:13,740
Watch your step.

646
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,060
What are you doing?

647
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,420
What can I do?

648
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,340
Follow the wooden chair

649
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,700
and you'll find a scroll of bamboo.

650
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,140
There.

651
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:30,740
Try harder.

652
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,060
Thank you.

653
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,740
You're welcome.

654
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,020
You're blind.

655
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,220
I can't walk.

656
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,820
We can be companions.

657
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,780
I don't want to be your companion.

658
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,740
You don't like me?

659
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,100
You talk too much.

660
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,260
It's noisy.

661
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,100
You...

662
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:02,700
Be careful.

663
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,540
It's rare to hear

664
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,060
Xie Chen talking so much with someone.

665
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,180
It's rare you have time

666
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,220
to come to talk with me.

667
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,500
You've been here all day.

668
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,340
You should get out of the mansion.

669
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,340
I won't go out.

670
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,100
I'll waste the time of a soldier

671
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,620
if I do.

672
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,100
I might as well stay here and bask in the sun

673
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,940
so as not to cause you guys any trouble.

674
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,660
Master has asked me several times

675
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:25,660
if there is a place

676
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,540
for you to go.

677
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:27,860
I want to ask about your opinion.

678
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,220
I have my own plans.

679
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,380
There's no need for you guys to worry.

680
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,460
Where do you want to go?

681
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,220
I thought you wouldn't be able to shoot well

682
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,420
with a troubled mind.

683
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,180
Qin Yan's letter says

684
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,900
Advisor Xie may not survive the winter.

685
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,900
I want to send someone to bring him back.

686
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:57,460
That's a good idea.

687
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,100
You change the subject

688
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,660
when you're troubled.

689
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,540
Do you want to prove to me

690
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,180
or do you want to prove to yourself

691
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,460
that you're still the Zhousheng Chen

692
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,220
whose mind is as calm as still water?

693
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,400
You're wrong.

694
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,200
I've never been a person

695
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,560
whose mind is as calm as still water.

696
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,820
I'm here to say goodbye to Your Highness.

697
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:26,740
I have asked someone

698
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,060
to prepare a carriage for you.

699
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,430
General Zhou and General Feng

700
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,070
will personally escort you to Yongcheng.

701
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,740
Since I'm about to say goodbye,

702
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,580
Prince of Fengyang, this time...

703
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:40,940
I'll go over there first.

704
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:53,660
Your Highness.

705
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,860
I want to see the child of Gao family.

706
00:41:58,620 --> 00:41:59,620
Who told you that?

707
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,300
It was the Prince of Pingqin.

708
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,300
He accidentally revealed this

709
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,900
while comforting me.

710
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,020
I've never told it to anyone else.

711
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:11,700
I just want to see the boy.

712
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,480
He is the smartest disciple

713
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,820
of mine.

714
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,390
Once you approach him,

715
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:17,660
he will definitely be able to sense

716
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:18,910
something fishy.

717
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:22,420
I've seen all Your Highness' disciples

718
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,560
back in the Central State.

719
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,860
Can you tell me which one he is?
