1
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:29,979
[One and Only]

2
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:32,979
[Episode 15]

3
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,440
I'm here to say goodbye to Your Highness.

4
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,460
I have asked someone

5
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:41,700
to prepare a carriage for you.

6
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,259
General Zhou and General Feng

7
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,060
will personally escort you to Yongcheng.

8
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,300
Since I'm about to say goodbye,

9
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,979
Prince of Fengyang, this time…

10
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:54,380
I'll go over there first.

11
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,260
Your Highness.

12
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,700
I want to see the child of Gao family.

13
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,300
Who told you that?

14
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,060
It was the Prince of Pingqin.

15
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,900
He accidentally revealed this

16
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,500
when comforting me.

17
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,620
I've never told it to anyone else.

18
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,420
I just want to see the boy.

19
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,300
He is the smartest disciple

20
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,500
of mine.

21
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,140
Once you approach him,

22
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,380
he will definitely be able to sense

23
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,660
something fishy.

24
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,020
I've seen all Your Highness' disciples

25
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,380
back in the Central State.

26
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,579
Can you tell me which one he is?

27
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,820
I promised to a dear friend of mine

28
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,260
I'd never reveal his identity

29
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,500
to anyone in this life.

30
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:49,620
I won't tell anyone.

31
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,700
Huaiyang thanks Your Highness for my family.

32
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,340
Your Highness, you've been hiding from me for several days.

33
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,180
Is it for her?

34
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,900
It is.

35
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,300
And also for my brother.

36
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,340
Why are you outside the archery range?

37
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,740
They're saying goodbye.

38
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,020
From this moment on,

39
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,220
I will let go of

40
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,860
the obsession of the first half of my life,

41
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,220
to be the Crown Princess of Pingqin.

42
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,500
Your Highness.

43
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,540
Please take care of yourself.

44
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,500
You're going to guard Luyuan?

45
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,100
Master, these last few months

46
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:14,980
you have been trying to decide

47
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,260
what to do with me.

48
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,060
Why don't you let me choose for myself?

49
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,540
Where is Luyuan?

50
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,220
Luyuan is on the north of the Great Wall,

51
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,420
where the royal army guards the border.

52
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,020
Xie Yun.

53
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,740
You finally dare pay me a visit?

54
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,740
Why won't you stay in the Western State?

55
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,900
Everyone has their own reasons

56
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,340
for the choices they make.

57
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,900
But it's not as peaceful as here.

58
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,180
Foreign enemies are a constant threat.

59
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,420
It's too dangerous for you there.

60
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,740
I'm a general.

61
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,620
I was born to fight the enemy.

62
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,940
That's in the past.

63
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,460
Xie Yun.

64
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,060
Won't you stop pushing yourself so hard?

65
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,700
No.

66
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,140
You're sulking?

67
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,460
I'm not your future husband, you know.

68
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,580
It's useless to give me that attitude.

69
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,460
You're changing the subject.

70
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:26,820
You know very well

71
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,060
that you can't persuade me.

72
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:28,860
If you can afford to

73
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,220
waste your time here,

74
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,900
why don't you go get packed

75
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,020
and see me off?

76
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,180
It's much colder here than in the Western State.

77
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,659
You're still recovering from your injuries. Will you be able to stand the cold?

78
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,300
Don't worry, Master.

79
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,460
I can take it.

80
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:04,860
Your Highness.

81
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,220
No need to perform the rites of courtesy.

82
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,420
Thank you, Your Highness.

83
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,100
General Xie, you...

84
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,180
One of my legs was wounded.

85
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,980
But I still have one good one left.

86
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,340
What?

87
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,520
Afraid that a general with only one good leg

88
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,780
can't defend the border?

89
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,220
Don't forget me.

90
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,590
I'll stay with General Xie,

91
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,900
you can rest assured.

92
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,300
Wait, Zhangsun Jie.

93
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,460
I thought

94
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,020
you were under my command.

95
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,220
When did you join Xie Yun?

96
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,460
Exactly today.

97
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,780
After I saw the Great Wall,

98
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,100
I decided to stay here.

99
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,380
This place can't compare to the Western State.

100
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:40,980
Are you sure you won't regret it?

101
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,220
I know I won't.

102
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:43,940
General Xie

103
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,300
is far more interesting than you.

104
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,420
I'm sure I won't regret

105
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,900
to make the decision to stay here.

106
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,270
Listen.

107
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:50,740
What can we call this?

108
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,260
This is "Abandon the old for the new."

109
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,820
Do you really want to stay in Luyuan

110
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,940
with General Xie?

111
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,740
I'm not lying.

112
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,700
Good.

113
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,100
Then I will entrust General Xie

114
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:04,980
to your care.

115
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:05,980
I hear and obey.

116
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,220
Master, you've got it all wrong.

117
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,420
He is following me.

118
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,880
I should be the one to take care of him.

119
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,960
Why put it the other way around

120
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,680
and entrust me to him?

121
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,310
This is a cavalry bow.

122
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,360
There aren't any of this sort in the palace.

123
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,360
Cavalry bows and arrows

124
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,480
are different from

125
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,640
infantry ones.

126
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,159
Generally speaking,

127
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,920
infantry bows and arrows are more powerful

128
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,840
while cavalry bows and arrows are lighter.

129
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,640
The feathers on the arrows used by Master

130
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,000
are either from eagles or hawks.

131
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,040
Each one of them was taken from Master's hunts

132
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,240
since he was a child.

133
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:49,159
This is from an eagle.

134
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:53,720
Are there any more white eagle feathers?

135
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:54,680
Of course.

136
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:55,950
The white eagle feathers have been well kept.

137
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,640
No one dares touch them.

138
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,120
Bring them to me.

139
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:58,800
Yes, Master.

140
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,520
Ten years ago,

141
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,720
Master hunted a white eagle.

142
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,640
It was extremely rare.

143
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,480
There was no impurity on the feathers at all.

144
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,840
Since he hunted it,

145
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,880
he has kept its feathers in his possession,

146
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,800
unwilling to make arrows from them.

147
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,760
Three white feathers

148
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,920
can be made into one arrow.

149
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,690
This box of feathers can make exactly ten arrows.

150
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,460
You don't have to go to war to kill the enemy.

151
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,200
That's enough.

152
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,360
You're giving them to me?

153
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,150
It's useless to keep them anyway.

154
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,820
Why not make arrows out of them for you?

155
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,720
Consider it a gift for your birthday next year.

156
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,840
Master is finally putting in some effort.

157
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,880
When have I ever done any less?

158
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,280
You just gave her brocade every year.

159
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,000
There's none better at taking

160
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
the easiest path than you.

161
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,240
That brocade was proof of the blood

162
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,960
spilled by the royal army for the people.

163
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,240
Every year, this gift

164
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:53,760
was my favorite.

165
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:04,840
Don't ever say

166
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,040
I'm not fond of you.

167
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,840
This is a hand-stitched gift

168
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,120
from me, General Feng.

169
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,720
This is a remote place,

170
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,960
and you have an injury on your leg.

171
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,080
This will protect you from frostbite

172
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,040
during the winter.

173
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,480
It was worth it to injure my leg.

174
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,720
You've grown wise,

175
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,240
starting to care for me like this.

176
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,920
Don't talk nonsense.

177
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,800
Although the military doctor said

178
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,840
you couldn't mount a horse anymore,

179
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,200
I believe that one day

180
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,520
you will come back to us,

181
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,480
and to the army.

182
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,670
I'll just imagine you're out on a mission

183
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,040
during this time.

184
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,520
Don't get indolent.

185
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,280
As you command.

186
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,080
I'll keep your instruction in mind.

187
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,080
Behave yourself while I'm absent.

188
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,640
Don't get into any more trouble.

189
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,080
I...

190
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,920
If someone goes to the master

191
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,200
to complain about you in the future,

192
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,920
no one will cover for you.

193
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,720
Is that my fault?

194
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,760
Isn't it that young lady's fault?

195
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,520
I helped her out,

196
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,600
and she complained about me

197
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,400
in front of Master in turn.

198
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,080
Couples fight

199
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,560
all the time.

200
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,720
You can't break three of a man's fingers

201
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,080
just because

202
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,680
he pointed at his wife's nose.

203
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,920
You fought for no clear reason.

204
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,200
Who was the one that got hurt?

205
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,240
Master gave me

206
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,640
seven days of confinement.

207
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,480
You

208
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,720
just won't learn the lesson.

209
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,200
Master should have punished you more severely.

210
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,280
All right.

211
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,640
I won't make that mistake next time.

212
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,760
If I do it again, punish me

213
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,280
by not letting me lead the army

214
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,680
and making me guard the border with you.

215
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:31,480
Then I wish you could make mistakes as soon as possible.

216
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,600
What did you say?

217
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,840
I said, "That would be unworthy of your talents."

218
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,400
That's true.

219
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,120
Master wouldn't want to punish me too severely.

220
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,000
Are you thirsty?

221
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,120
Let me get you a cup of water.

222
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,080
Okay.

223
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,980
[Mingguang Palace]

224
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,280
Zixing.

225
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:15,760
Zixing.

226
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,600
Zixing.

227
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,380
Your Majesty.

228
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,740
Lie down.

229
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,420
Why is your hand so cold?

230
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,460
Grand Mentor Xie is sick.

231
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,580
You are now sick too.

232
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,420
There is nothing

233
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,820
that can make me happy.

234
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,460
You're about to become a father.

235
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,940
Doesn't that make you happy?

236
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,060
Once the baby is born,

237
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,580
I will definitely be urged by my mother to name someone the Crown Prince.

238
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,580
As a father, you should think of your children.

239
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,140
Since Your Majesty has a child of your own,

240
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,300
it's only right

241
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,900
to pass the throne to your own child.

242
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,020
But the throne

243
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,860
should have been yours.

244
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,540
I have a question that may not be proper.

245
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,620
If one day

246
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,820
Your Majesty has to kill me,

247
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:26,100
will you be kind enough to let me go?

248
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,740
Why would I want to kill you?

249
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,980
If the courtiers think that

250
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,220
only by killing me

251
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,660
can Your Majesty's son

252
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,140
succeed the throne,

253
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,220
would you do it?

254
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,500
No.

255
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,900
Absolutely not.

256
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,260
Thank you, Your Majesty.

257
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,220
I hope Concubine Jiang

258
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,500
can bring Your Majesty a son.

259
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,700
So do I.

260
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,540
I will never hurt you.

261
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,020
Your Majesty.

262
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,460
Your Majesty.

263
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,220
Cui Feng.

264
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,460
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

265
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,180
Let's go and see Grand Mentor Xie.

266
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,780
You and Cui Feng haven't seen each other for years.

267
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,020
Have a good chat.

268
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,060
I'm going to be a father.

269
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,820
You're going to be a father too.

270
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,700
Think about it, that's something to be happy about anyway.

271
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,660
My aunt won't let me enter the palace.

272
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,420
If it weren't for His Majesty

273
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,300
summoning General Cui to the palace for talks,

274
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,900
I don't know when I could see you.

275
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,100
You're going to be a mother?

276
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,780
It's not true.

277
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,660
It's just my excuse for leaving Shouyang.

278
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,260
You're a princess.

279
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,380
How dare you lie about being pregnant?

280
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,180
If I didn't lie,

281
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,700
how could I have possibly come back?

282
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,380
What about your illness?

283
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,900
What is that about?

284
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,140
Did my aunt force you to leave the palace?

285
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,180
Sickness is a good excuse,

286
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,100
but it won't last long.

287
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,540
That's for real.

288
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,380
The imperial doctor said

289
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,220
three years at most.

290
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,860
Three years of what?

291
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,340
Three more years of my life.

292
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,780
No way.

293
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,300
They are just a few quacks.

294
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,500
Don't trust them.

295
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,340
We'll get another doctor to treat you.

296
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,580
That's enough.

297
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,940
Enough to get back

298
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,700
what should've been mine.

299
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:28,580
Don't go back to Shouyang this time.

300
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,020
Why?

301
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,460
I'm going to decree an edict

302
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,740
to make you the prefectural governor of Taiyuan.

303
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,020
How can I be

304
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:37,620
so qualified

305
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,020
as to be the prefectural governor of Taiyuan?

306
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,180
I absolutely won't do it.

307
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,260
It's not some plum job,

308
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,380
it's a pit of hell.

309
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,340
Jin Rong has been

310
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,460
spending all his money

311
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,020
on recruiting troops everywhere

312
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,060
on the pretext of quelling the rebellion.

313
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,580
The army of Taiyuan is growing stronger.

314
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,060
After the death of the former prefectural governor,

315
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,700
the position has been vacant.

316
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,060
Those who are capable are not loyal enough,

317
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,460
while those who are loyal are not capable enough

318
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,220
to suppress Jin Rong.

319
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,780
Have you told His Highness

320
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:18,900
about this?

321
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,500
I...

322
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,340
His Highness has already mobilized

323
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,060
200,000 soldiers

324
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,940
and stationed them in the west of Taiyuan

325
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,780
to guard against him.

326
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,860
But Taiyuan is too close to the Central State.

327
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,180
If something really happens

328
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,340
and news doesn't get out in time,

329
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,500
it will be too late

330
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,580
for the Western State to save it.

331
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,060
I've been unable to find

332
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,180
the right person for the job

333
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,380
until you suddenly returned to the capital.

334
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,980
Cui Feng.

335
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,460
Only your ability and loyalty

336
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,819
can reassure His Majesty.

337
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,819
I'd like to take over the position

338
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,420
and go to Taiyuan for Your Majesty.

339
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,819
Thank you for your sacrifice, General.

340
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,900
Has the prefectural governor of Taiyuan finally been decided?

341
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,860
I'm afraid General Cui's trip to Taiyuan

342
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,500
will be unlucky.

343
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,460
My son is

344
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,980
even wary of his own mother.

345
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,860
But he trusts firmly

346
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,500
the people from the Western State.

347
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,780
But

348
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,860
he does have a good eye for people.

349
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,060
Even if all the world is against him,

350
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:59,100
Zhousheng Chen will defend the kingdom for him.

351
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,660
It's a pity.

352
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:07,020
There is a traitor among you in the royal army.

353
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,300
Xie Chong didn't die.

354
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,460
I guess I should help him.

355
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,860
I beg you, Your Majesty, to spare Grand Mentor Xie's life.

356
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,100
If he knew

357
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,380
you were in my chamber right now,

358
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,020
he would have had you killed.

359
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,060
If you plead for his life,

360
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,740
you are asking for your death.

361
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,140
Do you understand?

362
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,180
In the past, he taught me a lot

363
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,300
when I was in the royal army.

364
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,940
I beg you to be lenient.

365
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,740
When Grand Mentor Xie recovers,

366
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,820
I will find an excuse

367
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,780
to send him out of the palace.

368
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,660
He'll never threaten

369
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,540
your great work.

370
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,740
I can't wait any longer.

371
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:09,580
My grandson will be born soon.

372
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,820
I just can't wait any longer.

373
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,720
I, Yang Shao,

374
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,070
come to greet the prefectural governor.

375
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,420
What did you call yourself?

376
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,660
I am

377
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,300
Yang Shao, who was stationed at Yongcheng.

378
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,340
You're the one who kidnapped Shiyi?

379
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,540
It was me.

380
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,540
I've defected to General Jin.

381
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,980
I will work with you

382
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,220
together in Taiyuan in the future.

383
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,460
Let's not talk about the future.

384
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,940
Let's settle old scores today.

385
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:04,620
Wait a minute.

386
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,220
Last month I ran into

387
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,700
the Junior Prince of Nanchen and Miss Cui.

388
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,020
His Highness let me live.

389
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,380
Those old scores were settled long ago.

390
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,900
If you don't believe me,

391
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,420
you can go to the Western State and ask around.

392
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,260
If I'm lying,

393
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,660
you can kill me

394
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,740
anytime you want.

395
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,300
But I guess

396
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,300
you have more important things to do here.

397
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,260
No need to waste time on me.

398
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,300
Although I have joined General Jin,

399
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,420
I still remember that

400
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,620
Miss Cui once saved me.

401
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,340
If you get into trouble in Taiyuan,

402
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,380
I will be your only helper.

403
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,380
Now that we've talked through it,

404
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,060
we'll be partners

405
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:50,780
and fellow soldiers from this day on.

406
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,100
Taiyuan is ahead.

407
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:55,900
Good wine and cuisine

408
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,740
have been prepared for you.

409
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,580
Let's go.

410
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:16,410
Your Majesty.

411
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,100
I beg Your Majesty…

412
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,820
g-give me a hand.

413
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,500
Your Majesty.

414
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,540
Before Concubine Jiang gives birth to your son,

415
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:45,540
find a chance to imprison the empress dowager.

416
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,780
How could I do that again?

417
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,180
If you don't imprison her,

418
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,800
she will kill you sooner or later.

419
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:59,860
She and Liu Wei are already colluding.

420
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,320
Once the little prince is born,

421
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:05,620
they will certainly make their move.

422
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,910
What your mother needs is

423
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,860
just a puppet.

424
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,780
Once the little prince is born,

425
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,120
you will be of no use

426
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,820
to her.

427
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,820
Your Majesty.

428
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,180
But...but I have wronged her.

429
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,140
I can't…

430
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,800
As a foreign minister,

431
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:28,740
how dare you disregard the courtesy a subject owes his ruler

432
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,380
and accept treatment in His Majesty's chamber?

433
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:34,660
Xie Chong, are you aware of your guilt?

434
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,040
Of course I am.

435
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,050
Take him away!

436
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:40,940
Stop it!

437
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,500
Mother.

438
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,220
If you have a grudge against me,

439
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,130
just punish me.

440
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:47,980
Why do you have to take it out on Grand Mentor Xie?

441
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,580
Your Majesty is the emperor.

442
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,820
No one can punish you.

443
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:55,780
This man

444
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:58,020
is not only guilty of disrespect.

445
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,420
He is also guilty of deceiving Your Majesty.

446
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,260
When has he ever deceived me?

447
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,860
Which clan is

448
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,900
your wedded wife from?

449
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,820
His wedded wife

450
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:18,580
is from the Gao clan of traitors.

451
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,420
When Your Majesty was born,

452
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,300
the Gao clan tried to poison you several times.

453
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,500
If I hadn't have taken precautions,

454
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,380
Your Majesty would have been

455
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,260
on the road to death.

456
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,460
After Your Majesty's ascension to the throne,

457
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,780
They even tried to rebel.

458
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,060
Fortunately, I uncovered their plot,

459
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,260
and saved Your Majesty again.

460
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:47,780
Now Xie Chong has concealed everything

461
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,540
ingratiated himself by helping you in the palace.

462
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,740
He's just waiting for an opportunity

463
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,220
to avenge the fall of the Gao clan.

464
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:01,060
Is it true, what my mother has said?

465
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,500
Your Majesty.

466
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:08,700
I am guilty of deceiving Your Majesty.

467
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,740
Take him away.

468
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,660
Please, Mother.

469
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,780
For the sake of

470
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,820
his many years of service to me,

471
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,780
spare his life.

472
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,140
Stop them and help the grand mentor back to his bed.

473
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:29,300
Qin Yan, why don't you move?

474
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,780
Do you want to disobey my order?

475
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,620
Close the inner and outer gates of the palace.

476
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,780
From this day on, no foreign ministers are permitted

477
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,820
in His Majesty's chambers.

478
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,380
Other than Concubine Jiang,

479
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,900
no concubine of the palace

480
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,060
is allowed to see His Majesty.

481
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:51,100
Yes.

482
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,620
Qin Yan.

483
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,060
I misjudged you.

484
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,460
His Highness has misjudged you too.

485
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,220
Your Majesty.

486
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,900
Your Majesty.

487
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,300
What should we do?

488
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:29,460
I don't know either.

489
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,340
Her Majesty Empress Dowager is here.

490
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,380
Greetings, Your Majesty.

491
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,780
The grand mentor is seriously ill.

492
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,540
His Majesty is so upset about this that

493
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,900
he too has fallen ill.

494
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,980
I will take over His Majesty's administration

495
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:23,420
until the day His Majesty gets well.

496
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,580
There is also a happy event taking place in the palace.

497
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:35,540
I saw a good sign in my dream.

498
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,020
This time, His Majesty

499
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,190
will get a son.

500
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:43,580
I'm going to celebrate in the palace for half a month

501
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,340
until the birth of my royal grandson.

502
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,020
Prime Minister.

503
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,740
Congratulations to His Majesty! Congratulations to Your Majesty Empress Dowager!

504
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:02,660
Congratulations to His Majesty! Congratulations to Your Majesty Empress Dowager!

505
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,180
Your Majesty,

506
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,100
I have something to tell you.

507
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,740
You live in the Eastern Palace.

508
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,540
If you have something to report,

509
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,700
it's not necessary to be in the Taiji Palace.

510
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:26,980
Your Majesty.

511
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,900
it's good to have a witness

512
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,460
in front of the ministers.

513
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,620
Go ahead, then.

514
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,900
I hope Your Majesty can issue a decree

515
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,420
granting me a fiefdom.

516
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,900
Let me establish a permanent residence,

517
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,060
and stay away from the Central State from now on,

518
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,340
so that there will be no confusion or whispers

519
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,100
in the palace or the court.

520
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,100
The future prince will be crowned

521
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,740
in a more clear and just way.

522
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,460
Let me think about it.

523
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,380
Wait until I find a suitable fiefdom

524
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,580
before issuing the decree.

525
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,940
Thank you, Your Majesty.

526
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:25,620
[Taiji Palace]

527
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,460
Your Majesty, which land are you going to

528
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,060
give him?

529
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,380
I don't know

530
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,460
whether he is sincere or not.

531
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,860
Keep him in the palace for now.

532
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,820
Let him go when everything is settled.

533
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,860
His Majesty was not at court today.

534
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,380
The empress dowager was in charge instead.

535
00:28:59,220 --> 00:28:59,940
It seems that

536
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,620
she can't hold back any longer.

537
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:05,900
Don't be in a hurry.

538
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,380
I have an idea

539
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,060
to help us meet soon.

540
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,500
Your Majesty, please.

541
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,020
Zixing.

542
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,300
This toast is for you.

543
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,900
I've been ill for a long time, unable to drink.

544
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:14,780
When I was imprisoned,

545
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,580
it was you who traveled thousands of miles to the Western State to ask for help.

546
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:21,610
Now I feel sorry for you.

547
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,100
If you have a wish,

548
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,540
just say the word.

549
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:31,220
I wish for a marriage.

550
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:34,340
With which girl?

551
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,260
Cui Shiyi.

552
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,780
Her again?

553
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:40,620
Yes.

554
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,300
Before Cui Guang died,

555
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,700
this marriage was a real prize.

556
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,900
But now, Cui Wenjun and her family

557
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,820
are no longer as powerful as before

558
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,860
among the Cui clan

559
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,900
due to Cui Guang's passing.

560
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,420
Instead, Cui Zheng's faction

561
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:00,150
is becoming more and more powerful in the court.

562
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,220
If you insist on marrying a girl from the Cui clan,

563
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,540
why don't you let Cui Zheng

564
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,300
choose a good girl for you?

565
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,580
Your Majesty, I'm flattered.

566
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,500
I don't want just any girl of the Cui clan.

567
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,500
I want just Cui Shiyi.

568
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,500
Cui Wenjun may not agree.

569
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,620
She is unreasonable.

570
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,780
Even if she's tough, she wouldn't dare to disobey

571
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,100
an imperial edict.

572
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,260
That's right.

573
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,180
It's up to Her Majesty.

574
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,220
You won't regret it?

575
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:44,500
I implore Your Majesty to grant this marriage to me again.

576
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:48,540
Very well. I'll grant it to you.

577
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,900
You have my gratitude, Your Majesty.

578
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:56,100
[Xianyang Palace]

579
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,300
Since I ascended the throne at the age of six,

580
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,420
I have had a rocky journey.

581
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,980
I was once gullible to slander,

582
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,620
which led to traitors taking advantage of me.

583
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,860
Zhao Teng and Liu Yuan usurped power.

584
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,500
I almost lost the foundation my ancestors had laid.

585
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,380
Fortunately, my uncle overlooked the past

586
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,860
and quashed the rebellion.

587
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,160
But before I could achieve my goal,

588
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,600
My mother, she…

589
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,760
I regret I didn't listen to the advice of the grand mentor

590
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,160
and so today's disaster has taken place.

591
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,840
It's my incompetence that caused the grand mentor's death.

592
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,600
I am now at the end of my rope.

593
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,200
I have nothing left.

594
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,160
No, Your Majesty.

595
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,840
You have me.

596
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,290
You have our

597
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,920
unborn baby.

598

Advisor Xie.

599
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,000
What are you doing here?

600
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,360
If I die, I can go back to the Western State.

601
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,570
And you?

602
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,400
Where can you go back to?

603
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,120
My hand was forced.

604
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,320
The empress dowager set me up.

605
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,320
I shouldn't have stayed.

606
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,840
I should have gone with General Hong.

607
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,520
Advisor Xie,

608
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,440
I am sorry.

609
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:37,210
You should go.

610
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:39,139
Go.

611
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:52,080
Do you have any message for His Highness?

612
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,040
I will try to tell him.

613
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:04,680
I, Xie Chong, was honored by the late emperor.

614
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,160
I have been loyal and righteous all my life.

615
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:16,900
The only guilt I feel is

616
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,490
failing His Highness.

617
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,980
What did you see?

618
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,960
Nothing.

619
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,880
This herd of deer seems to have seen something.

620
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,030
The Buddha disguised himself as a king of deer many times

621
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,030
in order to save the world.

622
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,540
They are the most emotional animals.

623
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,500
Master.

624
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,140
Grand Mentor Xie

625
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,020
is gone.

626
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,060
He passed away ten days ago

627
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,340
in the palace of the Central State.

628
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,700
After his death,

629
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,380
His Majesty decreed the posthumous title of Minister for him.

630
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,300
Prefectural governor of Yongzhou.

631
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,740
Whenever Master is upset,

632
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,660
he stays in the stable all alone.

633
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,940
He is a noble prince

634
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,900
in charge of hundreds of thousands of soldiers.

635
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,460
He couldn't reveal his ordinary emotions

636
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,460
in front of people.

637
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,620
It would be easier for him

638
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,900
to be with these animals instead.

639
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,100
When I came here, the royal army was so lively.

640
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,580
Nowadays,

641
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,660
he has fewer and fewer people around him.

642
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,780
You stay with him.

643
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,420
I'm going to take care of the grand mentor's funeral.

644
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,940
Master, where are you going?

645
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,540
To feed the horses.

646
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:25,860
I'll go too.

647
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,860
Don't follow me.

648
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,100
The meadow looks beautiful from afar.

649
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,740
I didn't realize it was all mud and water up close.

650
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,820
I came because I was worried about you.

651
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,860
Advisor Xie has gone.

652
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,060
I know it's hard for you.

653
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,340
That night you asked me

654
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:12,060
if the late emperor had any suspicions about me.

655
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,340
In fact, he asked Xie Chong to follow me

656
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,540
just to keep an eye on me.

657
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:21,620
After the late emperor passed away, he told me the truth

658
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:25,620
and let me choose whether to kill him or keep him.

659
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,860
You didn't just keep him,

660
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,940
you trusted him.

661
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,460
That's right.

662
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,420
He was a sword hanging over my neck

663
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,660
sent by the late emperor.

664
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,620
He was also my advisor for many years.

665
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,900
There is one thing

666
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,380
the advisor asked me

667
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,740
to tell you after his death.

668
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,820
His wedded wife's surname is Gao

669
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:01,060
from the Gao family of the former empress dowager.

670
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,500
He was afraid that I would hate him?

671
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,340
Yes.

672
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,180
I don't have that much hate.

673
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,660
There are thousands of people in the Gao clan.

674
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:17,980
Do I have to

675
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,060
hate them all?

676
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,660
He was different.

677
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,140
He considered himself

678
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,780
the one that witnessed to your formative years.

679
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,980
Of course he felt guilty.

680
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,820
What about his wife?

681
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,620
Does she need the care of the royal mansion?

682
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,580
She is no longer in this world.

683
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:41,140
Do they have children?

684
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,180
They have a son.

685
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,250
In case the fact that

686
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,540
he is a descendant of the Gao family becomes known

687
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,220
and he suffers retaliation from the Qi family,

688
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,300
he was fostered by a close friend

689
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,020
when he was very young.

690
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,380
Have you been outside the Pass?

691
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:12,780
Yes.

692
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,100
The scenery's beautiful there.

693
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,580
Next spring,

694
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:20,980
I'll take you to Yanmen Pass.

695
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:23,580
Really?

696
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:24,460
Can I really go?

697
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,500
Why not?

698
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:28,940
I'm not sure.

699
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,420
What if Mother finds out…

700
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:32,740
But it doesn't matter.

701
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,420
A general does not always follow the orders of His Majesty when abroad.

702
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,860
A daughter does not always follow the orders of her mother when she's not home!
