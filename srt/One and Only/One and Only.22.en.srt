[Episode 22]

4
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,740
General Feng!

5
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,259
What do you think?

6
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,780
Answer me!

7
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,660
Xiaoyu!

8
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,820
Do you remember the

9
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:50,660
Battle of Shouyang?

10
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,180
We have no reinforcements this time.

11
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,860
We're all on our own.

12
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,139
General Cui, are you afraid?

13
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:09,740
Yes.

14
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,860
I'm afraid that my family name

15
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,500
would affect your ability to do your job,

16
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,060
that you'd be too concerned about my safety to fight the good fight.

17
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,740
Even if you are captured,

18
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,380
I won't retreat.

19
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,940
The royal army comes first.

20
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,380
The war comes first.

21
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,579
The people come first.

22
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,620
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

23
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,660
General Hong.

24
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,660
If anyone of us is captured,

25
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,020
consider the other person dead.

26
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,540
Don't let this

27
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,579
hold us back.

28
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,500
I, Cui Feng,

29
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,580
as the prefectural governor of Taiyuan,

30
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,900
failed to hold Taiyuan.

31
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,060
I'm guilty of dereliction of duty.

32
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,580
If you insist on saving a sinner like me,

33
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,340
you're wasting the lives of soldiers

34
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,180
who died for this battle!

35
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,900
He's the young master

36
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,260
of Wushui branch of the Cui family,

37
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,980
the cousin of the future empress.

38
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,700
Generals!

39
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,380
Make your decision now!

40
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,420
-Xiaoyu.
-Bow and arrow...

41
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,740
Bow and arrow!

42
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,780
General!

43
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,260
It's useless to kill me!

44
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,820
Even if I die,

45
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,300
there will still be someone to kill him.

46
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,940
General Cui!

47
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,100
I, Hong Xiaoyu, will kill all the traitors

48
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,700
to avenge your death!

49
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,460
Killing Cui Feng

50
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,260
won't do you any good.

51
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,060
I advise you

52
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,580
to let him go

53
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,740
if you want your men

54
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,060
to leave here alive.

55
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,340
Bring her over.

56
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,460
I am Jin Zhen.

57
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,500
I want to see my father.

58
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,340
Your Highness!

59
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:05,980
General!

60
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:06,820
Your Highness.

61
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,620
Retreat!

62
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,260
Master.
-Master.

63
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,340
It'll be fine.

64
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,620
Your lowly soldier, Cui Feng,

65
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,580
greets Your Highness.

66
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,220
Get up.

67
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,140
Xiaoyu.

68
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,700
General Cui.

69
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,340
Sorry.

70
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:47,900
Today you almost

71
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,500
got killed by me.

72
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,100
That was our agreement,

73
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:51,980
wasn't it?

74
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,460
Besides, in that situation,

75
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,660
If I could die at the hands of

76
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,820
at your hands,

77
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,860
I would be glad...

78
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,420
Stop that nonsense.

79
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,140
It will never happen again.

80
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,980
By the way, the princess and I...

81
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,500
No need to explain.

82
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,380
I know it all.

83
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,380
When we were in the Central State,

84
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,180
Shiyi already told me.

85
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,820
After we're finish with the

86
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,700
things here,

87
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,380
let's go back to Shouyang together.

88
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,060
Here is the letter of surrender.

89
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,500
This letter of surrender was brought back by Prefectural Governor Cui,

90
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,380
your cousin Cui Feng.

91
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,179
Mother.

92
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,380
People say that the daughter of the Cui family

93
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,180
often come to pray at the Baima Temple.

94
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,860
All the noble women in the capital, spread the word among themselves and followed suit,

95
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,540
hoping to be

96
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,020
half as blessed as she was.

97
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,100
I prayed for

98
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,660
the safety of the soldiers.

99
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,300
The regent decided to

100
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,220
offer sacrifices to the heavens at the Pingyin Palace.

101
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,420
Then he will ascend the throne

102
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,300
Why must he offer sacrifices at the Pingyin palace?

103
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,700
Jin Rong murdered the late emperor

104
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,820
in Pingyin.

105
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,020
So he ordered his men

106
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,940
to take Jin Rong to Pingyin,

107
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,660
so that he could use the blood of the Jin family

108
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,660
to comfort the late emperor's spirit.

109
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,500
Many well-known clans came from Beichen

110
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,940
asking my aunt to let them see Your Highness.

111
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,140
What do they want with me?

112
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,660
My aunt knew you wouldn't want to see them,

113
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,020
so she said she was sick

114
00:09:59,020 --> 00:09:59,900
and didn't go to the palace.

115
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,060
This way,

116
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,580
Your Highness won't be disturbed, and neither will my aunt.

117
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,500
Pomegranates!

118
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,140
Big and juicy pomegranates!

119
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,220
Tulin pomegranates...

120
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,220
They are Shiyi's favorite.

121
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,700
Pomegranates for sale!

122
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,940
Come and have a look!

123
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,260
Tired?

124
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,300
Have you ever had Tulin pomegranates?

125
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,100
After Zhang Qian brought back pomegranate seeds from the Western Regions,

126
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,460
he planted them in various places.

127
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,100
They grew best in that place,

128
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,980
so they were called Tulin pomegranates.

129
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,980
I don't know what's got into Master.

130
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,300
He insisted on eating this,

131
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,620
and got someone to go to Pingyin to buy it.

132
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,660
Who knew Pingyin's court officer

133
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,340
heard about it.

134
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,420
That court officer did not sleep well for several nights,

135
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,820
pondering over and over,

136
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,020
wondering whether Master wanted to take this opportunity

137
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:29,900
to test Pingyin's attitude

138
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,380
towards the Nanchen Royal Mansion.

139
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,620
So he ordered his men

140
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,060
to pick 3,000 baskets of pomegranate overnight,

141
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,180
and sent them to the Western State as soon as possible.

142
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,580
See.

143
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,660
This is only a small fraction.

144
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,180
Except for these,

145
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,700
the rest are in the military camp.

146
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,620
His Highness does not like

147
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,220
to get too close to the county officials,

148
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,220
so he paid for these.

149
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,660
Try some.

150
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,420
Pomegranates.

151
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,900
Please have a look at my pomegranates.

152
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,180
Sir.

153
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,380
I'll take them all.

154
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,060
There will be someone coming to pick them up later.

155
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,460
Thank you, sir.

156
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,700
Tomorrow, send them to the palace in your name.

157
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,340
Yes, Master.

158
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:09,740
Thank you.

159
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,380
Your Highness.

160
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,460
Your Highness.

161
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,300
Are you feeling better?

162
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:33,860
Your Highness.

163
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,260
According to the divination, this battle will be dangerous.

164
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,420
Please choose an auspicious day to fight.

165
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,820
We've already won.

166
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,980
That's good.

167
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,940
I'm glad I was wrong.

168
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,660
I'm glad.

169
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,740
Master, it's time to leave.

170
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,940
We'll head for home tonight.

171
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,500
You should rest for two more hours.

172
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,460
Okay.

173
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,100
Come on.

174
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,700
We'll head for the Western State before sunset.

175
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,820
For me,

176
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,820
it doesn't make any difference whether we leave today or tomorrow.

177
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,700
But as the biggest contributor

178
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,820
to this rebellion,

179
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,660
I'm afraid you have no way to avoid

180
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,060
tonight's banquet.

181
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,860
I am an expert

182
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,060
at playing drunk.

183
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,260
We've won many battles.

184
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,100
That's right.

185
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,340
That's all thanks to His Highness.

186
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,420
His Highness will be here soon.

187
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,020
Right.

188
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:20,140
[Jiangdu Palace]

189
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,140
The Junior Prince of Nanchen has arrived.

190
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:44,820
Uncle

191
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,100
Uncle, please come inside.

192
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,660
Generals,

193
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,140
please take your seats at tables for generals.

194
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,980
Fellow generals, please.

195
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,860
General Hong.

196
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,420
Let's first have three bowls as a toast!

197
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,580
No problem!

198
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,340
Come!

199
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,220
As you wish.

200
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,060
Cheers!

201
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:33,820
All ministers,

202
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,780
dry your glasses, please.

203
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,260
-Please.
-Please.

204
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,620
Today is a precious reunion for us,

205
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,540
the descendants of the Liu family.

206
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,500
-Yes.
-Yes. That's right.

207
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,260
The last time I came here.

208
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,980
It was to offer sacrifices to the heavens with the late emperor.

209
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,620
That year, you were just...

210
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,420
I just turned 11 years old.

211
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,460
That's right.

212
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,500
How fortunate we are to have you in Beichen!

213
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,619
How fortunate we are!

214
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:07,140
Yes, that's right.

215
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:10,700
Come!

216
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,300
A toast to Your Highness.

217
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,980
-To Your Highness.
-Please.

218
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,300
-To Your Highness!
-To Your Highness!

219
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,740
Here. Please.

220
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,540
You are a good drinker, General.

221
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,900
General Zhu. Come.

222
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,580
General Chen. Cheers!

223
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,500
Feng Qiao.

224
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,700
Let me have another drink.

225
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,460
What is the seating arrangement

226
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,780
for today's banquet?

227
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,300
All the kings and ministers are in the main hall.

228
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,340
We generals...

229
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,300
sit here.

230
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,660
Come, General Hong.

231
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,500
Let's have a drink.

232
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,820
I can't hold my liquor very well.

233
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,060
I shall take my leave now.

234
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,380
Your Highness, you're leaving this early?

235
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,300
I'm afraid if we stay longer, we'll get drunk here.

236
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,780
It will delay our journey back.

237
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,180
Why don't you stay in Pingyin for a few more days?

238
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,340
Look at your uncles and aunts here.

239
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,020
They're already old.

240
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,780
I'm afraid it's not easy to reunite like this again.

241
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,660
That's right.

242
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,700
-The royal bedchamber has been prepared.
-Yes.

243
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,420
Why don't you rest here for the night

244
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,340
and leave tomorrow?

245
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,140
Staying here

246
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,260
always reminds me of the late emperor.

247
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,940
That makes me sad.

248
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,700
It's best I go back to the military camp.

249
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,300
I'll take my leave.

250
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,860
Take care, Your Highness.

251
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,580
Remember to return here often, Your Highness.

252
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,380
Remember to return here often.

253
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,380
Take care, Your Highness.

254
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,340
-Remember to return often.
-Remember to return often.

255
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,300
Zhousheng Chen assassinated the regent!

256
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,100
Arrest him!

257
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,780
We've been set up!

258
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,780
Nanchen Royal Army has rebelled!

259
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,260
By order of the regent,

260
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,220
kill them all!

261
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,660
I have so many soldiers at my command.

262
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,540
How come no one dares to kill the traitor?

263
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,500
Whoever kills Zhousheng Chen

264
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,140
will take his place

265
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,820
and claim the Western State!

266
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,060
Jin Rong.

267
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,980
Kill them!

268
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,860
Go!

269
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,340
Feng Qiao!

270
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,860
Xiaoyu!

271
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,060
Xiaoyu!

272
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,020
Xiaoyu!

273
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,340
Xiaoyu.

274
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,420
Xiaoyu!

275
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:53,780
Xiaoyu!

276
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,580
-Xiaoyu!
-Xiaoyu!

277
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,460
Xiaoyu, hang in there!

278
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,100
Reinforcements will be here soon!

279
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:03,900
Xiaoyu.

280
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,180
Xiaoyu.

281
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,300
-Xiaoyu! Xiaoyu!
-Xiaoyu!

282
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,340
General Cui.

283
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:28,860
It was I that fell in love with you first, General Cui,

284
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:37,500
from the beginning to the end.

285
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,060
Xiaoyu, don't die.

286
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,860
-Xiaoyu.
-Xiaoyu.

287
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:50,220
Don't forget me.

288
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,700
I...

289
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:01,460
I'll see you in the next life.

290
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,860
Xiaoyu.

291
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,180
Xiaoyu!

292
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,020
Xiaoyu!

293
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,700
Xiaoyu!

294
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,580
Xiaoyu!

295
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,100
Xiaoyu, don't die!

296
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,740
Xiaoyu!

297
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:23,420
Xiaoyu!

298
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,420
Your Highness.

299
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,300
Liu Zixing and Jin Rong are in cahoots.

300
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,900
There are too many ambushes here. We gotta get out of here fast.

301
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,540
Xiaoyu!

302
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,500
Xiaoyu!

303
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,660
Let's bring Xiaoyu back.

304
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,460
Grand-uncle!

305
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,220
Grand-uncle, save me!

306
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,620
Grand-uncle!

307
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,860
Grand-uncle, save me!

308
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,460
Grand-uncle?

309
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,940
Grand-uncle, save me?

310
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,540
Zhousheng Chen.

311
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:39,980
He was put on the throne

312
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,060
by you.

313
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,220
I believe

314
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,580
you wouldn't want a child

315
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:47,180
to die for you today, do you?

316
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,460
Bring him up.

317
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,460
Your Highness.

318
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:05,660
Watch carefully.

319
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,460
I am the Counselor-in-chief. How dare you!

320
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:20,260
Your Highness, go!

321
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,020
Don't care about us!

322
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:32,060
Inside the hall

323
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,820
there are still dozens of members

324
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,140
of the Liu's royal clan

325
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,140
and more than two hundred ministers.

326
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:41,060
If you don't surrender today,

327
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:44,140
I'll kill them one after the other

328
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,380
to have them join you in hell!

329
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:53,570
Liu Zixing.

330
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,490
Are you trying to kill all your family members

331
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,570
and slaughter all the ministers?

332
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:02,220
I guarantee with my life,

333
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,500
as long as you put down your weapon

334
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:08,070
no more people will die.

335
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:09,980
Master.

336
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,420
I beg you. Just for once, please be selfish.

337
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,660
Leave with us.

338
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,260
Don't care about them anymore.

339
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,780
Master!

340
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,980
Grand-uncle, go!

341
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,500
I'm not scared anymore.

342
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:33,740
All right.

343
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,860
I yield.

344
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,260
Let him go.

345
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,860
Master!

346
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,610
I

347
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,400
don't trust you.

348
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,420
You have over two hundred ministers

349
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,500
as hostages.

350
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,580
What are you afraid of?

351
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,500
Now that you're using them to threaten me,

352
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,090
you should know that

353
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,820
I wouldn't run away.

354
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,540
Grand-uncle!

355
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:11,060
Don't be afraid.

356
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,100
Escort His Majesty away!

357
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,380
Yes.

358
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,060
Retreat!

359
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,500
Master!

360
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,900
Master! Master!

361
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,620
I'm useless!

362
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:02,300
Master!

363
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:11,220
Master!

364
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:24,140
Do you still mind his bones?

365
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,780
[Jiangdu Palace]

366
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,140
Who told you to kill them?

367
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:33,900
What else then?

368
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:38,420
They are all my uncles.

369
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,740
If you keep talking this nonsense,

370
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,380
I'll even dethrone you,

371
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,660
the regent.

372
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,290
Now that the royal army has been falsely accused of rebellion.

373
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,740
You've already become a rebel general.

374
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,180
You can no longer stay in the Central State.

375
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,260
You must leave today.

376
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:27,620
Where is Shiyi?

377
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,100
I'll take care of her.

378
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,500
As long as she doesn't leave the palace,

379
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,780
I will not leave either.

380
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:35,180
If you are still risking your life for Shiyi,

381
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,940
how can I leave?

382
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,580
How can you say that?

383
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,500
You are my sworn brother's family,

384
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,100
then you are my family too.

385
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,540
You may not like to hear what I'm gonna say,

386
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,460
but you are too badly injured.

387
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:51,380
Your stay will only hold me back from saving others.

388
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:54,100
If you leave, you're helping me.

389
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:58,300
Staying alive is the only way to get revenge.

390
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,980
News of the incident at Pingyin Palace has spread to the capital city.

391
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,540
From the officials to the merchants and civilians,

392
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,380
everyone is talking that

393
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,620
the next city Jin Rong is going to slaughter

394
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,380
is the Central State.

395
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,860
In one night, over seventy percent of the people had fled.

396
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,300
Go back!

397
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,180
Go back!

398
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,020
Go back, all of you!

399
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,660
By the order of the regent,

400
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,220
ordinary officials and folk

401
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,260
who are not in collusion with the rebels,

402
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,460
will not be executed.

403
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,180
There's no need to flee.

404
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,420
Go home now!

405
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,900
General, come with me.

406
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,420
Is there something wrong, General?

407
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,940
Look how empty these stores in the city are.

408
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,580
The General will be back tomorrow.

409
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,820
He won't be happy to see that.

410
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,900
Take your men down there.

411
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,500
Change into civilian clothes

412
00:34:03,699 --> 00:34:04,940
and pretend to be merchants tomorrow.

413
00:34:05,139 --> 00:34:06,980
Also, get your men to bring back the runaways

414
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:08,100
from the neighboring counties.

415
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:09,820
Yes.

416
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,659
Close the city gate!

417
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,580
Leave them all here.

418
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,100
Be gentle.

419
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,100
Who sent this?

420
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:30,780
Your Highness.

421
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,380
These are sent by Mr. Huan

422
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,420
from Longkang Academy.

423
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,739
The night I left the academy,

424
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,340
I painted a lotus

425
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,580
as a farewell gift to Mr. Huan.

426
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:48,460
He must have understood that painting.

427
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,420
So he gave me this lotus flower in return.

428
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,780
Mrs. Cui is asking permission to leave the city.

429
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,300
Open the gate!

430
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,620
You're letting her go that easily?

431
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,940
That's the carriage of the Cui family.

432
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,220
Think of our ranks.

433
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:31,020
How can we offend them?

434
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,580
General Zhou.

435
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,300
I'll first take you to

436
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,660
an inn 20 miles away.

437
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,580
There is a 3000-soldier army of the Cui family waiting for you.

438
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,620
When you arrive at the inn,

439
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,180
I'll escort you to Shouyang with the army.

440
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,380
The young master is waiting there.

441
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,340
Thank you.

442
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,380
Do you know

443
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,420
how Shiyi is doing?

444
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,500
No one is allowed to see her now.

445
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,100
Not even her mother is allowed to see her.

446
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,340
How is Tianxing's injury?

447
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:09,940
Your Highness.

448
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,420
He has recovered well.

449
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,620
I'll go see him after lunch.

450
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,100
General Zhou has recovered, indeed,

451
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,780
but he has already left.

452
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,220
He's gone back to the Western State.

453
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,500
When did he leave?

454
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,660
The day before yesterday.

455
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:28,260
He said there were enemy movements in the south.

456
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,420
And that he had to go urgently.

457
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,220
After the peace treaty at the Frontier Settlement Tower,

458
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,660
the territories had long been at peace.

459
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:36,020
How can there be such a sudden change?

460
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,460
The Prince of Pingqin also went with him.

461
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,980
He said that his wife was pregnant

462
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,300
and went back to take care of her.

463
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,780
Now that the royal army has gone on an expedition,

464
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,060
schedule for me

465
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,410
to pray for our soldiers at the Baima Temple tomorrow.

466
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:53,980
Yes.

467
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:08,740
[Baima Temple]

468
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:06,060
She wants to pray at Baima Temple?

469
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:06,900
Yes.

470
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:11,420
But the temple has long been empty.

471
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,740
How can we hide it?

472
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,020
Get some monks from other counties.

473
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:18,300
If anyone makes a mistake, kill them.

474
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:18,780
Yes.

475
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,820
Why has no one wiped these incense burners?

476
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,020
The monks of Baima Temple

477
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,500
have had a habit for many years.

478
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,140
Every year in the twelfth lunar month, they would ask young disciples

479
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,300
to check the water inside.

480
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:13,420
If there is a thin layer of ice on the water,

481
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,740
they'll change it immediately,

482
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,260
so that the doves can drink the water.

483
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:27,880
This temple...

484
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,100
Doves are very smart.

485
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,260
They like to hide in the temple in the wintertime.

486
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,100
There is not even a single dove here.

487
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:58,540
These monks are all fake.

488
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,620
Master, you once said,

489
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,500
if something happened to you,

490
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,300

♫Gets clear after saying goodbye♫

516
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,180
already have someone in my heart.

517
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,380
♫Every glimpse means missing you♫

518
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,100
And I

519
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,180
won't change my mind.

520
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:40,880
♫Even if to be a stranger to you♫

521
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,300
You have never seen

522
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,500
the scenery of the whole Western State, right?

523
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,660
I want to leave a word on it.

524
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,540
After we leave and lock the gate,

525
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,540

526
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,860
no one can enter again.

527
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:47,980
Leaving a word here

528
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,420
is like leaving a secret just for us.

529
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,500
What do you want to write?

530
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:52,340
I'll write it for you.

531
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:58,340
