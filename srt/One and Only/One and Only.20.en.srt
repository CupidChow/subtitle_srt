[Episode 20]

4
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,759
Master, we are here.

5
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,160
Xie Yun and Cui Feng haven't arrived yet.

6
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,000
Xie Yun wrote several letters in a row

7
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,680
to let us know that he's learned how to ride a horse,

8
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,080
and can lead troops Eastward

9
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,320
as your vanguard at any time.

10
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,240
Let him stay in Beichen

11
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,520
and guard the border.

12
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,520
I'm just worried

13
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,760
about Cui Feng.

14
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,520
The new emperor is about to ascend the throne.

15
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,760
The regional princes and the prefectural governors

16
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,960
have been called back to the capital city.

17
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,160
Only Cui Feng hasn't responded yet.

18
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,240
Why don't we have Shiyi

19
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,720
write him a letter and call him back

20
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,480
on family matter grounds?

21
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,600
What family matter?

22
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,600
Don't keep us guessing.

23
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,680
Just spit it out!

24
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,880
Asking her cousin to come back

25
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,720
for her wedding ceremony

26
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,160
would be the best excuse.

27
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,440
You heard nothing.

28
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:29,920
No.

29
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,720
Advisor Xiao is right.

30
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,200
I'll go write to him right away.

31
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,400
There's paper and a writing brush here.

32
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,400
You can write here.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,520
No.

34
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,000
I need to think

35
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,440
carefully about how

36
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,480
to write such a message.

37
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,100
[I'm getting married. Hope you return.]

38
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,760
You only came up with

39
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,520
six characters after all that thinking it over?

40
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,680
Least said, soonest mended.

41
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,680
These six characters

42
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,840
are convincing enough for him.

This is a gift

47
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,079
that His Highness prepared especially for you.

48
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,960
His Highness said

49
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,520
if you don't like it,

50
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,560
there'd still be time

51
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,920
to make a new one for you.

52
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,560
This one is fine.

53
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,560
Governor, you looked worried just a minute ago.

54
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,800
What made you smile all of a sudden?

55
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,800
My cousin is getting married.

56
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,160
That's a good thing!

57
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,080
And something better

58
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,360
is sure to follow.

59
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,560
Now, go pack some things.

60
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,839
Wait. Forget it.

61
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,399
Just pack some food enough for 10 days.

62
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,600
We'll set off right away.

he will figure out

66
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,480
this is a cue that there will be an attack in Taiyuan

67
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,040
given that none of the generals

68
00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:29,480
in Nanchen Royal Army

69
00:04:30,159 --> 00:04:31,120
would leave the battlefield

70

[I'm getting married. Hope you return.]

Taiyuan is his battleground.

And now the army

77

after deliberation.

83
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,600
It's the Prince of Guangling, who entered

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,440
the palace when he was little, and was like

85

and all prestigious clans care about the most.

91

In the future,

95
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,640
Yeah...

96
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,280
It's not confirmed yet.

I've been worried about you ever since.

102
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,080
I rushed back

103
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,080
so that I could return in time for your wedding.

104

I'd regret it for the rest of my life.

Sorry that I can't keep you company.

the generals serving Nanchen Royal Army.

116
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,560
They've fought for dozens of years

117
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,159
for the peace of the Central Plains.

118
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,200
I heard

119
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,080
that there was a female general surnamed Feng

120
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,960
under the command of the Junior Prince of Nanchen.

121
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,120
She made great contributions in pacifying the chaos in the west

122
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,360
and saved thousands of women

123
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,800
and children from the foreigners' attacks.

124
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,200
She is General Feng.

125
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,159
General, thank you for protecting our country

126
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,760
and saving our people's lives!

127
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,159
It's simply my job.

128
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:48,880
Mother,

129
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,320

Okay.

131
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,960
Then I'll leave the palace first.

132
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,400
Thank you, Mother!

133
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,640
Shiyi is one of the Cuis.

134
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,000
She should be married off from our residence.

135
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,680
If we let her stay in the Xuanguang Palace,

according to the rules...

137
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,040
We've already forced her to enter the palace

138
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,280
using the so-called rules and rites.

139
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,120
Can't we just humor her once,

140
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,120
the night before she gets married?

141
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,040

Prince of Taiyuan! Prince of Taiyuan!

145
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,600
My fellow brothers.

146
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,400
The late emperor's death is a mystery.

147
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,440
And now, they've already

148
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,080
hastily put forward a child to be

149
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,640
the new emperor

150
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,840
so that they can shut people's mouths

151
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,120
and cover the cause of death of the late emperor.

152
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:50,400
The other princes may turn a blind eye on it,

153
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,840
but I,

154
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,880
as one who owes much to the late emperor,

155
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,440
can't just let it go!

156
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:57,920
Today,

157
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,280
I, Jin Rong, will declare war

158
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,480
for the late emperor

159
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,480
and for the sake of justice!

160
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,480
For the late emperor! For the late emperor!

161
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,600
For the late emperor! For the late emperor!

162

For the late emperor!

164
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,960
Come to think of it,

165
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,200
I wear armor

166
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,080
much more often

167
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,000
than I wear dresses.

168
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,760
Feng Qiao, you look good in dresses, too!

169
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,880
Is there anyone in the Taiji Palace tonight?

170
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,240
I think so.

171
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,280
Then forget it.

172
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,880

173
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,760
With my rank, I'm not allowed in.

174
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,360
But since

175
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,280
I'm here already,

176
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,200

177
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,880
I may never have another chance to.

178
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,400
Then let's go right now.

179
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,280

183
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,880
who's to say you can't go there?

184
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,760
Come on!

185
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,760
Your Highness,

186
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,440
after tonight,

187
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,440
she'll become someone's wife.

188
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,800
If you want to see her, why don't you

189
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,680
go to the Xuanguang Palace and visit her?

190
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,400
What do you want me to say?

191
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,120
To speak your mind.

192

I've guarded the border of Beichen for over 10 years,

202
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,640
and this is the first time I've come

203
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,080
this close to the Taiji Palace.

204
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,800
That's the Princess of Guangling!

205
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,040
How dare you stop her? Do you have a death wish?

206
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,880
But we'll be in trouble if we don't.

guards to patrol even at midnight?

211

00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,920
let's see your guts as a general!

216
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,520
Go ahead while there's

217

224
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,960
Feng Qiao said

225
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,640
she couldn't go in with her rank,

226
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,400
so I brought her here

227
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,920
since it's nighttime.

228
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,160
Who knows when she

229
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,600
can make it here again?

230
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,280
Master, please don't blame Feng Qiao.

231
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,680
It was my idea.

232
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,280
I'm not blaming her.

233
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,120
General Feng, you wanted to check out the palace, right?

234
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,240
Go ahead.

235
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,760
It looks interesting.

So many people

240
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,600
dream of this place,

241
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,240
and so many people would

242
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,400
do whatever it takes

243
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,200

when you talk about it?

246
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,000
I've only heard about it before,

247
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,320
and I've never seen it in person,

248
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,880
so of course I'd be curious.

249
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,040
Now that I see it,

250
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,760
there's nothing special about it.

513
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,040
Let's share a drink.

514
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,320
I've been sitting all the way here.

515
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,800
I'll stand.

516
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,760
Yang Shao,

517
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,600
pour some wine for Her Majesty!

518
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,600
In the future,

519
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,159
you and I

520
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,679
will stick together.

521
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,800
Then I should

522
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,719
thank you for such recognition!

523
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,760
When will we set off?

524
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,280
Set off?

525
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,080
Where to?

526
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,560
Taiyuan, of course.

527
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:33,360
Zhousheng Chen is in the Central State.

528
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,840
He might've already sent out army

529
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,840
and is on his way over here!

530
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:38,960
I know

531
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:41,760
that you've enlarged your army this year

532
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,320
and you've become much stronger.

533
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,719
But you still need to be careful

534
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,400
when dealing with Nanchen Royal Army.

535
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,600
Is this

536
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,440
the young emperor who just ascended the throne?

537
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,040
Yes.

538
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,720
It's said that there's an unwritten rule

539
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,600
in the royal family of Liu

540
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,040
that a gold figurine shall be forged

541
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,120
before selecting a future emperor.

542
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,680
If the figurine is forged successfully,

543
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,440
it means he's the chosen one.

544
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,000
Otherwise,

545
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,640
he should be replaced by another.

546
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,280
Your Majesty, I'd like to know

547
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,200
if a figurine was ever made

548
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,120
before this kid became the emperor?

549
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,280
It was an emergency...

550
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,480
An emergency?

551
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,520
It was just an excuse

552
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,360
you invented to fool people!

553
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,400
I came up with this plan

554
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,800
to keep the court in order!

555
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,840
You witch, I'm tired

556
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,600
of hearing your nonsense!

557
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,600
Get ready to forge the figurine!

558
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,120
I'll see it myself

559
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,560
whether this kid is

560
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,760
qualified to be

561
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,480
the new emperor!

562
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,640
Let's begin.

563
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,520
Yes.

564
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,080
General.

565
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,160
It failed!

566
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,840
General,

567
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,480
if you don't know how to forge the figurine,

568
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,200
you can ask the Qi clansmen to come here.

569
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,720
I'll let them forge one.

570
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,840
Qi clansmen?

571
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,920
There are no Qi clansmen!

572
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,680
You are lying!

573
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,640
It was the Qi clansmen

574
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,800
who got me out of the Baima Temple.

575
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,960
How could those cowards of your clan

576
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,800
have the guts to save you?

577
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,920
I don't mind

578
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,560
telling you the truth before killing you!

579
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,280
It's me

580
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,080
and the Prince of Guangling

581
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,480
who saved you!

582
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,280
Liu Zixing?

583
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,200
If it hadn't been for his Royal Guards,

584
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,520
we couldn't have been able

585
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,080
to take this kid away!

586
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,360
You...

587
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,040
Thanks to you, the Qi clan

588
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,720
has been enjoying wealth and glory.

589
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,360
And now,

590
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,760
it's time for them to go to hell along with you!

591
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,440
Guards,

592
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,120
throw her and this fake emperor

593
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,600
into the river to feed the fish!

594
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,080
How dare you, Jin Rong!

595
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,200
I'm the grand empress dowager!

596
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:19,880
Let me go!

597
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,560
What are you doing?

598
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,880
-Let me go!
-Let me go!

599
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,720
Prince of Taiyuan! Prince of Taiyuan!

600
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,160
Let go of me!

601
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,520
Prince of Taiyuan!

602
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,280
Prince of Taiyuan!

603
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,720
Prince of Taiyuan!

604
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,200
I don't wanna die!

605
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,640
Help!

606
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,240
Help!

607
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,960
Help!

608
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,880
Help!

609
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,640
Help!

610
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,200
Hold on!

611
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,200
Help!

612
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,520
Put him down.

613
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,560
Take the dragon robe off

614
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,320
of this kid emperor

615
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,800
and send it to the Central State.

616
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,200
As for this kid,

617
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,000
he's still useful to me.

618
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,520
Take him to my mansion

619
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,840
and let my wife watch over him.

620
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,480
Yes!

621
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:42,640
Come on.

622
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,640
General Yuan.

623
00:39:59,080 --> 00:39:59,840
General Jin.

624
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,360
You've been watching the whole time.

625
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,760
Is it because the regent

626
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,920
is afraid that I'd betray him?

627
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,000
General, you misunderstood.

628
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,160
He said Qi Zhenzhen

629
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,840
poisoned his brother to death

630
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,280
and he hated her,

631
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,480
so he asked me to confirm her death

632
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,160
to put his mind at ease.

633
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,920
I didn't expect

634
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,440
that the regent

635
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,920
was that close to the late emperor.

636
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,240
I didn't know either.

637
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,240
Come on, let's go have a drink.

638
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,640
General Yuan,

639
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,280
have a drink with me.

640
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:00,720
Cheers!

641
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,200
Cheers!

642
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,360
It feels good!

643
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,320
Qi Zhenzhen has bullied me for years.

644
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,560
Today,

645
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,840
I finally took revenge on her!

646
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,560
General!

647
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,160
We lost the battle in Henei.

648
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,120
We didn't even withstand for three days?

649
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:23,880
No.

650
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,520
Where's Zhousheng Chen right now?

651
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,920
300 miles away from here.

652
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:35,720
Withdraw!

653
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:48,640
Did

654
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,200
Jin Rong launch an attack?

655
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,520
Your Highness.

656
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,320
Your Highness.

657
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,280
Sorry

658
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,640
that I had you worried these days.

659
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,040
What happened exactly?

660
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,720
Jin Rong launched an offensive in Henei.

661
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,320
Uncle went to fight against him.

662
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,400
Where's my cousin?

663
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,440
How is he doing?

664
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,080
Based on my informant,

665
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,280
Cui Feng left

666
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,600
Taiyuan days ago,

667
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,400
but his whereabouts still remain unknown.

668
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,080
If he left days ago,

669
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,640
he could be hiding somewhere

670
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,320
and waiting to meet my Master.

671
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,800
When my uncle returns,

672
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,760
he may have an update for you.

673
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,480
If Jin Rong is attacking Henei,

674
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,920
why is the Eastern Palace locked?

675
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,200
The Royal Guards colluded with the Qi clan and rebelled.

676
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,800
After my uncle left for the battle,

677
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,640
they kidnapped His Majesty

678
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,080
and joined Jin Rong's army.

679
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,080
His Majesty is kidnapped?

680
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,800
When my uncle left,

681
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,080
he asked General Zhou and the Royal Guards

682
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,640
to protect the palace.

683
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,200
General Zhou...

684
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,880
What happened to him?

685
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,080
