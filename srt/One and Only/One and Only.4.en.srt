34
00:04:30,659 --> 00:04:31,900
We came across a bunch of monks

35
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,100
when we were on our way here from the west.

36
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,659
They came from Zhongli.

37
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:35,900
Monks?

38
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,159
The army of the Southern Dynasty

39
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,200
even attacked the temple?

40
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,920
It's not because the temple was under attack.

41
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:43,000
The monks saw the refugees coming to the south

42
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,080
and took in hundreds of them in their temple.

43
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,420
As more and more refugees gathered,

44
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,580
the monks could not afford to feed them in the temple.

45
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,740
So the abbot of the temple

46
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,020
decided to escort these refugees

47
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,260

48
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,540

for Feng Qiao,

Is the man at the temple

an old acquaintance of yours?

188

Yes.

He's the second prince of Nanxiao.

190
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,000
A few years ago,

191
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,160
we had met a few times.

192
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,920
At that time, he came to have a peace negotiation with me

193
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,120
representing the emperor of Nanxiao.

194
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,360
He was a very favored prince

195
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,680
and was only second to the Crown Prince.

196
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,680
After that, I don't know

197
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,040
what happened,

198
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,400
he began to live a secluded life

199
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,360
and refused to see any visitors.

200
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,840
Even if the officials from his jurisdiction

201
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,880
wanted to visit him,

202
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,480
they had to see him through a veil.

203
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,480
That's why only a handful of people

204
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,080
have seen him in the past few years.

205
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,600
I thought he was an assassin.

206
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,880

Calm down, Empress.

348
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,240
I almost thought there is no one left in the hall.

349
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,120
The ruler has left,

350
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,120
leaving behind the imprisoned Empress,

351
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,040
and the Crown Prince who will never be crowned.

352
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,200
If you want to break free from the prison,

353
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,880
allow me to express what I thought.

354
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,720
If we keep complaining to each other,

355
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,240
none of us will survive.

356
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:09,000
The only way to get out is by helping each other.

357
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,560
Those who I trusted were trying to save me.

358
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,320
Yet they were all killed by Zhao Teng one by one.

359
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,360
What else can I do now?

360
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,760
I will save you,

361
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,120
and then,

362
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,640
you give me what I want.

363
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,000
What do you want?

364
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,400
The Crown Princeship. The Ceremony of the Enthronement.

365
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,160
And...

366
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,400
The throne?

367
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,280
Only the injustice of Heaven and the indifference of human beings

368
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:05,000
can cultivate a good boy.

369
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,000
I never knew

370
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,240
the last one who is standing next to me

371
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,800
would be you.

372
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,480
So, do we have a deal?

373
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,160
You save me first.

374
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,880
And I'll fulfill your dream later.

375
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:39,960
Your Highness.

376
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,400
Is Shiyi inside?

377
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,600
Yes. She comes here every night.

378
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,600
She has almost finished reading all the books

379
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,200
in the library.

380
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,320
I thought there are people cleaning this place every day.

381
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,760
I'm afraid they're not careful enough.

382
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,560
So I wanna clean it by myself.

383
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,800
Throughout the entire mansion,

384
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,400
this is the only place that can't have fire.

385
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,680
Are you cold?

386
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,240
No.

387
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,680
I won't if I am occupied.

388
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,480
You'd better come up here

389
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,280
next time when it gets warmer.

390
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,600
The books are always here.

391
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,720
They're not going anywhere.

392
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,120
I got a letter from Qinghe County asking you to go back.

393
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,240
Why do I have to go back so suddenly?

394
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,160
The Grand Preceptor resigned from his post and returned to the hometown.

395
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,320
He summoned all the descendants of the Cui's clan back to Qinghe County

396
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,280
to compile the country's history with him.

397
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,280
Including me and my brother?

398
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,280
Yes.

399
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,800
When is it?

400
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:14,920
Next month.

401
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,960
So, can we come back after that?

402
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,360
I can't decide whether you can go or stay.

403
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,480
After all, the Qinghe County

404
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,840
is your hometown.

405
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,120
Jr. Prince of Nanchen's beloved disciple

406
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,720
has to climb up to the roof in secret

407
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,120
to take a look at the Western State under her master's jurisdiction.

408
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,000
I doubt if there's anyone who will buy that?

409
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,080
Uncle has returned to Qinghe County.

410
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,840
The Clan Chief is already over seventy.

411
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,280
He should have returned earlier.

412
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,320
He's now summoning the descendants of the Cui's clan to return,

413
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,520
including me.

414
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,120
When?

415
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,800
Ma said the sooner the better.

416
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,360
I'm already engaged.

417
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,640
I could be called to enter the Imperial Palace at any time.

418
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,520
The sooner I return to Qinghe County,

419
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,080
I'll be able to serve mom a few more years,

420
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,200
and stay with her for some longer time.

421
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,840
I should be happy

422
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,720
that I can go home earlier.

423
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,000
Right?

424
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,880
It's understandable that

425
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,320
you don't want to leave here.

426
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,720
You don't have to blame yourself.

427
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,800
Your Majesty.

428
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,240
Zixing, there couldn't be a better time for you to be here.

429
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,760
We got a secret letter from the Western State.

430
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:22,880
Zhao Teng.

431
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,360
A prince of Nanxiao has escaped to the Western State.

432
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,760
And he is currently being held in custody in the royal mansion.

433
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,660
My uncle wants me to decide what to do with him.

434
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,340
But I can't make up my mind.

435
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,380
Should I kill him

436
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,980
or persuade him to surrender?

437
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,020
Or maybe

438
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,300
I should ask a minister I trust

439
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,780
and hold a secret trial in the Western State.

440
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,940
Your Majesty.

441
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,420
Don't bother to concern about such a trivial matter.

442
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,380
Just leave it to me.

443
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,940
I'm willing to go to the Western State for Your Majesty

444
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,020
to hold a secret interrogation of this man.

445
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,740
That's exactly what I had in mind.

446
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,420
Your Majesty.

447
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,780
My fiancee is there.

448
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,940
Even if this does not exist,

449
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,900
I would have asked for your permission to see her.

450
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,940
I knew you wanted to see her.

451
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,020
You've been waiting to see her for ages.

452
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,420
I'll give the order right away.

453
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,540
You can leave tomorrow.

454
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,700
Thank you, Your Majesty.

455
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:42,700
[Xianyang Hall]

456
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,900
Say hello to my sister-in-law for me.

457
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:48,220
One more thing, tell my uncle that

458
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,620
I've been looking at the Western State from the Central State,

459
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,220
and I am looking forward to our reunion.

460
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,100
Your Majesty.

461
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,780
Given your high status,

462
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,660
you should think twice before

463
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,940
going to the Western State.

464
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,420
High status?

465
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,860
I'm just a member of the Liu's Royal family.

466
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,900
I will write a letter later

467
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,700
to tell my mother to come to the Central State and live for a short time.

468
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,380
I am sorry to trouble you

469
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,860
to take care of her, Mr. Zhao.

470
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,460
I'll take care of the Princess.

471
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,220
Don't worry.

472
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,580
How about I send my own men

473
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,860
to help you pick up the Princess?

474
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,140
Sounds good to me.

475
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,140
If you still don't believe

476
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,460
my loyalty to our alliance,

477
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,820
you can have your trusted men follow me

478
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,380
to make sure I am in one piece.

479
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,820
My men will definitely follow you,

480
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,980
but that doesn't mean I don't trust you.

481
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,180
I was just thinking that it's really a long way for you

482
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,140
to go to the Western State.

483
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,940
And I will feel more comfortable

484
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,940
to know that they are with you.

485
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,620
Then I'll wait for your arrangement.

486
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,420
All of them have

487
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,380
been following me for many years.

488
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:14,180
You must stay close to him at all times

489
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,140
and take good care of Prince of Guangling.

490
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,100
Yes!

491
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,700
Go take the gilt jade sculpture

492
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,060
sent by His Majesty last year.

493
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:48,820
Yes.

494
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,340
Wait.

495
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,100
Maybe it would be better to take

496
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,420
the inkstone, paper and brush sent by my father

497
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,660
She'll like it.

498
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,260
Yes.

499
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,780
Who do you think will like it?

500
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,580
Your Highness.

501
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,300
Leave us alone.

502
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,940
You're going to see her?

503
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,179
My brother said

504
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,659
you asked for permission to go to the Western State

505
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,139
just to see Cui Shiyi,

506
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:18,860
right?

507
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,260
Xinghua.

508
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:24,659
I understand.

509
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,060
To be the crown prince, you must marry her

510
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:28,219
for the support of the Cui's clan.

511
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:30,260
The most important thing is,

512
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,940
you really like her.

513
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,020
I'm just jealous.

514

What is it?

The emperor has granted permission

00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:17,820
for Prince of Guangling to leave the Imperial Palace,

526

for the Western State to see his fiancee.

Yes.

Although Prince of Guangling has yet to be crowned,

he's still a prince-to-be.

00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:29,060
You should accompany him throughout his visit and make sure he is well taken care of.

Yes.

You should ask His Highness directly.

As for Prince of Guangling's arrival.

550
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,720
First, he's to interrogate the prince of Nanxiao.

Second, to meet his fiancee.

And it is rare to spend a new year without a war?

Actually, the reason he leaves the royal mansion

564
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,020
is that he wants to leave some space
