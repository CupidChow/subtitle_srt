Stop!

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,320
General,

7
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,280
where did you come from?

8
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,840
That's not a question

9
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,160
You're entitled to ask.

10
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,920
We are escorting a major criminal to the capital city

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,080
according to His Majesty's decree!

12
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,520
Forgive me, General!

13
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,640
General, please.

14
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,800
Feng Qiao is so bold.

15
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,640
She's holding a fake decree

16
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,960

Is the Chief of State Finance in there?

Yes.

20
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,600
I've brought some desserts from Jiangnan.

21
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,160
Your Highness, please.

22
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,920
You actually don't trust me

23
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,440
though we meet every day?

24
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,520
I can take the box in myself.

25
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,680
Does that work for you?

26
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,720
The Chief of State Finance already had dinner.

27
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,960
You wait outside for me.

28
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,200
Yes.

29
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,600
Chief of State Finance.

30
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,400
I wanted to bring you

31
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,960
some desserts from Jiangnan

32
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,760
but was unfortunately stopped outside.

33
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,760
Thanks for Your Highness' kind offer.

34
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,160
Don't mind.

35
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,160
I'll punish them

36
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,840
for you later.

37
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,280
Thanks for taking the trouble.

Chief of State Finance.

39
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,960
His Majesty is still worshipping the Buddha.

40
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,160
His Majesty likes to chant scriptures,

41
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,800
which is just like the Empress Dowager.

42
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,960
I think I'm enjoying the honor

43
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,520
that no other eunuchs

44
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,240
have ever enjoyed.

45
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,640
I have my own living palace

46
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,440
with palace maids.

47
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,480
And the imperial family members like you

48
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,680
chat with me.

49
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,720
We discuss political affairs

50
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,399
around the state.

51
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,680
I'm sure that

52
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,720
you can't keep the title of Crown Prince.

53
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,040
Look.

54
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,960
His Majesty is in the prime of his life,

55
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,520
and he will have his own sons.

56
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,760
So how could he possibly

57
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,880
make you the Crown Prince?

58
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,720
But don't worry.

59
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,560
I will surely help you to

60
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,040
marry the lady from the Cui family.

61
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,280
Just count on me.

Thanks, Mr. Zhao.

Don't take the trouble.

65
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,840

72
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:38,920
He's dead,

73
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,000
so who are you serving?

74
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,040
Just admit your guilty now.

or you will be dead.

Find an adopted son of Zhao Teng.

84
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,480
Tell him that

85
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,520
Zhao Teng has suddenly caught a severe illness

86
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,640

Ask Liu Yuan to immediately come into the imperial palace

to watch Empress Dowager and comfort His Majesty.

89
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,240
Yes.

Isn't he the Prince of Guangling's chamberlain?

108

Go.

What's going on?

112
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,080
Why is this happening?

113
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,560
Why was His Majesty absent from the court session?

114
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,040
There they are.

115
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,560
The court is in bad order now.

116

Who are you?

119
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,320
You're Cui Wenjun from the Cui family.

120
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,200
You're right.

121
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,720
You rarely left Qinghe County before,

122
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,280
why are you in the capital today?

123
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,600
My elder brother is severely ill

124

and dying.

125
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,720
However, he didn't want to part with

126

His Majesty, his peer ministers

127
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,160
and Counselor-in-chief.

128
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,760
He decided to come back to the Residence of Cui in the Central State,

129
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,200
and I came back with him.

130
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,120
So why are you here now?

131
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,600
I'd like to invite all of you

132
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,840

Everybody, please be seated.

137
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,460
I've heard that

138
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,680
Zhao Teng is badly ill

139
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,720
and is dying.

140
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,250
I've also heard that

141
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,640
General-in-chief Liu Yuan went to see Empress Dowager.

142
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,200
He admitted that he had arrogated power in court

143
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,560
and killed loyal ministers.

144
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,200
At the time you arrived here,

145
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,120
the guilty minister Liu Yuan handed over his military power

146
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,000
and gave himself in.

147
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,680
Refreshments are ready.

148
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,120
Have a taste, everyone.

149
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,120
These are specialties of Qinghe County.

150
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,200
Counselor-in-chief,

151
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,800
didn't you hear of this?

152
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,640
You go in and out of the imperial palace every day.

153
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,800
You should have known it earlier than me.

154
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,960
I heard of it before.

155
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,880
Liu Yuan kept maids and whores,

156
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,840
killed ministers indiscriminately

157
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,680
and turned common people into slaves.

158
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,640
I guess you've been tolerating that

159
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,000
and have waited for this result for long.

160
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,440
You're absolutely right.

161
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:01,280
I'm badly ill now,

162
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,190
I'm powerless though I hope to do something.

163
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,040
At such a time of turbulence,

164
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:15,160
please help His Majesty.

165
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,520
It's my duty.

166
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,760
I knew that

167
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,240
you would ground me

168
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,840
sooner or later.

169
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,160
Your Majesty.

170
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,240
The outcome is certain now.

171
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,600
You should be happy.

172
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,840
Why are you still praying?

173
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,040
From beginning to end,

174
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,960
I've always thought that we would win.

175
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,680
What worries me most is that

176
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,160
His Majesty doesn't trust him.

177
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,320
I worry that His Majesty thinks he has other purposes.

178
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,240
If that's true,

179
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,080
everything he does for His Majesty

180
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,440
will be a joke.

181
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,560
Why are you crying?

182
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,360
Did you kill Zhao Teng?

183
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,240
Zhao Teng

184
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,600
died of illness.

185
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,480
What about Liu Yuan?

186
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,520
He confessed his guilty

187
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,440
and has been deprived of military power.

188
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,480
What I say

189
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,960
will be announced to the state

190
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,240
and recorded in history.

191
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,880
Well...

192
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,600
Will I be recorded

193
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,280
as dead today in history?

194
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,720
I'm afraid not.

195
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,560
You need to have several sons.

196
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,240
Otherwise, there will be more rebellions

197
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,120
if you don't have descendants.

198
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,200
I haven't brought weapons into the palace today,

199
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,680
just the wooden sword granted by Your Majesty.

200
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,720
I'm your uncle,

201
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,480
and you are more important

202
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,440
than the throne to me.

203
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,440
Uncle.

204
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,080
Thanks for saving me.

205
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,480
I once said that

206
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,110
you never need to kneel down in front of me.

207
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,960
After being grounded by my disobedient son and eunuch

208
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,600
for three years,

209
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,520
I've long lost my dignity as the Empress Dowager.

210
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,880
Without you,

211
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,680
I wouldn't have been set free.

212
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,920
I was wrong.

213
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,000
I will not see you as my son anymore.

214
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,960
I believed in slanderous talks

215
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,119
and wanted to come into throne as soon as possible,

216
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,640
But then…

217
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,440
But then

218
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,040
I just couldn't break away from Zhao Teng.

219
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,680
I knew I was wrong earlier

220
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,240
and couldn't eat or sleep well every day.

221
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,000
However, I didn't dare to go against them

222
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,359
because I was afraid they would kill you.

223
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,560
I was wrong.

224
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,720
I really was wrong.

225
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,920
I was wrong.

226
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:23,800
I was wrong.

227
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,880
Mother.

228
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:33,460
[Shiqian Palace]

229
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,840
Your Highness.

230
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,640
Have you thought of many things in the past?

231
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,200
The late emperor was just in his thirties

232
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,520
when he passed away,

233
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,880
but he died as an emperor anyway.

234
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,760
It's hard to come by that

235
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,880
we've made it without much trouble.

236
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:34,960
Exactly.

237
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,560
It's really hard to come by.

238
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,000
Then why is Shiyi going to cry?

239
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,640
Your Highness.

240
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,280
No one likes to joke about his disciple

241
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,520
as you do.

242
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,040
I can't stand seeing this.

243
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,000
I thought that

244
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,920
you must have been imprisoned by His Majesty.

245
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,120
His Majesty did order to

246
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,320
imprison me.

247
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,560
He ordered to

248
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,520
imprison me in the palace

249
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,840
for a period of time.

250
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,160
What will happen after this?

251
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,800
I'll go back to the Western State.

252
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,560
The Shiqian Palace is an emperor's living palace,

253
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,080
but why is it vacant?

254
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,000
The late emperor passed away here,

255
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,560
and His Majesty had his bedchamber moved to the Xianyang Palace

256
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,320
for fear of feeling sad.

257
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:49,620
[Shiqian Palace]

258
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,280
I was brought up by the late emperor here

259
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,080
when I was young,

260
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,320
so I lived here too.

261
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,880
What are you looking at?

262
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,080
I'm looking at the place

263
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,320
where you lived in childhood.

264
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,280
They don't know us.

265
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:12,320
That sounds right.

266
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,290
During this rescue,

267
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,440
except a few people,

268
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,080
no one else knows that

269
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,560
the junior Prince of Nanchen is back.

270
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,680
Therefore,

271
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,500
we need to hide our real names in the palace.

272
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:23,950
That sounds right.

273
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,640
So I can't call you “Master”, right?

274
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,480
We would be exposed in that case.

275
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,960
That makes sense.

276
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,480
Zhou…

277
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,920
Your Highness.

278
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,640
The Empress Dowager asks Your Highness to her living palace.

279
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,880
Go to the military advisor.

280
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,280
After all, it's not my mansion.

281
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,600
Don't go around.

282
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,800
The lady is in the palace.

283
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,440
If Your Highness wants to meet her,

284
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,840
I will invite her here.

285
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,240
I'm feeling pitiful.

286
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,480
Pitiful?

287
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,160
For what?

288
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,840
If we want to eliminate uncle,

289
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,960
tonight will be the best time.

290
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,400
That he came to the capital to save the emperor

291
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,840
has been known by no one else

292
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,240
except several close ministers.

293
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,960
Therefore, Royal Army of Nanchen would not complain

294
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,280
even if he died here.

295
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,760
If we kill Liu Yuan and him tonight,

296
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,040
it will be a double kill.

297
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,600
Pitifully, His Majesty values kinship

298
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,800
more than the throne

299
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,320
and doesn't have the heart to kill uncle.

300
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,480
Change clothes for me.

301
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:02,800
Yes.

No.

Actually, I'm going to thank uncle for

306
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,160
saving His Majesty.

307
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,880

we're family

Yes, Your Majesty.

You can.

332
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,320
Get up.

Your Majesty.

334
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,120
You taught the late emperor

335
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,680
and support my uncle,

336
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,320
so I should bow to you.

337
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,720
I need to bow twice more.

338
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,520
You were engaged with the late emperor

339
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,040
but you didn't marry him at last,

340
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,680
so why did you do this?

341
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,080
After the late emperor died,

342
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,880
Empress Gao forced me to be a nun.

343
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,920
When she died later,

344
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,360
I wanted to leave the palace at first.

345
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,080
Then I heard that you made a severe promise

346
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,480
at the Taiji Palace that

347
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,120
you would never get married,

348
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,800
so I stayed here.

349
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,040
After all,

350
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,320
this was the place where we met.

351
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,920
Your Majesty don't come here

352
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,680
just to bow to me, right?

353
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,600
I'd like to ask about a person.

354
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,080
Have you ever heard of

355
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,760
a lady named Huaiyang?

356
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,160
Gao Huaiyang?

357
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,760
Yes. Her surname is Gao.

358
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:56,880
Your Majesty,

359
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,600
what do you want to know about her?

360
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,040
What's her relationship with uncle?

361
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,320
Your Majesty,

362
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,040
why do you think

363
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,960
she has anything to do with your uncle.

364
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,280
I asked you first.

365
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,000
I will tell you

366
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,200
after you answer my question.

367
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,480
Your Majesty,

368
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,960
she's a cousin of Empress Gao

369
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,400
and has lots of chances to come into the palace.

370
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,240
The late emperor saw her

371
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,080
and took a fancy to her soon.

372
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,280
However,

373
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,960
the one she wanted to marry

374
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,000
was your uncle.

375
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,400
Did my uncle like her?

376
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,480
I didn't dare to ask.

377
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,240
So she must be very sad

378
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,240
when uncle left after that.

379
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,640
Maybe.

380
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,040
All I've heard is that

381
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,480
Gao's clan forced her into the palace

382
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,880
so that she could serve the late emperor.

383
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,360
After all, it was always

384
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,480
to Gao's advantage

385
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,440
if they had

386
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,840
an adored concubine.

387
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,560
However, Empress Gao didn't want her to share the late emperor's love

388
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,120
and tried all means to stop that.

389
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,840
Finally, she couldn't marry the late emperor.

390
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,200
After the late emperor passed away,

391
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,280
I've never heard about her.

392
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,800
She has been in the palace as a nun with hair

393
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,440
until today.

394
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,760
She's still alive?

395
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,320
I thought that

396
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,040
I would see you sooner or later

397
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,880
if I stayed in the palace.

398
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,160
Did it have anything to do with me

399
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,120
when you left the palace back then?

400
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,720
No.

401
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,540
[Chonghua Palace]

402
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,320
You like this place?

403
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,880
Master, you must have been tired

404
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,840
after seeing an old acquaintance.

405
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,960
Get in the palace and sleep.

406
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,480
Where are you going?

407
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,560
I'm going out of the palace.

408
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,160
The gate was closed earlier.

409
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,240
A powerful minister can go out

410
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,520
if he has important affairs.

411
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,960
Like you said,

412
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,000
a powerful minister can go out only if he has important affairs.

413
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,800
Do you think this place is like the Western State

414
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,920
where you can go anywhere arbitrary?

415
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,720
I've sent someone to

416
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,080
inform the Residence of Cui,

417
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,480
so you may stay here tonight.

418
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,120
Your Majesty is here too.

419
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,120
Yes.

420
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,080
I almost fainted after crying today.

421
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,120
I just chatted with your military advisor

422
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,600
and I'm back to myself now.

423
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,680
Why don't you

424
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,880
pay respect to His Majesty?

425
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,000
As a noble lady from the Cui family,

426
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,640
where are all your good manners?

427
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,720
He has been here for two hours.

428
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,160
He?

429
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,520
His Majesty.

430
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,920
I told her that

431
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,160
she didn't need to treat me as an emperor

432
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,520
in this living palace.

433
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,840
Please don't blame her.

434
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,240
Uncle, please be seated.

435
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:46,720
Sit down.

436
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,590
You eat.

437
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,480
Uncle.

438
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,360
You've done a deed of merit this time,

439
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,680
so what reward do you want?

440
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:19,680
I don't need that.

441
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:21,360
Jewelries?

442
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,040
A rank?

443
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,000
Or a land?

444
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,600
Or is it marriage?

445
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,520
I can't get married.

446
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,320
Even though you can't actually get married,

447
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,680
you can be with a lady

448
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,200
if you love each other.

449
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,080
His Majesty is wise.

450
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,360
A wedding is useless.

451
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,880
That you truly love each other

452
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,320
is the thing that matters.

453
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,360
I don't want you to be childless.

454
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,640
If you have a child,

455
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,680
you can bring him into the palace.

456
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,160
I'll personally bring him up.

457
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,560
No one would dare to say anything bad.

458
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,320
Your Majesty,

459
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,160
I'm not childless.

460
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,520
So,

461
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,280
I have cousins?

462
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,960
When did that happen?

463
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:17,840
There are ten orphans

464
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:19,520
and one disciple

465
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,280
in my mansion.

466
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:23,200
I'm contented.

467
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:51,640
My military advisor is old.

468
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:52,800
I hope Your Majesty won't blame him.

469
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,640
It's OK.

470
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,400
Your Majesty!

471
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,000
How dare you!

472
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,200
I told you that

473
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,400
no one should come in.

474
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,240
Please don't be angry.

475
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,320
I heard a noise

476
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,520
and was afraid that Your Majesty was in danger.

477
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,600
They are my honored guests

478
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,840
in the living palace,

479
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,960
so how could I be in danger?

480
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,840
Get out!

481
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,680
Yes.

482
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,960
I have nobody to trust

483
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,960
except you.

484
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,760
Your military advisor just told me that

485
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,800
Liu Yuan and you were close when you were younger.

486
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,240
Would you like to ask for leniency for him?

487
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,960
I can give him a way out.

488
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,160
Your Majesty,

489
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,080
please be fair and just.

490
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,000
I have only one request.

491
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,640
Go ahead.

492
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,920
Don't get my descendants involved.

493
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,160
If you're hungry,

494
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:28,960
you may ask someone outside the palace.

495
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,520
I'm not hungry.

496
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,840
I'm just not used to it

497
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,960
since this is my first time to sleep in the palace.

498
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,960
Master, are you worried about something?

499
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,560
Well.

500
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,360
You seem to be worried about something too tonight.

501
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,000
I'm young

502
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,520
without many past stories,

503
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:28,960
so I don't have the chance to be worried.

504
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:31,520
I found that you were not in the mood

505
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,639
as soon as you came back.

506
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,560
What's actually going on?

507
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,350
The wine I'm drinking

508
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:48,739
is called Sangluo.

509
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,080
It's usually granted to

510
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,240
meritorious officials.

511
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,000
My father once granted it to

512
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,920
a general who claimed to

513
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,480
drink lots of wine without getting drunk.

514
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,840
However, he was drunk for half a month

515
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,520
after drinking several liters of it.

516
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:10,340
The wine is strong

517
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:12,900
and I've drunk much tonight.

518
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,240
So if you have any worries,

519
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:17,750
just tell me.

520
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,480
I won't remember anything tomorrow.

521
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,880
Did His Majesty bring it here?

522
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:29,540
We buried it here before.

523
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,840
We buried it in many places in the palace.

524
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,560
Who buried it with you?

525
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,210
Several friends.

526
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,440
In childhood.

527
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,800
Was the person with you?

528
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:53,520
Yes.

529
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,080
He's really drunk

530
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,440
and tells me everything.

531
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,480
So will you take the person out of the palace this time?

532
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,560
The person has committed a severe crime,

533
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,360
and I have no reason to save him.

534
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,320
Your eyes are red.

535
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,800
I haven't slept well,

536
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,920
so my eyes are red.

537
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:33,840
Shiyi.

538
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,520
We've known each other for such a long time that

539
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:37,960
you can't cheat me.

540
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,520
The person knows you for a longer time.

541
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,440
Did my military advisor tell you this?

542
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:45,840
When His Majesty was here,

543
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,240
they chatted about this

544
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,080
and I heard that.

545
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,400
His Majesty just asked me

546
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,040
whether I would ask for leniency for the person just now.

547
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,200
Why would you ask for leniency?

548
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,720
Because of the surname Gao?

549
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,640
Liu Yuan's surname is not Gao.

550
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:05,200
You...you've been talking about Liu Yuan?

551
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,720
Who else should I be talking about?

552
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,680
Let this go.

553
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,040
Go to bed early.

554
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,360
Master, where are you going?

555
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,520
There's curfew in the palace.

556
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,160
You could be taken as an assassin.

557
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,280
Why are you following me?

558
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,600
I'm afraid you would be in danger.

559
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,080
Why?

560
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,360
You've drunk a lot tonight.

561
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,320
Actually, I can drink a lot.

562
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,080
That's right.

563
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,240
What's right?

564
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,160
Mom once read me several lines

565
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,240
about you.

566
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,160
“Lying on the beach with numerous corpses after getting drunk

567
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,680
indulges in singing”

568
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:21,960
I should have realized that

569
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,240
you can drink a lot.

570
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,360
The crazy things I did at a young age

571
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,760
was actually written down.

572
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:31,320
There were not enough soldiers back then

573
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:32,680
and we didn't know if we would survive,

574
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:33,920
so I could indulge myself.

575
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,960
Just put this on.

576
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:42,220
You put it on.

577
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,120
I'm not cold.

578
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:45,280
Come here.

579
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,840
Master, what are you digging for?

580
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:58,840
Wine.

581
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,000
I'll see an old friend in a while.

582
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,520
He buried the wine with me.

583
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,900
We promised to

584
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,520
get it out

585
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,470
and celebrate my victorious comeback.

586
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,800
Who are you?

587
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,440
Let me go!

588
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,560
Do you still want to be alive?

589
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,320
Do you hear me?

590
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,000
Let me go!

591
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,800
Aren't you afraid of getting your families and relatives killed?

592
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,280
Hurry up and let me go!

593
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,400
Who are you?

594
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,520
Tell me!

595
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,120
Who are you?

596
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,800
Who...who are you?

597
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,680
Who actually are you?

598
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,600
You!

599
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,360
That makes sense.

600
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,800
Only you will come to see me.

601
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,340
I've dug this jar of wine out

602
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:31,700
to meet you for the last time.

603
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,760
I should have

604
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,080
asked Empress Gao to

605
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,760
kill you back then.

606
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:42,160
Thanks for caring about me when we were young.

607
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,840
I cared about one who wants my life now.

608
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,160
Give me some wine.

609
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,560
My throat is soar.

610
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,560
Well.

611
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,400
You're the only one

612
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,840
that makes me concede defeat.

613
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,280
Do you have any unfulfilled wish?

614
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,200
I've been arrogating power in court for years

615
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,760
and I've enjoyed the dignity as an emperor.

616
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,320
I have no pities.

617
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:38,240
Is there any family member

618
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:40,040
you need me to take care of?

619
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,360
I have a son.

620
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,280
I'll have him escorted back to Pingcheng

621
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,940
so that he can escape this misfortune.
