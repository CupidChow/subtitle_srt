[Episode 3]

4
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,520
All the zithers here are handed down from ancient times.

5
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,320
And one of them

6
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,979
was used by His Highness when he was young.

7
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,420
It was sent to Chang'an

8
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,620
after the late emperor passed away.

9
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,300
His Highness said that

10
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,620
you can choose one yourself.

11
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,440
Which one did my master ever use?

12
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,140
Are you asking me which one

13
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,770
did His Highness use?

14
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,260
This one.

15
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,260
It's called Chang Feng.

16
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,480
The waves rise as the distant wind comes,

17
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,680
like a single filed on a high mountain.

18
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,120
I'll take it.

19
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:12,840
The reason

20
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,600
you are unwilling to get together with me in Pingqin Commandery must be that

21
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,640
you have kept a beauty

22
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,440
inside your house.

23
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,720
Is he one of master's friends?

24
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,140
[Pince of Pingqin]

25
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,000
You are?

26
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,880
Whatever.

27
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,280
I am just gonna salute him first.

28
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,360
Are you Zhousheng Chen's concubine?

29
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,000
No, no, I am his disciple.

30
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,480
I see, I see.

31
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,840
I get it.

32
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,840
I knew it the moment you waved.

33
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,079
He can't marry you in a public manner.

34
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,360
You see, he'd

35
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,560
rather take a serious oath,

36
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,280
what a nuisance.

37
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,880
You two.

38
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,000
Yes, sir.

39
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,320
What you saw today

40
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,280
stays in this room.

41
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,000
Do you hear me?

42
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,800
Got it.

43
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,520
I should call you sister-in-law.

44
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,320
It should be.

45
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,080
What's the name of your mansion?

46
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,400
No, no, you misunderstood.

47
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,240
Not sister-in-law?

48
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,360
If not, then.

49
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,480
Whom?

50
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,240
You, you go out and ask

51
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,160
someone in the mansion,

52
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,880
and you will know who I am.

53
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,600
Me? Go out?

54
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:20,760
No, my dear,

55
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,240
why are you driving me out?

56
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,160
Did I say anything wrong?

57
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,480
Don't take it personally.

58
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,760
Though I am one of the princes.

59
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,720
I am actually,

60
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,280
I am just a vassal prince, bestowed for the counter-insurgency.

61
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,440
I am not a member of the royal family,

62
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,159
I didn't read a lot.

63
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,080
Please forgive me

64
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,880
if I said anything offensive.

65
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,480
I, I will apologize.

66
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,280
Don't be mad, don't be mad.

67
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,360
I am a man with little schooling.

68
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,360
I am really not...

69
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,760
You scared my disciple.

70
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,000
You little...

71
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,760
Disciple?

72
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,120
The Cui family sent her over here?

73
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,080
But I had no idea.

74
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,280
Sorry, my dear sister-in-law.

75
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,240
All right.

76
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,200
You may go.

77
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,200
I have put my foot in my mouth again.

78
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,280
Come on.

79
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,840
The people of Pingqin Commandery.

80
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,440
came along with Prince of Pingqin.

81
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,080
And they brought a lot of harvest from this year

82
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,120
to show their gratitude

83
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,480
for the great kindness His Highness showed to send out troops and save the city last year.

84
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,159
May I know if she is the princess?

85
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,159
No.

86
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,480
This is His Highness's disciple.

87
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,560
I heard that Prince of Nanchen's disciples

88
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,720
are all generals.

89
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,480
She is new, she is new.

90
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,240
The people in your jurisdiction

91
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,680
are so you.

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,520
You all love to see someone as someone else's wife.

93
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,640
Stop calling without knowing.

94
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,159
This is not concubine.

95
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,120
I was mistaken just now.

96
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,800
I mean...

97
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,480
Come on.

98
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,720
Apologize to His Highness and Miss Cui.

99
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,000
Please excuse me, sorry.

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,600
Not a problem, it's ok.

101
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,320
You are also to blame for this.

102
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,280
If you, the Prince of Nanchen, take someone as your disciple,

103
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,120
you have to let all the people from the Western State,

104
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,520
and the Royal Army recognize her.

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,480
Tomorrow, I will take you

106
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,680
to see the Royal Army.

107
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,860
[The Western State]

Secular conduct my guide, remain integrity for good.

Secular conduct my guide, remain integrity for good.

113
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,040
What's her dreaming about

114
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,360
that makes her smile like that?

115
00:08:30,799 --> 00:08:32,240
She is not too old,

116
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,840
nor too young.

117
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,480
It might be inappropriate

118
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,679
to just carry her back.

119
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,240
What happened to master?

120
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,240
To cover Shiyi with a fox fur

121
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,880
on such a hot day.

122
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,680
Maybe it's for avoiding body contact.

123
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:35,740
How can you be doing this?

124
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,860
Please let me.

125
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:37,780
She's too heavy for you to carry.

126
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,620
Open the door, please.

127
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,020
This fox fur...

128
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,420
It's from my room.

129
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,900
Just leave it here.

130
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,540
Am I not in my master's study?

131
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,100
My Lady, morning.

132
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,380
Did you know that last night,

133
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,380
it was His Highness who carried you back in his arm?

134
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,700
You mean

135
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,140
I fell asleep in my master's study?

136
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,340
Though His Highness is not

137
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,140
someone to be easily fussed.

138
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,100
But you should always remind yourself of

139
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,740
the etiquette between a master and a disciple.

140
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,820
Especially because His Highness is the uncle of the emperor,

141
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:58,900
even the emperor himself

142
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,380
has to show some courtesy to him in the future.

143
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,940
I know.

144
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,860
But I didn't mean to fall asleep.

145
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,220
I get it, My Lady.

146
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,900
You were simply too tired at that time.

147
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:09,980
But here we are, at the royal mansion.

148
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:10,940
Nothing like that of Cui Mansion.

149
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,900
We must be careful all the time.

150
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:17,980
Master,

151
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,100
you are finally back.

152
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,820
Shiyi locked herself up in the yard

153
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,100
for no reason.

154
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,820
She refuses to eat or come out.

155
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,620
And she's been copying books all the time.

156
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,100
Cheng Xi said she is pondering over her mistakes behind the closed door.

157
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,540
Master.

158
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,020
Did she make any mistake?

159
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,460
I will check it out later.

160
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,580
Master,

161
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,220
why don't you go there now?

162
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,940
I am afraid she's starving.

163
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:43,720
Not everyone

164
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,700
is the same as you

165
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,500
who would starve to death without having a meal.

166
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:47,460
I...

167
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,300
Master.

168
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,500
It's a bit inappropriate for you

169
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,860
to crack a joke at this moment, isn't it?

170
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,020
You need to go over there now.

171
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:54,940
All right.

172
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,220
I will be on my way.

173
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,020
I heard that

174
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,420
you are pondering over your mistakes behind the closed door.

175
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,540
Is it because last night

176
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,380
you fell asleep in my study?

177
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,580
Master, I have realized my mistake.

178
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,460
I forgive you now.

179
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,180
Though you have forgiven me,

180
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,820
I can never rest easy.

181
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,740
I need to review as many times as I can.

182
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,660
And keep everything firmly in mind.

183
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,780
In my opinion, rather than wasting your time

184
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,420
and doing the same thing over and over again,

185
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,210
it would be better to open your eyes instead

186
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,340
and look around you.

187
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,820
Xiaoyu

188
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,080
is now freaking out

189
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,020
because you refuse to step out of the yard.

190
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:09,200
Soon,

191
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,250
if she still can't see you,

192
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:10,900
I am afraid

193
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,260
she is going to tear the whole mansion down.

194
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,140
Make sure you get that.

195
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,260
I understand.

196
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,420
I gotta go then.

197
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,020
Counsellor,

198
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,220
do you know anything about aphasia?

199
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,740
As far as I know,

200
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,580
if it was a usual aphasia,

201
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,180
the most common way

202
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,940
is to stimulate the acupoints through acupuncture,

203
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,620
along with the support of some medicine.

204
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,260
It will take effect as time goes by.

205
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,900
But I see Miss Cui

206
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,260
is very clever and quick-witted.

207
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,100
She can hear while remain silent.

208
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,740
In my humble opinion,

209
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,460
the root cause lies in her heart.

210
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,020
Her mother ever mentioned

211
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,100
that she had aphasia

212
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,340
because of her father's departure.

213
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,540
Have you heard about this,

214
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,140
Counsellor?

215
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,100
I only heard that

216
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,540
the Cui Family searched everywhere

217
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,860
for a good doctor for their daughter.

218
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,780
As for the rest,

219
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,940
it seems that no one dared mention anymore.

220
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,740
Your Highness,

221
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,500
if you really can't bear to see her unable to speak,

222
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,860
I can help you search for some good doctors in the Western State

223
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,900
and ask them to come to our mansion for treatment.

224
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,260
However,

225
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,980
if what Mrs. Cui said was true,

226
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,900
as far as I am concerned,

227
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,180
the root lies in Miss Cui's heart.

228
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,980
We must seek her salve where she got her sore.

229

[The Chonghua Palace]

230
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,620
The secret letter making a false charge against me

231
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,460
should be tore on the spot.

232
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,820
How could you even hide it?

233
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,540
You misunderstood, mother.

234
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,540

235
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:10,820

[Liu Zixing]

237
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,420
His Majesty has not yet to read the letter,

238
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,820
as it was opened by me.

239
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,500
Oh, yeah?

240
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,820
What's the content of the letter?

241
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,660
Recite it to me.

242
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,180
You don't dare to speak but to read?

Zhao Teng.

244
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,460
Take him out. Give him 30 strokes of the cane.

245
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,220
Don't be angry, Your Highness.

246
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,380
Prince of Guangling has been in a poor health since childhood.

247
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,940
30 strokes...

248
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,140

Your Highness has taken a huge advantage,

262
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,700
but no one knows your grievances.

263
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,540
You love birds,

264
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,660
and then death was granted by the empress upon your birds.

265
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,060
You had several fish,

266
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,860
and they were also poisoned by the empress.

267
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,780
Apart from the daily torture,

268
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,780
you have to take all the blame and punishment for His Majesty.

269

Enough.

and send the records to the Eastern Palace

from the Empress, His Majesty and Prince of Guangling.

These are all birthday gifts

from the Cui's clan in the Beichen.

302

That many?

They have got a big family.

304
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,220
The Cui's clan has six branches.

305
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,380
Even for our branch alone,

306
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,740
there are three little branches.

307
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,420
And branch to which my lady belongs is called Wushui.

308
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,340
It got prosperous because of our chief.

309
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,180
My Lady is the only girl

also the future crown princess.

That's why she's got lots of birthday presents.

Did you forget what I said?

No formality inside the mansion.

00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,020
I forgot.

your birthday is coming.

318
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,100
I have never prepared any birthday presents

for anyone.

320
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,820
After thinking it over.

321
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,060
I think this

322
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,340
might be suitable.

323
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,300
Open it and take a look

324
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,860
before you decide whether you want it or not, okay?

325
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,580
These are all the seals from the generals who surrendered to me

326
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,580
after I left the Central State.

327
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,420
I was gonna give it to my royal brother.

328
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,300
But it's fine if I give it to you,

329
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,260
so that I don't have to think it over and over

330
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,860
for your following birthdays

331
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,060
year after year.

332
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,940
Are you sure you want to give me

333
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,740
such an important item?

334
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,740
So long as you don't hate it.

335
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,420
This is the proof that my master

336
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,180
once fought for his people in different wars.

337
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,020
I will make sure it's well-kept,

338
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,460
and protect it with my life.

339
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,060
We are about to send out our troops.

340
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,260
Get ready.

341
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,780
This is going to take months.

342
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,700
The army provisions and the defense of the Western State

343
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,740
must be taken into consideration.

344
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,780
Yes.

345
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,620
Your Highness.

346
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,700
There is one more person to concern.

347
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:46,180
Oh, and Shiyi.

348
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,980
When we went for a battle before, we went without delay

349
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,980
and our mansion became an empty house immediately.

350
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,480
This time,

351
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,420
we have this little disciple in the mansion.

352
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,980
We can't simply go at our free will.

353
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,200
Well, bring her along then,

354
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,720
so that everyone will feel at ease.

355
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,840
That's impossible.

356
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,280
If Mr. Cui ever finds out that

357
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:05,880
we brought Shiyi

358
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,840
to a battlefield,

359
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,040
he's definitely going to

360
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,760
put up a desperate fight against master.

361
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,780

363
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:08,910
Did you forget the next line?

364
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,320
I used to recite it.

365
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,640
But somehow,

366
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,960
I forgot when I took the brush.

367
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,280
May I?

368
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:47,660
[Love]

369

[the female exerts her charm while the male becomes intoxicated...]

370
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,920
What are you thinking about?

371
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,760
Mom once told me,

372
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,560
the sentence is saying

373
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,000
the female exerts her charm while the male becomes intoxicated,

374
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,880
soon they hit it off and fall in love.

375
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,240
Fill in the blank

376
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,600
when you finish your studies here.

377
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,560
I have to go.

378
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,720
And I am here to tell you that.

379
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,880
Where are you going?

380
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,490
I don't live here normally.

381
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,800
Around 8-9 months in a year,

382
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,010
I will be leading troops outside.

383
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,680
It will be the same in the future.

384
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,540
You need to get used to this.

385
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,380
After I leave.

386
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,700
You and Cheng Xi will be the only ones

387
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,340
living here except the guards.

388
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,740
Take care of yourself.

389
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:06,880
That's all.

390
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,040
There are no other things

391
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,400
I need to tell you.

392
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,080
News of victory.

393
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,480
Okay, wait for my news of victory.

394
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,920
From now on,

395
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,100
there will only be news of victory for the Royal Army.

Since we left the Western State,

479
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,100
it has been 19 months.

480
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,020
Your wound.

481
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,580
It's okay.

482
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,660
You don't need to worry about that.

483
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,380
Master.

484
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,180
I have prepared the provisions

485
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,460
according to your order.

486
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:26,900
Great.

487
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:27,940
So tonight,

488
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,140
you set out with the provisions

489
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,180
to Shouyang.

490
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,620
Please leave it to me, Master.

491
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,740
I know the place better than he does.

492
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,700
All right.

493
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,140
Then you send the news of victory back to the Central State.

494
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:36,900
Got it.

495
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,060
Glad Shiyi is here today.

496
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,500
Even if all of us were gone,

497
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,940
there's still someone looking after our master.

498
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,780
I'll be honest with you.

499
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,340
Master fell off his horse

500
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,580
because he was shot by a poisonous arrow

501
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,060
and hurt his arm.

502
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,780
Although he was detoxified,

503
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,780
his symptoms will come back now and then,

504
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,260
and it feels like breaking a bone.

505
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,580
Master won't allow us to make it public.

506
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,940
It will get worse at night.

507
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,660
So, you need to be extra careful.

508
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,580
Now Master is all yours.

509
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,940
I'll also leave my brother to you.

510
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:16,860
Don't worry.

511
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,580
He will be okay as long as I am.

512
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,500
Our master and I will be the same.

513
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,180
Please take a good rest, Your Highness.

514
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,540
Why are you here?

515
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,540
I worry about you.

516
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,180
Go take a rest in Xiaoyu's camp.

517
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,380
You won't be of much help here.

518
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,860
I can handle this.

519
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:49,740
Go ahead.

520
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,540
Anything wrong, My Lady?

521
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:44,020
Well...

522
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,820
I am afraid His Highness will blame that on me.

523
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:49,900
Please.

524
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,580
All right, all right.

525
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,460
If he keeps sleeping,

526
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,980
the medicine will get cold.

527
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,220
Why are you here?

528
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,860
My Lady, what brought you here?

529
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,140
His Highness finished taking his medicine?

530
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,460
No, no, the medicine was spilled out.

531
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,540
It's all gone.

532
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,140
You are being too kind, My Lady.

533
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,220
Actually, I could

534
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,700
take the bowl on my own.

535
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,780
No, no.

536
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,180
I spilled it.

537
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,660
Spilled it.

538
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:20,780
My Lady.

539
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,580
What on earth happened?

540
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,340
Medic.

541
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:26,780
Your Highness.

542
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,580
I was being careless

543
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,660
and tipped over the medicine just now.

544
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,860
I am gonna have to bother you to cook another one for me, will you?

545
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,100
Yes, I will cook it immediately.

546
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:34,940
Nevertheless,

547
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,620
I'm afraid you'll have to wait for another two hours.

548
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,180
Okay, no problem.

549
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,140
Just a bowl of medicine.

550
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,220
It won't kill me with two extra hours.

551
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,740
Why are you so worried?

552
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,620
What do you want?

553
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,100
No matter what you say,

554
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,460
I am staying.

555
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,260
You have made up your mind?

556
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,140
These days,

557
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:48,980
I am afraid

558
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,660
the news of me having a relapse would get out,

559
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,500
that's why I am only keeping Xiaoyu and Tianxing

560
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,740
with me.

561
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,340
What they can do,

562
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,380
I can do just the same.

563
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,620
All right.

564
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,700
If you get tired,

565
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,980
you can sleep over there.

566
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,020
Today,

567
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,340
Xiaoyu and Tianxing were both wrong.

568
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,260
The day after tomorrow

569
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,260
marks the full 19 months.

570
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:32,770
♫Snow of pavilion gently kisses the window pane♫

571
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,780
The 19 months you are away from your mansion.

572
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:38,440
♫My love for you won't dive deep into my brow♫

573
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:44,360
♫Singing whispers while I'm slightly drunk♫

574
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:49,940
♫Hearing it, can you see that I'm thinking of you♫

575
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:59,120
♫Watching your shadowy form disappearing in the heavy snow♫

576
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:01,660
Master.

577
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:07,920
♫If I were a lyre, how would I be able to harmonize with you♫

578
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,780
Allow me a few more days till I get used to this.

579
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,820
I will pay a solemn respect to you by then.

580
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:13,800
♫If I took the brush, how should I portray you♫

581
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:19,650
♫With the floating tea fragrance, how should I drink with you?♫

582
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:25,240
♫Under the moon at the city gate, we enjoyed the lanterns and boats together♫

583
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:35,320
♫Pity that the feelings cannot be expressed♫

584
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:43,060
♫The snow in front of the yard keeps falling♫

585
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:48,840
♫Looking at your smile, I don't want to wake up♫

586
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:59,260
♫How should I greet you in the four seasons of the world?♫

587
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:06,480
♫With a sincere heart, I believe♫

588
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:12,310
♫One day, we will enjoy this picturesque world together♫

589
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:22,500
♫Even if it's millions of miles, I'll run to you willingly♫
