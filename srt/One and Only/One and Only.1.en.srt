1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,440
Eastern Palace has sent lavish gifts this time.

3
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,199
Miss,

4
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,200
will you please put on a smile

5
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,520
when you see the chamberlain later?

6
00:02:11,768 --> 00:02:14,240
(Cui Shiyi)

7
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,480
(Cui Shiyi)
I beg you.

8
00:02:17,112 --> 00:02:18,000
(Cheng Xi)

9
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,960
May all four seasons go as you wish

10
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,160
and may you finish your apprenticeship as early as possible

11
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,600
to get married in the palace

12
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,160
in the coming year.

13
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,720
Miss.

14
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,640
It's been two months.

15
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,760
Why is there no good news yet?

16
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:14,240
Countless thoroughfares and alleyways.

17
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,320
The nine markets open at the same time. Different stores scatter along different streets.

18
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,320
People jostle one another on the way. Vehicles cannot thus turn around.

19
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,760
Overflowing passengers in the city set off to hundreds of stores.

20
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,800
This is the Western State you see.

21
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,159
I'm here to deliver the good news.

22
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,400
I heard you haven't slept well for a dozen days

23
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,320
waiting for it.

24
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,480
Master, congratulations on your complete victory.

25
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,920
What I just read

26
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,400
was taught by my uncle when I was young.

27
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,520
The west capital in the former dynasty has been our current Western State.

28
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,160
His Majesty's army has returned.

29
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,200
In this generation of Cui,

30
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,600
I'm the only girl

31
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,320
in my family.

32
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,600
The rest of them

33
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,080
mostly died in infancy.

34
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,440
Because my family was at the height of power,

35
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,920
I had been engaged to the Crown Prince

36
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,560
before I was born.

37
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,280
Today is your birthday.

38
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,120
Gifts have been sent here from the palace.

39
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,600
Remember to

40
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,480
give gratuity to the people from the palace

41
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,520
(Cui Shiyi in youth)
after you accept the gifts.

42
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,160
(Cui Shiyi in youth)

43
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,000
(Cui Shiyi in youth)
I see.

44
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,120
Father.

45
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,280
Father, are you back?

46
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,480
Father?

47
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,400
Where's father?

48
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,040
Mother.

49
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,440
(Cui Wenjun)
It's time to go to the banquet.

50
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,400
Third Lady.

51
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,120
Suzerain, he still won't leave.

52
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,000
He still wants to see his daughter one more time.

53
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,080
Where's Father?

54
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,760
He's not coming.

55
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,240
Didn't you say

56
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,040
Father will come to my birthday banquet today?

57
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,000
Your father...

58
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,480
is not in the residence.

59
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:46,390
(Cui Guang)

60
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,760
Wait until Shiyi is asleep,

61
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,200
take him to see Shiyi once.

62
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,040
Don't delay any longer.

63
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,920
He must leave tonight.

64
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,360
Qilang's parents and brothers are no longer in this world.

65
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,240
And now he's sick.

66
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,880
How can I bear

67
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,120
to ask him to leave the Cui family now?

68
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,720
If it weren't for His Majesty's concern that

69
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,040
I've served two generations of emperors,

70
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,920
who has asked for a peaceful divorce of you two,

71
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,120
you and Shiyi

72
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,520
would have long been implicated.

73
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,000
Third Lady.

74
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,080
Why haven't you seen through the situation yet?

75
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,280
But he's my husband.

76
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,200
He's innocent.

77
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,559
Sister.

78
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,559
They offended the Empress Gao.

79
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,120
That is

80
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,000
the Gao family, which controls half of the country.

81
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,080
If you can't do this,

82
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,840
not only you and your daughter,

83
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,640
but the whole Cui family will get involved.

84
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,200
But I'm his wife.

85
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,360
And you're the third lady of the Cui family too.

86
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,360
What you should protect is

87
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,480
not just your husband.

88
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,440
It's the Cui family.

89
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,520
(Father of Shiyi)

90
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,719
(Father of Shiyi)
I owe you, my daughter.

91
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:23,600
I owe you, my daughter.

92
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,240
If you know you owe me,

93
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,640
put me to bed tonight.

94
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,040
You know

95
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,920
I'm still sick.

96
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,760
I didn't behave well.

97
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,160
Don't blame me, father.

98
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,360
Go get some rest.

99
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,520
Get well soon.

100
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,120
Uncle has promised me

101
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:46,960
to go to see the hunting

102
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,160
when the snow stops.

103
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,000
You can also go with me

104
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,560
at that time.

105
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,360
Lie down.

106
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,520
Go to sleep.

107
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:36,291
(Cui Mansion)

108
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,160
I've arranged someone to find a place

109
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,200
where you can hide for the winter.

110
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,200
I am the son of a sinner.

111
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,200
I have no regrets that

112
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,320
you and I once were a couple.

113
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,120
Qilang.

114
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,800
Third Lady, take care of yourself.

115
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,800
Qilang.

116
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,240
Third Lady, you can't afford to get ill.

117
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,960
It's cold at this snowy night.

118
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,680
Go back now.

119
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,440
Let's not see each other again

120
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,400
for this life.

121
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,040
Mother, I'm going to pay my respects to Father.

122
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,400
Shiyi.

123
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,720
Shiyi.

124
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,400
Father.

125
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,120
Father.

126
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,520
Where's Father?

127
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,440
Shiyi.

128
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,560
Mother, where's Father?

129
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,440
He said he was coming back to rest last night.

130
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,080
But why isn't he in his room?

131
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,840
Where is he?

132
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,120
Shiyi.

133
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,800
Your father...

134
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,560
Your father is gone.

135
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,800
He left Qinghe County.

136
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,920
He abandoned you.

137
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,360
But don't be afraid.

138
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,600
You still have your mother and uncle.

139
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,840
You're still the daughter of the Cui family.

140
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,160
Nothing will change.

141
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,960
From now on,

142
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,640
here

143
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,520
in Qinghe County,

144
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,120
in the Residence of Cui,

145
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,920
no one will ever mention your father again.

146
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,320
You can't mention him either.

147
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,520
Shiyi.

148
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,400
Shiyi.

149
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,680
Father once said

150
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,640
it was snowing heavily the day I was born.

151
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,040
After that, on my every birthday,

152
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,280
he regretted that it didn't snow.

153
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,800
On the day I turned 10 years old,

154
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,920
the long-awaited snow finally came.

155
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,040
But it took him away from me.

156
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,960
Shiyi.

157
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,800
Shiyi.

158
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,080
It's been six months since Shiyi received acupuncture.

159
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,560
Why can't she talk yet?

160
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,840
I'm incompetent.

161
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,120
You are incompetent.

162
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,920
It's just that my daughter has been suffering.

163
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,360
Please.

164
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,600
Greetings to the Grand Preceptor.

165
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,200
Minister Zhao.

166
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,600
How are Concubine Qi and the Crown Prince doing?

167
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,560
This is a secret message from the imperial concubine.

168
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,400
I've come all the way here

169
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,600
by day and night.

170
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,360
This letter has never been off me for a moment.

171
00:14:34,784 --> 00:14:36,897
(Zhao Teng)

172
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,200
Is there any oral instruction?

173
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,600
Come to the capital at once.

174
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,080
Cui Shou.

175
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,400
Prepare a carriage to go to the capital.

176
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:47,840
Yes, sir.

177
00:14:48,798 --> 00:14:55,695
(Central State)

178
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,920
(Cui Shou)

179
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,000
(Cui Shou)
Suzerain, do you want to go to the palace right away?

180
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,680
First bathe and dress.

181
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,840
Put on our court uniforms and then go to the palace.

182
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,280
We must not let anyone notice

183
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,440
anything wrong.

184
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,360
Yes, sir.

185
00:16:55,095 --> 00:16:56,639
(Central State)

186
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,480
Who else are in the palace?

187
00:17:02,599 --> 00:17:04,960
The kings and the empress' henchman

188
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,359
Qian Bin.

189
00:17:15,842 --> 00:17:19,044
(Liu Wei)

190
00:17:20,703 --> 00:17:24,255
(Liu Yuan)

191
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:32,880
Great General.

192
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,360
Grand Preceptor, please.

193
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,680
Greetings, Your Concubine.

194
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,440
His Majesty has gone off?

195
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,120
His Majesty

196
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,800
has been dead.

197
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,920
Your Majesty.

198
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,400
Since His Majesty is dead,

199
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,200
why hasn't the prince succeeded to the throne?

200
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,920
The empress hasn't been informed of this.

201
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,640
How can he take the throne so hastily?

202
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,080
His Majesty is now gone.

203
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,640
The crown prince shall succeed to the throne.

204
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,120
This is a natural thing to do.

205
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,920
Why do we need the empress' permission?

206
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,680
Grand Preceptor, what's the hurry?

207
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,280
Can't you wait till dawn?

208
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,640
The country cannot be left without a master for a while.

209
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,600
What's the point of waiting till dawn?

210
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,480
I can take over the position of Lord Commander

211
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,880
to perform the enthronement ceremony.

212
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,440
Cui Guang, you...

213
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:22,960
Qian Bin!

214
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,480
I approve of the Grand Preceptor.

215
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,840
Tonight, the crown prince must be enthroned.

216
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,720
You...

217
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,760
You just want to leave the empress out of this.

218
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,360
Minister Zhao.

219
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,600
Bring the imperial edict, the seal,

220
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,040
and the ribbon.

221
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,360
Dress His Majesty.

222
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,240
You!

223
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,840
Qi Zhenzhen!

224
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,120
Qi Zhenzhen!

225
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,920
How dare you go behind my back

226
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,440
and let the Crown Prince ascend to the throne?

227
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,640
Good for you, Qi Zhenzhen!

228
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,560
Qi Zhenzhen, come out!

229
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,200
Long live the emperor!

230
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,040
Long live the emperor!

231
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,720
(Liu Hui in youth)
Long live the emperor!

232
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,040
Long live the emperor!

233
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,876
(Qi Zhenzhen)

234
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,240
In front of three royal highnesses of the clan,

235
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,520
I couldn't exchange pleasantries with you.

236
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,120
This is the Eastern Palace.

237
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,480
You and I can catch up now.

238
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,280
Congratulations, Your Highness.

239
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,400
After so many years of endurance,

240
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,960
finally this day has come for you.

241
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,960
I just get rid of the shadow of the Empress

242
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:24,640
before falling right into

243
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,920
Liu's clan's control.

244
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,400
If you endure for a while, you will be able to live a whole smooth life.

245
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,280
Hui, leave the house.

246
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,480
Will he come back?

247
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,160
Zhou Shengchen?

248
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,000
If he questions Hui's succession?

249
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,800
Let's hold the funeral for the late emperor following the ancestral rule first.

250
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,600
What shall come, cannot be avoided.

251
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,600
Counsellor, His Highness is back.

252
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,360
(Xie Chong)
Congratulations to Your Highness for winning the battle.

253
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,960
Congratulations to Your Highness for winning the battle.

254
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,280
Sorry to keep you waiting, Counsellor.

255
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,200
Master.

256
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,000
The soldiers are waiting to celebrate.

257
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,080
Good.

258
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,400
Kill the animals, prepare the wine, and start a bonfire.

259
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,120
(Song Xiaoyu) (Zhou Tianxing)
Yes, Master.

260
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,960
Counsellor, it's cloudy today.

261
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:27,920
The light is poor.

262
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,120
Why don't you light a lamp?

263
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,440
Your Highness.

264
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,880
I came back with the cavalry

265
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,520
this time.

266
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,720
Chariots and infantry

267
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,880
will be four hours late.

268
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,520
Your Highness.

269
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,680
From the Central State.

270
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,080
From the palace?

271
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,200
Some time ago,

272
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,680
the news of victory was sent to the capital.

273
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,520
I guess

274
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,440
it should be an imperial decree to reward the armies.

275
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,840
His Majesty.

276
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,480
Come on.

277
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,680
Take and put them away all gently.

278
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,880
Put the wine over there.

279
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,760
Put it here, put it here, put it here.

280
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,320
Fill it up, fill it up.

281
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:24,880
Okay.

282
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,440
Bring it here.

283
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:26,760
Sister.

284
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,800
Are you done?

285
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,720
Let's go see Master.

286
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,360
Okay, let's go.

287
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:30,840
Let's go.

288
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,320
You shot

289
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,720
an amazing arrow today.

290
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,240
Counsellor.

291
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,760
Wait a minute.

292
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,360
Wait a moment before you go in.

293
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,600
His Majesty has passed away.

294
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,920
His Majesty has passed away?

295
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,320
Your Highness, you insist on returning?

296
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,800
It was my brother, His Majesty who raised me.

297
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,400
He's gone now. I must see him off.

298
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,640
But you swore an oath, Your Highness.

299
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,320
You will never return to Central State

300
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,600
nor enter the palace.

301
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,480
Now that the new emperor is on the throne.

302
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,640
You're leading the troops to the palace.

303
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,360
Aren't you awaiting

304
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,640
to be accused of rebellion?

305
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,560
I can handle it.

306
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,280
Thousands of courtiers in my royal mansion.

307
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,520
Hundreds of thousands of soldiers outside the tent.

308
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,520
And the people at the border.

309
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,400
I'll entrust them to you tonight.

310
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,280
Your Highness, this can't work.

311
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,040
I will return safely.

312
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,360
Master.

313
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,160
The divine army camp is ready.

314
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,360
We can leave anytime.

315
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,320
The divine army camp shall stay in Western State.

316
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,640
You take 3,000 horsemen

317
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,680
and follow me to Central State.

318
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,480
We are going to Central State.

319
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,960
Not back to Western State

320
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,920
Please think twice, Master.

321
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,640
Please think twice, Master.

322
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,360
Please think twice, Master.

323
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,120
I'm just going to see the late emperor

324
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,720
one last time.

325
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,360
I'm not to take over the kingdom.

326
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,960
3,000 horsemen are enough.

327
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,720
His Highness is right.

328
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,280
3,000 horsemen are enough.

329
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,240
I will go with you.

330
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,320
Your Highness.

331
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,920
I already made a vow

332
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,400
the day I followed you,

333
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,800
I'll live

334
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,040
if Your Highness lives.

335
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,920
If Your Highness...

336
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,400
I will never live alone.

337
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,440
If you want to go, let's go together.

338
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,440
Let's go.

339
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,400
The words Central State...

340
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,320
still remain the same as before.

341
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,080
Who dares not dismount when entering the city gate?

342
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,400
We're from Western State.

343
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,000
From Nanchen Royal Mansion.

344
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,200
May I ask who this gentleman is?

345
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,960
This is Jr. Nanchen King.

346
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,560
Greetings to Jr. Nanchen King.

347
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,240
Has the funeral held for the late emperor?

348
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,560
It'll be held the day after tomorrow.

349
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,320
Send the token to the palace,

350
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,800
saying that Zhou Shengchen has returned.

351
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,840
I will not enter the city gate.

352
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,480
I'll just wait here until the day after tomorrow

353
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,800
to send the late emperor to his funeral.

354
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,640
Yes.

355
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,920
Since he won't enter the city,

356
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,680
what do we have to fear?

357
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,240
Zhou Shengchen is stationed outside the city.

358
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,720
Can you fall asleep?

359
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,240
What should we do?

360
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,960
Just let him be outside the city?

361
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,520
Let him enter the city.

362
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:50,800
No.

363
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,160
Force him to enter the city.

364
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,320
The death of the late emperor was a suddenness.

365
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,320
There have been suspicions among the clans everywhere.

366
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,040
If

367
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,280
even Zhou Shengchen refuses to enter the palace,

368
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,840
wouldn't we fall exactly under suspicion?

369
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,920
Since he's here,

370
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,480
why don't we let him face the ministers directly

371
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,080
and force him to support His Majesty in the palace?

372
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,080
If he enters the palace,

373
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,920
I'm sure it'll stabilize the people.

374
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,400
What if he refuses to come?

375
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,920
If he refuses to enter the palace,

376
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,320
the rumors of his rebellion will be confirmed.

377
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,120
This will leave him a cause for gossip.

378
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,960
Even if His Majesty can't do anything about him now,

379
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,520
there will be a reason to crusade against him

380
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,120
in the future.

381
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,960
Anyway, in a word,

382
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,720
whether he comes or not,

383
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,720
it's good for His Majesty.

384
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,440
I beg Your Highness

385
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,640
to break your oath once for His Majesty

386
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,320
and enter the palace to support the young emperor.

387
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,760
Master, you can't go in.

388
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:18,760
That's right.

389
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,480
They only let you in.

390
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,080
If there's an ambush,

391
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,480
it'll be too late for us to save you.

392
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,680
You're there to attend the funeral for the late emperor

393
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,520
instead of getting yourself killed.

394
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,320
We bow to Your Majesty.

395
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,640
Please stand up.

396
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,680
Thank you, Your Majesty.

397
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,920
Gentlemen.

398
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,440
Jr. Nanchen King is now outside Central State.

399
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,520
He comes here at this moment.

400
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,400
What does he want?

401
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,320
His Majesty is young and the country is in turmoil.

402
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,960
The court is treacherous.

403
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,560
The man who holds the army

404
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,840
returns to the capital now.

405
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,760
Yes, he returns to the capital at this moment.

406
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,160
What's the purpose?

407
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,240
He came here with an army.

408
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,440
I'm clear of

409
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,160
the fears and suspicions in your mind.

410
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,840
Because I am afraid too.

411
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,040
How many soldiers does he have with him?

412
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,920
3,000 horsemen.

413
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,160
Only 3,000?

414
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,280
3,000 is not that many.

415
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,920
I have sent an oral message

416
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,239
to ask him to enter the palace.

417
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,920
Let's wait and see

418
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,199
if he can come to the Taiji Palace

419
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,760
and support His Majesty.

420
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,360
Wait here.

421
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,400
Master.

422
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,440
You...

423
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,880
At the Taiji Palace,

424
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,280
(Zhou Shengchen in youth)
I swear to Heaven.

425
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:44,560
(Zhou Shengchen in youth)

426
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,800
(Zhou Shengchen in youth)
From this day forward,

427
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,600
(Zhou Shengchen in youth)

428
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,159
(Zhou Shengchen in youth)
I will give up my royal name

429
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,800
and guard the Western State forever.

430
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,480
From now on,

431
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,760
I will never set foot in the Central State again.

432
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,560
He's here.

433
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,280
Your Majesty, he's here!

434
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,760
Your Majesty.

435
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,960
My young nephew has now ascended to the throne and the kingdom is in turmoil.

436
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,320
I have to break my oath

437
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,800
and enter the palace to face the emperor.

438
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,960
Your Highness, please remove your sword.

439
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,280
I, Zhou Shengchen, bow before Your Majesty.

440
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,000
Please stand up, Your Highness.

441
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,840
Thank you, Your Majesty.

442
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,320
I didn't mean to

443
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,600
force you to break your oath today.

444
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,840
It's only because of the anecdotal rumor.

445
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,120
Anecdotal rumor has it...

446
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,360
I have a rebellious intent.

447
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,560
That's why Her Highness summoned me to the palace

448
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,240
as a sign of harmony between His Majesty and his subjects,

449
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,640
as well as a stable court.

450
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,960
Thank you, Nanchen King, for taking care of the overall situation.

451
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,160
Please accept my obeisance.

452
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,280
You don't have to do that, Your Highness.

453
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,160
I'm your subject.

454
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,480
How can you make obeisance to me?

455
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,160
For the sake of the country,

456
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,360
what would it take to kneel?

457
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,280
Since your vow has been broken,

458
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,080
will you stay in Central State

459
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,400
to serve His Majesty?

460
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,440
No.

461
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,360
I've been away from Central State for a long time.

462
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,960
I don't want to come back.

463
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,560
Western State suits me more.

464
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,320
I have been plagued by rumors for many years.

465
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,600
I would like to put an end to them today

466
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,000
as a congratulatory gift for

467
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,280
His Majesty's accession to the throne.

468
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,240
How to end them?

469
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,800
I hereby make a vow

470
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,600
to guard the border for the rest of my life.

471
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,720
I will not marry or have any children.

472
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,920
Since there are no children,

473
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,920
there will be no more reasons for me

474
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,680
to usurp power and plot rebellion.

475
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,240
In this way,

476
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,360
His Majesty can feel at ease.

477
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,400
All the ministers can feel at ease.

478
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,800
I

479
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,200
will also no longer be troubled by the rumors.

480
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,840
Your Highness, are you sure?

481
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:25,800
I am sure.

482
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,160
Your Highness really understands what is right.

483
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,560
Your Highness really has a high moral character.

484
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,200
(Liu Changshan)
Yet we...

485
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,899
(Liu Changshan)

486
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,920
I'm really afraid to fight you.

487
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,360
If we had this chance, it wouldn't' be bad.

488
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,840
You and I can have a showdown.

489
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,720
Your name, Jr. Nanchen King

490
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,080
has been known all over the world.

491
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,600
I wouldn't dare to fight you.

492
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,000
Your Highness.

493
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,840
I have a favor to ask.

494
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,040
Please go ahead, Grand Preceptor.

495
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:09,160
I have a daughter named Shiyi.

496
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,560
The late emperor once engaged her to the royal family.

497
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,960
Would Your Highness

498
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,480
like to take her as your pupil?

499
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,480
If so,

500
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,840
the royal family, Cui family

501
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,120
and the Nanchen Mansion

502
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,840
will all get closer to each other

503
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,520
for this.

504
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,600
Good idea. Good idea.

505
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,360
Thus, you'll be doubly related. Doubly related.

506
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:38,880
I...

507
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,800
I'm asking for this with great sincerity

508
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,200
to eliminate the past estrangement

509
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,280
between the Cui family

510
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,320
and Nanchen Mansion.

511
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,280
I would like to do so.

512
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,280
Thank you, Your Highness.

513
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,640
Congratulations, Your Highness, on your new pupil.

514
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,000
Congratulations, Grand Preceptor.

515
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,280
I will lead the troops to the south soon.

516
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,000
I'll be gone for several years.

517
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,360
My entire mansion is full of warriors.

518
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,680
No one will be able to take care of your young daughter.

519
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,680
After I win victory in the battle of Jiangshui,

520
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,560
send her to Western State.

521
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,920
It's a deal.

522
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,000
It's a deal.
