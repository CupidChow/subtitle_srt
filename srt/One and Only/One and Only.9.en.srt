4
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,320
I promise.

5
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,000
I'll still give you

6
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,440
the title of Prince of Fengyang.

7
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,479
I'm already a monk.

8
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:42,120
Xiao Yan,

9
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:43,840
although you've got tonsured,

10
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,600
you still attach to the world.

11
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,039
When you avenge,

12
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,479
come tell me

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,840
whether you want this title or not.

14
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,960
I...

15
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,000
Just follow the edict

16
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:56,160
of His Majesty.

17
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,400
Don't disobey it.

18
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,840
Yes, Your Majesty.

19
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,919
That's right.

20
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,280
When will you set off, uncle?

21
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,760
Tomorrow.

22
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,400
When will we meet next time?

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,600
We'd better not meet again in this life.

24
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,160
Have I done something wrong

25
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,440
and offended you, uncle?

26
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,000
My return to the Central State

27
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,200
always means something serious has happened here.

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,840
so I'd rather

29
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,760
not see you again in this life.

30
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,400
I'll look out to the Central State while I'm in the Central State

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,440
harboring the hope that you'll be a wise emperor.

32
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,600
I envy you

33
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,840
having these able men around.

34
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,920
I want someone of them.

35
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,280
Who?

36
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,280
I'd like to invite Advisor Xie

37
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,200
to help me in the Central State

38
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,080
like how he taught the late emperor.

39
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,240
Are you thinking about Your Majesty's words, Master?

40
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,640
Advisor Xie to me,

41
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,400
is like a teacher, a father.

42
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,950
I won't feel at ease

43
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,680
if I let him stay in the capital.

44
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,920
You are back, Advisor Xie.

45
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,840
Your Highness, I am here to say farewell to you .

46
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,120
You want to stay?

47
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,640
Yes.

48
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,360
His Majesty didn't force you to stay.

49
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,480
You can still think about it.

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,040
I know

51
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,280
Your Highness is concerned about me.

52
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,180
Back then,

53
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,760
I was asked by the late emperor

54
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,230
to follow Your Highness out of the Palace.

55
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:15,320
How time flies.

56
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,530
We have already spent over ten years

57
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,640
fighting on the battlefield together.

58
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,460
Now that Your Highness can totally

59
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,540
manage on your own.

60
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,400
Whether I am there or not

61
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:24,800
won't make a difference.

62
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,140
Your Highness.

63
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,780
Whenever and wherever,

64
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,180
you will always be my right-hand man,

65
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,980
part of my body.

66
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,740
You should never get hurt,

67
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,260
nor severed with me.

68
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,180
I can now die without regret

69
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,580
after hearing what you said, Your Highness.

70
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,460
His Majesty is still quite young

71
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,500
and there is no one he could ask for help.

72
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,210
That's why I

73
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,500
decide to stay and assist him.

74
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,740
Just like I assisted you before.

75
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:20,940
Okay.

76
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,900
Since you have made your decision,

77
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,860
I am gonna have to let you go.

78
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,780
Advisor Xie,

79
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,780
remember this,

80
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,220
the Western State

81
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,260
is always waiting for you to come back.

82
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,380
Okay.

83
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,340
I also want to ask Your Highness a favor.

84
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,460
On that day,

85
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:54,540
please bury me in the Western State.

[Chonghua Palace]

87
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:06,780
Your Highness.

88
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,460
When is your wedding with the princess?

89
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:11,660
In three years?

90
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,560
The last words of my father says

91
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,880
I don't have to get restrained by the three-year mourning period for his death.

92
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,160
The sooner, the better.

93
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,120
And so is the Empress Dowager's opinion.

94
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,000
When did the Empress Dowager want this to happen?

95
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,720
Before I go back to Qinghe County.

96
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,120
She wants the princess

97
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,159
to accompany me back to Qinghe County

98
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,360
and observe mourning rituals for my father.

99
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,960
Even if we ignore the mourning period,

100
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,360
how are we going to hold the wedding ceremony?

101
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,760
According to the Empress Dowager' edict,

102
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,840
there won't be any wedding ceremony

103
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,240
as the marriage is complete

104
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,400
once Shiyi is sent to the residence.

105
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:41,050
You...

106
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,120
I will be going back within two years.

107
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,400
Look how worried Shiyi gets.

108
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,560
She's so worried about that His Highness won't let her go back.

109
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,520
I was thinking about the time

110
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,080
to see if I can pick you up in person.

111
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,110
By then,

112
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,540
I should be in the Six-garrison.

113
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,000
The state affairs are more important,

114
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,200
I can go back on my own.

115
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,950
The state and family affairs are equally important.

116
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,100
Even if I couldn't make it to see her off,

117
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,540
General Cui Shou will accompany her on the way back.

118
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,440
Please don't worry, Your Highness.

Father,

121
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,720
I conducted a divination practice for you.

122
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,520
And the symbol is ominous.

123
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,840
Involved in the battle for the supreme power,

124
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,080
I wonder whose symbol could be auspicious.

125
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,480
Don't tell anyone anything about the divination result.

126
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,600
Not even His Highness.

127

What are you doing here, General Feng?

128
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,920
Greetings, Prince of Fengyang.

129
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,120
How kind, General Feng.

130
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,040
We are so special to each other.

131
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,680
Both of our names contain the character Feng, meaning phoenix.

132
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,559
I am nowhere as good as you.

133

General Feng is a heroine.

134
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:32,520
The character Feng in my name

135
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,480
doesn't live up to its worth.

136
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,960
Someone's really got a good destiny.

137
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,200
Born to be a prince.

138
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,559
And wherever he is, he's still a prince.

139
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,320
Someone's really got a good destiny.

140
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,120
Born to be

141
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,800
the disciple of the junior Prince of Nanchen.

142
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,720
And wherever she is,

143
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,080
she's a member of the Nanchen Royal Mansion.

144
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,440
That makes sense.

145
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,560
Especially for you.

146
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,440
You're always trying to join the Royal Army.

147

But I am one of them from the very beginning.

148
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,080
So,

149
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,680
I should envy you, General Feng.

Is Master in there?

153

He is.

154
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,400
Go in there.

After he leaves tomorrow,

157
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,440
it will take a long time

158
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,040
before she can see him again.

159
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,880

Yes.

168

This is the longest time I have been away from here

169

since I became your disciple.

170
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,400
Yeah.

If there is any delay,

I am afraid that I can only go back to the Western State

after a long time.

176

It's okay.

After all that I said,

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,040
how could you reply with only a few words.

179
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,120
You just need to remember

180
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,320
the Nanchen Royal Mansion will always be there,

do you want to come along?

I don't see it's proper.

you are back in the Central State,

if you bring us with you.

195

General Feng's got a point.

196

And it's natural to be sentimental

as we are about to leave here.

198

I forgot we are outside of the Palace.

Did you use to come here when you were a kid?

Before leaving the Central State,

208
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:32,960
I did.

Then I'll take a good look at this place.

Why is he filling it with water?

211

The well-respected monks of Baima Temple

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,920
has a custom over the years.

213
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,280
Every time when it's the end of the year.

214
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,360
They would ask their disciples

215
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,600
to check the water in there.

216
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,720
If there was a sheet of ice,

217
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,000
they must change the water immediately

218
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,720
in case the pigeons won't get the water.

219
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,560
That's very considerate.

220
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,480
Pigeons are intelligent,

221

they love to stay in the temple during the winter.

222

By the way,

Nope.

I am a general.

226

I have been through blood wars and seen numerous bones of the dead.

Is he a regional prince who just arrived in the capital?

239

how can you tell he's a regional prince?

Look at his bearing,

he should never go to Qinghe County to see you.

For outsiders,

not being able to marry you

309
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,100
is the only regret in his life.

310
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,600
My uncle was, in fact,

forced to break off the engagement.

312
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,520
The late emperor feared that the connection through marriage between the Cui family

would make the Western State an overpowering state.

00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,320
That's why

316
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,380
there was a secret edict from the Palace.

This is called sandfish sashimi.

330
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,500
It's shredded skin of sandfish,

331
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,940
which is also unique to Qinghe County.

332
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,140
You won't see sandfish if you don't live near the sea.

Being a criminal when you entered the city,

yet being the Prince of Fengyang when you leave.

341
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,380
No wonder people would come out to see you.

342
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,620
What they don't know, however,

343
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,420
is that their beloved junior Prince of Nanchen

344
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,860
is now at the back of the convoy.

345
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,120
If there is anything you don't know

346
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:30,920
in the Palace or on the court,

347
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,820
consult Advisor Xie.

348
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,170
Don't say anything wrong

349
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:35,220
that would implicate him.

350
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,340
I will make sure Advisor Xie is in one piece

351
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,020
by being next to him all the time and protect him.

352
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,940
I have trained you personally,

353
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,540
don't let me down.

354
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,420
Keep that in mind.

355
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,220
I won't, General Hong.

356
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,140
Your Highness,

357
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,060
take care.

358
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:10,220
Advisor Xie,

359
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,340
take care.

360
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:23,540
Go.

361
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,060
Advisor Xie,

362
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,140
see you.

363
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,180
Let's go.

364
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,380
Where are you from?

365
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,100
Why don't you give way

366
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,220
when you see the Prince of Taiyuan come?

367
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,940
We are from the Western State.

368
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,540
Master,

369
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,060
this man is called Jin Rong,

370
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:50,860
he is a Qihu people,

371
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,180
and got the credits for counter-insurgency during the late emperor's reign.

372
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,540
One of his daughters

373
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,780
now is a concubine in the Palace.

374
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,660
So sorry.

375
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,020
General,

376
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,940
why would you give way to them?

377
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,660
Did you see

378
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,460
the man in white just now?

379
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,500
He should be

380
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,020
the junior Prince of Nanchen.

381
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:39,260
[Mingguang Palace]

382
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:43,820
Your Highness.

383
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,780
Your Highness.

384
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,700
General Jin.

385
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,100
Please take a seat.

386
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,900
I saw a man

387
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,500
at the city gate

388
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,380
who looks like the junior Prince of Nanchen.

389
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,620
That's him.

390
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,140
Liu Yuan handed all the troops

391
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:07,940
to a man

392
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,140
named Qin Yan,

393
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,460
have you heard of that?

394
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:11,980
Yes, I have.

395
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,420
Some nobody

396
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,700
comes from nowhere

397
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,580
should delude His Majesty

398
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,510
to hand the strong army of the Central State

399
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:19,780
to him.

400
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,820
He is from the Nanchen Royal Mansion.

401
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:27,140
Xie Chong, the military advisor from Nanchen Royal Mansion

402
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,540
was also left in the Palace

403
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,220
to assist His Majesty in the future.

404
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,540
We have killed Zhao Teng and Liu Yuan.

405
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,380
Now comes the Xie Chong and Qin Yan.

406
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,100
The son-in-law of mine,

407
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,100
is really simple-minded

408
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,420
and is always influenced by other people.

409
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:50,980
Your Highness.

410
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,660
Is my daughter in the Palace

411
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,700
having a good time?

412
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,500
She is not favored by His Majesty.

413
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,700
Nevertheless,

414
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,420
with the friendship between you and me,

415
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,500
I will take care of her for you.

416
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,140
I appreciate it, Your Highness.

417
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,340
I

418
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,740
am counting on you in the future, General.

419
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:23,820
No problem.

420
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,380
From now on, the Taiyuan Army

421
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,980
will be at your disposal, Your Highness.

422
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,220
Your Highness.

423
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,940
Dad finally remembers to see me.

424
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,260
Come on,

425
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,500
let me have a look.

426
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,100
Looks like someone's really mad at her dad.

427
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,980
I don't want this either.

428
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:00,660
I am only doing this

429
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,100
for my useless son-in-law

430
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,700
to suppress the rebellion everywhere, isn't it?

431
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,260
You help him suppress the rebellion,

432
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,380
while he already left your daughter uncared-for.

433
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,980
The Prince of Guangling is here.

434
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,620
Don't talk nonsense.

435
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:35,900
Shiyi...

436
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,220
Miss Cui is in the Residence of Cui,

437
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,980
does Your Highness want to see her?

438
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:42,980
There is no engagement

439
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,340
and no point of seeing her anymore.

440
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,580
On the day when Xinghua gets married,

441
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,660
I will take her to the Residence of Cui on behalf of His Majesty.

442
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,300
and I will see her for sure.

443
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,500
Feng,

444
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,180
Mother's afraid that you may get cold feet

445
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,460
and she lets me accompany you all the way.

446
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,700
Does your brother look like

447
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,260
that kind of man?

448
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,940
Men from the Nanchen Royal Mansion

449
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,820
will never get cold feet.

450
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,220
Let's go.

451
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:32,660
[Residence of the Grand Mentor]

452
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,220
Your Highness.

453
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,340
Wenjun.

454
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,460
The Empress Dowager and His Majesty got caught in their business and couldn't get out of the Palace,

455
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,820
so, as the emperor's brother,

456
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,220
I will send the princess here instead.

457
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:57,980
Here's His Majesty's verbal instruction,

458
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,460
since Grand Mentor Cui just passed away,

459
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,860
we don't have to hold a grand wedding ceremony.

460
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,220
Everything must be kept simple.

461
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,180
I accept.

462
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,060
Xinghua?

463
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:21,900
Xinghua.

464
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,460
This is no joke.

465
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,300
Get down now.

466
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,660
It is hard for girls to leave their family when they get married,

467
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,660
and the princess is no exception.

468
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,140
Hope you won't mind.

469
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,220
Understandable.

470
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,180
Please.

471
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,540
What are you burning in the middle of night?

472
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,660
Some confidential military documents.

473
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,180
Military intelligence?

474
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,220
Why are you crying?

475
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,620
[Confidential]

476
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,500
I never knew I would marry you.

477
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,580
I have fallen in love with someone else.

478
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:18,300
Do you have someone you love, General Cui?

479
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,060
I'll be honest with you.

480
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,180
Yes.

481
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,140
Tonight,

482
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,900
are you going to take me as her?

483
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,020
You are not her.

484
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,340
You and me tonight,

485
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,820
are not who we really are.

486
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,140
But rather, the princess and general of BeiChen.

487
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,540
General,

488
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,500
please go to bed.

489
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,780
You have watched the moon for up to two hours.

490
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,060
I miss Xiaoyu.

Your Highness.

492
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,140
Your Highness.

493
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,620
It's pretty late at night,

494
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,100
why is Your Highness not back yet?

495
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,300
Still mad?

496
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:43,980
Nope.

497
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,940
On the day I learned the engagement was canceled,

498
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:46,860
in desperation,

499
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,380
I embarrassed you in front of everyone.

500
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,660
I owe you an apology.

501
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,220
What is done is done.

502
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,020
Your Highness doesn't have to put it in mind.

503
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,900
If Your Highness is fine,

504
00:31:59,020 --> 00:31:59,940
I take my leave now.

505
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,220
Shiyi.

506
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,060
If I get a fief,

507
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,500
and stop being obsessed with position of the crown prince

508
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,540
and stay away from the Central State,

509
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,220
will you go with me?

510
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,340
No.

511
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,380
You still want to be the crown princess,

512
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,940
and the empress in the future?

513
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,460
Never.

514
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,220
It has nothing to do with being the crown princess or not.

515
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,020
I have never wanted to enter the Palace.

516
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,780
If you have the chance to choose again,

517
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:30,980
why don't you

518
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,860
choose someone you want?

519
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,900
How do you know

520
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,300
you are not the one I want?

521
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,620
And how do you know

522
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,740
that I don't want to marry you?

523
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,900
Please behave yourself, Your Highness.

524
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,140
When the engagement was made,

525
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,220
I was not born and couldn't make the decision.

526
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,260
What's in the past

527
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,780
is the agreement of our fathers,

528
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,860
not mine,

529
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,620
and definitely not my intention.

530
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,180
From today on,

531
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:12,220
Your Highness, please forget me.

532
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,580
A prince who has no power,

533
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:21,300
and an imperial concubine who is not favored.

534
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:24,020
In this Palace,

535
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,380
we are somewhat alike.

536
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,460
What

537
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:32,540
do you want from me?

538
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:36,739
The title of the empress.

539
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,699
The fact that His Majesty and I being each other's brother

540
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,380
doesn't give me the power to decide

541
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,540
which concubine he wants to favor.

542
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:48,900
What if you were the emperor?

543
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,820
My father can help you get the throne.

544
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,940
While you,

545
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,380
need to repay me with the throne of empress.

546
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:10,500
[Residence of Cui]

547
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:10,700
My Lady,

548
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:11,820
every branch of the family is here.

549
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,140
They said they wanted to offer their condolence.

550
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,900
Keep the body in the room

551
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,700
and send the princess back to rest.

552
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:20,620
Yes, My Lady.

553
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,780
[Residence of Cui]

554
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,220
Please go inside and have a rest, Your Highness.

555
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,900
Only Shiyi follow me inside.

556
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,460
Wenjun.

557
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,620
Wenjun is here.

558
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,420
Sit down and let's talk.

559
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,780
Wenjun,

560
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,980
sorry to hear the sudden death of the clan chief.

561
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,460
We made it here

562
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,220
as soon as we learned the news.

563
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:23,980
Why don't you send someone

564
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,860
to send a letter here first?

565
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,180
So that I can arrange people to receive you.

566
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,180
We are afraid that you worried too much.

567
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,700
Wenjun.

568
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,460
So far, in your generation,

569
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,580
only you and Wenji were left.

570
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,580
Do you

571
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,540
have any plan for the future?

572
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,860
From now on,

573
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,180
I will be in charge of

574
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,780
both internal and external affairs of Wushui House.

575
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,860
Here is the bride-price list.

576
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,500
Please have a look.

577
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:07,300
Who is this bride-price for?

578
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,740
To you, from me.

579
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,020
Wushui House can't sustain without having a chief, not even a day.

580
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,700
This is bride-price list

581
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,940
that I asked someone to prepare overnight.

582
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,340
I thought

583
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,340
it was prepared for the younger generation.

584
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,100
I never knew it was for me.

585
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,020
Shiyi.

586
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,220
Yes, Mother.

587
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,900
Return it to your uncle.

588
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:31,860
Yes.

589
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,060
If it were for the younger generation.

590
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,580
Two of the three sons left by my brother

591
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,780
remain unmarried.

592
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,140
I can help arrange.

593
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,100
If it were for me,

594
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,660
there is no need.

595
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:56,180
We are only doing this for your good.

596
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,820
I appreciate it.

597
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,380
As the clan chief is gone,

598
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,060
if there was no marriage connection between Wushui

599
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,060
and the rest of us,

600
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,380
once anything goes wrong,

601
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,500
we are left without proper reasons

602
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,780
to offer a hand.

603
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,660
We have the same ancestry,

604
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,180
if you want to help,

605
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,700
you will do it no matter what.

606
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,780
If you don't want to help anymore,

607
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,100
I won't say a thing.

608
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,700
We are here for your good,

609
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:29,020
why do you have to turn us down?

610
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,820
What you may not know

611
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,220
is that before my brother passed away,

612
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:37,180
he recommended his eldest and second son to the Imperial Palace

613
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,860
and he let his third son marry Princess Xinghua.

614
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,780
My youngest daughter, Shiyi,

615
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:44,060
who was a disciple of the junior Prince of Nanchen.

616
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,780
Be it the Liu Royal family,

617
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,100
Empress Dowager Qi ,

618
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,460
or the Zhousheng family in the Western State,

619
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,900
we will be family to each other someday.

620
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,420
If you're

621
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,900
so insistent,

622
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,420
then I won't push it.

623
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,740
What kind of bride-price is this?

624
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,980
They are literally here

625
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,980
to rob my family property.

626
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,220
The person who wanted to marry me today,

627
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,540
is called Cui Zheng.

628
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,060
His branch was once the most thriving

629
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,340
among our six branches.

630
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,500
But they offended the emperor later

631
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,220
and in despair,

632
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,420
they had to flee to the south of the river.

633
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,220
That was also the darkest time

634
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,860
for us, the Cui family.

635
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,540
Later.

636
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,860
Your uncle became an official on the imperial court.

637
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,300
And our family

638
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,540
gradually regained its past glory.

639
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,700
And those who fled to the south

640
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,540
have gradually returned.

641
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,580
My uncle is the one who made it possible for them to come home,

642
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,060
yet they want to steal the position of clan chief

643
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,940
after he died.

644
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,180
Glad that he is gone

645
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,100
so he won't be sad about this.

646
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,540
You finally opened your mouth

647
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,140
to talk to me.

648
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,620
My master said,

649
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,820
the Gao family

650
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,460
was always trying to get a chance to destroy our family.

651
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,620
If Mother didn't do that,

652
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,540
not only you and me,

653
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,940
the whole family is going to suffer.

654
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:01,220
I can't help recalling that night over and over again,

655
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,580
and I regretted.

656
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,780
[Residence of Cui]

657
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,220
If only

658
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,340
I could go with him

659
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,500
on that night.

660
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,660
It is really heartbreaking

661
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,860
to see him leave alone.

662
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,260
You did that for me.
