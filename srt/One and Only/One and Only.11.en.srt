[Episode 11]

3
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,680
Stay where you are!

4
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,000
Yang Shao, let go of Feng Qiao.

5
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,039
Don't come close, Shiyi.

6
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,160
I have but one request.

7
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,759
Give me Liu Changshan.

8
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,039
What do you want him for?

9
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:43,960
That's none of your business.

10
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,960
Just bring him here.

11
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:46,479
Go get him.

12
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,280
Yes.

13
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,600
Don't come close.

14
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,840
Yang Shao,

15
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:55,960
if I had known

16
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,320
you were so ungrateful,

17
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,560
I wouldn't have helped you.

18
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,640
Miss Cui,

19
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,199
I have my reason to save him.

20
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,120
Stay where you are!

21
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,160
Don't push him.

22
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,600
He won't hurt Shiyi.

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,760
General Yang.

24
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,400
You are finally here to save me.

25
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,840
Cut the crap and come with me.

26
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,040
Prepare a carriage for me

27
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,000
outside the city.

28
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,360
Prepare a carriage.

29
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,200
Yes.

30
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,400
Please excuse me, Miss Cui.

31
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,560
You don't know Kung Fu,

32
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,920
which makes you a better choice as a hostage.

33
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,320
Come.

34
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:53,740
[Yongcheng]

35
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,080
You drive the carriage!

36
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,160
Your Highness,

37
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,600
I won't hurt her.

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,920
You can follow me.

39
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,520
Once I make it to Nanxiao in one piece,

40
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,960
I will let her go.

41
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,080
Yang Shao,

42
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,640
if you so much as harm a hair on her head,

43
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,420
whether you go beyond south of the river,

44
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,760
the Gobi Desert in the west,

45
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,320
or even to the underworld,

46
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,670
I will personally

47
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,680
take your life.

48
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,920
I have no other choice.

49
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,880
Your Highness, I am sorry for doing this.

50
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,520
Get me a horse!

51
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,200
Yes, Your Highness.

52
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,560
Xiao Yan, do something.

53
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,160
Nanxiao is your homeland.

54
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,200
The transportation between the South and the North is smooth.

55
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,320
It won't be a problem for them to go there.

56
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,400
However, since it is His Highness,

57
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,770
it would definitely cause a stir

58
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,040
if people found out he was in Nanxiao.

59
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,600
Isn't that obvious?

60
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,560
Scouting Camp,

61
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,720
get on your horses.

62
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,960
We'll follow them in secret to protect His Highness and Shiyi.

63
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,840
Yes!

64
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,540
I have been holding the sword

65
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,980
all this way.

66
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,780
My arm is about to come off.

67
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,880
You are being followed by Zhousheng Chen.

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,880
You dare to lower that sword

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,200
but have not fear of being decapitated?

70
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,200
General Yang,

71
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,040
the best thing I ever did in my life

72
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,960
was putting in a good word for you.

73
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,840
There's not much to eat around here,

74
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,720
so have some of this.

75
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,880
Master hasn't eaten anything

76
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,200
for a day.

77
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,750
He cares a lot about you.

78
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,030
Otherwise, why would a noble prince

79
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,030
be willing to risk his life coming here alone

80
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,190
and follow you to Nanxiao?

81
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,240
He is my master.

82
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,400
Whatever it is,

83
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,520
he cares about you.

84
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,560
My oh my.

85
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,360
It turns out

86
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,320
your affair

87
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,120
is no less serious than

88
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,960
my treason.

89
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,040
Aren't you marrying the Prince of Guangling?

90
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,680
The engagement was canceled.

91
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,320
He is just my master.

92
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,920
When we make it to Nanxiao tomorrow,

93
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,520
remember you mustn't say anything about who you are.

94
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,600
If someone found out and came after you,

95
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,840
I can't guarantee your safety.

96
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,360
Have some of this.

97
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,080
Give it to my master.

98
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,760
This is the only chicken I got.

99
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,640
Even I feel reluctant to eat it.

100
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,240
He hasn't eaten anything

101
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,400
for a day and a night.

102
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,000
There's two of you

103
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,159
so you two can take turns to hunt for food.

104
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,360
But he can only starve.

105
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,840
If you don't give him food,

106
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,159
I am not going to eat either.

107
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,040
I'll have it.

108
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,600
The master-disciple relationship you have sure is touching.

109
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,600
Here's some food your disciple got for you!

110
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,120
I will charter the two boats.

111
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,760
This one,

112
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,800
is for him.

113
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
My mother said

114
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,800
you had to come back to Jingling with me this time

115
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,160
and you had to explain to them

116
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,000
in person,

117
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,960
about why you married my sister without their consent.

118
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,240
If you can't give an explanation,

119
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,640
she will not be coming back with you.

120
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,200
Get on the boat.

121
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,800
The bastard's full of tricks.

122
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:55,760
General,

123
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,920
what do we do now?

124
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,360
Get our men to the bank of the river

125
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,840
and wait for furthur orders.

126
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,160
If their identity is exposed,

127
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,960
we need to be ready to cross the river.

128
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,840
Set sail, follow him.

129
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,680
Go to Shouyang immediately

130
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,800
and tell General Cui

131
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,400
to get ready to send out troops.

132
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,480
Yes.

133
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,640
You northerners

134
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,000
love to elope, huh?

135
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,400
Not really.

136
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,120
I won't blame your brother-in-law

137
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,120
for being so mad.

138
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,800
You have to go back with him,

139
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,320
prepare a bride-price, perform a formal wedding ceremony,

140
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,080
and bow before your parents to express your gratitude for their upbringing.

141
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,240
After that,

142
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,880
you bring your bride home.

143
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,520
All right.

144
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,080
However,

145
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,200
the lady over there is constantly looking back.

146
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,680
I guess it won't be hard for you

147
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,080
this time.

148
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,240
You know how parents are.

149
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,440
As long as their daughter shows affection,

150
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,800
they won't give you a hard time.

151
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,960
You can see

152
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,400
that she's into me?

153
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,760
The moment you stepped on the boat,

154
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,520
her gaze

155
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,760
were fixed on you.

156
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,160
Who do you think is in her heart

157
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,440
other than you?

158
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,480
This is your first time to Nanxiao?

159
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,760
You saved me twice, I owe you.

160
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,080
This is a military stronghold of the South.

161
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,160
Be careful of what you say.

162
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,040
Let's go.

163
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,600
Give me the Tiger Tally.

164
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,800
Yang Shao,

165
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,360
did you bring me to Nanxiao

166
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,080
just for the tally?

167
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,600
The favor of your recommendation

168
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,560
is now returned.

169
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,440
I will give you a hint to save yourself.

170
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,600
Bring the news of the second Prince, Xiaoyan

171
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,360
to the Emperor of Nanxiao.

172
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,560
He loves his son very much,

173
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
thus he will for sure accommodate you.

174
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,040
Now hand out the Tiger Tally.

175
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,120
The rest of your stragglers

176
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,480
are now mine.

177
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,800
What are you doing?

178
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,840
I hate a ruthless traitor like you

179
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,520
the most.

180
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,840
The next time I see you,

181
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,400
I will kill you myself.

182
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,520
It's all my fault that I got you involved.

183
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,320
It's nothing like that.

184
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,440
If it weren't for this occasion,

185
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:31,510
I am afraid

186
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,270
you will never get the chance to come here.

187
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,800
You said it as if you set this up

188
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,960
on purpose.

189
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,600
But seriously,

190
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,960
I had given some thoughts that

191
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,960
one day when the Central Plains are united,

192
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,240
I'll take you here.

193
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,800
It's true.

194
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,200
Move aside!

195
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,280
Out of the way!

196
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,200
Why did you let out a sigh, Master?

197
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,720
It just occurred to me

198
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,000
that you had never

199
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,240
fought alongside me.

200
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,640
What a pity.

201
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,400
We can do that in the future.

202
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,000
Yeah, we can.

203
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,480
Guards, hurry!

204
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,760
I need to see your prefectural governor.

205
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,120
Now!

206
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,320
Who are you?

207
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,600
I am a member of the royal family of Beichen.

208
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,400
Liu Changshan.

209
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,160
Bring me to your prefectural governor, now.

210
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:45,880
General.

211
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,200
What's the fuss about?

212
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,960
The junior Prince of Nanchen is in the city.

213
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,760
Bring me to see your prefectural governor, now!

214
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,160
Who did you say it was?

215
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,600
The junior Prince of Nanchen.

216
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,880
Zhousheng Chen!

217
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,760
Close the city gate.

218
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,960
There is a carriage pulled by goats.

219
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,120
People in Jiangling

220
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:17,480
are pretty unconstrained.

221
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,200
Not only do they use goats to pull carts.

222
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,280
There was even a General Shen in the Former Song Dynasty,

223
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,520
who would ride a bizarre carriage

224
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,000
every time he met the emperor.

225
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,680
It was called the pig-nose valance-less car.

226
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,480
All the officials didn't think it was strange.

227
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,000
On the contrary, they loved it.

228
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,680
Pig-nose valance-less car?

229
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,720
Get out of the way, get out of the way!

230
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,480
Get out of the way, get out of the way!

231
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,560
Get out of the way, get out of the way!

232
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,640
Get out of the way!

233
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,640
What do you think happened?

234
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,360
Why are there so many troops?

235
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,560
I'll tell you what,

236
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,040
the junior Prince of Nanchen is right here in the city.

237
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,360
No one knows what happened.

238
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,240
Isn't...

239
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,800
Isn't there a peace treaty between the South and the North?

240
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,080
Exactly! Why did the prince come here

241
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,640
when everything is okay?

242
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,120
The city gates are now closed

243
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,000
and no one is allowed to go in or out.

244
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,360
Let' get out of here.

245
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,720
Let's go home, go home now.

246
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,520
Let's go.

247
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,680
It looks like we are going to stay here a few more days.

248
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,200
Are we not figuring out a way to send information out of the city?

249
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,760
There is no hurry.

250
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,640
So where are we going now?

251
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,460
Let's go to someone I know here.

252
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,280
You know someone in the South?

253
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,970
An old friend of mine who happens to be around here.

254
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,770
It's so beautiful here.

255
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,960
Adjacent to the river and the mountain.

256
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,830
It would be great if we could unite the Central Plains sooner.

257
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,190
So that people from the south could see

258
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,470
our lofty ancient cities and vast deserts

259
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,670
and we could enjoy the mountains and rivers here.

260
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,230
How nice that would be.

261
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,910
There's still an hour's walk,

262
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,070
can you take it?

263
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,190
When Master was away,

264
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,590
I used to go around

265
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,310
all the temples in the Western State

266
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,270
to lit up incense and pray for the Royal Army.

267
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,750
That's why I got strong legs.

268
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,550
You can't call me "Master" here.

269
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,560
It will reveal our identity.

270
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,570
Yes, Master.

271
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,960
I understood.

272
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,140
Are you going up the mountain?

273
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,060
Yes.

274
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,500
Then you need to hurry.

275
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,420
The teacher of this academy

276
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,420
is grumpy

277
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,300
and won't receive visitors

278
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,540
after sunset.

279
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,020
It doesn't matter if you have to spend the night in the mountains,

280
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,140
it's just that

281
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,940
your wife would have a hard time.

282
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:52,740
What?

283
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,580
This is a land full of great people and natural wonders.

284
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,420
Oh yeah?

285
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,100
I like this place.

286
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,860
I  like the mountains,

287
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,060
the water,

288
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,100
and even what the people say.

That's our teacher.

Miss, you do not need to ponder.

295

You will see him in a bit.

Sir.

297
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:13,450
I can't believe it.

298
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,730
This is the famous

299
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:23,010
young master from Zhou family in the Western State.

300
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:26,650
All of you are dismissed.

301
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:28,290
I need to catch up with my old friend.

302
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:29,770
Yes, Sir.

303
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,370
I thought we would never

304
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,010
see each other again.

305
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,450
You must be

306
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,210
the Princess of Nanchen.

307
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,410
I...

308
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,170
She is the daughter of one of my acquaintances.

309
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,480
Of the Cui family in Beichen.

310

Cui Shiyi.

311
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,000
Oh, so you are the daughter of his acquaintance.

312
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,400
The Cui family.

313
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,110
A family of top-notch advisors to Beichen.

314
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,360
It is my pleasure to meet you.

315
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,590
This is Mr. Huan from Longkang.

316
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,120
Huan Yu.

317
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,480
My family used to say that the Huan family in Longkang

318
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,740
is home to three generations of royal mentors

319
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,500
who educated five emperors in total.

320
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,060
I never thought...

321
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,340
You never thought

322
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,340
you would be able see

323
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,060
the descendant of the Huan family in Longkang.

324
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,340
I'm sorry.

325
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,540
The entire Huan family in Longkang

326
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,020
was executed.

327
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,860
Those who made a narrow escape

328
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,500
have mostly changed their names

329
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:38,940
and left their hometown.

330
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,260
What a disaster it was.

331
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,500
But those things happened to my ancestors,

332
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,700
let's talk about what's happening at present.

333
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,260
Do you know

334
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,540
that my life

335
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,420
was saved

336
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,820
by your fiancé?

337
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,380
She's not my fiancé.

338
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,140
Did I just make another mistake?

339
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,700
My guesses are usually pretty good.

340
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,660
We have been travelling for days

341
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,660
and haven't had

342
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,860
a proper meal.

343
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:08,980
Let's talk after the meal.

344
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,820
Yes, let's talk after the meal.

345
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,620
He didn't mention anything

346
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,220
about how you saved him.

347
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:25,820
Do you want him

348
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,020
to continue?

349
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,060
If he continues,

350
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,100
things won't be as simple

351
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,010
as being your fiancé.

352
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,180
He is a great man,

353
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,780
except that tongue of his.

354
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,780
Weren't you complimenting

355
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,220
that his family is home to three generations of royal mentors

356
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,740
who educated five emperors in total.

357
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,780
He's your friend.

358
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,660
I can't go wrong complimenting him.

359
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,060
Master, you haven't taken a proper meal

360
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,380
for the past few days.

361
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,980
You must have more today.

362
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:07,420
Here.

363
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:08,940
I can help myself.

364
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,340
It seems she really is hungry.

365
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,600
Here, this is your favorite.

366
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,380
Master, try this.

367
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,780
I have never seen this in Beichen.

368
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,430
It is called bamboo mushrooms.

369
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,700
It seems I am the unlearned person.

370
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,540
Is it good?

371
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,900
Sir, your two friends.

372
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,500
What's their relationship?

373
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,340
Do you see anything

374
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,420
between their eyes?

375
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,980
Between their eyes?

376
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,540
There's nothing there.

377
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,580
Is there something?

378
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,980
Affection.

379
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,980
So, are we preparing a single room tonight?

380
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,180
Naturally.

381
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,620
Do we prepare it as a bridal chamber?

382
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,060
As someone educated,

383
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,540
we must have some self-restraint.

384
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,700
If they didn't say anything,

385
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,020
we should not point it out for them.

386
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:43,860
Go on.

387
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:45,740
Wait.

388
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:50,540
But it should also be graceful.

389
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,300
I understood.

390
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:05,900
Grand Mentor.

391
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,420
What you said is true?

392
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,220
What do you think, Your Majesty?

393
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,620
In my opinion,

394
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,540
the Nanxiao's troops have been quite

395
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,980
because of my uncle

396
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,300
and his hundreds of thousands of troops

397
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,580
who are defending our borders.

398
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,420
Now that my uncle is trapped.

399
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,940
If something happens to him,

400
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,260
then Nanxiao would

401
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,180
take the chance

402
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,540
to harass our borders at Beichen.

403
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,280
On the contrary, in my humble opinion,

404
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,860
not only will Nanxiao not give His Highness a hard time,

405
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,550
they would even send him

406
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,540
back to Beichen safe and sound.

407
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,140
Your Majesty,

408
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,340
the peace negotiation we had with the South

409
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,540
on the Frontier Settlement Tower

410
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,740
has made it possible that there would be no more conflict in Nanxiao.

411
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,380
The people are now living and working in a peaceful environment.

412
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,660
If His Highness was found dead in Nanxiao,

413
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,860
it will undoubtably cause a dispute between the two countries

414
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,100
and ignite the flames of war once more.

415
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,540
And the people in Nanxiao

416
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,900
would be thrown back to agony again.

417
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,260
You have made a good point.

418
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,940
[Longkang Academy]

419
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,180
This is the only room left.

420
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,020
You two will have to make do tonight.

421
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,940
I remember last time when I was here,

422
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,460
the adjacent room is also a guest room.

423
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,660
That room

424
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,580
is filled with things right now.

425
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,820
It's true.

426
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,380
It smells so good.

427
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,580
There are many bugs and insects in the mountain.

428
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,780
Burning some incense at night

429
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,380
will deter the insects.

430
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,100
The curtains will also help.

431
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,500
That's very considerate.

432
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,900
One?

433
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:22,860
Mas...

434
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,140
I am sorry.

435
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,620
It doesn't matter.

436
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,820
My wife used to

437
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,900
love to pull the corner of my clothes.

438
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,980
You two must be tired

439
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,260
after a long journey.

440
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,380
You should rest early.

441
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,260
There are wild monkeys in the mountain,

442
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,260
make sure your windows are closed at night.

443
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,300
There is only one bed here,

444
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,500
how are we going to sleep here?

445
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,820
I will sleep on the floor.

446
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,580
You didn't sleep well following me all the way here.

447
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,100
I suggest you sleep on the bed.

448
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,300
Didn't you say that

449
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,740
I slept on the beach with numerous bones after getting drunk?

450
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,180
If I can do that,

451
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,580
why can't I sleep on the floor?

452
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,340
We have learned that

453
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:45,940
they are in Jiangling.

454
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,300
The military strongholds of the South,

455
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,260
one is Jiangling,

456
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,380
the other is Chaisang.

457
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,020
We are in trouble now.

458
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,020
What a piece of scum Yang Shao is

459
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,940
that he would know how to use this to hinder us.

460
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:57,980
Before sunset,

461
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:58,660
Jiangling has closed its city gates.

462
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,940
No one is allowed to go in or out.

463
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:00,820
They have started to search for

464
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,100
Master and Shiyi.

465
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,340
Don't worry.

466
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,460
From what I know about your master,

467
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,670
he should be at ease

468
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,170
and enjoying his trip to Nanxiao.

469
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,860
You have been saying "don't worry" the whole night,

470
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,400
can't you come up with any solution?

471
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,660
Do you think I'm your military advisor?

472
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,860
After my foster father left,

473
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,460
you are our adviser, aren't you?

474
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,180
The prefectural governor of Jiangling is someone mediocre.

475
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,740
He became intimidated by the fame of the junior Prince of Nanchen

476
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,900
and only thought about closing the gate to search for them.

477
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,860
But so what after they found them?

478
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,820
Would he kill them?

479
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,140
If so, that would be an unwanted disaster

480
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,020
for the city of Jiangling.

481
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,780
His people are living a good life.

482
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,060
If he starts a war,

483
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:46,820
then he's foolish.

484
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,460
What if it were you?

485
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,540
What would you do?

486
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,940
If it were me,

487
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,460
I would pretend as if nothing had happened

488
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,620
and that I had never heard about it.

489
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,980
I would open the gate

490
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,620
and let His Highness go about freely.

491
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,700
But what if your father blamed this on him?

492
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,660
I am sorry.

493
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,500
There's nothing to be sorry about.

494
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,340
Everyone in the world knows

495
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,780
that he is my father.

496
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,220
The Emperor of Nanxiao

497
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,360
is definitely hoping that his officials

498
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,040
would let His Highness go in secret.

499
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,600
The South and the North has already made a peace treaty.

500
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,400
If he ever offended His Highness at this moment,

501
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,400
it won't do him any good.

502
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,040
Now that things have become like this.

503
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,640
Everyone in the city knows.

504
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,480
Who would let him go secretly?

505
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,960
After all, what's on the emperor's mind is the hardest to guess.

506
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,320
You guys

507
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,920
were really in sync just now.

508
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,060
General Feng.

509
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,340
Why do you always

510
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,900
look so worried, as if the sky is going to collapse?

511
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,540
My master is across the bank,

512
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:43,780
trapped in the city of Jiangling.

513
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,780
That, to me, is like the sky is collapsing.

514
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,260
It's them who should be terrified,

515
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,380
not us.

516
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,460
After all, our army is

517
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,900
approaching their borders.

518
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,780
They are now sending out troops to search for us.

519
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,020
Within ten days,

520
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,580
they will surely find us in the academy.

521
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,500
No need for ten days.

522
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,180
This is a military stronghold

523
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,300
with plenty of soldiers.

524
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,460
They will find us in about three days.

525
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,980
So, shall we leave?

526
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,020
No need for that.

527
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,190
The prefectural governor will receive a secret edict

528
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,060
telling him not to find me

529
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:34,800
in the city of Jiangling.

530
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,820
Because their emperor

531
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,780
doesn't want to start a war

532
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,780
because of this.

533
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,880
There are numerous relations among the world,

534
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:02,910
every one of them is different from each other.

535
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,140
Sir,

536
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,050
what did you hear?

537
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:10,540
Hush!

538
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,940
I didn't hear a thing.

539
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,940
But they would have heard everything you said.

540
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,060
Go, guard the door for Her Lady.

541
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:19,980
Okay.

542
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,220
There are so many wild monkeys tonight.

543
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,580
I am driving them away with my attendant

544
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,820
at the door.

545
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,740
It's getting late now,

546
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,620
my wife

547
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,180
is expecting me to go back to sleep.

548
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,020
I gave you

549
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:44,980
my best bamboo room.

550
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,620
You should feel sorry

551
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,980
if you mess this opportunity up.

552
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:14,340
How did you save Mr. Huan?

553
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,540
Some time ago,

554
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,100
robbers broke into the Huan family's academy.

555
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,100
He took his collections of books, ran to the wilderness,

556
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,700
and almost died there.

557
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,450
I happened to be there while with my troops,

558
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,320
so I saved him.

559
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,340
Once a family like his

560
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,780
lost their glory,

561
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,460
all the collections of ancient books,

562
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:36,800
and treasures handed down for generations

563
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,500
will get him killed.

564
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:41,100
I had met this kind of families a couple of times

565
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,140
in my earlier years.

566
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,860
As they couldn't live in the North,

567
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:46,370
I would send troops to escort them across the river

568
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:48,950
and help them escape to the South.

569
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,730
There was also a branch of the Cui family that once traveled to the South.

570
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,560
Some of the aristocratic families went to South to seek asylum,

571
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,580
while some went to the North to earn a living.

572
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,740
They are like wild geese migrating between the North and the South

573
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:00,890
in order to survive.

574
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:02,860
Yeah.

575
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,860
Like the people we met

576
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,740
who fled their hometown.

577
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,420
They were all doing this

578
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,260
just to survive.

579
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,060
I haven't lived a laid-back life like this

580
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,300
for a long time.

581
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:31,900
My senior brothers and senior sisters

582
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,180
must be terribly worried,

583
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,460
yet you say we're having a laid-back time.

584
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,220
In the past,

585
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,820
I have always been the one who worried about them.

586
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,410
Now it's their turn

587
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,620
to worry about me.

588
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,660
You are the master

589
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,980
but you still care about that?

590
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:45,940
Don't you remember?

591
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:46,900
Xiaoyu and Tianxing

592
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,080
are about my age.

593
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:49,820
While other disciples

594
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,990
are only a few years younger than me.

595
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,300
That's what the monk said as well.

596
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,060
Only he

597
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,460
knows how hard it is for me.

598
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,380
I know as well.

599
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,860
You did it on purpose.

600
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,780
Did what on purpose?

601
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,020
To air your grievances and get my empathy.

602
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,300
Why would I

603
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,620
lie to you yo get your empathy?

604
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:18,900
I give up.

605
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,140
All right, time to sleep.

606
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,580
Why are you not sleeping on the bed

607
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:33,860
but on the floor?

608
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,500
I have slept on the floor before.

609
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,420
The day you took me to see the retainers,

610
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,540
I slept in you study.

611
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,220
That was on the floor as well.

612
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,220
That time,

613
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,020
you covered me with a fox fur

614
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,340
and carried me back in your arms.

615
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,940
That fox fur

616
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,620
is still kept in my room.

617
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,500
If you like it,

618
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,220
I can make a new one for you.

619
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:03,160
That's the only one I like.

620
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,060
Your Highness,

621
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,260
you have been staring at it all night.

622
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,700
It's time for you to take your medicine.

623
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,620
Why don't you love me?

624
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,020
You would rather be a disciple

625
00:34:03,139 --> 00:34:03,780
of Zhousheng Chen

626
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,620
than marry me

627
00:34:04,739 --> 00:34:06,139
and become a prestigious princess.

628
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:12,020
If you want,

629
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,739
I can give up everything for you.

630
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:15,860
I can bring you out of the Central State,

631
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,219
this troubled land.

632
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:24,179
Yes.

633
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:26,780
I may not understand this kind of thing,

634
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:28,260
but Your Highness can't

635
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,020
overlook your own health.

636
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,659
Please take your medicine first.

637
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,340
Put it here

638
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,460
and leave.

639
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,100
Yes, Your Highness.

640
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,940
They are all students from impoverished families.

641
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,720
They heard that someone from the Cui family came to the academy,

642
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,540
and vied to get the opportunity

643
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,660
to talk about poetry and Taoism with you.

644
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:24,620
You've read a lot of books since you were a kid.

645
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,060
Just share your opinion with them

646
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,260
as a pastime.

647
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,140
Though I have read plenty, I may not understand everything.

648
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,540
Take me and Zhousheng Chen for example,

649
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,620
people at our age

650
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,540
won't say that we understand everything we read.

651
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,340
In terms of the amount of book collections in the North,

652
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,740
the Cui family comes first.

653
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,300
Most of what you have read,

654
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,420
I have never had the privilage

655
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,180
to read them.

656
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,900
It would be of great help

657
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,620
if you can share it with all of them.

658
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,940
After hearing what you said, I'm glad to do it.

659
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,060
I'm not skilled or very knowledgeable,

660
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:55,660
I merely took advantage of

661
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,340
the book collections at home.

662
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,420
Please don't take my words too seriously

663
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,420
and treat this as a casual exchange.

664
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,500
We'd be more than happy

665
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,500
to have you share your thoughts.

666
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,500
This way please.

667
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,780
This is brilliant.

668
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:20,900
How do you feel for the first time

669
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,620
that you are not surrounded

670
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,820
by everyone?

671
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:25,760
Great.

672
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,210
I'm sure

673
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,940
you'll be like me in the future,

674
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:31,780
a person that fears his wife.

675
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,060
What?

676
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:40,740
Brilliant!

677
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,140
Impressive, impressive!

678
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:53,820
You are watching them shoot arrows?

679
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,020
Wanna have a try?

680
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,060
Go and try it.

681
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,660
Is it allowed in the academy?

682
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,580
For an outsider to do this?

683
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,680
I am in charge here

684
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,580
while he commands the army.

685
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,900
Who dares to say no?

686
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,940
She seems to like lively places.

687
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,940
It's rare for her to be somewhere there are many people.

688
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,550
I was often away from my mansion.

689
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,180
For the past few years,

690
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,700
she was only accompanied by one of her servants

691
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,080
and the home library.

692
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,140
Having heard that,

693
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,340
she is indeed a poor girl.

694
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,100
Impressive, very impressive.

695
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,340
Look at that, that's really something.

696
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,100
Did you teach her?

697
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,300
I have never taught her archery.

698
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,620
Mas...

699
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,100
Did you see that?

700
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,800
Who taught you that?

701
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,140
The mansion's shooting range is always empty

702
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,140
and I found myself idle most of the time.

703
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,020
So I learnt it secretly.

704
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,740
You're fairly accurate.

705
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,340
But your posture needs fixing.

706
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:25,150
Here.

707
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:42,410
Ready.

708
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:46,450
♫Like a gust of wind gently brushing♫

709
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:53,000
♫Like a cloud waiting for the rain to fall♫

710
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,830
♫There is a corner in my heart♫

711
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,030
♫Where my expectation is glowing♫

712
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:06,630
♫It's the shooting star lighting up the night sky for you♫

713
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:11,860
The bows in our academy are

714
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,180
all given by the hunters.

715
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,180
They are not

716
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,420
as light as the ones from your mansion.

717
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,300
I should've warned you

718
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,620
so that you wouldn't injure your shoulders.

719
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,660
She needs help with the injury behind her shoulder.

720
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,620
I can apply it myself.

721
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:36,620
This medicine

722
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,180
requires some rubbing with your palms

723
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,220
in order to take effect.

724
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,060
It's a pity

725
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,020
that my academy is full of male students.

726
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,580
So no one can help you.

727
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,460
Do you mind

728
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,380
asking your wife to help me?

729
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,460
She won't see visitors.

730
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,300
Help yourselves.

731
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,420
I will leave you two be.

732
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,630
Apply the medicine on your own first

733
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:18,000
and call me after you've covered your shoulder with a cloth.

734
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,260
I am ready.

735
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,060
Did I

736
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,260
say something wrong just now?

737
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,940
You mean about Mrs. Huan?

738
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:55,900
I'll find a time

739
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,340
and take you to see her later.
