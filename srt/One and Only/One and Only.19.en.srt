You're worried about Shiyi?

5
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,960
Shiyi is in the imperial palace...

6
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,840
Her Majesty knows

7
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,840
she can hold back many forces at play,

8
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,400
so she won't be in immediate danger.

9
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,600
If so, why are you

10
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,200
still worried?

11
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,640

13
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,420
Your Highness.

14
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,940
How did you enter the city?

15
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,579
I've been here the whole time.

16
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,660
I came here for this.

17
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,940
My troops

18
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:36,820
in the Central State

19
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,620
can only control the imperial palace,

20
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,460
they can't dominate the whole city.

21
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,740
So it must be solved in the imperial palace

22
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,500
to prevent the vassals from finding out

23
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,579
and rebelling.

24
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,460
So you plan to...

25
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,740
Enthrone a new emperor and dethrone the empress dowager.

26
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,500
When can you set us free?

27
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,420
These days Her Majesty

28
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,500
is busy with the enthronement,

29
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,500
that she has no time for you.

30
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,060
Don't worry.

31
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,900
When Her Majesty is free,

32
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,900
she will see you.

33
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,579
Who will ascend the throne?

34
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,940
The son

35
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,900
of Concubine Jiang.

36
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,940
What are you worried about?

37
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,740
After the enthronement,

38
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,500
all the vassals and prefectural governors

39
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,020
will receive the imperial edicts.

40
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,220
Do you worry that your master will come to a bad end like Empress Gao's brother

41
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:47,380
after entering the capital city?

42
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,820
Aren't you worried?

43
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,980
My father has many children,

44
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,380
so he doesn't care about me.

45
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,220
He has been on the ascent recently.

46
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,380
Even an imperial edict

47
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,860
can't summon him to the capital city,

48
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,820
because he worries he'll be ambushed in the Central State.

49
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,060
So it's impossible for him

50
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,940
to come to save me.

51
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,180
I have become the grand empress dowager

52
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,180
Yes, Your Majesty have become even nobler.

ascended the throne in childhood.

As long as he is the child of the late emperor,

78

he can ascend the throne.

Your Excellencies, please.

Did you see the late emperor

Her Majesty gave a banquet one day.

146
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,420
I was drunk,

147
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,900
so I went back to my chamber first.

148

His Majesty secretly summoned me that night.

149
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,460
Impossible.

150

What did His Majesty say to you?

152
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,340
His Majesty said that

153
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,100
his child was dead,

154
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,380
and he was in poor health,

155
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,860
so he wanted to choose the right successor

156

from Liu's clan...

157

She didn't see the late emperor.

162
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,140
When she entered the imperial palace,

163

the late emperor was still alive.

164

Why is it impossible?

165
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,940
At that time, the late emperor was badly ill

166
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:28,940
and even couldn't speak.

167

Go on.

177
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,500
His Majesty also said that

178
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,700
Grand Mentor Xie didn't die of illness.

179
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,740
-It...
-It...

180
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,740
Is it true?

181
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,220
Cui Shiyi,

182
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,620
you spread vicious falsehoods to deceive ministers.

183
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,220
I will have you beheaded!

184
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,380
The Commander of Royal Guards

185
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,740
Yuan Wuchu!

186
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,700
You...

187
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,140
you're trying to frame me.

188
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,220
Miss Cui,

189
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,900
that's enough.

190
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:35,940
Your Excellency,

191
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,020
why don't you let her go on?

192
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,020
Miss Cui's words

193
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,940
are baseless,

194
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,140
so we can't believe anything she says.

195
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,420
In their confrontation,

196
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,180
we can tell the true from the false.

197
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,820
How dare you

198
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,500
interrogate Her Majesty?

199
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,940
Ministers,

200
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,300
it's related to the reputation

201
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,980
of the royal family.

202
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,900
Please step out for a while

203
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,660
so that I can make things clear.

204
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,900
As a relative of the royal family,

205
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,740
I'll absolutely show no partiality to either side.

206
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,740
Why didn't you help me just now?

207
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,500
Your Majesty, listen to me first.

208
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,540
Zhousheng Chen is in the Central State.

209
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,900
Why has he come?

210
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,660
You?

211
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,580
He asked me to tell you that

212
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,780
you have been driven

213
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,620
into a corner today.

214
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,940
Does he want to rebel?

215
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:56,540
No.

216
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,540
He wants you to enthrone Liu Zizhen.

217
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,820
How about my grandson?

218
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,100
-He is...
-Stop.

219
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,300
You know

220
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,100
he's not your grandson.

221
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,820
If you want to protect the whole Qi family,

222
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,420
you'd better do as he says.

223
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,940
Ministers,

224
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,660
please.

225
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,740
-I...

226
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,820
I have no choice

227
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,500
but to do so.

228
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,100
Ministers,

229
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,020
His Majesty passed away suddenly,

230
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,300
and his son also died with his mother.

231
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,660
If others know that

232
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,260
the late emperor didn't have any descendant,

233
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,380
the country will fall into chaos.

234
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,820
So I had no choice

235
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,020
but to do so.

236
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,620
I had planned to declare to the public

237
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,660
his dethronement

238
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,740
and enthronement of Liu Zizhen

239
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,620
after the country was at peace.

240
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,500
How can you just

241
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,860
enthrone or dethrone an emperor

242
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,580
at will?

243
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,540
You're still quibbling.

244
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,380
Yes, you're quibbling.

245
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,780
It's ridiculous!

246
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:49,820
I

247
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,620
will issue an edict immediately

248
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,500
to enthrone him.

249
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,260
Mother.

250
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,380
You like this baby?

251
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,580
Someone from the Western State

252
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,300
wants to see you.

253
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,900
Now he's in the chamber where he used to live.

254
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,540
Go.

255
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,740
She treats the baby as hers

256
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,140
and even can't bear to put him down.

257
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,380
[Chonghua Palace]

258
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,860
-Miss Cui.
-Miss Cui.

259
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,460
Why are you all dressed

260
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,660
in the uniforms of the Royal Guards?

261
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,340
His Highness required us to do so.

262
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,500
He is inside?

263
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,500
I'm here.

264
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,500
You wait for me outside.

265
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,940
Yes.

266
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:27,820
Master.

267
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:29,980
Go in.

268
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,540
You're going to keep holding him?

269
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,260
Put him here.

270
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,500
Hui ascended the throne at 6

271
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,540
but died at 19.

272
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,940
Only 19 years old.

273
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,860
He was known as a young emperor

274
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,580
all over the country,

275
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,700
but I didn't keep him safe.

276
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,660
You've tried your best.

277
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,300
Look, he's asleep.

278
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,340
He is asleep so quickly, isn't he?

279
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,820
Babies do fall asleep quickly.

280
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,940
That day His Excellency Counselor-in-chief showed me a note.

281
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,140
It startled me

282
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,380
when I recognized your handwriting.

283
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,740
Thanks to your intelligence,

284
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,420
now the new emperor has ascended the throne smoothly,

285
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,100
and a power struggle has been avoided.

286
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,460
For common people,

287
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,620
it couldn't be better.

288
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,500
Why didn't you leave?

289
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,140
I was afraid you would have an accident

290
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,980
after entering the imperial palace in such chaos.

291
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,140
It's not shameful for you to cry.

292
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,100
I'm not crying.

293
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,980
It's better to stay in the Western State.

294
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,300
With our protection,

295
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,620
nobody would dare bully you.

296
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,240
Of course.

297
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,000
Master,

298
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,920
Feng Qiao and the military advisor

299
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,200
are on their way.

300
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,960
And the reinforcements will arrive within ten days.

301
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,600
OK, I see.

302
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:58,960
Xiaoyu,

303
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,520
my mother has allowed him

304
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,120
to divorce Her Highness.

305
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,320
Isn't Her Highness pregnant?

306
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,440
No, she isn't.

307
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,200
Having no feeling for each other,

308
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,320
they've wished to divorce.

309
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,560
But they're bound

310
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,800
by the reputation of the Cui and Qi families.

311
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,280
After everything is settled,

312
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,080
I'll ask the prefectural governor of Taiyuan back.

313
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,400
Then you can ask him in person.

314
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,360
Why do you smile?

315
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,160
Your smiles

316
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,920
remind me of the past.

317
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,560
When will you leave?

318
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:48,960
I don't know.

319
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,120
You don't know?

320
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,840
I still have a lot of things to deal with,

321
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,480
so I won't leave in 1 to 2 months.

322
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,840
Then we still have 1 to 2 months.

323
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,200
This child is unlucky.

324
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,920
He doesn't know what happened,

325
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,760
who his parents are,

326
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,560
and who will take care of him.

327
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,880
I'll take care of him.

328
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,480
You?

329
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,080
In my mansion,

330
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,560
there are ten orphans.

331
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,520
They all have grown up

332
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,640
and lived well.

333
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:31,860
This is

334
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,900
the Junior Prince of Nanchen guarding the Western State.

335
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,150
Greetings, Grand-uncle.

336
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:47,910
Why do you laugh?

337
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,540
You're his grand-uncle.

338
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,040
Come on.

339
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,560
Get up.

340
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,300
Why do you embrace me?

341
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,300
Father often told me that

342
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,540
you're a good man.

343
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,220
He knows

344
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,660
who can protect him.

345
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,060
Come on.

346
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,180
Are you afraid of being an emperor?

347
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,260
Yes.

348
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,380
Emperor Gaozu ascended the throne at 5,

349
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,780
and the late emperor 6.

350
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,380
Neither of them was afraid of it,

351
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,660
so you don't need to be afraid.

352
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,020
I want to find

353
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,060
a good grand mentor for you.

354
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,780
Before that,

355
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,300
Miss Cui

356
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,660
will be your teacher.

357
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,020
Here are my respects, Miss Cui.

358
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,820
Am I qualified?

359
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,540
Your uncle used to be the grand mentor,

360
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,980
so I believe you can do it, too.

361
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,540
Your Highness, the Prince of Guangling wants to see you.

362
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,020
Ask him in.

363
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:09,860
Yes.

364
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,660
Your Highness, we're leaving.

365
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,260
Let's go.

366
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,620
Your Highness, please go in.

367
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,420
Uncle, thank you for saving me.

368
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,260
You're welcome.

369
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,100
Uncle, can you allow me

370
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,900
to chat

371
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,340
with my fiancee alone?

372
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,440
OK.

373
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,660
I heard from the palace maid on the way that

374
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,500
you had been imprisoned in the Eastern Palace for several days.

375
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,060
After experiencing that,

376
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,340
I couldn't wait any longer.

377
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,340
Let's get married next month.

378
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,900
If you want to get married early,

379
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,340
let me tell my mother first.

380
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,140
I'll tell her.

381
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,260
Where have you stayed these past few days?

382
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,540
I stayed in Xuanguang Palace.

383
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,380
The simply-furnished Xuanguang Palace

384
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,980
was deserted for a long time.

385
00:25:58,940 --> 00:25:59,820
You deserve better.

386
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,860
I'll send

387
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,140
some daily necessities

388
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,460
to your chambers later.

389
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,420
Thank you, Your Highness.

390
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,860
Greetings, Your Highness.

391
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,580
Get up.

392
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,740
The smell of herbs here is too strong.

393
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:53,660
I heard that Palace Attendant Cui

394
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,340
spoke for me in the court.

395
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,700
I just told the truth.

396
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,820
After Cui Guang's death,

397
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,100
you want to be the chief of the Cui family.

398
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,820
I dare not.

399
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,940
What daren't you do?

400
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,740
Daren't you tell the truth?

401
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,620
Go to summon the general here.

402
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:32,780
Yes.

403
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,860
Thank you, Your Highness.

404
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,820
Greetings, Your Highness.

405
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:01,980
Get up.

406
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,060
You want to serve a wise master,

407
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,380
while I want to find a trusted subordinate.

408
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:15,420
I've shown you my sincerity.

409
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,540
I've controlled the Royal Guards.

410
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,820
Knowing you're

411
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,540
used to staying in Nanchen Royal Mansion.

412
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,940
His Highness worries that you're not used to staying in the Central State,

413
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,420
so all the good things of the Eastern Palace

414
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,580
have been moved here.

415
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,100
The royal mansion is not as luxurious as you imagine.

416
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,340
I just stayed

417
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,780
in a common house there.

418
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,340
What does the royal mansion look like?

419
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,900
There're only soldiers and servants.

420
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,100
Only I had a maidservant

421
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,820
from my family in my house.

422
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,260
Doesn't His Highness

423
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,500
keep any beauties in his mansion?

424
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:08,900
No.

425
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,540
The members of the royal clan in the capital city

426
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,820
have countless beauties in their mansions,

427
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,780
but they still often

428
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,220
ask Her Majesty for palace maids in the imperial palace.

429
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:14,940
Yeah.

430
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,380
His Excellency Counselor-in-chief is old,

431
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,140
but he also has dozens of beauties in his mansion.

432
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,380
I didn't lie to you.

433
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,660
Can I ask more?

434
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,420
What does His Highness look like?

435
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,460
Is he really

436
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,820
a truly handsome man

437
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,260
rare among all those in the world,

438
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,380
as others have said?

439
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,180
He...

440
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,140
Or has his appearance been exaggerated

441
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,420
since he is His Majesty's grand-uncle?

442
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,940
He is better still than what others think of him.

443
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,660
Your Majesty.

444
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,500
Your Highness.

445
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,420
This is the Junior Prince of Nanchen,

446
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,940
my grand-uncle.

447
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,300
Your Highness.

448
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,300
I want to talk to my teacher.

449
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,860
You can leave.

450
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,180
Yes.

451
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,900
He wanted to come

452
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:10,780
to see his brother

453
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,060
after I just taught him to recite for a while.

454
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,260
If you teach His Majesty,

455
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,860
he won't need me.

456
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,500
No.

457
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,460
Yesterday you taught me:

458
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:21,220
"The people are the most important element in a country;

459
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,620
next is the country; least is the ruler himself."

460
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,860
Good job.

461
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:29,660
Master,

462
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,100
Her Majesty is cutting her hair.

463
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,780
Zhousheng Chen, spare my life.

464
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,980
Zhousheng Chen, help me.

465
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:59,180
Zhousheng Chen, help me. Zhousheng Chen.

466
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,020
Zhousheng Chen.

467
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,260
To see me,

468
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,940
you cut your hair.

469
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:05,900
Go ahead.

470
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,380
What do you want to say?

471
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,780
Hui,

472
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,460
Hui wanted to kill me.

473
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:12,700
He wanted

474
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,780
to kill me, his real mother.

475
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,620
Should I just let him do that?

476
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,140
Zhousheng Chen,

477
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,340
you have no child.

478
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,940
You can't understand my feelings.

479
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,020
My

480
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,900
own son

481
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,380
imprisoned me

482
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,220
and wanted to poison me.

483
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,420
How I wish that

484
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,300
I hadn't given birth to him!

485
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,740
So you admit

486
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,340
you killed him.

487
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,060
No,

488
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,420
I didn't.

489
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,420
It was Qin Yan.

490
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,340
Qin Yan poisoned him.

491
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,380
Qin Yan is your man.

492
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,140
Once it is known by the rest,

493
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,100
you won't be able to convince anyone that you weren't involved too.

494
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,820
The traitor in my army

495
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,740
will be punished by military law.

496
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,620
He'll be killed,

497
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,380
but we won't mitigate

498
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,060
your punishment.

499
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,860
You also killed Grand Mentor Xie, right?

500
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:18,940
No.

501
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:21,740
No,

502
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,500
I didn't.

503
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,620
Don't attribute his death

504
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,140
to me.

505
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,820
He was related to the Gao family by marriage

506
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,660
and sent by your brother

507
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,420
to watch you.

508
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,580
I eliminated him.

509
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,620
You should thank me

510
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,500
instead of killing me.

511
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,220
Tell me

512
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,060
yes or no.

513
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,500
I'm your sister-in-law,

514
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,020
Zhousheng Chen.

515
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,820
Among those concubines in the imperial harem,

516
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,580
I was

517
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,020
the only one who risked my life in giving birth to a son

518
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,940
for your brother.

519
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,380
He loved you since your childhood.

520
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,340
For his sake,

521
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,500
please spare my life.

522
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,420
Please.

523
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,740
Qi Zhenzhen,

524
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,980
you killed

525
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,380
the late emperor,

526
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,300
plotted a rebellion

527
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,620
and persecuted the faithful and honest.

528
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,060
In this case,

529
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,220
you'd better plead for your family

530
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,380
rather than defend yourself.

531
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,460
I dare you!

532
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,020
I dare much.

533
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,420
You must offer up your life

534
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,740
for poisoning the late emperor.

535
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,140
Only after you die,

536
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:49,820
can your family members survive.

537
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,140
Attendant!

538
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,340
Her Majesty want to shave her hair

539
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,540
and go to the Baima Temple

540
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:03,120
to pray for Beichen.

541
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,400
From today on,

542
00:34:04,719 --> 00:34:06,600
there is no empress dowager in the court.

543
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,199
Take her to the temple.

544
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,440
Yes.

545
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,880
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

546
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:47,239
Cheers.

547
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,120
When you joined the army,

548
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,360
I warned you that

549
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,280
if you betrayed the royal army,

550
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,640
I'd kill you

551
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,440
no matter where you went.

552
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,600
Keep silent, or you'll be killed.

553
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,840
He betrayed Nanchen Royal Army.

554
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,280
Ask your prefectural governor

555
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,840
to send his head to the Central State.

556
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,900
[Nanchen]

557
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,440
Grand-uncle.

558
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,880
Can't you write?

559
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,080
The Prince of Guangling said

560
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,080
he'll marry Miss Cui next month.

561
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,160
Yes,

562
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,800
next month.

563
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,680
What should I

564
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,400
give her?

565
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,520
As her Master,

566
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,160
you must know what she likes.

567
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,000
She likes...

568
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,520
likes books.

569
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,000
Mother said

570
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,720
the Cui family's collection is larger

571
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,520
than that in the palace.

572
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,120
That's true.

573
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,320
So there's no use giving her more books.

574
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,160
What else does she like?

575
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,440
What did you give her?

576
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,560
I gave her

577
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,040
seals of conquered generals.

578
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,920
You've watched them the whole tonight.

579
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,080
Are these things important?

580
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,640
Yes.

581
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,240
These are the seals

582
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,440
of conquered generals

583
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,000
my master collected from each victorious battle.

584
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,320
What do you want to say?

585
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,360
My hometown is in the west.

586
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,840
We were saved by Nanchen Royal Army.

587
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,960
Please tell us more about His Highness.

588
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,160
Yes. Yes.

589
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,320
OK.

590
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,080
Where is your hometown?

591
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:42,960
Qingcheng.

592
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,120
Qingcheng.

593
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,840
The royal army

594
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,840
fought their longest defensive battle there.

595
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,680
I was a little girl back then.

596
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,280
My mother told me,

597
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,840
without Nanchen Royal Army,

598
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,160
we would have been slaughtered.

599
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,360
I was a little girl, too.

600
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,840
My senior brother told me about that.

601
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,400
After Qingcheng was surrounded,

602
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,160
my master rushed there through day and night

603
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,720
to reinforce them with 10,000 of his cavalry.

604
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,240
However, there were 130,000 enemies.

605
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,400
They held that position for over half a month.

606
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,760
Twenty days later,

607
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,080
when the reinforcements arrived,

608
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,320
they held no strong hopes.

609
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,800
But suddenly,

610
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,120
dozens of pieces of raven-blue long cloth

611
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,720
could be seen hanging from the city wall.

612
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:23,700
[Qingcheng]

613
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,840
The ragged cloth

614
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,560
flew in the strong wind.

615
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,480
Raven blue is the color

616
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,360
of His Highness' flag.

617
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
The flying cloth

618
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,800
over the city wall

619
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,040
meant that the city still held.

620
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,360
The 200,000 reinforcements

621
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,440
burst into cheers

622
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,160
and called him by his title at the top of their voices.

623
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,120
This is the Victory of Qingcheng.

624
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,800
Go ahead.

625
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,960
What else do you want to know?

626
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,000
Did Miss Cui cry

627
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,040
when she left your mansion?

628
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,960
Didn't she?

629
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,620
She did,

630
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,800
but she tended to

631
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,800
cry alone,

632
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,560
so I didn't see it.

633
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:38,340
[Central State]

634
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,160
What's wrong?

635
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,480
This is the hometown of His Highness

636
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,160
and also

637
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,640
the most dangerous place to be.

638
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:54,840
Let's go.

639
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,280
Master, we're here.

640
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,640
Xie Yun and Cui Feng haven't arrived yet.

641
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,440
Xie Yun wrote several letters,

642
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,240
to let us know that he has learned to ride a horse,

643
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,560
and can lead troops Eastward

644
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,800
as your vanguard at any time.

645
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,600
Let him stay in Beichen

646
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,880
and guard the border.

647
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,000
I'm just worried

648
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,280
about Cui Feng.

649
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,960
The new emperor is about to ascend the throne.

650
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,240
The regional princes and the prefectural governors

651
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,360
have been called back to the capital city.

652
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,600
Only Cui Feng hasn't responded yet.

653
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,680
Why don't we have Shiyi

654
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,160
write him a letter and call him back

655
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,840
on family matter grounds?.

656
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,000
What family matter?

657
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,200
Don't keep us guessing. Just spit it out!

658
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,320
Asking her cousin to come back

659
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,120
for her wedding ceremony

660
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,640
would be the best excuse.

661
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,000
You heard nothing.

662
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,440
No.

663
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,080
Advisor Xiao is right.

664
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,640
I'll go write to him right away.

665
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,800
There's paper and a writing brush here.

666
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,920
You can write here.

667
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:04,880
No.

668
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,440
I need to think

669
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,880
carefully how to write such a message.
