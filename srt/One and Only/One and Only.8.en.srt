[Episode 8]

4
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,440
Well.

5
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,200
You're the only one

6
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,640
that makes me concede defeat.

7
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,080
Do you have any unfulfilled wish?

8
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,080
I've been arrogating power in court for years

9
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:06,520
and I've enjoyed the dignity as an emperor.

10
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,080
I have no pities.

11
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,000
Is there any family member

12
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,840
you need me to take care of?

13
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,240
I have a son.

14
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,960
I'll have him escorted back to Pingcheng

15
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,680
so that he can escape this misfortune.

16
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,240
Before His Majesty was born,

17
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,200
the late emperor had an eldest son

18
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,160
who wasn't born to the empress.

19
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,640
But he died at three.

20
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,800
In order to find the truth out,

21
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,520
I offended Empress Gao.

22
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,680
But Liu Yuan begged for leniency

23
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,960
and saved me.

24
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,880
In my childhood,

25
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,400
I was on good terms

26
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,640
with Liu Yuan.

27
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,240
That's why you buried wine together?

28
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,640
Yeah.

29
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,280
Then,

30
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,280
have you ever buried some wine with any woman?

31
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,400
What do you mean?

32
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:26,840
Nothing.

33
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,440
You walked on every itch here

34
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,880
in your childhood?

35
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,280
Yeah.

36
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,000
Zhousheng Chen.

37
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,720
I'm sorry.

38
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,120
It doesn't matter.

39
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,600
I'm just not used to

40
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,920
hearing you

41
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,800
call me by my name.

42
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,060
Your family is in the Western State

43
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,030
and you will live in the Western State later.

44
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,320
You just said

45
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,000
it's enough for you to have ten orphans

46
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,080
and one disciple

47
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,240
in your mansion.

48
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,640
Yeah, it's enough.

49
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,400
Miss Cui,

50
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,900
The Prince of Guangling

51
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,900
is waiting for you outside the hall.

52
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,260
I'm going to ask him back.

53
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,040
My bedding hall

54
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,120
is also in the imperial palace.

55
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,720
How can you stop the Prince of Guangling?

56
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,040
Ask him in.

57
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:41,980
Yes.

58
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:42,780
Wait.

59
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,020
I don't feel well.

60
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,260
I'm afraid I can't deal with him if he comes in.

61
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,940
If so, we can only ask him to go back.

62
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,900
Yes.

63
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,420
What's wrong?

64
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,820
I'll be better after having a rest.

65
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,220
Your Highness,

66
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,060
she is...

67
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,300
Advisor Xie,

68
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,580
summon an imperial doctor.

69
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,620
Your Highness, can't you

70
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,690
feel her pulse?

71
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,940
I'm unfamiliar with it

72
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,010
as I haven't done this for long.

73
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,780
Let me do it.

74
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,400
It's more reliable

75
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,420
to summon an imperial doctor.

76
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,270
Your Highness, you know

77
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,120
my medical skills.

78
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,860
I can...

79
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:45,540
OK.

80
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,460
I'll summon an imperial doctor.

81
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,060
Advisor Xie,

82
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,100
please feel my pulse.

83
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,460
Let me do it.

84
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,140
You feel a pain in the chest?

85
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,180
Sometimes you feel depressed?

86
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,100
You had ringing in the ears?

87
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,100
A little.

88
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,100
It's not serious. You'll be better after a rest.

89
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,980
Then I go to rest immediately

90
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,020
and won't meet any visitors.

91
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:37,980
Suit yourself.

92
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,300
The maid said

93
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,880
Empress Dowager wants to send the nun

94
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,640
to the Western State

95
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,700
to give the junior Prince of Nanchen a favor.

96
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,460
Second,

97
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,940
if she gives birth to a baby,

98
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,380
the baby can be sent back to the palace

99
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,900
to be raised as a hostage.

100
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,740
Are you sad

101
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,860
that you're being forced to stay here by me?

102
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,100
I'm just tired.

103
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,100
I know

104
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:31,780
you feel so restless

105
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,419
because she is in the palace.

106
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,299
Since you came here,

107
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:38,580
I've been with you,

108
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:39,420
haven't I?

109
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,420
That's just your helpless action.

110
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,140
She is my fiancée.

111
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,820
I'm worried about her since she is ill.

112
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,140
Is there anything wrong?

113
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,340
After marrying me,

114
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,860
she will be your sister-in-law.

115
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:53,980
You can't dislike

116
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,540
her like this.

117
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,380
If she is good to you,

118
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,020
I won't dislike her.

119
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,380
Don't worry.

120
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,220
Your Highness,

121
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,380
Princess.

122
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,580
What's up?

123
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,660
By order of Empress Dowager,

124
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,060
some of the Cui family directly drove a carriage from the palace gate

125
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,300
to her bedding hall.

126
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,700
Did you see who got off the carriage?

127
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,500
Many of

128
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,660
the Cui clan.

129
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,980
If you want to see me,

130
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,860
I can go to your mansion.

131
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,340
Why do you come regardless of your condition?

132
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,780
I'm afraid I can't wait any more.

133
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,060
You come

134
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,260
for the Crown Princess' engagement?

135
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,660
Now that His Majesty has concubines,

136
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,690
he'll have sons soon.

137
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,440
You won't allow the Prince of Guangling

138
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,900
to be the Crown Prince,

139
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,940
right?

140
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,300
Yeah.

141
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,180
The Prince of Guangling will be unqualified.

142
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,700
So Shiyi won't be the Crowned Princess.

143
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,500
I'm sorry.

144
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,460
But...

145
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,540
Please cancel Shiyi's engagement.

146
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,780
My son Feng.

147
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,540
I want to ask for an engagement

148
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,500
for him.

149
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,620
Which girl do you think suits him?

150
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,900
Tell me.

151
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,980
Princess of Xinghua.

152
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,740
My son has been guiding Shouyang for many years.

153
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,740
With many battle achievements,

154
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,940
he is worthy of Her Highness.

155
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,460
In the palace,

156
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,220
only she

157
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,540
reaches marriageable age.

158
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,140
But...

159
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,980
If she marries my son,

160
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,110
the Cui clan and your family

161
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,800
will be united through marriage,

162
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,540
which will be good

163
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,820
for you only.

164
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,020
Empress Dowager.

165
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:09,980
OK.

166
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,260
I'll certainly agree with this marriage

167
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,580
to make up for what the royal family

168
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,820
owe your family.

169
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,060
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

[Jiafu Palace]

Shiyi.

173
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,020
Your Highness, please behave yourself.

174
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,180
I won't definitely cancel our engagement.

175
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,260
Your Highness,

176
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,500
as a favored prince,

177
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,140
it's not hard for you

178
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,260
to have a better marriage.

179
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,820
Now that Empress Dowager has cancelled our engagement,

180
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,620
don't give your heart

181
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,980
to me.

182
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,940
Shut up.

183
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,700
You called her in public like this.

184
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,660
Aren't you afraid of offending the Cui family

185
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,300
and Nanchen Royal Mansion?

186
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,980
You're a prince,

187
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,100
but the Cui family's daughter

188
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,780
is not humbler than you.

189
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,820
Your Highness, My Lady,

190
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,740
please calm down.

191
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,620
Your Highness has loved Miss Cui since childhood.

192
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,340
He doesn't want to

193
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,940
and won't hurt her.

194
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,540
I'm sorry.

195
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,660
Uncle, please forgive me.

196
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,020
Go out of the palace

197
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,260
to stay in the Residence of Cui

198
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,100
with your mom for a few days.

199
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,380
And spend some days

200
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,540
with your uncle.

201
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,220
Yes.

202
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,260
Aunt, I don't want to marry him.

203
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,660
Aunt.

204
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,180
I don't want to marry him.

205
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,220
The marriage between the Cui family and us

206
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,940
is imperative.

207
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,620
Now we just let it be.

208
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,540
So you must marry him.

209
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,380
But, but I don't like him.

210
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,660
Who do you like?

211
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:32,620
I...

212
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,940
I grant you the status of princess

213
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,140
is not to make you enjoy yourself.

214
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,140
You can choose to marry Cui Feng of the Cui family,

215
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,540
or marry a ruler in the border areas

216
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,020
to make peace.

[Residence of the Grand Mentor]

218
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,540
Cui Xiu is dead,

219
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,900
and I'm dying.

220
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:16,940
The Cui family doesn't have anyone influential in the court.

221
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,580
Wenjun,

222
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,340
remember.

223
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:30,260
Don't mourn for me for three years,

224
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:40,980
but ask the Princess to marry in as soon as possible.

225
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,740
Dad,

226
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,500
I don't want to marry her.

227
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,140
Please cancel the engagement.

228
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,860
You,

229
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,540
you unfilial son.

230
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,180
Dad.

Dad.

232

Unfilial son.

Dad. Dad.

234
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,820
Cui Feng,

235
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,140
your dad gave up his dignity

236
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,860
to ask for this engagement for you.

237
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,220
Do you really want your dad

238
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,980
to die in anger?

239
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,340
Dad,

240
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,220
I always

241
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,140
listen to you

242
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,180
and have never gone against you.

243
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,500
This time,

244
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,420
I beg you to cancel this engagement.

245
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,660
I would rather remain single all my life

246
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,660
than marry the princess.

247

Beat him.

248
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,940
Don't stop until he promises.

249
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:11,940
Mom,

250
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:13,300
stop them.

251
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,980
Your uncle is the clan chief.

252
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:17,099
Who dares to disobey him?

253
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:25,860

Dad.

258

Favored by

259
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,340
the late emperor,

260
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,300
I was promoted to such a position.

261
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:09,340
I should have gone without regrets,

262
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:19,740
but I'm loath to leave the descendants

263
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,780
of Wushui.

264

Dad.

265
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:37,140
Do you still treat me as your dad?

266
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,180
Promise your dad.

267
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,740
You unfilial son.

268
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,620
All of us

269
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,500
get married for the Cui family.

270
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,460
Promise him.

271
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,460
Wenji.

272
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,140
I know you dislike it.

273
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,060
But, Feng,

274
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,180
each of us

275
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,780
should sacrifice for our clan.

276
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,820
When Shiyi was 10 years old,

277
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,820
her dad's clan

278
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,500
offended Empress Gao.

279
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,380
To prevent the Cui family

280
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,860
and Shiyi from being implicated,

281
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,140
I wrote the divorce agreement

282
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,540
to divorce him.

283
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,340
I was more reluctant

284
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,180
than you are.

285
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,900
Feng,

286
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,500
I beg you.

287
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,860
Let your dad

288
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,420
go without regrets.

289
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:57,500
I promise.

I want to go back to the Western State.

303

I want to go back to the Western State.

304
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,420
I want to go back to the Western State.

She is not feeling well.

Give me some days

313
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,060
to persuade her.

314
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,700
You're her master,

315
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,260
but you're not her family after all.

316

Let us take her back.

Cui Wenji.

319
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,620
As a member of the Cui family,

320
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,140
you should know

321
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:44,820
Shiyi has lived in my mansion

322
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,820
for long.

323
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,620

all come

from here.

327
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,700
So I know more about her

328
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,100

So we have no time to talk things out with Shiyi.

333
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,060
Back then...

334

You were so rude.

341
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,900
You wanted to see your own daughter,

Can't I

344
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,940
speak for you?

It has been years since my uncle's death.

353
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:24,900
I didn't expect that

354
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,300
she is still

355
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,820
dwelling on the past.

356
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,820
They were not destined to be together,

357
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,660
so she can't let it go.

358
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,460
In the palace that day,

359
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,260
Cui convinced me

360
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,780
to take Shiyi

361
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,140
as an apprentice

362
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,860
with the affair of my uncle with Cui Wenji,

363
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,940
so as to resolve the hatred between the two families.

364
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,460
Otherwise,

365
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,140
I wouldn't have agreed

366
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:47,980
with him easily.

367
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:57,140
I'm sorry

368
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,060
to embarrass you.

369
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,580
Shiyi.

370
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,820
If I had known that

371
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,220
you didn't want to take me as an apprentice,

372
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,060
I wouldn't have stayed in the Western State.

373
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,780
If not,

374
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:25,860
where can you go?

375
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:29,900
Come with me.

376
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,020
Who is she?

377
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,520
She is from the Cui family.

378
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,960
Cui Shiyi.

379
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,360
She is the daughter of Li Qilang?

380
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,160
Yes.

381
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,600
Another blood debt

382
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,320
that the Gao family owes.

383
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,020
In the Taiji Palace back then,

384
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,940
considering the complicated relations

385
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:09,980
in the court in the Central State,

386
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,940
I just didn't want to connect with any family.

387
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,380
So back then,

388
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,180
no matter

389
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,410
who you are,

390
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,500
I couldn't

391
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,180
take you as my apprentice.

392
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,820
You smile finally.

393
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,420
Mind your words as a senior.

394
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,220
I'm less than ten years older than you.

395
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:35,380
I'm not a senior.

396
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,340
But as an uncle,

397
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,340
you rank as my senior.

398
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:43,700
Your Highness.

399
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,260
Wait for me here.

400
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,760
I'll come back to you

401
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,960
after meeting her.

402
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,320
It's late.

403
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,800
Why does she want to meet you?

404
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,640
What brings you

405
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,800
here this time?

406
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,920
May I talk with you

407
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,360
on our own?

408
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,000
There are no outsiders here.

409
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,240
Go ahead.

410
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,800
Please help me.

411
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,120
The Empress Dowager

412
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,640
let me out of the nunnery

413
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,640
to finish a task.

414
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,240
What did she want you to do?

415
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,440
Be your wife.

416
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:56,760
What if

417
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,680
I can't promise you?

418
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,680
At any cost, even if as your maidservant.

419
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,880
There is only one maidservant

420
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,240
in my mansion

421
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,640
and she came with Shiyi.

422
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,000
The rest are bodyguards.

423
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:09,920
Moreover,

424
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:12,600
I need no maidservants.

425
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,760
The Empress Dowager hates the Gao clan.

426
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,680
The reason why

427
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,960
she didn't kill me

428
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,400
is our misleading past.

429
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,280
If you don't take me in this time,

430
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,040
she'll think that I'm useless

431
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:35,280
and will kill me.

432
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,960
Get up first.

433
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,180
I really can't

434
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,020
promise you this time.

435
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,060
Although I can't marry you,

436
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,620
I can take you away.

437
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,180
I have an adoptive brother,

438
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,420
the Prince of Pingqin.

439
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,820
I can pretend to take you away

440
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,380
and secretly send you to him to avoid trouble.

441
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,620
What if she is provoked

442
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,140
and sends man to kill me

443
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,940
when finding that

444
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,220
I'm not in the Western State?

445
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,980
As a vassal king

446
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,940
not from the imperial clan,

447
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,860
The Prince of Pingqin is less restrained by the imperial court.

448
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,020
As Pingqin County is the farthest from the Central State,

449
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,720
the people and soldiers there

450
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,080
all respect him.

451
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,240
Even assassins sent there by her

452
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,560
may either die halfway

453
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,440
or never return.

454
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,840
OK, I'll go.

455
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,560
The Royal Army of Nanchen will leave soon.

456
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,120
Go back and get ready.

457
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,000
Miss Cui,

458
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,520
would you come out and see me?

459
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,800
Her uncle just passed away.

460
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:58,960
She is sad

461
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,320
and asleep.

462
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,080
Then I'll say it here.

463
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,000
I apologize

464
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,920
to you for my clan

465
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,160
killing your father's family.

466
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,440
I accept it for her.

467
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,280
You can leave.

468
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,680
My dad...

469
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,680
As a gentleman

470
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:22,800
from a famous family,

471
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:26,880
he was

472
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:30,680
known for his noble character

473
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:33,560
among his peers.

474
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,080
He loved your mom

475
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,880
and proposed many times,

476
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,480
but he was refused

477
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,680
for his humble origin.

478
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:45,760
At last, he chose to marry into the Cui family

479
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,160
and lived in the Residence of Cui.

480
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,400
How did that happen?

481
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,960
Why do you know it?

482
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,920
On the day he took you as his apprentice...

483
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,240
Why did he leave?

484
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,600
Is he hiding something from me?

485
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,080
No.

486
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,240
Perhaps

487
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:14,990
he wants me

488
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,550
to tell you without his presence.

489
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,730
On the day he took you as his apprentice,

490
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,560
your mom told him that

491
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,700
you got aphasia

492
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,050
because of your dad's matter.

493
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,230
Thus he got to know

494
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,220
the Li and Cui familys

495
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,670
and every detail

496
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,240
of what happened

497
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,520
to your dad.

498
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,920
His Highness is quite

499
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,240
attentive to you.

500
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,240
Advisor Xie,

501
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,360
what was the Gao's clan like

502
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,000
back then?

503
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,560
I know

504
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,440
it's a forbidden subject.

505
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,240
If it's not appropriate...

506
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,520
The Gao clan had two empresses,

507
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,739
so it had its heyday,

508
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,800
dominating the court

509
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,760
and overwhelming the royal Liu clan

510
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,630
and the Cui family.

511
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:11,719
However,

512
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,280
consequently,

513
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,320
few people today

514
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,840
remember the Gao clan.

515
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,600
Her Lady wants to return to the capital as soon as possible

516
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,120
to send the clan chief back to Qinghe County.

517
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,360
The condolence from ministers

518
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,960
will be over today.

519
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,000
I see.

520
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,199
So you must

521
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,600
be careful at night.

522
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,719
General Hong.

523
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,120
What can I do for you?

524
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,600
Both you and I

525
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,960
are generals

526
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,120
of the equal status.

527
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,800
Please don't say so.

528
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,000
I was ordered to

529
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,080
guard the peace of the Residence of Cui.

530
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,320
Here

531
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,600
I'm a guard

532
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,000
and you're the master.

533
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,640
Certainly you can order me.

534
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,800
I remember you were friendly to each other.

535
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:08,560
Why do you

536
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,360
have a conflict right after

537
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,560
his dad passed away?

538
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,760
It isn't a conflict.

539
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,120
It's public affair.

540
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:13,600
Well...

541
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,120
I'm in pain these days.

542
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,200
Perhaps what I did and said

543
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,680
have offended her.

544
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:25,880
Tonight,

545
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,320
may I see you

546
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,120
to apologize to you?

547
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,120
Tonight...

548
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,040
Sure.

549
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,920
I'll guard tonight.

550
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,440
What makes

551
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,840
the Royal Army of Nanchen invincible

552
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,280
is our united morale.

553
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,400
You two should

554
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,600
patch things up.

555
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,240
Today,

556
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,400
you must talk about it over.

557
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,240
I've kept some words

558
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,000
in my heart for years.

559
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,240
Let me say first.

560
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,880
Because of your status,

561
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,880
you need to consider

562
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,320
manner and reputation

563
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,840
whenever you talk.

564
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,920
But I'm an orphan

565
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,160
without any constraints,

566
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,440
so I'll say first.

567
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,080
That day

568
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,360
when you first went to

569
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,440
the Western State

570
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,800
with your sister,

571
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,720
I stopped you

572
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,520
under the gate tower,

573
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,080
but you made

574
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,590
a strong impression on me.

575
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:21,910
♫I don't seek glory of the multitude♫

576
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,760
I thought you

577
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:28,980
♫I only want to have a quiet conscience♫

578
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,080
couldn't stand the hardships in the army.

579
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,600
However,

580
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,400
you guarded Shouyang for years

581
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:37,010
♫With a pot of liquor, I travel all over the world♫

582
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,200
and resisted the enemy there.

583
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,720
Though you were in danger

584
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,200
when being besieged for several times,

585
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,720
you never retreated,

586
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:44,930
♫The horse's hooves sound on the battlefield♫

587
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:39,760
but guarded the south gate

588
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,440
for the people.

589
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,160
I'm flattered.

590
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:54,190
♫I am griping a great ambition in my hand♫

591
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,000
I really

592
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,520
admire you.

593
00:37:54,830 --> 00:38:01,420
♫I don't fear the rain and wind and have an inflexible will♫

594
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,680
I, I also...

595
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,000
Xiaoyu, it's my turn.

596
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:00,600
No.

597
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,360
Let me say first.

598
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,960
♫As a general, I may forget any wound on the shoulder♫

599
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,240
Perhaps what I want to say

600
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,800
is more than your words.

601
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:20,160
♫I am willing to stick to a ray of light for a lifetime♫

602
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,360
This is your news of victory.

603
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,640
I've kept it for years.

604
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,920
You've made greater achievements

605
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,240
than I've done.

606
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,200
You've long been famous in the Central Plains.

607
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,440
I love you,

608
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:38,430
♫The moon knows my heart♫

609
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,040
but I dared not say.

610
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,000
From beginning to end

611
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:46,340
♫Forgive me as I never retreat on the battlefield♫

612
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,120
I always love you,

613
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,760
but we can never be together.

614
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:52,890
♫There will be a grand scene of prosperity♫

615
00:38:53,320 --> 00:39:05,560
♫I don't expect people to praise me, and I just want to have a clear conscience♫

616
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,160
I've heard of you,

617
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,560
Xiao Wen.

618
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,600
Xiao Wen is dead.

619
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,480
I'm Xiao Yan.

620
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,320
You changed your name?

621
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,040
My uncle believes you,

622
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,320
so do I.

623
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,160
I've drawn up an edict

624
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,720
to make you the Prince of Fengyang.

625
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,600
You'll stay in the Central State

626
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,880
and be protected

627
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,400
by Beichen in this life.

628
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:10,960
Thank you, Your Majesty.

629
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,760
I don't want to stay in the Central State.

630
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,400
Where do you want to go?

631
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,000
Sure enough,

632
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,000
people prefer following uncle.

633
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,920
Your Majesty,

634
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,440
Xiao Yan wants to join the Royal Army of Nanchen

635
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,440
to get a chance

636
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,240
to avenge his parents.

637
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,120
Don't bother to explain.

638
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,480
I don't mind.

639
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,800
I promise.

640
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,720
I'll still give you

641
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,200
the title of Prince of Fengyang.

642
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,160
I'm already a monk.

643
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:48,920
Prince of Fengyang,

644
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,600
although you've got tonsured,

645
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,320
you still attach to the world.

646
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,720
When you avenge,

647
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,160
come tell me

648
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,640
whether you want this title or not.

649
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,600
I...

650
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,680
Just follow the edict

651
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,880
of His Majesty.

652
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,160
Don't disobey it.

653
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

654
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,640
That's right.

655
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,000
When will you leave, uncle?

656
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,360
Tomorrow.

657
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,120
When will we meet next time?

658
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,280
We'd better not meet again in this life.

659
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,760
What's wrong

660
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,160
with me, uncle?

661
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,600
Whenever I come back,

662
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,800
there will be great events in the court,

663
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,560
so I'd rather

664
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,400
not see you again in this life.

665
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,120
I'll guard the Central State in the Western State.

666
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,200
I hope that you'll be a wise emperor.

667
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:52,240
I envy you

668
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,520
having these able men around.

669
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,600
I want someone of them.

670
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:00,960
Who?

671
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,960
I'd like to invite Advisor Xie

672
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,000
to help me in the Central State

673
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,680
like how he taught the late emperor.
