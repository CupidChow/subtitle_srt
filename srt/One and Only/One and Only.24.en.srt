[Episode 24]

4
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,480
Throughout my life,

5
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,680
I've never let anyone down

6
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,240
but Eleven.

7
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:11,100
[Eleven]

8
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,240
General Cui,

9
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:15,200
have you decided?

10
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,600
A soldier must be upright above all else, even if it means death.

11
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,720
I believe my parents

12
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,760
will understand and forgive me.

13
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:24,840
Let's go.

14
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,400
Under the heavens and in front of the three armies,

15
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,080
I make an oath that

16
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,720
I will give up my family name Cui

17
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,120
and give myself the surname of the Junior Prince of Nanchen and follow him.

18
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,080
For the state,

19
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,280
for the people

20
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,060
and for those generals and soldiers

21
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,420
who sacrificed their lives.

22
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,820
We will start the rebellion in Shouyang today!

23
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:12,440
Rebel! Rebel! Rebel!

24
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,440
That night when my husband left,

25
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,080
it was snowing heavily

26
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,920
in Qinghe,

27
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,800
just like this.

28
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,960
Your Ladyship,

29
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,040
we've got news from the young master.

30
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,400
He gave up his family name Cui

31
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,800
and started a rebellion in Shouyang.

32
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,080
His Majesty issued an edict to

33
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,960
offer amnesty and enlistment to the young master

34
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,480
and that he shall not be killed.

35
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,320
Now that he has given up his family name Cui.

36
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,520
Will it displease His Majesty?

37
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,960
Knowing Feng's personality

38
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,960
he will not submit.

39
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,240
Since he has made his decision,

40
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,080
then let him be.

41
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,400
But,

42
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,920
he gave up his family name

43
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,840
at will

44
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,640
to follow the Junior Prince of Nanchen.

45
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,680
How unrestrained he is.

46
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,040
Yeah.

47
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,440
He's not like us

48
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,600
who have too many worries.

49
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,840
Is there any message from Mr. Huan?

50
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,000
Not yet.

51
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,080
Let's wait for some more days.

52
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,040
Yes.

53
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,600
Your Highness, were you awake all night?

54
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,640
Prepare some tea.

55
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,880
Yes.

56
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:34,960
It's indeed hard for you

57
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,560
to accept the fact that

58
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,460
the royal mansion has rebelled.

59
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,659
Here, have some water.

60
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,180
Your cousin has also rebelled.

61
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,140
If you don't believe me, you may ask your mother.

62
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,260
Among your six branches,

63
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,940
only Wushui branch

64
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:08,940
has hundreds of members

65
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,660
taking posts as Royal Guards in the royal court

66
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,180
and posts in different counties and prefectures.

67
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,700
How many people will die

68
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,500
as Cui Feng rebels?

69
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,539
The Gao family was eliminated due to one person.

70
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,940
The Qi family was destroyed due to one person.

71
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,380
Do you want the Cui family

72
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:35,900
to follow in their footsteps?

73
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,100
Here, drink some water.

74
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,300
Go get breakfast ready.

75
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,060
Yes.

76
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,940
When I was a kid, they said

77
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,940
you were good at Qin and painting.

78
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,580
I planned to ask you to play the Qin

79
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,500
on the day when you are conferred the title.

80
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,500
Now it seems

81
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,140
you won't be able to do it.

82
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,820
I'm going to summon the imperial doctor.

83
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,420
She didn't utter a word before me.

84
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,420
Why doesn't she

85
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,460
think for me?

86
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,020
He's been a Regional Prince

87
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:55,980
guarding the Western State for over 20 years.

88
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,530
No emperor would dare to keep him alive!

89
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,240
Your Majesty.

90
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,610
Zhousheng Chen.

91
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,940
But I ordered

92
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,540
him to be killed by dismemberment

93
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,540
in front of all people.

94
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,620
Your Majesty.

95
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,780
She is the Crown Princess,

96
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,740
while I am

97
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,900
a fake Crown Prince.

98
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,660
Do flowers bloom in lunar December?

99
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:25,180
I saw Shiyi's wound in her hand.

100
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,420
If Your Majesty wants to have the support of

101
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,420
the Yang family and Zhangsun family,

102
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,340
then do not agitate her anymore

103
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,740
before the conferment.

104
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,980
I have only one daughter.

105
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,460
Everything I do is for her.

106
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,740
Lady Cui Wenjun.

107
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,580
She doesn't believe me.

108
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,980
She has been living in the royal mansion for many years.

109
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,020
It's impossible that she would believe in such a short while

110
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,900
that the

111
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,420
royal mansion rebelled against you

112
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,500
If Your Majesty does not have enough patience,

113
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,100
why do you force her to stay in the palace?

114
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,380
I know my daughter the best.

115
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,860
Leave her be for several days.

116
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,700
She will figure it out.

117
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,660
I understand.

118
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,820
Honored Concubine ate a lot in the morning.

119
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,140
She watched the snow in the yard

120
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,410
for an hour.

121
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,100
She also ordered the servants to find a ladder,

122
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,180
intending to go up to the roof of the side palace hall to watch the snow.

123
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,500
But she was stopped by

124
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,500
Lady Li.

125
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,940
As Cui Wenjun said,

126
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,020
she will come to her senses slowly.

127
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,580
Ultimately,

128
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,820
a mother would know their daughter best.

129
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,020
Clean the roof of the side palace hall

130
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,660
and have the Royal Guards stay guard.

131
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,100
Let her watch the snow if she wants to.

132
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,180
From today on, as long as she doesn't go out of the palace,

133
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,860
she can do anything she likes.

134
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,500
Yes.

135
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,380
The royal army is back.

136
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,140
The royal army is back.

137
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,940
Why do you stay in Pingyin?

138
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,580
Flooding of the Jiang State.

139
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,340
The fierce battle in the Shuo State.

140
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,300
Six expeditions to the Dai State.

141
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,340
They all forgot your deeds.

142
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,490
They only remember you were upright, handsome,

143
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,460
and were praised by the people

144
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,940
which threatened them.

145
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,980
I'm here to send the news of victory.

146
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,020
I heard that you didn't sleep well

147
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,500
for more than ten days for it.

148
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,660
Congratulations on the complete victory.

149
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:23,860
[Throughout my life, I've never let anyone down, but Eleven.]

150
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,860
All your life you had no wife and no children.

151
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,020
And for what?

152
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:23,820
Your Majesty.

153
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,460
His Majesty ordered that

154
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,020
you can't meet the Honored Concubine.

155
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,340
He became the emperor because of my family.

156
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,220
Don't you know that?

157
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:35,710
Get out!

158
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,140
The Wushui branch migrated southward secretly.

159
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,460
My father sent troops

160
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,300
to trap them within the border.

161
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,060
No one knows this

162
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,660
besides His Majesty and me.

163
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,420
Your family name is very prestigious

164
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,980
among the scholars.

165
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,660
If your family moves southward,

166
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,300
Beichen will truly perish.

167
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,140
Why do I tell you about this?

168
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,220
Perhaps I want to

169
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,140
threaten you with the lives

170
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,420
of the Cui family,

171
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,520
because I'm afraid you would kill

172
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,980
Liu Zixing on your wedding day.

173
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,260
If so, I wouldn't be able to become the empress.

174
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,500
Or because

175
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,700
we were friends

176
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,060
for a night.

177
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,740
If I were you,

178
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,460
no matter how painful it is,

179
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,140
I must know the whole truth.

180
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,300
Thanks.

181
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,140
In the past,

182
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,860
no Honored Concubine

183
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,820
has had such a grand conferring ceremony.

184
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,180

185

His Majesty's heart,

186
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,900
but I, as his wet nurse,

187
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,220
knows that he cares very much about you.

188
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,700
You'll be busy for a whole day tomorrow.

189
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,420
Please sleep early.

190
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,700
-Please.
-Please.

191
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:42,700

192
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:45,780

193
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,180
Lady Cui Wenjun.

194
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,580
It has been a long time since we last met.

195
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,740
General Yang is as strong as before.

196
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,860
Today, Honored Concubine Cui will be conferred with the title.

197
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,660
It's truly something joyous.

198
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,660
Thank you, General Zhangsun.

199
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,140
Though, she's not conferred with the title of empress.

200
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,340
Even if the Jin family has the title of empress,

201
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,580
they can't hold on to it for long.

202
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,020
In our eyes, only Honored Concubine Cui

203
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,360
deserves the position.

204
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,580
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

205
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,260
Generals, please come with me to the palace.

206
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,380
Please.

207
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:15,980
-Please.
-Please.

208
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:32,020
It's not until today that I truly think

209
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,980
I will marry you.

210
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,740
Lady Cui Wenjun.

211
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,700
I want to have a word with her Honored Concubine alone.

212
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,260
Yes.

213
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:15,140
Your father appeared in my dream last night.

214
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,860
He had never shouted at me

215
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,380
from the day when he married me

216
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,340
to when I gave birth to you

217
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,380
and to when he was forced

218
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,980
to leave.

219
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,180
But last night,

220
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,140
he blamed me.

221
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,940
He blamed me for sending you to the palace.

222
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:39,140
He said if you stayed in Zhousheng Chen's royal palace,

223
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,100
you would have lived a free life.

224
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,300
Shiyi,

225
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,980
I was wrong.

226
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,820
I am sorry.

227
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,260
Mr. Huan is waiting for you in Nanxiao.

228
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,300
When you reach the south,

229
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,020
do not turn back.

230
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,140
Mother,

231
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,340
please forgive my disobedience.

Outside the gate of Great Xia,

00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,660
there are over 2,000 scholars of well-known families

235
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,980
from places outside the capital.

236
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,060
They are waiting to kowtow to Your Highness.

237
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,020
Greetings, Honored Concubine Cui!

238
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,340
The Prince of Pingqin is waiting for you

239
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,380
behind the scholars.

240
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,380
When they kowtow to you later,

241
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,260
you only need to

242
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,420
run out along the middle path.

243
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,460
The scholars dare not stop you as they don't know about the truth.

244
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,140
The generals and soldiers are all my trusted subordinates.

245
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,500
Today, I will fight a way out

00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,660
for you.

247
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,180
His Majesty has issued a proclamation.

248
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,540
Honored Concubine Cui was born into a noble family

249
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,580
and has the support of scholars.

250
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,540
Today, she will be conferred the title of Honored Concubine.

251
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,820
People in Beichen are allowed to

252
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,980
pay their respects to her outside the city gate.

253
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,420
Greetings, Honored Concubine.

254
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,660
When Miss Cui runs out later,

255
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,660
we will rush in.

256
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,660
Got it.

257
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:27,540
Miss Cui.

258
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,420
Why is Miss Cui going back?

259
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,820
She doesn't want to get us into trouble.

260
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,860
Why is the Honored Concubine going up to the palace gate?

261
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,740
I guess she wants to see

262
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,300
the people in the city more clearly.

263
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,740
As a woman,

264
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,180
It's a great honor for her

265
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,020
to be able to go up to the city gates

266
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,740

But I can't escape.

I can't let you die for me,
