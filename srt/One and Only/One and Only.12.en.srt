00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:32,979
[Episode 12]

3
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,720
Did I

4
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,160
say something wrong just now?

5
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,400
You mean about Mrs. Huan?

6
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,600
I'll find a time and take you

7
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,840
to see her later.

8
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,680
I think

9
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,280
after a few more days,

10
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,040
I can ask them to pay for the accommodation.

11
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,760
What do you say, dear?

12
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,120
Yes. You're right!

13
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,000
What I want

14
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,320
is the book collections of the Cui family!

15
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,400
That's an invaluable treasure.

16
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,560
Today she debated

17
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,680
with a group

18
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,960
of people,

19
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,880
yet she still won.

20
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,840
The reason is

21
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,079
that the books Miss Cui reads

22
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,920
are all rarely seen.

23
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,240
Did his wife…

24
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,720
They were of the same age.

25
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,800
They first met when they were 6,

26
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,920
and they got married when they were 16.

27
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,360
Two years later,

28
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,360
the rebel forces ransacked the Residence of Huan.

29
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,720
My wife and I left everything behind

30
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,280
except our collections of ancient books

31
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,160
and escaped to the northwest desert.

32
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,160
She died at the desert

33
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,240
while I...

34
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,640
am still alive.

35
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,160
Please come in.

36
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,960
Before my wife passed away, she said to me,

37
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,240
"Huan Yu,"

38
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,000
"don't make me a memorial tablet."

39
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,960
"I will be with you always"

40
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,560
"and I'll never leave you.”

41
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,120
That's why I didn't make her a memorial tablet.

42
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,840
My wife is right here with me.

43
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,360
Have a seat.

44
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,920
I'll go get you two some tea.

45
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,720
The promise that Mrs. Huan made

46
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,159
became Mr. Huan's faith,

47
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,000
by which he lives by

48
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,960
for the rest of his life.

49
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,320
It shows how important a promise

50
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,080
can be to a family.

51
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,840
But, Master, you…

52
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,400
I what?

53
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,560
You are wrong.

54
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,960
About what?

55
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,640
You said

56
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,040
one would

57
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,360
leave nothing behind

58
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,160
but useless sorrow

59
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,200
after he dies.

60
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,680
To a soldier,

61
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,520
a promise is

62
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,400
more valuable than his life.

63
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,600
I can give you my word

64
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,680
that if something bad

65
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,360
ever happens to me,

66
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,430
you will be informed of

67
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,600
when and where

68
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,200
I died.

69
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,520
Master, you are an experienced,

70
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,640
ever-victorious general.

71
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,280
I'm sure you'll live a long life.

72
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,440
So, we've arrived at the Longkang Academy?

73
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,120
Yes, Your Majesty.

74
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,040
Did you inform Mr. Huan of our visit beforehand?

75
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,920
I forgot.

76
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,080
Fine.

77
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:25,860
[Longkang Academy]

78
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,400
Let me play some music for you.

79
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,440
Sir!

80
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,600
An old gentleman

81
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,880
is here with…with another…

82
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,440
another old gentleman!

83
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,360
You were speaking unintelligibly. Try again.

84
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,640
An old gentleman

85
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,160
who claimed to be Mr. Xiao of Nanxiao

86
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,920
is here with another old gentleman.

87
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,480
It's only the two of them and no guards?

88
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,920
Yes. There are no guards.

89
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,960
They are dressed casually?

90
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,480
Yes, they are dressed casually.

91
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:14,800
Shut the curtains.

92
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,880
I don't know who he is.

93
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,320
Of course I need to shut the curtains.

94
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,720
Am I right, Your Highness?

95
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,520
Yes.

96
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,080
Miss Cui,

97
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,799
can you guess who has come?

98
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,039
He called Nanxiao his own place

99
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,320
and his last name is Xiao.

100
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,080
Could it be the Emperor of Nanxiao?

101
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,920
Shall I ask them to come out to greet you?

102
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,120
Mr. Huan's residence

103
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,840
is where students come to study

104
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,080
and where his close friends come to visit.

105
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,440
There is no need to speak of formalities here.

106
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,340
I heard that a very important guest

107
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,260
from the Western State is visiting the academy.

108
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,500
Mr. Huan, could you

109
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,820
please open the curtain

110
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,500
and introduce him to me?

111
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,160
I don't have an important guest.

112
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,800
You are my guest,

113
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,060
so is this gentleman from the Western State.

114
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,640
I'm a person who believes

115
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,600
“First come, first served.”

116
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,320
Since this gentleman was here first,

117
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:25,920
you should ask him if he

118
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,000
wants to see you.

119
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,000
That's fair.

120
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,640
Would the gentleman from the Western State

121
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,160
come out and meet me?

122
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,180
Since the curtain is still closed,

123
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,460
let's just pretend

124
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,420
that we've never met each other.

125
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,700
That's the least complicated way.

126
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,420
But the rumor that you're now in Jiangling

127
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,260
has caused quite a stir

128
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,900
and everyone has heard about it.

129
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,660
The rumor is not true.

130
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,260
You can tell people

131
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,860
that the prefectural governor made a mistake.

132
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,340
Your suggestion

133
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,740
would be convincing enough for the public.

134
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,300
But,

135
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,100
Zhousheng Chen,

136
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,260
how am I supposed to just let it go

137
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,620
and set you free?

138
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:17,900
Both of us

139
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,540
want peace for the North and the South.

140
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,460
If that's the case,

141
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,620
letting me go is your best choice.

142
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,660
But I'm the emperor after all.

143
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,700
If I let you go like this,

144
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,060
I may regret it

145
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,020
when I think about it later.

146
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,220
Young Man, I'm an elder already.

147
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,780
Shouldn't you show me

148
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,700
some respect?

149
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,380
I accidentally entered Jiangling

150
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,100
without your permission.

151
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,180
I hope you can forgive me, Your Majesty!

152
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,660
An earnest apology usually comes with a gift.

153
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,180
What gift do you offer?

154
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,300
Since Your Majesty is asking for something,

155
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,580
you must have

156
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,660
something in mind already.

157
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,540
My son,

158
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,340
Xiao Wen.

159
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,940
Aren't you afraid of not being able to come back?

160
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,420
He is my father.

161
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,380
I know him very well.

162
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,340
Since he's arrived in Jiangling,

163
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,460
he won't return empty-handed.

164
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,820
He'll force His Highness to hand me over.

165
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,820
You should go back.

166
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,540
Emperor Xiao can't kill His Highness,

167
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,060
but he won't hesitate a bit to kill you.

168
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,340
You are the military advisor.

169
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,900
Protecting you is my job.

170
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,220
How can you protect me

171
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,500
when you can't even defeat me?

172
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,220
You talk too much.

173
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,300
Now, row the boat.

174
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,060
If I can come back,

175
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,980
I'll teach you how to defeat me.

176
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,220
I intentionally went easy on you

177
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,300
because you were a monk.

178
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,060
You really think I can't defeat you?

179
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,580
His Highness told me

180
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,580
that you were highly gifted in martial arts.

181
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,500
No one can defeat me

182
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,660
except my master!

183
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,500
He has

184
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,020
changed his name to Xiao Yan,

185
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,180
and he serves the Royal Army of Nanchen as the military advisor now.

186
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,620
As the Chief Commander,

187
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,820
how can I hand over

188
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,460
my military advisor for my own safety?

189
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,620
You've never suspected him?

190
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,740
After all, he's my favorite son

191
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,460
who lived with me for over 20 years.

192
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,180
If you use a man, then trust him.

193
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,580
If you don't trust him, then don't use him.

194
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,020
I just want my son back.

195
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,820
It's totally up to him

196
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,740
whether he wants to come back or not.

197
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,860
Zhousheng Chen,

198
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,820
you are in Jiangling right now,

199
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,020
not the Western State.

200
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,820
Aren't you afraid that I would become irrational

201
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,500
and kill you to vent my anger?

202
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,940
I always say what I mean,

203
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,740
no matter when I'm in the Western State

204
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:25,300
or Jiangling.

205
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,580
Your Majesty,

206
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,260
we can talk about

207
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,780
the second prince's matter later.

208
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,500
The news about the Royal Army of Nanchen

209
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,740
stationing across the river

210
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,940
has spread to the whole country.

211
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,540
The word on the street is that a war

212
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,420
will break out between the South and the North.

213
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,740
If we can't persuade him

214
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,900
to go back,

215
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,860
I'm afraid…

216
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,340
I'm afraid our country would first fall into chaos.

217
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,860
Putting our status aside.

218
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,460
If we talk about seniority,

219
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,380
then you should at least

220
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,420
respect me for my age,

221
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:06,820
right?

222
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,060
You are right.

223
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,860
Then I'd love to know

224
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,060
if there's

225
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,580
anything else you'd want?

226
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,060
I'll see what I can do.

227
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,980
It's an apologetic gift from you,

228
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,820
so you should make a suggestion.

229
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,220
I've had something

230
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,220
prepared.

231
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,900
The book collections of our family consists of the ancient books of the previous dynasties.

232
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,340
It's a priceless treasure

233
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,100
that our clansmen

234
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,060
risked their lives for

235
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,500
during the Central Plains War.

236
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,220
I took 5,600 transcripts

237
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,540
of the volumes

238
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,660
when I left home.

239
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,420
They are my dowry,

240
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,920
as well as my private book collections.

241
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,020
I'm willing to give Your Majesty half of it

242
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,060
on the junior Prince of Nanchen's behalf.

243
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,000
But I have one condition.

244
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,340
The transcripts

245
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,160
must be kept in the Longkang Academy.

246
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,340
Are you serious?

247
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,540
Miss, your last name is Cui?

248
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,260
Where are you from?

249
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,900
My mother is Cui Wenjun, from Beichen.

250
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,340
Her branch name is Wushui.

251
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,740
She's the current clan chief of our family.

252
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,380
Back then, we invited the Cui family

253
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,450
to move to the South for three times,

254
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,140
but your family still refused.

255
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,690
Only one branch moved here.

256
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,980
However, after dozens of years

257
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,350
they moved back again,

258
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,460
which really broke my heart.

259
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,700
It's understandable that they missed their homeland.

260
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,860
Please forgive them, Your Majesty.

261
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,820
No.

262
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,220
It's because we were not sincere enough.

263
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,660
I don't have a say

264
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,820
in the relocation matter.

265
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,060
I'd love to focus on the issue at hand.

266
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,050
Your Majesty, would you like to accept the transcripts?

267
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,020
Yes! Of course!

268
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,420
Greetings, Your Majesty!

269
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,620
I've spent my whole life looking for the book collections of the Cui family,

270
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,100
but I had no luck.

271
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,020
Your Majesty, if you accept the transcripts,

272
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,020
I will take the position you offered

273
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:18,900
and become the…

274
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,340
the…Grand Mentor for the Crown Prince!

275
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,580
Right! The Grand Mentor for the Crown Prince!

276
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,300
Mr. Huan, you…

277
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,420
You should watch your manners!

278
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,660
It's okay. It'll be a great honor

279
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,060
to have Mr. Huan in the royal court.

280
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,820
The transcripts are in the Azure Dragon Temple.

281
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,380
Please find a time and deliver them here.

282
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,820
You gave him half of your dowry,

283
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,220
but only stayed here for three days.

284
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,460
Looks like he's got the better deal.

285
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,820
They are transcripts.

286
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,160
I can make more copies.

287
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,900
This place is too far away from home.

288
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:52,660
I'll ask my mother

289
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,820
to send me the original books

290
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,410
so that I can copy them in the mansion.

291
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,410
In my opinion,

292
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,140
you can open the curtains now.

293
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:11,859
Your Majesty.

294
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,300
The junior Prince of Nanchen.

295
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,180
Greetings, Your Majesty. I'm Cui Shiyi.

296
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,020
Although it's not

297
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,620
the gift I was hoping for,

298
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,580
it's generous enough.

299
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,980
Please bring a message to your mother for me.

300
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,300
We have always hoped

301
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,220
that the Cui family can move to Nanxiao.

302
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,900
I will, Your Majesty.

303
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:48,980
[Longkang Academy]

304
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,820
The Nanchen Royal Mansion is full of talented people.

305
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,580
We can't underestimate them.

306
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,460
Your Majesty,

307
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,020
the second prince is at the riverside and wants to see you.

308
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,820
Hurry! Let's go to the riverside!

309
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,580
Father, rest assured!

310
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,060
I promise you that one day

311
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,940
I will lead the army across the river

312
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:19,780
and help you fulfill your dream

313
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,340
of unifying the whole country!

314
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,980
Among all my sons,

315
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,020
you are like me and

316
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,780
understand me the most.

317
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,020
Wen!

318
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,740
Wen!

319
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,180
Wen!

320
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,980
Why did you shave your head?

321
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,020
Come on land

322
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,260
and go back with me.

323
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,580
Come back to Jiankang with me.

324
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,900
I crossed the river

325
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,660
to pick up the junior Prince of Nanchen.

326
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,460
You are the second prince of Nanxiao.

327
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,700
Why do you humble yourself

328
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,420
and serve the junior Prince of Nanchen?

329
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,260
Wen, don't fall for the rumors.

330
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,100
I am really your birth father.

331
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,060
I hold a grudge against you

332
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,860
not only for you killing my father and my wife,

333
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,500
but also for you destroying my country.

334
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,340
In this life,

335
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,020
you'll never be my father

336
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,820
but only my sworn enemy!

337
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,340
Step back!

338
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,420
I've said

339
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,020
that whoever dares hurt my son

340
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,740
would be executed

341
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,260
along with his whole family!

342
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,300
Your Majesty.

343
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,500
I think

344
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,860
we should ask the second prince to come with us

345
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,540
so that Your Majesty will have more time to talk.

346
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,620
Sooner or later everything would be resolved.

347
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,700
There's no need for that.

348
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,660
I will

349
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,340
wait for you to change your mind.

350
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,660
Would Your Majesty be willing to let His Highness go?

351
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,780
He will go back tomorrow.

352
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,580
Wen…

353
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,460
My master

354
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,340
made some silly comments

355
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,900
and misunderstood the relationship you two had.

356
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,660
He hopes you won't take his word to heart.

357
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,580
He tends

358
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,260
to be silly sometimes.

359
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,860
It's all right.

360
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,860
I'll clean up the room

361
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,980
next door,

362
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,660
so you can sleep there tonight, Miss.

363
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:47,940
Isn't that room

364
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,660
packed with stuff?

365
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,140
It's not.

366
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,500
Master.

367
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,860
You talk too much. Now, leave us.

368
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,700
Serve her some dishes.

369
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,980
Help yourselves!

370
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,980
Master, clean your hands.

371
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,180
Why do you call me

372
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,260
"Master" again?

373
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,500
The people of the academy

374
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,660
know who you are

375
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,020
and who I am now.

376
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,420
People here are all educated

377
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,740
and pay attention to etiquette.

378
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,020
If I don't call you "Master",

379
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,540
they'd gossip about us.

380
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,420
Besides,

381
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,140
tomorrow we'll cross the river.

382
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,660
After we go back,

383
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,260
I'll need to call you "Master" anyway.

384
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,540
That's tomorrow.

385
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,900
It's not tomorrow yet.

386
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,900
Tomorrow is only around 20 hours away.

387
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,500
No need to fool ourselves.

388
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,340
Master, have some more.

389
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,020
We don't have this kind of food back home.

390
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,460
I know you like this place.

391
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,870
But we are from Beichen,

392
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,020
we can't stay in the South for too long.

393
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,620
I understand.

394
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,090
You gave all the food to me. What will you eat?

395
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,020
I'm not that hungry.

396
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,300
Since you are not hungry,

397
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,540
why don't we go down the mountain?

398
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,180
For what?

399
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,660
The scholars of Nanxiao are all aesthetes

400
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,740
who enjoy playing the Qin and talking about poetry after lunch.

401
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:25,780
Since you love Qins,

402
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,390
why don't we go and take a look?

403
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,100
Good idea! Let's go!

404
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,040
I'll be your guide!

405
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,340
Not only does my master

406
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,500
talk foolishly,

407
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,100
he also likes to eavesdrop.

408
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,100
You are a man.

409
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,340
Why are you wearing a veil?

410
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,540
That's part of my identity.

411
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,340
When people see this,

412
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,180
they'll know

413
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,580
Mr. Huan of the Longkang Academy

414
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,460
has come down the mountain.

415
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,620
Isn't that a brilliant idea?

416
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,860
You don't have these in the Western State?

417
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,780
I've never taken a walk like this in the Western State.

418
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,180
This is your fault.

419
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,220
How could you not show your disciple your hometown?

420
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,780
It's not my master's fault.

421
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,700
It wasn't

422
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,180
convenient for me to go outside in the past.

423
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,260
If he took me out,

424
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,140
he'd offend my uncle

425
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,740
and the people of the Imperial Palace.

426
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:42,980
But now

427
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,260
I can do whatever I want.

428
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,260
Why was it inconvenient for her

429
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,540
to go out?

430
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,100
She had an engagement before.

431
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,140
And now?

432
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,140
Now she's not engaged.

433
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,340
Because of you?

434
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,540
Not because of me.

435
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,500
It may not seem to be,

436
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,860
but actually it is.

437
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,260
Miss Cui,

438
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,980
let's go listen to some music first

439
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,660
before taking a boat tour.

440
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,260
This is

441
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,300
where we are right now.

442
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,620
If anything happens,

443
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,540
we can take the route in the north.

444
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:43,860
Keep that in mind.

445
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,780
And here…

446
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,540
Hey, monk.

447
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,380
What are you thinking about?

448
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,020
Actually, I'm a little afraid.

449
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,460
Of what?

450
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,220
I'm afraid that the emperor of Nanxiao would break his promise.

451
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,100
After all, holding the junior Prince of Nanchen hostage,

452
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:04,860
it's no different

453
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,820
from controlling half of our country.

454
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,250
He wouldn't.

455
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:09,940
Why?

456
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,500
He can be cold-blooded

457
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,940
and skeptical of the people around him,

458
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,100
but he's an emperor

459
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,820
who cares about his people.

460
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,620
He wouldn't want his people

461
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,900
to suffer in a war.

462
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,420
It's easy to detain Zhousheng Chen,

463
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,700
but he can't afford to provoke

464
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,220
his army of 700,000 soldiers.

465
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,220
That's why he wouldn't do that.

466
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,580
You want to say

467
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,380
I know him well, don't you?

468
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,860
I don't dare to.

469
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,380
I don't want to upset you.

470
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:44,700
In fact, I've thought of a lot

471
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,180
comforting words.

472
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,300
But nothing seems useful.

473
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,620
How about I tell you something about my father?

474
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,980
My father

475
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,630
is actually not much better

476
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,180
compared to your father.

477
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,500
He took away

478
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,140
all my mother's money for medicine

479
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,340
and went to gamble.

480
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,260
None of our relatives offered help.

481
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,940
So in the end, I watched my mother die of illness

482
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,940
right in front of me.

483
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,540
Then one day,

484
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,340
I hid a wine jar

485
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,020
on the door.

486
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,740
When my father came home,

487
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,260
the jar fell and he was almost killed by it.

488
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,380
I was so afraid.

489
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,700
I was afraid that he'd beat me to death after he recovered,

490
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,180
so I ran away.

491
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,900
I kept running for a long time but was so tired and hungry

492
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,980
that I fell asleep on the roadside.

493
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,500
When I woke up,

494
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,420
I saw my master and my senior sister.

495
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,620
So I followed them.

496
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,380
I learned martial arts and became a soldier to protect my country.

497
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,220
I enjoy it so much!

498
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,940
Do you still hate him?

499
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,220
Who?

500
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,740
Your father.

501
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,100
I don't even care about him now.

502
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,020
He doesn't deserve my hatred.

503
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,020
I am

504
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,540
General Feng who

505
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,460
intimidates people now.

506
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,660
All I care about

507
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,380
is the citizens of the Western State.

508
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,140
Looks like you are

509
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,460
much more open-minded than I am.

510
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,420
You monks

511
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,340
believe in helping everyone, right?

512
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,820
Since you care about everyone,

513
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,620
what's the big deal if you hate the Emperor of Nanxiao?

514
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,300
That's true.

515
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,940
You are right.

516
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,740
Greetings, Mr. Huan.

517
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,340
Is this gentleman your friend?

518
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,820
My best friend.

519
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,460
Are you a couple?

520
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,220
No.

521
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,700
Then, are you

522
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,220
engaged, Miss?

523
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,620
I'm not.

524
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,900
My last name is Houmochen

525
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,180
and my given name is Yue.

526
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,300
Nice to meet you, Mr. Houmochen.

527
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,820
I'm…

528
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,820
Would I give away

529
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,460
my identity if I tell him my last name is Cui?

530
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,180
This lady is from the Nanchen Royal Mansion

531
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,640
in the Western State.

532
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,940
You mean the junior Prince of Nanchen's Mansion?

533
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,340
Yes.

534
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,740
It's such a pleasure to meet you!

535
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:10,980
I have some fine wine

536
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,780
that's over one hundred years old.

537
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,100
May I have the honor

538
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,140
to have a drink with you, Miss?

539
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,780
Since you have some fine wine,

540
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,500
why don't you share it

541
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,740
with all of us?

542
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,940
That's right, Mr. Houmochen.

543
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,260
Drinking fine wine alone is such a waste.

544
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,900
It'd be more fun to drink it with other people.

545
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,380
That's right. Mr. Houmochen,

546
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,380
don't hide it.

547
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,980
Share it with all of us!

548
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,420
-是啊
-Come on!
-Share it!

549
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,580
Alright, fine. I'll share it with you lot!

550
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,460
You greedy drinkers.

551
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,260
Thank you!

552
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,500
You are not afraid of giving your identity away?

553
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,700
We'll be leaving tomorrow.

554
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:56,860
It's okay.

555
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,260
I wonder if you

556
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,500
protect every disciple

557
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,900
of yours like this.

558
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:07,700
Of course.

559
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:15,040
During the reign of Taishi,

560
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,260
the people lived a happy life.

561
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,620
Ever since my dear left me,

562
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,860
I've missed him day and night.

563
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,220
Ever since my dear left me,

564
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,340
I've missed him day and night.

565
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,540
This is a folk song of the South.

566
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,140
The Qin master likes it,

567
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,260
so he plays it quite often.

568
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,380
But you don't

569
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,660
put too much thought into it.

570
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,420
Why not?

571
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,420
Ask him.

572
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,180
He asked me

573
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,740
the same question in the past.

574
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,130
"Ziye Songs of the Four Seasons"

575
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,640
is also known as "Ziye Songs of Wu".

576
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,390
The lady who wrote the songs was named Ziye.

577
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,140
Huan Yu.

578
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,440
Let the Qin master

579
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,920
play something elegant.

580
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,120
What's wrong

581
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,840
with Ziye Songs of Wu?

582
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,360
You are quite busy today.

583
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,400
People like to take a boat ride

584
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,920
when the weather is nice.

585
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,200
Mr. Huan.

586
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,240
-Mr. Huan.
-Mr. Huan.

587
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,440
You guys go ahead.

588
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,600
I got a carriage.

589
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,680
I'll wait for you on the other end.

590
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,760
Mr. Huan, you are not coming with us?

591
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,520
I…

592
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,600
I'm afraid of water.

593
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:44,800
Afraid of water?

594
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,960
Come on! Just go!

595
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,400
I'll wait for you in the south of the town.

596
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,400
Here. Be careful.

597
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,240
Mr. Huan.

598
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,280
You love taking a boat tour.

599
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,880
Why don't you go with them?

600
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,280
I don't want

601
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,760
to be a third wheel.

602
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,120

We are supposed to climb a mountain,

605
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,840
but we are taking a boat instead.

606

00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,400

00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,560
And one more.

682
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,200
Thank you.

683
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:46,720
Take care.

684
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,080
Have a taste.

685
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,360
Miss,

686
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,400
would you like a cornelian cherry pouch?

687
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,880
Pick one. It can ward off evil spirits.

688
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,680
Yes. It can ward off evil spirits.

689
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,640
Take a look.

690
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,360
Why don't you pick one too?

691
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,040
It's for ladies,

692
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,560
not for men.

693
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,200
Then what can he do to ward off evil spirits?

694
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,600
He can drink the Chrysanthemum Wine.

695
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,480
We'll have this one.

696
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,120
Oh, no!

697
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,600
Three coins. Only three coins.

698
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,520
We came from the North.

699
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,640
We don't have any local money.

700
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,480
This is all we have.

701
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,160
But,

702
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,560
it's too much! Too much!

703
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,000
Please take it.

704
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,280
You can go home

705
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,920
and enjoy the festival with this money.

706
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,800
Thank you!

707
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,000
Thank you so much!

708
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,200
Master, drink some more.

709
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,400
The ma'am said

710
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,320
it'd help ward off evil spirits.

711
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:37,920
Do you want some more?

712
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,520
Yes.

713
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,040
Drink mine then.

714
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,520
What about you?

715
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:49,960
I'll go buy another bottle.

716
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,200
Okay. Since it's Fortune Wine,

717
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,840
the more, the better.

718
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:09,540
[Longkang Academy]

719
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,400
Miss, you had Fortune Wine?

720
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,840
You can smell it?

721
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,160
Does it smell bad?

722
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,640
No. Chrysanthemum Wine smells very good.

723
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,000
His Highness will have a chat with my master.

724
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,400
He'll be back later.

725
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,720
I brewed some tea for you.

726
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,120
Please enjoy it, Miss.

727
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,000
Thank you!

728
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,480
You are welcome!

729
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,200
Hold on.

730
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,040
Have you ever heard

731
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,400
of "Ziye Songs of the Four Seasons"?

732
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,960
"Ziye Songs of Wu"?

733
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:45,640
Yes.

734
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,800
Why did my master take you to listen to that?

735
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,320
Is there something wrong with the song?

736
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,640
Some are okay.

737
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,400
But some of them have inappropriate lyrics,

738
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,640
like "Clean sheet is put on my bed,

739
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:02,680
inviting my beloved to come to my room.”

740
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,320
That wouldn't be proper for you.

741
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,640
I'll go back to work now.

742
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,680
Please take a rest.

743
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,520
“Clean sheet is put on my bed,

744
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,680
inviting my beloved to come to my room.”

745
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,400
That is improper!

746
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,320
Miss, we have a guest

747
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,320
who wants to see you.

748
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,440
I, Houmochen Yue,

749
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,680
didn't know who you were earlier

750
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,480
and offended you. I'm here to apologize to you.

751
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,680
You did nothing wrong.

752
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,760
Why do you apologize?

753
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,920
Because I didn't know who you were.

754
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,120
While having food at home,

755
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,440
my parents mentioned

756
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:50,880
that a guest from the Cui family presented

757
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,880
800 volumes of books to Nanxiao.

758
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Only then did I suddenly realize who you are.

759
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,680
My identity is not important,

760
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,920
and you don't have

761
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,240
to apologize for that.

762
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,760
Houmochen Yue,

763
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,040
you certainly need to apologize.

764
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,560
Not only that,

765
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,320
you also need to thank me for stopping you

766
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,120
from flirting with her.

767
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,720
Otherwise, you'd be in big trouble.

768
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,680
Neither His Majesty

769
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,280
nor her master,

770
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,600
the junior Prince of Nanchen,

771
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,960
would forgive you!

772
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,480
Thank you for that, Mr. Huan!

773
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,600
It's okay.

774
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,640
Miss Cui is not a petty person.

775
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,080
Just relax

776
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,160
and leave.

777
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,240
What? You have more to say?

778
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,360
Miss, I'm aware that you are

779
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,640
out of my league,

780
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,080
but I still wanna know

781
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,720
if you are engaged with someone.

782
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,200
You still won't give up?

783
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,920
You are asking me this

784
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,480
because my last name is Cui.

785
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,040
Since you ask me to tell you the truth,

786
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,560
you also need to be honest with me.

787
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,360
Yes. The Houmochen family

788
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,960
enjoys high prestige as well.

789
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,600
If I can marry a lady from the Cui family…

790
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,760
Houmochen Yue,

791
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,960
I advise you to sober up.

792
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,320
Miss Cui is the daughter of

793
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:15,320
the head of Wushui.

794
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,000
If she were to get married, the six clans would be her first choice.

795
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,240
The Liu royal family

796
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,840
and the Beichen aristocratic family would be her second choices.

797
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,560
She's way out of your league.

798
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,000
I'm asking Miss Cui here.

799
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,880
Whether you are engaged or not,

800
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,520
I just want an answer from you.

801
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,480
I'm not engaged with anyone.

802
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,600
But I already

803
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,640
have someone in my heart.

804
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,000
And I won't

805
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,120
change my mind.
