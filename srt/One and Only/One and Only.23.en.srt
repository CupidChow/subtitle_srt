In that case,

174
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,200
we'll

175
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,480
burn down the whole Eastern Palace

176
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,680
to have her join us in hell!

177
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,200
If you dare

178
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,160
harm my sworn sister,

179
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,080
I will cut you all into little pieces!

180
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,020
Your Highness!

181
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,500
The Eastern Palace is heavily guarded.

182
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,980
We have no way to get in.

183
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,820
I knew it.

184
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:49,820
How I wish I could

185
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,860
tear down this palace.

186
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,580
Prince of Pingqin.

187
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:01,820
I'm Yang Shao.

188
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,220
Yang Shao?

189
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,620
Jin Rong's dog.

190
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,660
I'm not here to fight you today.

191
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,540
I just want to give you a piece of advice.

192
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,900
Even if you stay,

193
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,180
you'll not be able to help her.

194
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,980
You would only get yourself killed.

195
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,260
I don't need you

196
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,220
to teach me what to do.

197
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,780
I don't want to talk too much

198
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,060
to an ignoramus either.

199
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,860
I was just trying to help His Highness

200
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,660
keep some strength of the royal army.

201
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,580
This is what I owe him.

202
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,700
Whose side are you on?

203
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,460
It doesn't matter which side I'm on.

204
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,860
I owe Miss Cui two lives.

205
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,780
I owe His Highness a debt of gratitude for not killing me.

206
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,260
If you believe me,

207
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,620
go out of the city for a few days

208
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,660
and wait for my message.

209
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,940
If you don't believe me,

210
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,780
I'll save

211
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,420
Miss Cui myself.

212
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,340
Slow down.

213
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,740
It's okay. It's okay.

214
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,460
Good wine.

215
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,820
Good wine!

216

You know what.

217
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,300
There was definitely something wrong with that carriage that day.

218
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,460
Yang Shao is very suspicious.

219
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,860
I'll go to the general tomorrow.

220
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,780
Yang Shao, I knew it was you!

221
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,540
What did you say?

222
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,260
He let Zhou Tianxing go?

223
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,620
We followed him out of the city

224
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,940
but Yuan Wuchu ambushed us.

225
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,060
All the men I took died.

226
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,540
Please punish me, Your Highness.

227
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:54,260
Get out!

228

You loser!

230
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,700
He insulted me,

231
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,140
and I have to crown his daughter as my empress.

232

The territory has already belonged to Your Majesty.

233

One day, these people

234

will be eliminated one by one.

I've never been friends with Jin Rong.

247
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,660
I wonder what the reason

248
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,020
for your visit is?

249
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:42,260
I've been entrusted by His Highness from the Western State,

250
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,860
to ask for your help, Lady Cui.

251
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,900
You've made up your mind?

252
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,500
From now on,

253
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,620
I'll leave Wushui to you.

254
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,900
After you return to Qinghe,

255
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,740
don't delay

256
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,820
and move south with them immediately.

257
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,180
Only the people and books matter.

258

As for the other things, just leave them behind.

260

Shiyi is still trapped in the palace.

261

Back then, for the sake of the Cui family,

262
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,620
I gave up on her father.

263
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:43,100
This time, I can't give up my own daughter

264
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,140
for the Cui family again.

265
00:25:59,140 --> 00:25:59,900

Thank you for taking care of me these days.

have ever treated you badly.

Now that you're leaving,

275
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,260
I have a favor to ask of you.

276
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,220
As long as I can.

277
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,140
I will do it.

278
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,420
I want to see my daughter.

279
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,620
Is that too much to ask for?

280

Zixing has been keeping

281
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,620
a very close eye on her.

282
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,180
Several times I have entered the palace,

283
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,660
but I have not been able to see her.

284
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,500
I will try to persuade him

285
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,100
to let you see each other.

286
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,540
Be patient, auntie.

I remember that.

345
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:57,660
I have invited

346
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,340
all the famous clans to the capital city.

347
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,340
If you need anything, let me know.

348
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:34,620
[I want my master, senior brothers and sisters to come to the capital city.]

349

Uncle led the troops far away from the border.

350
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,820
I'm afraid he won't be back in time.

351
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,820
I still have to see my ministers.

352
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:46,980
You should get some rest.

353
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,620
The Prince of Runan, Liu Cheng.

354
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,020
The Prefectural governor of Beiqing State, Lu Jun.

355
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,100
The Prefectural governor of Yiyang County, Lu Shida.

356
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,060
And

357
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,100
all the Nanjing State

358
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,590
have surrendered to Nanxiao.

359
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,740
Our border with Nanxiao

360
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,140
has collapsed.

361
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:29,740
We must take things

362
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,260
step by step.

363
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,860
Have some tea first

364
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,740
to moisten your throat.

365
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,060
What about Shouyang?

366
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,140
Shou...Shouyang...

367
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,500
Previously,

368
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:51,420
it'd been guarded by Cui Feng.

369
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,580
But now...

370
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,780
I ordered you to invite the famous clans to the capital city.

371
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,940
Did anyone respond?

372
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,820
I'm incompetent.

373
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,620
Zixing.

374
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,460
The reputation of Cui Wenjun in Wushui

375
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,700
is not accumulated overnight.

376
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,180
It's been built up over time.

377
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,820
If you want to win over those famous clans,

378
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,940
you must make up with Cui Wenjun.

379
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,140
He can't be trusted.

380
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,500
Tomorrow.

381
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,420
You go invite Cui Wenjun to the palace.

382
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:49,140
Tell her I have a favor to ask of her.

383
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

[Xiye Gate]

The Yang clan of Hongnong

386
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,380
is loyal and modest.

387
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,540
Disciples of theirs are all over the territory.

388
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:23,900
The Zhangsun clan of Jiyang

389
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,300
is holding the military power.

390
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,860
They are the only ones

391
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,060
who can suppress the rebels inside the Pass.

392

And the Yuwen clan

often lives in the northwest.

394

Their foundations are much deeper than the Jin clan.

395
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:36,300
These clans hold the military power.

396
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,500
They are the ones

397
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,060
Your Majesty must win over.

398
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,620
Can you help me

399

invite them to the capital city?

400
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,500
Candidates for all official positions in the court,

from the Counselor-in-chief to the Praetorian Guard,

can be recommended by you.

As long as you assist me,

the prestige of the Cui family

405

will only be better than it was before.

406

As for the Empress Jin,

407
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,820
I had no other choice.

408
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,300
I hope you can understand that.

409
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,940
In my heart,

00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,460
Shiyi is my real wife

411
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,260
and my only empress.

412
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,060
Then may I ask Your Majesty,

413
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,500
when will I be able to see Shiyi?

414
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,780
Your Majesty won't let anyone near her.

415
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,340
I can understand that.

416
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,460
But I am her mother.

417
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,140
Is Your Majesty worried that

418
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,540
I would harm my own

419
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,260
daughter?

420
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:04,620
I don't want her to find out about what happened in Pingyin.

421
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,220
Nowadays, everyone knows that

422
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,940
the Junior Prince of Nanchen

423
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,300
was executed for conspiracy.

424
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,340
If that is true,

425
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:15,980
Shiyi

426
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,100
will understand your decision.

427
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,580
Or is Your Majesty worried

428
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,700
she doesn't know right from wrong?

429
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,420
Shiyi is sentimental.

430
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,380
I'm afraid she can't bear this news.

431
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,660
She is sentimental,

432
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,620
but she knows loyalty better.

433
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,780
If you can help me

434
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,500
persuade her to accept this matter,

435
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,020

climb from the foot of the bed into the brocade quilt.

no one is allowed to turn their backs to His Majesty.

The same applies to getting off the state bed.

450
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,420
You should face His Majesty,

451

and slowly get off the bed from the bottom of the bed.

What's the use for me telling her the truth?

I've seen this country change hands too many times.
