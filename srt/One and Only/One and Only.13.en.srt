Houmochen Yue,

7
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,360
I advise you to sober up.

8
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,800
Miss Cui is the daughter

I just want an answer from you.

I'm not engaged with anyone.

18
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,240
But I already

19
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,720

20
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,200
And I won't

21
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,240

23
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,400
I hereby make a vow

24
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,240
to guard the border for the rest of my life.

25
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,200

27

Your Highness, are you sure?

28
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,720
Since I would have no child,

29
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,680
there will be no more reasons for me

30

to usurp power and plot a rebellion.

31

A life without a wife or children.

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,400
and stationed his army here.

170
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,160
He built a small tower

171
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,080
together with

172
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,760
a county lord of Nanxiao.

173
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,720
And then

174
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,400
he invited the chiefs of the western and northern

175
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,120
tribes of the Southwest Barbarians

176
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,800
to come to this small tower to make peace.

177
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:21,640
Frontier Settlement Tower.

178
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,160
Do you know it?

179
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,960
I've heard of it.

180
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,480
I heard

181
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,280
they decided the border according to the map that night.

182
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,720
The next day, the five of them destroyed the tower and left,

183
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,480
leaving behind a gentleman's pact

184
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,560
of non-confrontation for ten years.

185
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,880
Yes, yes.

186
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,120
That's it.

187
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,240
That tower

188
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,480
is built right there.

189
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,320
This time,

190
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,120
I had someone build a tower named Frontier Settlement Tower.

191
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,680
Unfortunately, they've already torn it down.

192
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,680
I should've brought you to see it.

193
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,760
Frontier Settlement Tower.

194
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,160
Settle the frontier for ten years of non-aggression.

195
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,160
You've done a great deed for the people.

196
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,060
Your gift for this year.

197
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,520
I have always been gifting you

198
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,640
birthday gifts.

199
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,760
But you haven't prepared

200
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,080
a single one for me.

201
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,800
The next time I come back,

202
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,840
try to call me Master, okay?

203
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,920
Or call me

204
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,600
Zhousheng Chen.

205
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,720
That's the flag of Nanchen Royal Army.

206
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,520
Welcome, Your Highness.

207
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,120
Y-Your Highness?

208
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,040
Your Highness, it's safe for you to get off the boat now.

209
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,130
Come.

210
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:28,680
Your Highness.

211
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,120
-Master!
-Master!

212
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,720
I heard you

213
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,560
crossed the river for me.

214
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,400
I heard that Your Highness

215
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,480
almost offended the Emperor of Nanxiao because of me.

216
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,040
Xie Yun.

217
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,400
If I hadn't broken my leg,

218
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,880
I would have welcomed you across the river.

219
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,960
Cui Feng is late.

220
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,360
I beg for your mercy, Your Highness.

221
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,560
Feng.

222
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,640
I'm glad you two got back safely.

223
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,080
I've already gathered my troops in Shouyang，

224
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,800
ready to cross the river to save you.

225
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,840
What happened to your leg?

226
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,440
What?

227
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,640
What's with that look on your face?

228
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,520
I heard

229
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,680
General Cui is the scholar in the royal army.

230
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,560
You sure are sentimental.

231
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,900
There's no need to be sentimental, Yun.

232
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,540
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

233
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,660
Seeing your leg like this

234
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,100
all of a sudden…

235
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,300
Since the royal army has arrived here,

236
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,060
why don't we go to Shouyang?

237
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,180
Let's go see

238
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,180
the city General Cui has guarded with his life.

239
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,380
That's good. I've never been there.

240
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,940
Okay, I'll go back and make arrangements.

241
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,820
Going to Shouyang

242
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,180
has been

243
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,580
Shiyi's wish for a long time.

244
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,940
As I have said,

245
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,060
Master loves Shiyi the most.

246
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,060
Your Highness.

247
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,660
Half of my village people

248
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,900
survived because the royal army escorted

249
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,020
us to move south for refuge.

250
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,700
Now that I have met Your Highness,

251
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,620
I have no regrets in my life.

252
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:28,460
Get up.

253
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,460
Thank you

254
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,820
for taking me across the river.

255
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,140
Your Highness.

256
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,140
Miss Huaiyang made this.

257
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,060
She said

258
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,180
you should eat noodles on your birthday

259
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,420
to ensure a long and peaceful life.

260
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,300
I'll heed her words.

261
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,900
For a long and peaceful life.

262
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,460
I'll have some now.

263
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,380
It smells so good.

264
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,260
It's delicious.

265
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,660
It's much better than what you people make.

266
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,700
Let me tell you.

267
00:17:01,859 --> 00:17:02,619
There must be a mistress

268
00:17:02,619 --> 00:17:03,940
in a mansion.

269
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:05,780
Even the noodles taste different.

270
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:07,420
Your Highness.

271
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,140
You're saying

272
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:09,420
shameless things again.

273
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:11,060
Miss Huaiyang is merely staying here for a short while.

274
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,060
How has she become

275
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,460
the mistress of the mansion?

276
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:16,700
Did she

277
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,020
say something?

278
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,500
Does she not like me?

279
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:22,700
Your Highness.

280
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,540
Although she has a difficult time now,

281
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,700
she is not someone ordinary.

282
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,540
Just look at the temperament and appearance

283
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,300
she has.

284
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,660
As for you, Your Highness.

285
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,540
You should take a look in the mirror.

286
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,500
You brat!

287
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,220
I've spoiled you lot!

288
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,320
You show no respect for me!

289
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,260
What look in the mirror?

290
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,780
Am I ugly?

291
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,100
Not really.

292
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,900
It's just that this mirror is too small

293
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,460
to show my whole face.

294
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:12,550
Your Highness.

295
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:14,980
Miss.

296
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,260
Miss.

297
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:23,660
Um.

298
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,940
I'm wondering,

299
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:25,860
last time I asked you

300
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,060
to find a place for me to stay,

301
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,180
are there any houses suitable?

302
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,740
No.

303
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,200
Within the place I govern,

304
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,540
there's not a single empty house

305
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,090
except for my mansion.

306
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:42,880
No.

307
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,060
Am I so terrible?

308
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,910
You don't even want to live in my place?

309
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,180
That is not my intention.

310
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,460
I just

311
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,540
don't want to trouble you.

312
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,940
I'm not troubled.

313
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,500
I haven't been in a relationship

314
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,300
for years!

315
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,820
I wish I could see you every day!

316
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:57,780
Every day, you…

317
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,300
I've already said

318
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,380
such shameless things.

319
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,820
I won't take it back.

320
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,700
You don't have a place to live for now.

321
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,800
So just live

322
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
in my mansion.

323
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,800
What if one day you find me

324
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,160
pleasing to your eye?

325
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,120
Well.

326
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,160
Um.

327
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,080
Someone!

328
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,400
Where are my men?

329
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:34,420
[General's House]

330
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,560
Shouyang is a small city.

331
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,200
My residence is even smaller.

332
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,440
Please forgive me.

333
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,400
We have distinguished guests here.

334
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,360
Why did you not inform me?

335
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:43,950
Uncle.

336
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,200
I didn't want to disturb you.

337
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,960
Are you afraid of disturbing my rest

338
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,350
or are you afraid I'll disturb my uncle?

339
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,200
The issue you and I are arguing about

340
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,240
hasn't come to a conclusion yet.

341
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,760
There's no need to tell His Highness now.

342
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,960
What are you afraid of?

343
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,880
My uncle is an elder.

344
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,840
He can help us to settle it.

345
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,720
Otherwise, I'm afraid

346
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,080
we won't get anywhere

347
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,080
even if we argue until next year.

348
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,200
Your Highness.

349
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,560
His Highness has just returned from Nanxiao...

350
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,480
General Cui,

351
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,980
take me to the Council Chamber.

352
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,600
Xinghua, please.

353
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,960
Your Highness, please come with me.

354
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,640
They don't look like a couple.

355
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,200
Was their relationship like this

356
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,680
in the past, at the Residence of Cui?

357
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,600
In our residence,

358
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:46,760
I lived alone in the academy,

359
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,880
apart from them.

360
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,280
It's said that being a princess' husband has been hard.

361
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,280
Don't discuss about

362
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,520
their marital issues.

363
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,760
Maybe

364
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,080
they just happen to be fighting

365
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,200
and we saw it.

366
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,310
Let's go in.

367
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,120
Let's go.

368
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,160
Tonight

369
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,470
I'll stay with you.

370
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,960
Are you worried about me?

371
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,960
You are his cousin

372
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,400
and also Master's disciple.

373
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,920
It's okay

374
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,000
for you to go in and listen.

375
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,080
I think the princess

376
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,840
is talking about official business,

377
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,320
not a personal matter.

378
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,040
So go listen to their discussion

379
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,280
for me and the advisor.

380
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,840
If there is something wrong,

381
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,400
we'll be able to deal with it.

382
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:44,680
Give it to me.

383
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,800
How could I have you serve tea?

384
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:48,200
You have no experience

385
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,160
serving His Highness.

386
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,920
Give it to me,

387
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,440
so you won't be punished for your mistakes.

388
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,000
Where are the maids in the mansion?

389
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,160
In the royal mansion,

390
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:06,920
it's been me

391
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,000
who serves tea and water for my master.

392
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,360
I'm afraid the maids won't do a good job.

393
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,800
Is what you just said

394
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,040
your intention

395
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,400
or Cui Feng's?

396
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:25,480
It's not my intention.

397
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,560
I don't want to go to the Central State.

398
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,120
You've been guarding Shouyang for so long.

399
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,640
You've done your duty.

400
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,320
Do you want to guard it for the rest of your life?

401
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:37,840
Yes.

402
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,920
I'm going to guard it for the rest of my life.

403
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,720
I'm more attached to Shouyang

404
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,320
than I am to the Cui family

405
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,880
and the Western State.

406
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,840
I've been guarding this city

407
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,400
since I joined the army.

408
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,560
Before I married you,

409
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,160
I had made a vow

410
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,760
to guard this city

411
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,200
until I couldn't draw my sword

412
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,560
or get on my horse.

413
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,760
So, is Shouyang more important

414
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,920
than your future child?

415
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,960
What did you just say?

416
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,920
I grew up in the Central State,

417
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,560
so I can't stand the enviroment here.

418
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,120
No matter what,

419
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,320
I have to go back!

420
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,680
I'll take my leave.

421
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,280
Your Highness, how could you say that?

422
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,480
How would you explain it?

423
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,560
The imperial doctor will know

424
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,120
if you're pregnant once he examines you.

425
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,600
I must return to the Central State.

426
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,160
I've been with you since I was a child.

427
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,920
I know what you're thinking.

428
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:45,720
But now

429
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,960
you've married someone outside the capital.

430
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,120
Why do you cling to

431
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,560
that man in the Central State?

432
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,680
He sent me a letter.

433
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:55,720
If I can go back,

434
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,920
I'll be able to get rid of

435
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,360
this arranged marriage.

436
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,920
That's why you must help me.

437
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:01,760
No matter what,

438
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:03,720
make the imperial doctor say that I'm pregnant.

439
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,040
Although your husband doesn't love you,

440
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,800
he has always treated you with respect.

441
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,680
Why don't you

442
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,920
treat him with care?

443
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,200
With your intelligence,

444
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,440
it's not hard to make your husband fall in love with you.

445
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:19,240
He's a good man.

446
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,000
But I...

447
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:22,400
But...

448
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,620
Sir.

449
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,680
You are with the princess every day.

450
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,000
You should know

451
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,080
she can't be pregnant with my child.

452
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:36,520
I…

453
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,920
This child...

454
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,640
I've treated you coldly after the wedding.

455
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,200
That was what led to this scandal.

456
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,520
I will write a letter

457
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,800
to report it to Empress Dowager Qi and my aunt.

458
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,640
For the sake of both our families' reputation,

459
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,880
the child's surname must be “Cui”.

460
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,040
I won't ask

461
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,320
who the father of the child is.

462
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,440
After the child is born,

463
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,600
I am fine

464
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,320
if you want a divorce

465
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,400
or to continue to live in

466
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:26,880
the Residence of Cui in the Central State.

467
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,240
General.

468
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,320
You and I were both toyed by fate

469
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,120
and ended up in this marriage.

470
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:38,440
In the future,

471
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:42,280
I'll be in Shouyang and you in the Central State.

472
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,440
We don't have to meet ever again.

473
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,800
General.

474
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,600
I'm sorry.

475
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,400
Feng.

476
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,240
You've made up your mind?

477
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,480
Yes.

478
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,200
I'll send the princess back to the Central State first.

479
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,760
Then I'll come back when she's settled.

480
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,880
Go in.

481
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,520
Don't keep His Highness waiting.

482
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,920
Since you're here,

483
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,760
it's better if you tell them yourself.

484
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,080
The princess is pregnant.

485
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,560
I have decided to send the princess

486
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,760
back to the Central State for the fetus's safety.

487
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,240
Congratulations, General Cui.

488
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,440
Congratulations.

489
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,880
Thank you all.

490
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,040
In that case,

491
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,040
we'll have to replace

492
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,040
Shouyang's general.

493
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:04,880
No need to do that.

494
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,480
I'll send the princess back to the Central State

495
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,000
and find a way to come back.

496
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,040
General Cui, it's not that simple.

497
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:14,720
If you leave the princess alone in the capital,

498
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,440
even if the princess won't complain,

499
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,360
the empress dowager and the Qi family

500
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,880
will come after you.

501
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,000
But

502
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,360
I can't leave here for too long.

503
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,880
I'm the only one who knows this place.

504
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,720
The advisor is right.

505
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,760
You go back to the capital first.

506
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,320
We'll discuss the date of your return later on.

507
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:36,940
Xiaoyu.

508
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,320
You were once stationed here

509
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:40,520
together with General Cui.

510
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,280
You know the place better.

511
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,360
Stay here for the time being.

512
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,600
Yes, Your Highness.

513
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,520
General Hong.

514
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:54,880
I'm entrusting you

515
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,760
with Shouyang.

516
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,400
Don't worry, General Cui.

517
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,920
As long as I'm alive,

518
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,600
Shouyang will never fall.

519
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:36,380
[General's House]

520
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,080
Feng.

521
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,080
Although I joined

522
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,960
the Nanchen Royal Army,

523
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,840
I didn't live in the Western State

524
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,640
for a long time.

525
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:48,760
On the contrary, Shouyang

526
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,880
is more like my second hometown.

527
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:52,960
I know.

528
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,410
You've put your heart and soul into Shouyang.

529
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,720
It's okay.

530
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,120
After the princess has given birth,

531
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,000
find a chance to come back.

532
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:09,560
The first time I came to Shouyang,

533
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,120
it's when His Highness had just recaptured the city.

534
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,680
I came with Xiaoyu

535
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,240
and we lived here for three years

536
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,660
before she left.

537
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:22,960
I'm sorry

538
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,880
to upset you too.

539
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,960
You've kept these things to yourself

540
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,520
with no one to say it to.

541
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,720
I'm the only one you can talk to about this.

542
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,840
Since I'm here, you should get it all out.

543
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,920
It's useless to talk too much.

544
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,750
Tell General Hong

545
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,560
that if there are any good reports,

546
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,280
send that information to the Residence of Cui in the Central State.

547
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,280
Only after reading the good news,

548
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,360
will I be at ease.

549
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,880
Master.

550
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:19,960
Your Highness.

551
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,800
You have to hand over the military power

552
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:22,880
and it's a troublesome matter.

553
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,480
Don't treat us like guests.

554
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,240
Just go.

555
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,320
Yes.

556
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,920
I'm going out for a walk.

557
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,520
I wanted to let you

558
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:54,240
spend some days with your cousin together

559
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:55,520
in Shouyang

560
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,120
so that you can relax.

561
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,100
I didn't expect

562
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,580
it made you even more upset.

563
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,180
I have a question for you.

564
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,500
Go ahead.

565
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,900
If two people really love each other,

566
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,420
but they can't be together

567
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,700
for various reasons.

568
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,620
Though they know they should let go, they just can't.

569
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,780
What should they do?

570
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,580
Master.

571
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,260
You don't know what to do either, do you?

572
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,540
Huan Yu asked me

573
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:36,980
the same question

574
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:37,940
at the academy.

575
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,820
He asked

576
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,980
if I regretted the vow I made when I was young,

577
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,500
to take no wife and have no children.

578
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,700
I didn't know how to answer that.

579
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,340
But on the river,

580
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,580
the boatman's words made me think that

581
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,500
whether I regret it or not,

582
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,580
every choice I made

583
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,180
is worth it.

584
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:26,100
[Taiji Palace]

585
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,100
[Jiafu Palace]

586
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:34,860
Come on.

587
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,220
Here, take it.

588
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,700
Don't look at them.

589
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,100
General.

590
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,780
Whenever Empress Dowager Qi feels happy,

591
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,420
she would ask us to pick up the pearls.

592
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,540
General, we're all discontented

593
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,860
that you're stopping us.

594
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,380
Just

595
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,380
turn a blind eye

596
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:01,210
to it today.

597
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,900
Even if you won't take it,

598
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,760
you can't stand in our way

599
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,980
to get rich.

600
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:12,420
-General.
-Don't let me catch you.

601
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,370
We're saying this all for your own good.

602
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,940
If you don't reward them,

603
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,540
how can you convince the people?

604
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,870
What great things can

605
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,800
a general who can't convince the people do?

606
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,180
-That's right.
-That's right.

607
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:22,930
General.

608
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,500
All of you, leave.

609
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,300
Yes, Your Majesty.

610
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,660
General Qin.

611
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,100
Come in.

612
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,620
I'll make a toast to you.

613
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,900
Come.

614
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,500
Thank you, Your Majesty.

615
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,060
You can hold your liquor! Have another shot!

616
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:32,780
Men.

617
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,380
Yes, Your Majesty.

618
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,980
These jewels on the ground.

619
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,420
They are all yours.

620
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,739
Thank you, Your Majesty!

621
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:47,139
Your Majesty, you must not indulge them like this.

622
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,500
You prevented your men from receiving the reward.

623
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,340
Aren't you afraid that

624
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,460
they will hate you?

625
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,180
I...

626
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:05,820
They used to be Liu Yuan's soldiers

627
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,530
and they have already gotten used to such things.

628
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:13,460
They are no match for your Nanchen Royal Army.

629
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,540
To rule over your subordinates,

630
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:20,940
you need to find the right way.

631
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,420
General.

632
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,460
Her Majesty said

633
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,420
you could leave on your own

634
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,700
when you wake up.

635
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,470
Yesterday…

636
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,970
You were drunk last night

637
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,810
and slept here.

638
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:50,270
Qin Yan.

639
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,340
Look at His Majesty…

640
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,940
Qin Yan?

641
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,180
Why are you so distracted?

642
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,300
I...

643
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:05,900
It's nothing.

644
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,060
I asked you to guard the empress dowager's chambers.

645
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,380
You must have seen

646
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,100
things that you shouldn't have seen.

647
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,300
I was wrong to trust others

648
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,180
and imprisoned her for three years.

649
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,780
I can't help but feel guilty.

650
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,060
I can't control

651
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,580
the many absurd things

652
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,100
she does in the palace.

653
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,340
General, please

654
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,580
bear with it.

655
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,580
This is

656
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,420
my duty.

657
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,420
Your Majesty.

658
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:48,260
Concubine Jiang.

659
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,340
Didn't the imperial doctor tell you to rest and recuperate?

660
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:52,860
You only need to send a maid

661
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,380
and I will go over to your place.

662
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,740
Your Majesty is the emperor.

663
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:57,860
How can you let me

664
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,060
order you around?

665
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,780
I'm your husband

666
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,460
as well as his father.

667
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,900
Present the gift.

668
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:08,980
What gift?

669
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,060
Is it for me?

670
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,900
It's not.

671
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:16,940
This…

672
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:18,980
Grand Mentor Xi will be celebrating

673
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,100
his 70th birthday.

674
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,740
I ordered someone to make this.

675
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,100
Your Highness,

676
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,620
I can't accept

677
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,900
such an expensive gift.

678
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:30,420
When my son is born,

679
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:33,220
you can use this to discipline him.

680
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,700
I wouldn't dare to.

681
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:35,700
Besides,

682
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,180
I can't get myself to do that.

683
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,060
His parents are willing to do so.

Congratulations, General.

If you become a marquis in the future,

689
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,340
don't forget about us.

690

Wait.

All of you stay here.

You're making things difficult for us, General.

I beg Your Majesty

to spare my life.

and responsible for the security of the palace.

Why would I

702
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,980
spare your life?

703
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,220
I should thank you

704
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,900
for watching over me day and night.

705
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:26,060
What must I do for you

to let me go?

707
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,250

the troops you have.

If you become my man,

and have power in the palace.

Why would you not want this?

General Qin.

I'm not willing to

715

do something against my conscience.

Then do you wish to die?

Outside this door

Last time I was here,

723
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,860
the hall here had been completed.

724
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,060
The person who first found this place

725
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,140
was Tianxing.

726
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,660
The last time he left you

727
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:58,780
and the barracks,

728
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,020
he came here.

[Azure Dragon Temple]

730
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,380
The name is nice.

731
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,900
It was Master's idea.

732
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,420
It was Shiyi's idea.

733
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:10,740
I was

734
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:11,700
merely speaking for her.

735
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,540
No wonder Shiyi wanted to

736
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,300
hide the dowry here.

737
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,700
Go up the mountain now.

738
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,100
I'll wait at the foot of the mountain.

Let me carry you.
