[Episode 18]

4
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,920
You still blame me

5
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:37,720
for that matter.

6
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,520
No.

7
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:43,720
I just can't understand you.

8
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,280
You're my own child.

9
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,360
However,

10
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,000
you prefer trusting others

11
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,800
over trusting me.

12
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:55,400
When your great grandpa ascended the throne at five,

13
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,600
the empress dowager at that time held court.

14
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,360
And they ruled

15
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,080
in harmony.

16
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,360
If they could do that,

17
00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:05,320
then why can't the two of us

18
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:07,280
do the same?

19
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,720
Over the years,

20
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,360
you've tried very means

21
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,079
to gather toy-boys in the palace,

22
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,079
and I just ignored it.

23
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,240
After Zhao Teng's plot,

24
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,240
I didn't want to get involved

25
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,840
in your private life.

26
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,840
However, you emptied the treasury

27
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,800
to fund your lavish lifestyle.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,040
The Qi family merely sit on the fence,

29
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,120
while they persecute the faithful and honest.

30
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,480
I can't ignore it.

31
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,520
Hui,

32
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,960
without me,

33
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,360
you would have died.

34
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,240
I'm from the Qi family.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,280
What if you give

36
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,800
your uncles more freedom?

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,360
I don't want to betray my people.

38
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,160
Well said.

39
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:08,760
Come on.

40
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,079
Why don't you pick up the cup?

41
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,360
Do you fear I'll poison you?

42
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,760
Drink it. There's no poison.

43
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,040
I wouldn't do that.

44
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,880
You're my own son.

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,480
At worst,

46
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,720
I'd force you to abdicate.

47
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,640
You should not drink it.

48
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,760
Why?

49
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,600
The imperial doctor said

50
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,560
you shouldn't drink these days.

51
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:14,040
I would like to abdicate.

52

drink this cup of wine for me.

57
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,840
Haven't you tried this wine before?

64

put poison into the wine.

He dares not.

He is not afraid of me,

but his old master, the Junior Prince of Nanchen.

120
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,240
I guess he went south

does this belong to Grand Mentor Xie?

149

Yes, it is.

150
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,680
Why do you have this?

151
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,600
Someone threw this into the Residence of Cui

wrapped in a brocade handkerchief,

153

saying it belonged to Grand Mentor Xie

and that you would know it if you saw it.

155

there's been an accident in the palace and you should be careful.

the atmosphere strange at the city gate.

00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,440
as if on guard.

Lady Cui,

163
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,400
a chamberlain came here

and said he would take Her Highness and Her Ladyship into the palace

165
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,600
to celebrate the birth of the prince.

166
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,440
It's reasonable for the princess to enter the palace.

But why should Shiyi go too?

168
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,920
That chamberlain said that

169
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,800
the Prince of Guangling grew up in the palace

170
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,840
and there were deep feelings between His and Her Majesty.

171
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,800
Her Majesty has always regarded

172
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,280
the Prince of Guangling as her own son,

173
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,240
so to celebrate the birth of the prince,

174
00:13:59,400 --> 00:13:59,880
she will naturally ask

175
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,240
the Princess of Guangling to go

176
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,960
and enter the palace to celebrate together.

177
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,320
Please prepare a generous gift for me to bring

178
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,440
before I enter the palace for the celebration.

179
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,560
This is the empress dowager's imperial edict.

180
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,720
No one can act against it.

181
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,760
Mother, don't worry.

182
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,240
I'll take things as they come.

183

[Residence of Grand Mentor]

184
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,080
Shiyi,

185
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,680
why won't you come with me?

186
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,680
People are celebrating

187
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,280
the birth of the new prince.

188
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,040
They have long forgotten that

189
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,360
Zixing is the crown prince.

190
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,400
Life is most unpredictable.

191
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,880
Shiyi,

192
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,040
he suffers in the palace

193
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,040
to win the throne and marry you.

194
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,200
Be nice to him.

195
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,000
As long as you treat him well,

196
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,000
I'll try my best to fight for you.

197
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,240
I don't think

198
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,560
I heard what you said.

199
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,440
You can't say it again in the future.

200
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,720
Even if you are a princess,

201
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,320
you can't say that.

202
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,640
Zixing.

203
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,360
Your Highness.

204
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,440
Your Highness.

205
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,400
Shiyi, I'll take you to the palace.

206
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,360
Her Majesty is giving a banquet,

207
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,960
accompanied by the imperial concubines.

208
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,520
It is inconvenient for me to attend the banquet.

209
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,360
So I'll leave after I take you in.

210
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,040
Thank you, Your Highness.

211
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,880
Have you ever seen the little prince?

212
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,400
Her Majesty was very nervous

213
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,840
when the eldest son of His Majesty was born

214
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,520
and took care of him in person in her chamber.

215
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,640
Even the prince's biological mother never saw him,

216
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,080
let alone anyone else.

217
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,280
People have died before in every palace here.

218
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,440
So it's much colder

219
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,000
than outside the palace.

220
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:10,160
The Cui family pay attention to etiquette and law.

221
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,599
Are you

222
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,599
doing this just to me,

223
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,280
or are you doing this to everyone?

224
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,800
Let's go.

225
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,480
Don't keep the empress dowager waiting.

226
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,800
Shiyi,

227
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,280
the relationships

228
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,840
between people

229
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,640
are really unpredictable.

230
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,960
Your cousin is the prefectural governor in Taiyuan

231
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,680
in order to monitor my father,

232
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,240
but you and I drink happily at this banquet

233
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,760
in the palace.

234
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,120
So you are Honored Concubine Jin.

235
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,440
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

236
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,760
I have doubts in my heart.

237
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,480
I want to ask you something.

238
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,000
Go ahead.

239
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,080
His Majesty sent Cui Feng

240
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,000
to be the prefectural governor of Taiyuan County.

241
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,880
Was there a verbal command

242
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,640
to kill my father at any time?

243
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,840
The prefectural governor of state and county

244
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,320
is not just a supervisory role.

245
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,600
It also has the duty of dispatching troops and horses

246
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,480
to suppress

247
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,680
rebellions by local vassals or princes.

248
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,760
The thirteen prefectural governors

249
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,720
including my cousin in thirteen counties

250
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,240
are the same.

251
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,600
I think as long as General Jin

252
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,480
is loyal to His Majesty,

253
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,120
my cousin

254
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,800
will never use military power without authorization.

255
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,120
Thank you.

256
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,800
Get some rest.

257
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,320
The honored concubine drank a lot tonight.

258
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,680
How can she see His Majesty?

259
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,680
His Majesty dotes on Concubine Jiang only

260
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,440
and rarely summons other concubines,

261
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,760
especially Honored Concubine Jin.

262
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,800
It is well known in the palace that

263
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,320
she is not at peace with His Majesty.

264
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,920
Since Concubine Jiang gave birth to a son,

265
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,040
no concubine can see His Majesty.

266

[Jiafu Palace]

What are you looking at? Do you not want to keep your head?

268
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,200
What's going on?

269
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,400
Something big.

270
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,920
His Majesty

271
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,680
passed away.

272

My son

273
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,960

-His Majesty.

After shaving your heads,

277
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,160
you can temporarily live in the palace

278
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,640
and chant scriptures

279
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,160
for His Majesty.

280
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,760
I don't want to shave my head.

281
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,960
I had already guessed that

282
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,280
you would be the only one in His Majesty's harem

283
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,880
who will disobey me.

284
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,520
I have also guessed that

285
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,640
among the imperial concubines in the harem,

286
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,920
you dare not touch me alone.

287
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,960
Among the thirteen counties in the empire,

288
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,200
the Western State has the most troops and horses,

289
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,080
followed by Taiyuan County.

290
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,920
My father is never at the mercy of others.

291
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,520
You want me to cut my hair,

292
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,200
so that I can be trapped justifiably

293
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,360
in the palace

294
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,040
and you can use me to threaten my father.

295
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,880
Of all those in the harem,

296
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,720
you really are the smartest.

297
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,080
Unfortunately,

298
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,960
your man, my son,

299
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,000
is now the late emperor.

300
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,920
Send the concubines to the nunnery.

301
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,400
I'm afraid your marriage with Zixing

302
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,680
will be delayed.

303
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,640
His Majesty passed away, and all the people are grieving.

304
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,320
How dare I talk about marriage again?

305
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,760
Then you can

306
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,000
stay with me in the palace for a while.

307
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,840
It's my honor, Your Majesty.

308
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,560
Not really.

309

You are the only daughter of Cui Wenjun,

and the disciple of the Junior Prince of Nanchen.

313
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,520
That's why

314
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,160
I want you to stay in the palace.

315
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,400

[Taiji Palace]

When His Majesty was six years old,

318
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,840
I took his hand

319
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,240
and walked into Taiji Palace.

320
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,480
Now suddenly

321
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,480
he passed away,

322
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,240
but I'm still here.

323
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,560
Your Majesty, if you are sad,

324
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,560
you might as well go back to your chamber to have a rest.

325

and three of the royal family

328
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,040
worked together

329
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,800
to help His Majesty ascend the throne overnight,

330
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,000
which helped determine the overall situation.

331
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,640
Uncle told me about it.

332
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,920
It was a dangerous night.

333
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,320
If they were careless,

334
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,000
they would lose everything.

346
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,520
Ask him if he can enter the capital alone

347
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,480
as he did before

348
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,600
and kowtow to the new emperor

349
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,600
in front of all the officials.

350
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,600
Why are you not writing it?

351
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,760
I can't write it.

352
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,520
Why can't you write it?

353
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,280
Please find another person to do this for you.

354
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,480
I must not

355
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,200
write this letter.

356
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,760
Tell me what you're afraid of.

357
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,480
What do you fear

358
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,240
from a mere letter?

359
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,200
Are you afraid that Zhousheng Chen

360
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,680
will recognize your handwriting,

361
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,680
and venture into the city out of concern?

362
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,640
Do you two

363
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,000
really love each other secretly

364
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,080
as rumored?

365
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,360
Master treated all the eleven disciples

366
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,560
like relatives.

367
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,160
If my elders were asked

368
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,600
to write this letter today,

369
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,640
as long as Master recognized the handwriting,

370
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,880
he would come to save them for sure.

371
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,600
But if on this day,

372
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,120
my elders were to be present,

373
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,400
then absolutely no one would

374
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,520
do such a thing,

375
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,040
that would put Master at risk.

376
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,960
You're not afraid to die, huh?

377
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,360
Leave it to Your Majesty.

378
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,720
You're trying

379
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,480
to conceal

380
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,560
your love for him.

381
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,880
The Junior Prince of Nanchen

382
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,080
is really untidily romantic.

383
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,120
Shiyi,

384
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,920
your uncle saved me twice,

385
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,400
so I won't kill you.

386
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,760
Come here.

387
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,200
If my father finds out

388
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,240
you treated me like this,

389
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,840
he'll kill you all.

390
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,960
Your Highness, calm down.

391
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:57,880
Other concubines

392
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,440
have been sent to a nunnery

393
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,560
and only you're still here,

394
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,680
which shows Her Majesty's

395
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,280
special care for you.

396
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,960
Her Majesty's care for me?

397
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,520
She's just afraid of my father.

398
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,640
Your Highness, as you were a child,

399
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,680
you might not know

400
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,400
the Empress Gao's brother

401
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,400
had more troops than your father.

402
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,640
But what happened in the end?

403
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,360
He was killed

404
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,120
on a narrow path in the palace.

405
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,640
It's exactly that one you just passed by.

406
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,480
You're honored women.

407
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,040
As long as you don't hurt yourselves,

408
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,400
no one can do that to you.

409
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,360
Close the door.

410
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,400
How did Empress Dowager Gao's brother die

411
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,640
at that time back then?

412
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,080
After His Majesty ascended the throne,

413
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,040
he was tricked into the palace

414
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,320
by Her Majesty Empress Dowager.

415
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,280
On a path in the palace,

416
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,920
he was surrounded

417
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,480
and strangled by soldiers.

418
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,480
Does Her Majesty want

419
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,440
to deal with my father or your master

420
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,120
using this old trick?

421
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,280
Your Majesty.

422
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,680
How is the situation outside the palace?

423
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,000
The city people are still taking part in the grand ceremony.

424
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,240
It's very crowded and lively.

425
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,760
Hasn't Counselor-in-chief come?

426
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,640
He's on his way.

427
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,960
Close the gate.

428
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,560
Without my instructions,

429
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,720
no one enters the Central State.

430
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,600
Yes.

431
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:10,300
[Central State]

432
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:19,740
[Central State]

433
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,400
Move it, now.

434
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,720
This is His Excellency Counselor-in-chief's carriage.

435
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,320
You're surrounded.

436
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,440
Who are you?

437
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,560
Nanchen Royal Army.

438
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,620
[Xuanguang Palace]

439
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,400
How boring.

440
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,480
Your Highness,

441
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,320
you don't seem sad about His Majesty's death.

442
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,280
He didn't have me in his heart,

443
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,120
so I am not sad.

444
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,120
But you held a wedding witnessed by heaven and earth

445
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,480
and consummated your marriage.

446
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:11,760
Do you have no special feeling

447
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,560
for His Majesty?

448
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,080
As he was the emperor,

449
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,160
I married him.

450
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,800
We consummated our marriage

451
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,360
as I wanted to have a son

452
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,680
and be the Empress Dowager.

453
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,600
He has feelings

454
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,680
for Concubine Jiang,

455
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,080
but I had no feelings for him.

456
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,720
My father

457
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,400
will control the whole country

458
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,280
sooner or later.

459
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,200
By then,

460
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,920
he'll be close to death.

461
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,040
It seems

462
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,200
we can only

463
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,720
be allies tonight.

464
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,440
Yes.

465
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,720
You and I are destined to be mortal enemies later.

466
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,800
But before that,

467
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,240
we should first manage to come out of this alive.

468
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,440
Your Highness.

469
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,440
Your Excellency has a clear conscience.

470
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,920
Why do you kneel down?

471
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:25,720
I,

472
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,680
I finally got to see you, Your Highness.

473
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,480
We'll be saved.

474
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,800
Qi Zhenzhen wants

475
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,720
to command vassals with her grandson.

476
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,760
No.

477
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,920
In fact, the baby

478
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,520
wasn't His Majesty's son.

479
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,840
Didn't Concubine Jiang give birth to a son?

480
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,080
Yes, she did,

481
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,560
but the baby died that night.

482
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,840
To keep it a secret,

483
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,880
Her Majesty killed

484
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,000
29 people in Concubine Jiang's living palace,

485
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,040
including the imperial doctors, palace maids and chamberlains.

486
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,720
She even killed Concubine Jiang.

487
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,400
I was forced to,

488
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,239
so I didn't dare to resist.

489
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,920
Your Excellency's family is safe in your residence.

490
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,760
Don't say that.

491
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,520
No.

492
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,719
She...

493
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,000
My master doesn't want to look into it.

494
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,920
If you do as he says,

495
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,600
you'll have a chance to redeem your crime in due course.

496
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,199
I'd like to follow Your Highness's orders.

497
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,040
From tonight on,

498
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:30,320
they will follow you

499
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,400
wherever you go.

500
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,560
OK, OK.

501
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,679
What will

502
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,000
she do next?

503
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,840
Help the new emperor ascend the throne and hold court.

504
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,760
Since she wants the new emperor to ascend the throne,

505
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,800
help her do it.

506
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,040
Um...

507
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:51,679
We should let

508
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,160
a non-existent prince ascend the throne?

509
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:53,720
Yes.

510
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,160
Do you still remember

511
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,480
how Liu Yuan was executed?

512
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:57,920
Yes, surely.

513
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,600
Yes, surely.

514
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,080
Do everything as I said.

515
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,200
Don't have an ulterior motive,

516
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,560
or you'll be the first person

517
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,240
who goes to accompany His Majesty.

518
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,760
I'll atone for my past crimes

519
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,080
and act at your command.

520
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,920
Uncle, thank you

521
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,080
for guarding the frontier for my father these past years.

522
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,760
There is a patterned sword and an axe decorated with gold for you.

523
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,200
In the future, report to me at any time you want.

524
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,880
You can go to court by sedan

525
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,280
and enter the hall with a sword.

526
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,200
I only have the wooden sword

527
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,880
Your Majesty gave me with me today.

528
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,480
As your uncle,

529
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,240
I think

530
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,160
you are more important than the throne.

531
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:13,960
Uncle.

532
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,920
Sorry for not

533
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,960
keeping you safe.

534
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:30,180
[Taiji Palace]

535
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,080
Your Majesty.

536
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,320
Your Majesty.

537
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,440
Your Majesty.

538
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,320
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

539
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,280
Your Majesty. Why did

540
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,080
you die so young?

541
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,560
Your Majesty.

542
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,240
Your Majesty.

543
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,280
Your Majesty.

544
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,040
Your Majesty.

545
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,840
Your Majesty.

546
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,360
Your Majesty.

547
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,880
Your Majesty.

548
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,040
Our country can't be without an emperor.

549
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,200
Though His Majesty passed away,

550
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,240
he left

551
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,840
a newly-born son for us.

552
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,160
I think we should

553
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,880
help him ascend the throne

554
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,040
to stabilize the court and appease the people.

555
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,520
Your Majesty.

556
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,200
Your Majesty Empress Dowager,

557
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,760
it concerns the security of our kingdom.

558
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,800
If the newly-born prince

559
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,200
ascends the throne,

560
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,920
I'm afraid the vassals will resist and stir up great turmoil.

561
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,440
Your Majesty, please think it over.

562
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,080
It's common for a young prince to ascend the throne in our dynasty.

563
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,400
Emperor Gaozu ascended the throne at 5,

564
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,960
and the late emperor at 6.

565
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,920
Both of them were assisted by the empress dowager.

566
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,360
Why can't it work that way now?

567
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,600
Not exactly.

568
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,840
Your Majesty,

569
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,200
it was a temporary expedient

570
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,960
for the late emperor to ascended the throne at 6.

571
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,080
The Gao family monopolized the court affairs back then.

572
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,880
If the late emperor didn't ascend the throne,

573
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,160
then the Central State

574
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,760
would be controlled by the Gao family for sure.

575
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,880
We're not in imminent danger.

576
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,880
Why don't we

577
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,240
choose a man of the right age

578
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,200
from the royal family to be the heir?

579
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,120
The late emperor's remains are scarcely cold yet.

580
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,480
His newly-born son is crying in my chamber.

581
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,160
But you can't wait

582
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,040
to support another now.

583
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,160
Without any selfish motives,

584
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,080
I just think of the interests of our country.

585
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,520
Don't make excuses to me.

586
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,000
Explain to Her Majesty.

587
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,160
Your Majesty.

588
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,400
Prepare for the enthronement.

589
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,720
Yes.

590
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:44,740
[Mingguang Palace]

591
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,840
The Cui family's opposition

592
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,080
upsets me a lot.

593
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,160
After the enthronement, everything will be settled.

594
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,080
It's useless

595
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,200
even if the Cui family opposes us

596
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,000
together with other prominent families.

597
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,560
But we

598
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,880
can't hide the baby's not existing

599
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,800
for long.

600
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,520
Do you still remember

601
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,800
the deceased Prince of Lintao

602
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,160
has a 5-year-old son

603
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,240
named Liu Zizhen?

604
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,280
Besides Zhousheng Chen,

605
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,920
he's the clansman most closely

606
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,000
related to the late emperor.

607
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,240
I'll bring him into the palace tomorrow.

608
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,760
Your Majesty, after this matter,

609
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,360
you can make an edict to the public that

610
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,880
you were tricked by Concubine Jiang

611
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,080
into believing her pregnancy

612
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:22,960
and so put

613
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,320
all the blame on her.

614
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,560
But she already died.

615
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,200
People outside the palace don't know it.

616
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:30,920
Then you can make an edict

617
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,800
sentencing Concubine Jiang to death

618
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,640
and letting Liu Zizhen ascend the throne.

619
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,920
In this way, you can convince

620
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,880
the officials and vassals.

621
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,720
A 5-year-old child

622
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,320
is at your mercy.

623
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,680
I'm afraid the old officials

624
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,400
wouldn't believe such an absurdity.

625
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,080
I'm behind you.

626
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,800
Send Liu Zizhen to the palace.

627
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,880
Yes.

628
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,880
You're worried about Shiyi?

629
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,600
Shiyi is in the imperial palace...

630
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,560
Her Majesty knows

631
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,440
she can hold back many forces at play,

632
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,920
so she won't be in immediate danger.

633
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,280
If so, why are you

634
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,760
still worried?

635
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,280
Go to the Residence of Cui.
