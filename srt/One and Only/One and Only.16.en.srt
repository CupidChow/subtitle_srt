3
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,160
Have you ever been outside the Pass?

4
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,479
Yes.

5
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:46,800
The scenery's beautiful there.

6
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,280
Next spring,

7
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,840
I'll take you to Yanmen Pass.

8
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,280
Really?

9
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,200
Can I really go?

10
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,400
Why not?

11
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,560
I'm not sure.

12
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,039
What if Mother found out…

13
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,520
But it doesn't matter.

14
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:08,160
A general does not always follow the orders of His Majesty when abroad.

15
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,440
A daughter does not always follow the orders of her mother when she's not home!

Master.

17

What's wrong with Shiyi?

18
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,079
I accidentally stepped in a muddy pit

19
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,200
and twisted my ankle.

20
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,480
Prepare a coffin to bring to the Central state

21

the whole story behind Grand Mentor Xie's illness.

29

Do you think there is something off about his death?

30
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,640
There's no harm in knowing

31
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,900
what there is to know.

32
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:15,920
Let me carry you.

who sent you here? Do you still remember?

the reason why I hid it from you.

70
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,080
You were afraid the Qi family

71
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,680
would seek revenge and kill me.

72
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,400
Grand Mentor Xie wanted to hide it from you all your life.

I was more afraid that,

if I died one day,

77
00:06:59,090 --> 00:06:59,680
no one would

Or did you just run into each other?

What has Cui Feng done?

General Cui works as the prefectural governor in Taiyuan

and is on an equal footing with General Jin.

Don't worry on that count.

What marriage?

131
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,180
The Prince of Guangling asked for a fiefdom.

132
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,740
Before he leaves the capital,

133

00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,620
She left her hometown and came to the Western State.

173
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,220
It's natural I should take good care of her.

174
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,060
You must be guessing

175
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,700
why I came here this time.

176
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,780
The empress dowager has arranged a marriage for her.

177
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,660
We came to take her back to Qinghe

178
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,900
for her wedding.

179
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,300
What marriage?

180
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,740
Your mother is talking with your master.

181
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,660
Sit down.

182
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,460
What marriage?

183
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,220
When was this set?

184
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,140
It's still the old one.

185
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,100
Even after all that,

186
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,140
it is still the Prince of Guangling.

187
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,980
How did you get hurt?

188
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,180
Your Lady.

189
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,700
Leave now.

190
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,940
Alright.

191
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,140
It's fine.

192
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,900
The palm won't scar so easily.

193
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,620
Did you read my letter?

194
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,180
Do you hope I have read it

195
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,500
or do you hope

196
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,940
I have never received it

197
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,220
and we won't even mention it again?

198
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,020
I want to know

199
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,820
what you think.

200
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,540
You said you wanted to stay in the Western State,

201
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,500
and compile classics and histories all your life.

202
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,660
Do you not want to get married,

203
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:07,380
or is it that you can't marry

204
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,579
the one you like?

205
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,540
Do you want to hear the truth?

206
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,380
You don't have to say anything.

207
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,220
I've just seen it with my own eyes.

208
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,260
I never had any delusions.

209
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,740
I just wanted to stay in the Western State

210
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,620
to stay with him.

211
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,540
You're no fool.

212
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,380
You should know it won't work.

213
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,700
Since you came back to the Western State,

214
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,540
there have been rumors among the commonfolk,

215
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,580
saying that the daughter of the Cui family and the Junior Prince of Nanchen

216
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,180
have an improper relationship,

217
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,860
disregarding his apprenticeship

218
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,620
and all ethics.

219
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,420
Who said that?

220
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,020
He and I have never crossed a line

221
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,300
and we never will!

222
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,900
There are also rumors that

223
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,500
the Junior Prince of Nanchen wants to rise in revolt

224
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,220
to ascend the throne himself

225
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,420
and the Cui family will

226
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,700
offer him this young beauty and help

227
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,340
to divide the country

228
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,620
so that the Cui family can rise in stature.

229
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,300
All noble families in the world

230
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,940
and his political enemies

231
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,540
have their eyes on you.

232
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,940
They won't give up any chance

233
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,180
to destroy and slander the people of Nancheng Royal Mansion

234
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,980
and the Cui family.

235
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,020
How could anyone believe this?

236
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,900
People love to praise heroes,

237
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:58,460
but also feel pity watching heroes fall from grace.

238
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:03,780
It has been so since ancient times.

239
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,540
Isn't there any room

240
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,100
for us to maneuver our way out of this?

241
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,380
Even if just for him,

242
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,060
instead of for all of us,

243
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,780
you must leave.

244
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,740
Before I meet you,

245
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,340
I've gone over countless scripts in my mind

246
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,260
trying to find words to persuade you.

247
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,980
But they didn't work.

248
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,380
I can't even convince myself.

249
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,460
I've been

250
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,060
through this pain.

251
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,500
Your cousin has experienced too.

252
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,660
I've thought that

253
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,340
in any case,

254
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,100
I won't let you experience the pain I've felt.

255
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,320
I've even thought that

256
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,260
if you fall in love

257
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,420
with any of your senior brothers,

258
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,220
I would help you

259
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,640
regardless of the family's dignity,

260
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,700
all to make you happy.

261
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,540
But you can't

262
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,020
marry the man in your heart.

263
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,100
I understand.

264
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,980
I never had any wild thoughts.

265
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,340
I just

266
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,820
want to be with him

267
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,300
and stay by his side.

268
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,340
That's enough.

269
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,660
Please, I beg you

270
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,540
to give me a few more days.

271
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,820
I just want to

272
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,740
stay here for a little while longer.

273
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,740
Palace Attendant Cui and Chamberlain Meng

274
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,100
are waiting in the post house.

275
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:47,980
You can stay

276
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,900
till tomorrow.

277
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,260
Okay.

278
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,380
This is Nanchen Royal Mansion.

279
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,940
It's inconvenient for us to live here.

280
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,940
So we shall stay at the post house tonight.

281
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,660
We'll give Shiyi time to

282
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,900
say goodbye to her senior brothers and sisters.

283
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,380
Tomorrow, we head out.

284
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,500
You still haven't worn the dress

285
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,380
His Highness ordered made last year.

286
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,540
Do you want me to take it out?

287
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,540
Take it out.

288
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:52,980
Sure.

289
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:50,780
Who is it?

290
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,660
Master, it's me.

291
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,020
It's time for dinner.

292
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,500
The military advisor said

293
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,140
you haven't allowed anyone to come in.

294
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,620
I have something urgent to do.

295
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,180
Can you light a lamp first?

296
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,500
In the first two years after I came here,

297
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,580
whenever you left on an expedition,

298
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,940
I would sleep here.

299
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,220
At that time,

300
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,900
I was not familiar with the guards

301
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,260
and so I was afraid of them.

302
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,460
I guessed your study

303
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,020
must be a forbidden area

304
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,820
where ordinary people didn't dare intrude.

305
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,900
So it seemed safest to sleep here.

306
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,860
You never told me about this.

307
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,340
You seldom come back.

308
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,780
I'm only too happy

309
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,380
to say these little things when you're back.

310
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,700
I cooked all these.

311
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,100
I don't know if you like them or not.

312
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,100
Have a taste.

313
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,860
Is it good?

314
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,060
Then take your time.

315
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,620
Where are you going?

316
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,500
I forgot the wine.

317
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:17,480
♫The shadow lingers, the sudden downpour comes♫

318

323
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:36,540

♫I'm suffering with you♫

325
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,180
You couldn't wait, Master?

326
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,020

327

♫Suffered so much from this sea of pain♫

328
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,340

338
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,980
I recall, when you were in the imperial palace,

339
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,060
you looked for wine everywhere.

340

366
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,540
General Feng.

367
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,540
The empress dowager has ordered

368
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,340
the marriage of Miss Cui and the Prince of Guangling.

369

The edict was passed today.

♫Swords and horses, leave the dust of this world behind♫

I'm going to look for a piece of clothes.

406
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,300
Someone is waiting for you in the Council Hall.

407
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,660
Who?

408
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:40,820
Palace Attendant Cui.

409
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,740
He brought the empress dowager's verbal instructions.

410
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,660
Greetings, Your Highness. I'm Cui Zheng.

411
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,500
Palace Attendant Cui.

412
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,380
Your Highness,

413
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,140
I came here

414
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:59,460
to escort Shiyi back to the Central State.

415
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,460
But also, I brought the empress dowager's

416
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,699
verbal instructions to you.

417
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:05,380
Proceed.

418
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,620
The empress dowager said that,

419
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,380
although the gossip and rumors are not credible,

420
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,179
the Nanchen Royal Mansion and the Cui family

421
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,780
are noble families

422
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,060
admired by all scholars.

423
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:23,020
In order to stop the rumors,

424
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,380
the best solution is for Your Highness

425
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:27,780
to adopt

426
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,060
Cui Shiyi as your daughter.

427
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:54,190
♫Maybe it's the snow falling without a sound♫

428
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,670
♫Maybe it's the flower in the mirror without a trace♫

429
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:03,170
♫I've seen all the scenes of the passing years♫

♫They're not as good as you, not as good as you♫

433
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,540
I will call you Eleven.

434
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,540

♫My heart that can't stand being away from love♫

446
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,580

♫Hides nothing from you♫

448

Weiyang, Changle,

504
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:08,040
Mingguang Palace, North Palace, and Gui Palace.

505
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:08,960
You can see them all.

506
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,500
Feng Qiao said

507
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,660
since you entered the Western State,

508
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,860
you've never visited here.

509
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:29,980
Thank you

510
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,740
for disobeying the decree

511
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:32,940
and making an exception for me.

512
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,260
Have you brought the key?

513
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,100
It's as if I can see

514
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,820
the scene of them running away.

515
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:22,900
What do you want to do?

516
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,420
I want to leave a word on here.

517
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,420
When we leave and lock the gate,

518
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,660
no one can enter again.

519
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,900
Leaving a word here

520
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,140
is like leaving a secret just for us.

521
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:36,420
What do you want to write? Let me write it for you.

Chen.

523
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,180
I mean "morning", it's morning right now.

524
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,300
How meaningful.

♫The snow before the pavilion softly kisses the lattice♫

526
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:14,210
♫I don't want to dive deep into my heart to see how much I miss you♫

527
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:20,110
♫Sing my whispers while I'm slightly drunk♫

♫Listen to it, can you see that I miss you♫

530
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:34,930
♫The snow won't stop, the person won't show up, my heart won't clear up♫

531
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:40,600
♫The snow in front of the garden keeps falling♫

532
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:47,160
♫I can't wake up from your smiles♫

533
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:56,630
♫I'm willing to run to you even for millions of miles♫

536
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,020
Master has ordered

537
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,020
me to escort you

538
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,380
to the Central State safely.

539
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,300
Where is he?

540
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:24,540
When you leave through the gate,

541
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,700
you'll see him.
