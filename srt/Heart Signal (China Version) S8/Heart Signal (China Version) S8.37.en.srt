1
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,520
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,960
Surprise, it's us again.

3
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,080
It's us again.

4
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,320
Hello, everyone.

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,160
I'm from "Signal of the Heart".

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,520
Season 8, Liu Zihan.

7
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:30,800
Hello, everyone.

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,320
I'm from "Signal of the Heart".

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,640
Season 8, Wang Lechen.

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,400
Hello, everyone.

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,240
I'm from "Signal of the Heart".

12
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,760
Season 8, Xu Rulan.

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,560
Alright.

14
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,120
Before the show, let's

15
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,440
play a quick game together.

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,120
To warm up.

17
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,600
It's called

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,120
"In My Eyes".

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,200
Each guest

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,240
draws a painting prompt.

21
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,080
You have three minutes to finish your drawing.

22
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,000
Also, guests need to pick

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,920
an action restriction card.

24
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,680
During the game,

25
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,080
if you trigger the action on your card,

26
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,080
you must pause drawing for ten seconds.

27
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,120
Let's hand them out.

28
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,960
I want

29
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,520
the blue one.

30
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,160
Here's a pink one for you.

31
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:05,880
And then

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,880
You use this one.

33
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,880
The red one.

34
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,880
My drawing skills

35
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,840
are really being tested here.

36
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,600
Honestly,

37
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,200
Three,

38
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:15,880
two,

39
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,120
one,

40
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:16,840
one,

41
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,760
Go!

42
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,920
You want to start so fast?

43
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,960
Okay, you both triggered your cards.

44
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,480
Can you get me that pen?

45
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,080
Help him get it.

46
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,640
Starting to block out distractions.

47
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,280
Don't disturb my drawing.

48
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,320
Drawing is actually kind of hard.

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,360
Mine...

50
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,840
Did I not finish even in one minute?

51
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,240
No, I'm just feeling a bit hot.

52
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:03,920
Wait a second.

53
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,120
Hold on.

54
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,320
Can you tell what it is?

55
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,720
Do you think we can guess?

56
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,280
Is this supposed to be that pine tree?

57
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,480
I feel like you're leading me

58
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,360
to say a certain word.

59
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,440
It should be

60
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,440
yes or no.

61
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,800
Something in Chinese, right?

62
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,360
Just pause for ten seconds.

63
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,480
But I'm already done.

64
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,040
Can you get me a piece of paper?

65
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,720
Help her get a piece of paper.

66
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,000
You get a piece of paper.

67
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,400
Help her get a piece of paper.

68
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,920
You get it, you're closer.

69
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,160
Getting anxious.

70
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,320
Can I borrow your pink one?

71
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,400
I'll add a hair accessory.

72
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,080
Alright, you got caught.

73
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,560
You fell for it.

74
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,400
That's Weini.

75
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,240
That's Weini.

76
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,760
Nicole.

77
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,280
Yours is...

78
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,360
Mine is...

79
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,400
Who is this?

80
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,440
Jiao Zhiheng.

81
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:12,800
No, that's not right.

82
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,800
I think it's Liu Zihan.

83
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,480
No.

84
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,680
Whose face shape is...

85
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,520
Jin Yuxing.

86
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,160
An inverted trapezoid.

87
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,920
Jin Yuxing's face isn't that thin.

88
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,440
Wait, is this...

89
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,360
Ruilong.

90
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:28,880
Ruilong.

91
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,960
Ruilong.

92
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,840
Does this have anything to do with Ruilong?

93
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,680
I wanted to draw his prominent nose.

94
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,120
And he's smiling.

95
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,080
But I couldn't draw the smile.

96
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,800
This is way too abstract.

97
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,880
Sorry, Ruilong.

98
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,440
Sorry, Ruilong.

99
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,360
Who is this?

100
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,120
Duoduo (Keke).

101
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,760
No.

102
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,360
Is that a ponytail?

103
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,520
It's tied up.

104
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,480
That's all I wanted to show.

105
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,720
That's Chichi.

106
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,400
So it feels like...

107
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,520
Drawing this is pretty stressful.

108
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,440
All I can say is...

109
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,200
I wonder if Chichi...

110
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,680
When she sees this episode...

111
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,640
She might blush a little.

112
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,200
Let's put on our headphones.

113
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,360
And keep watching the second day's date.

114
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,040
Alright.

115
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,160
Let's go.

116
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,080
Are they going to...

117
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,040
Play ball?

118
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,920
Squash?

119
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,600
Squash.

120
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,680
Yeah, I see the racket.

121
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,040
They must be playing squash.

122
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,760
Ruilong's most common look

123
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,280
is wearing workout clothes.

124
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,120
The guy's here for some exercise.

125
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,000
It's printed on him.

126
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,800
This seems pretty fun.

127
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,480
I want to try it.

128
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,920
There's a lot of back and forth.

129
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,440
And look, Ruilong keeps...

130
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,520
finding a really good...

131
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,320
angle for her to catch.

132
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,440
He's feeding her the ball.

133
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,400
Yeah, he's feeding the ball.

134
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,400
Because I remember at the sports event,

135
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,280
the two of them were in sync jumping rope.

136
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,880
Two "sports pros."

137
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,920
When they exercise,

138
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,080
there's a kind of chemistry.

139
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,880
Those who take initiative enjoy happiness first.

140
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,320
I noticed Ruilong's dates

141
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,240
always have a relaxed vibe.

142
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,000
That's actually pretty special.

143
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,200
It's quite romantic, yeah.

144
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,600
I think it's really romantic.

145
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,480
Because I think

146
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,040
one of the most romantic things is

147
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,440
taking someone to

148
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,600
the place where you grew up.

149
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,800
Yeah, to places I've been.

150
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,640
Walking the roads I've walked.

151
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,000
Seeing the sights I've seen.

152
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,360
That's the feeling.

153
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,880
Jue'er just mentioned this.

154
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,920
The "city belle" is online.

155
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,880
You two keep chatting.

156
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,800
Do you really like playing billiards?

157
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,360
Not really.

158
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,240
You'll see.

159
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,960
Is this the iconic moment?

160
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,320
I just mentioned the iconic moment,

161
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,200
and here it is.

162
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,600
Luckily, the first shot wasn't a miss.

163
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,880
I'm really bad at this.

164
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,280
If I knock out more of my balls,

165
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:08,800
I'll win.

166
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,960
Yeah, I was just about to say that.

167
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,360
That's what you call "not knowing how."

168
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,000
When playing badminton before,

169
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,200
they also said they couldn't play.

170
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,920
Playing dumb.

171
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,720
There's some skill there.

172
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,200
Really impressive.

173
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,680
Finally gave you a chance

174
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,720
to get some applause.

175
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,640
Remember.

176
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,280
There are so many great quotes every day.

177
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,720
Class is starting, everyone!

178
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,440
Nice shot!

179
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,560
That was a good one.

180
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,720
It just makes me look silly.

181
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,120
I was really focused on playing pool.

182
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,000
What does that mean?

183
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,920
There’s something extra, right?

184
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,520
But you’re pretty smart too.

185
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,280
Yeah, you’re clever.

186
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,080
You noticed it right away.

187
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,880
I didn’t catch it at first.

188
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,080
What’s that little ball?

189
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,000
Look, there’s a note inside.

190
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,840
What?

191
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,640
What did he write?

192
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,320
A whole bunch.

193
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,440
A whole bunch.

194
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,320
Darn it, I’m going to look silly later.

195
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,720
No, I think every field is different.

196
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,640
It’s totally normal.

197
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,920
It’s a warning with no loop.

198
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,600
The golden hour for doctors to save lives.

199
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,280
Zero.

200
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,000
Zero five two zero.

201
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,200
Isn’t it twenty-one?

202
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,240
Double helix.

203
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:32,960
Two.

204
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,520
Two.

205
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,480
Double.

206
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,360
Zero five two three.

207
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,400
Zero five two five.

208
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,960
The day you met.

209
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,640
That’s the day we arrived on the island.

210
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,800
May 25th, right?

211
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,440
Yeah, the first day on the island.

212
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,600
Leading to a place

213
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,280
where I gave you a gift.

214
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,360
Summer’s starting!

215
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,880
Better remember it.

216
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,240
Make you look even prettier in photos.

217
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,640
Learning something new every day.

218
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,200
My brain’s running out of space.

219
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,960
Men who are focused are so attractive.

220
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,680
Everyone's so good at this.

221
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,120
You can do it.

222
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,200
Didn't play well.

223
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,680
Shouldn't we frame this racket?

224
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,680
How will we use it later?

225
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,440
It's written all over your face.

226
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,280
Just like a kid

227
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,040
when they first get a present.

228
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,720
You don't want to let it go.

229
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,520
Five minutes.

230
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,080
Goosebumps.

231
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,080
Goosebumps.

232
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,640
All over the place.

233
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,520
Go back.

234
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,040
Replay and study it.

235
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,600
Replay and study it.

236
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,680
All golden quotes.

237
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,440
This little teasing between you two is quite something.

238
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,120
This isn't just teasing.

239
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:57,760
It's a big push and shove.

240
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,400
That look in your eyes.

241
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,080
So is this something

242
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,520
you both enjoy together?

243
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:39,600
No.

244
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,760
She does free diving.

245
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,960
I do scuba.

246
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,040
This is my first time trying free diving.

247
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,480
Two mermaids.

248
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,280
What's this?

249
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,000
Isn't this what you did at the sports meet

250
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,760
when taking group photos?

251
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,760
What's this?

252
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,440
Duoduo really

253
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,560
has endless energy.

254
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,240
She really still has energy.

255
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,120
High energy.

256
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,080
Happy things always give you energy.

257
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,320
When I was here, I was already

258
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,920
Depends who you're having fun with.

259
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,320
Okay.

260
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,760
This is actually pretty exciting.

261
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,400
It's fun.

262
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:02,360
Not bad.

263
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:02,720
Pretty good.

264
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,160
It's okay.

265
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:03,760
Quite talented.

266
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,600
You got this.

267
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,160
This activity of yours is nice.

268
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:08,880
It's fun.

269
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,920
Still not as good as skiing.

270
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,240
But Duoduo

271
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,840
really knows how to liven things up.

272
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,040
Yeah.

273
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,960
That's her strength.

274
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,920
She's very energetic.

275
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,240
Yeah, high energy.

276
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,560
But I think people with high energy

277
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,720
need to recharge a lot too.

278
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,560
They need a lot of energy.

279
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,160
So what she needs is probably

280
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,120
more energy.

281
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,640
Because

282
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,240
she definitely has to

283
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,680
maintain a balance of energy.

284
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,880
No one can be high energy all the time.

285
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,120
That's true.

286
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,200
What kind of guy are you?

287
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:14,920
Tell us.

288
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,360
What kind of guy are you?

289
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,600
I don't really know.

290
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,160
Actually,

291
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,080
it's hard to

292
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,360
put labels on myself.

293
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,960
Because right now, she said

294
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,640
you want to say you're slow to warm up.

295
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,040
Yeah, I don't know

296
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,920
how I come across to her.

297
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,080
Because when I'm with her,

298
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,920
there are some

299
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,360
parts I haven't shown yet.

300
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm still a bit worried

301
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,280
that if two people

302
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,120
aren't on the same page,

303
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,480
there might be a lot of problems later.

304
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,000
I'll accept her leaving, yeah.

305
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,040
Respect and accept it.

306
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,800
What she said makes sense.

307
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,880
Duoduo means that

308
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,400
she wants a clear answer.

309
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,320
Whether it's yes or no,

310
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,320
she needs

311
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,360
she needs feedback.

312
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,240
Give her something definite.

313
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,240
I'm the same way.

314
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,440
Yeah, me too.

315
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,240
When solving a problem,

316
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,200
I try everything

317
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,720
I can think of.

318
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,680
I try every possible way.

319
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,200
Until it works.

320
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,520
Yeah.

321
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,440
I think so.

322
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,840
Because at different stages of life,

323
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,000
you go through different things.

324
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,080
You enter different environments.

325
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,360
So you meet different people.

326
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,520
It's not necessarily you changing,

327
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,600
but your life

328
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,480
and surroundings are changing.

329
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:33,880
Everything is changing.

330
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,640
Yeah, it's natural.

331
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,480
The people around you change too.

332
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,880
Everything is in flux.

333
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,440
Let's talk about something lighter.

334
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,800
Yeah, don't talk about

335
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,840
serious topics in the car.

336
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,400
Lesson learned.

337
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,760
Lesson learned.

338
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,720
Conversation in the car

339
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,000
Why does it always feel a bit unpleasant?

340
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,880
Because honestly, I really enjoy

341
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,840
chatting in the car

342
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,440
It's because, honestly,

343
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,200
there are only two people at that moment

344
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,800
spending time together alone

345
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,880
But I think it's necessary

346
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,600
No two people would say

347
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,080
that every conversation is

348
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:31,880
right?

349
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,200
always comfortable

350
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,040
"Help!"

351
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,160
Pause

352
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,760
I need to "judge" this

353
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,720
This line of yours

354
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,000
"Adults only choose, they don't change"

355
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,040
If I were

356
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,960
that girl

357
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,800
I'd feel it's a bit

358
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,760
too absolute

359
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,400
Basically, what you're saying

360
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,560
means

361
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,080
I won't make any changes in a relationship

362
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,840
From now on, in my relationships

363
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,040
I'll only choose people

364
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,600
I won't change for you

365
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,200
or compromise for you

366
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,360
That's a bit harsh

367
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,040
If I heard that, I might

368
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,240
feel disappointed

369
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,440
What Duoduo said

370
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,440
is actually right too

371
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,360
But I think for two people

372
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,800
the most important thing is

373
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,400
at least some compatibility

374
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,560
should be relatively high

375
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,720
Then, in that space

376
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,880
you can make adjustments

377
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,960
I think this

378
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,440
means you two might

379
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,000
have some personality differences

380
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,400
I think when it comes to relationships

381
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,360
you're more cautious and afraid of getting hurt

382
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,760
and also afraid of hurting the other person

383
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,320
But Duoduo

384
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,480
she's probably the type

385
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,160
who doesn't care

386
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:43,960
She just goes for it

387
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,680
She loves first

388
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
and thinks later

389
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,080
That's the vibe

390
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,440
I think Lechen is probably

391
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,040
someone who needs to interact, get to know, and adjust first

392
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,200
Duoduo feels

393
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,720
that being serious about a relationship means

394
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,560
once she decides to enter

395
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,800
the relationship

396
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,240
she wants this relationship

397
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,600
to have a good outcome

398
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,560
and to develop

399
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:12,600
But you might focus on

400
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,720
Right, one is process-oriented

401
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,920
the other is result-oriented

402
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,080
But sometimes I think

403
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,400
because I used to be

404
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,240
just like Duoduo

405
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,560
I was a very

406
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,160
result-oriented person

407
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,840
So if you keep

408
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,440
focusing on the goal

409
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,640
and moving forward

410
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,920
any negative feedback

411
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,960
makes you doubt your actions

412
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,480
or you end up exhausted

413
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,520
and you might hurt

414
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,240
the other person's feelings

415
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:31,800
That's how it is

416
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,960
I still hope

417
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,360
to break the so-called filter first

418
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,840
and let both people show their true selves

419
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,480
Yes, exactly

420
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,520
to face each other

421
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,840
If you think it's okay

422
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,040
then we can try to move forward

423
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,240
I'm not saying there's a limit

424
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,240
but I'm telling you my bottom line is here

425
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,760
But the way you express yourself now

426
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,520
might make others

427
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:50,880
find it hard to accept

428
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,320
Yeah, my way of doing things

429
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,400
does have some issues

430
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,240
It's a bit too direct and

431
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,600
can make people feel

432
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,720
uncomfortable

433
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,400
Handwritten letter

434
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,040
You're good at it too

435
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,720
Why do you care when they read it?

436
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,440
You already gave it to them.

437
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,160
Why worry about when they read it?

438
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,280
Seriously.

439
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,040
I think love can

440
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,160
make you act foolish in love.

441
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,360
The strategist never leaves the battlefield.

442
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,920
The reason I wrote this letter

443
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,920
was because

444
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,120
of what we just watched

445
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,560
the conversation in the car.

446
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,080
I just felt

447
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,200
I needed to explain my actions.

448
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,160
Give some explanation.

449
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,800
I was worried about misunderstandings.

450
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,240
Yeah, because at that moment

451
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:54,920
not after it ended,

452
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,880
I already felt that way.

453
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,720
So I wanted

454
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,320
to explain it this way.

455
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,680
I get it.

456
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,840
Backfired.

457
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,560
I think in relationships,

458
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,240
when you really have feelings,

459
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,480
a lot of times things

460
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,160
end up backfiring.

461
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,320
Like you said, you get love-struck.

462
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,320
You get impatient.

463
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,360
It's a bit heavy.

464
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,120
Feeling a bit sentimental.

465
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,920
In the end, it's a comparison.

466
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,320
A conclusion with lots of thoughts.

467
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:49,960
Leave some space.

468
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,800
Yeah, let everyone leave a nice pause.

469
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,040
Let's share

470
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,360
what we thought

471
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,440
on the night of the date.

472
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,200
Start with your driving experience.

473
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,080
No, actually

474
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,320
after the last time with Duoduo,

475
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:03,880
after interacting,

476
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,680
maybe

477
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,560
I just got a general idea about her.

478
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,080
What kind of personality she has.

479
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:09,920
Or

480
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,040
how she handles daily life.

481
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,760
Just a rough impression.

482
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,800
But we didn't talk deeply.

483
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,200
It's because this time

484
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,320
the two of us

485
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,000
talked at a deeper level.

486
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,560
I realized

487
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,560
in some views

488
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,400
we really

489
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,360
have quite a few differences.

490
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,600
But I think

491
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,320
at that moment,

492
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,480
our conversation was actually pretty comfortable.

493
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,360
Let's leave it at that.

494
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,120
Actually, in every episode of

495
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,280
"Watching Heart Signal," we have this segment.

496
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,600
It's the wish message bottle.

497
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,560
To explain,

498
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,360
the previous guests

499
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,760
leave their own

500
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,840
question or task

501
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,520
for us.

502
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,280
We draw one from these.

503
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,160
Just one.

504
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,000
And help fulfill or answer it.

505
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,120
Whatever they wrote.

506
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,920
So now it's our turn

507
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,720
to pick one.

508
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,800
Since you're new here,

509
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,880
Lanlan, you go first.

510
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,640
Okay.

511
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,280
So Lanlan,

512
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,560
pick the blue one.

513
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,720
Mine says

514
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,960
Whoever gets this card

515
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,880
join us for skiing next time.

516
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,200
Do it within two months.

517
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,680
Zeng Zhaohao.

518
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,400
I'm going skiing with the "Jinzhao" group.

519
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,080
Yeah, congrats!

520
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,840
I'm going to be the third wheel.

521
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,920
I'm dancing with Good Luck.

522
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,240
Can we swap?

523
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,400
I want to ski.

524
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,200
I can't dance.

525
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,280
Not this one.

526
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,000
It's Xue Zheyang's.

527
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,920
What's that?

528
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,760
What is it?

529
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,280
Let's see.

530
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:31,760
Hello.

531
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,600
Please take a photo

532
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,720
of this moment.

533
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,640
Send it to me on WeChat.

534
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,440
Thanks.

535
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,440
I'll send it to him soon.

536
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,360
Darn it.

537
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,320
His dream is shattered.

538
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,040
He wanted to add the female guest on WeChat.

539
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,800
So now

540
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,640
it's the next segment.

541
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,200
We need to write

542
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,360
tasks or questions for the three of us.

543
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,720
Tasks or questions.

544
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,120
Just write

545
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,200
You can set a trap,

546
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,120
or send blessings.

547
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,560
Write whatever you want.

548
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,080
But let me tell you, this karma

549
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,600
will come back to you.

550
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,440
So think carefully.

551
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:57,760
Okay.

552
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,320
What to write.

553
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,080
Let me see yours.

554
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,280
How did he write it?

555
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,600
Whoever draws this card

556
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,320
pulls the person sitting next to them

557
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,880
one or two people

558
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,840
and makes the ugliest funny face

559
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,680
then sends me a selfie

560
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,320
Next, let's dance together

561
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,520
Because the lucky card says

562
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,520
to go to Shanghai and dance with her

563
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,240
I wrote that we might go skydiving together

564
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,840
Take a photo and post it on Xiaohongshu

565
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,840
And finally, our usual tradition

566
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,400
Let's grab the Polaroid together

567
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,840
and capture this moment

568
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,840
Come on

569
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,720
the best moments

570
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,800
Okay

571
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,120
You go in front

572
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,080
I'll be in front

573
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,680
Watching Heart Signal with you

574
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,120
Heart Signal never ends

575
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,480
See you next time

576
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,120
Bye
