1
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,160
So I've already made that impression, huh?

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,520
Jue'er

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,120
You still got caught by me.

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,720
She's a bit embarrassed.

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:20,760
She turns around.

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,600
We're almost done eating.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,080
But there's still a big plate left.

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,520
Yeah.

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,320
It's separate.

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,240
But no one touched it either.

11
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,640
She knows what happened.

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,800
So she turned around.

13
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,680
She retreated.

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,680
Still feels a bit disappointed.

15
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:35,840
Yeah.

16
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,240
Still hope Jue'er can pay more attention to others.

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,600
Right.

18
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,640
Come on, let's play a game.

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,440
Come play a game.

20
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,480
Let's play something.

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,520
Jue'er just said to play this.

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,320
What's this?

23
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,240
"The Answer to Heartbeats"

24
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,120
"The Answer to Heartbeats"

25
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,520
Then everyone has to ask a question.

26
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,040
Right.

27
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,520
Come on.

28
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,560
Let the new friend go first.

29
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,400
Or give you a special chance.

30
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,000
You can pick someone to give an example.

31
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,800
Give an example.

32
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,800
Lanlan, he'll definitely pick Lanlan.

33
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:22,720
Come.

34
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,480
Come.

35
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,440
Come.

36
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:26,920
Come on, "Boss Lan."

37
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,360
"Boss Lan."

38
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,360
No.

39
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,680
Why did you choose me?

40
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,320
Wouldn't you pick someone you know first?

41
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:37,840
"Taking advantage of acquaintances."

42
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,960
Because just now at the table,

43
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,080
you exposed too many of his weaknesses.

44
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,160
He's already taken note of it.

45
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,480
The others don't know yet.

46
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,600
They still don't know.

47
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,160
Right.

48
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,640
What?

49
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,320
Are you going to announce it?

50
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,480
Lanlan's friend.

51
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,640
Lanlan's friend.

52
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,760
Everyone just realized it now.

53
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,480
Turns out they know each other.

54
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,240
Yeah.

55
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,040
Dr. Fang feels very hopeless inside.

56
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,280
What happened?

57
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,760
The two of us

58
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,520
were both shocked when we met today.

59
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,280
Is that even possible?

60
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,760
This news is really surprising.

61
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,640
Yeah, they know each other.

62
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,560
Friends in real life.

63
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,800
We didn't know either.

64
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,240
And we were shocked when we first met.

65
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,760
I said, "How is the world so small?"

66
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,520
Yeah.

67
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,720
That's exactly the expression.

68
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,480
Let's start first.

69
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,640
Then I'll start first.

70
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,680
Let me think.

71
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,640
Then I want to ask, will tomorrow be better than today?

72
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,840
Which chapter is this?

73
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,920
Make friends with time.

74
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:05,840
The answer is

75
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,360
not bad.

76
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,240
Things will get better.

77
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,640
Yes.

78
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,240
I think the two of them can't really cheer up.

79
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,080
Yeah, right now they

80
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,200
are feeling very heavy.

81
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:22,960
Here.

82
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,840
Then, for our new friend.

83
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,160
Here you go.

84
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,000
It's my turn.

85
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,360
Go ahead, then.

86
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,320
I'll ask, in the next month,

87
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,280
will everything go smoothly?

88
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,880
Will everything in the cabin go smoothly?

89
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,480
Teacher Jiao is paying close attention.

90
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,560
You don't have to demand too much control over things.

91
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,000
What?

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,320
You don't have to demand too much control over things.

93
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,040
This "Answer from the Heart" is really great.

94
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,440
Yuxing.

95
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,600
So, if I say

96
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,440
what am I thinking about right now?

97
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,400
That's a bit abstract.

98
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:27,840
Yeah.

99
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,320
You haven't asked yet.

100
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,760
I'm just thinking about something.

101
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,560
What I'm asking now is

102
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,120
what am I thinking about myself.

103
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,880
He's really too abstract.

104
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,680
His style is truly unique.

105
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,640
Be your true self.

106
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,560
Only then will you meet someone who likes the real you.

107
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,080
I really like this answer.

108
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,000
Okay.

109
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,360
The harvest of this journey

110
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,000
could possibly be what?

111
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,280
Accepting each other

112
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,640
and insisting on expressing your own needs

113
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,240
are equally important.

114
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:08,960
Good answer.

115
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,800
This month

116
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,920
what will be the happiest thing?

117
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,800
What is it?

118
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,400
Believing in your own uniqueness and irreplaceability

119
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,640
During this month in the cabin

120
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,360
can I find myself?

121
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,080
When our ability to consider and understand others

122
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,320
starts to decline,

123
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,360
our relationships will be affected.

124
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,160
Wait, let me ask

125
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,920
are you satisfied with who you are now?

126
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,560
That's a good question.

127
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,520
You don't have to stand out,

128
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,560
but you must pursue your greatest potential.

129
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,000
After this month's experience, will there be

130
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,880
an answer?

131
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,880
Go find a more suitable way to communicate.

132
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,080
Avoid falling into a negative state.

133
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,040
Indeed.

134
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,440
I'll do it.

135
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,040
Then

136
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,480
in the coming month

137
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,520
in the cabin

138
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,480
will I gain

139
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,320
someone who makes my heart flutter?

140
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,840
Yifan, as always,

141
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,360
is efficient.

142
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,480
Good question.

143
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,560
Will it happen?

144
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,480
What?

145
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:34,680
What?

146
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,160
This

147
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,960
Relationships are like the sun,

148
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,560
they have ups and downs, that's normal.

149
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,720
It makes me feel

150
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,400
a bit less confident.

151
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,120
After hearing this,

152
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,280
it feels like you're comforting me.

153
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,360
You might not gain anything,

154
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,120
because there will be setbacks.

155
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,480
But I see the rise as well.

156
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,960
Where there's a fall, there's a rise.

157
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,280
That's good too.

158
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,360
Very philosophical.

159
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,760
Let's have Dr. Fang go first.

160
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,600
Dr. Fang.

161
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,600
Then,

162
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,800
will things go in the direction

163
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,440
that I hope for?

164
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,640
Not bad.

165
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,280
He asked very directly.

166
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,800
Don't be afraid of negative feelings in relationships.

167
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,440
Take the initiative to create more positive emotions.

168
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,680
That's wonderful.

169
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:41,960
He's happy now.

170
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,920
Look how happy he is.

171
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,360
Brother Jiao.

172
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,160
Brother Jiao's face is all red.

173
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,200
Brother Jiao has a "tipsy look" today.

174
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,880
What should I do to stay true to myself?

175
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,440
Stay true to yourself.

176
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,400
Love yourself first.

177
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,920
This line suits him perfectly.

178
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,360
This is especially good.

179
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,440
And this sentence

180
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,600
matches his question

181
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,080
quite well.

182
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,400
Indeed.

183
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,080
Alright.

184
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,760
To love others, love yourself first.

185
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,440
Look at how Xiao Jiao feels.

186
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,760
It's a mix of emotions.

187
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,240
It feels like the answer from "The Answer of Heartbeat".

188
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,000
Sometimes you might need

189
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,760
some time before it becomes clear.

190
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,760
It's inspiring and forward-looking.

191
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:55,800
Yes.

192
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,400
He was touched.

193
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,160
That's right.

194
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,320
Because actually, Xiao Jiao

195
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,560
in this process

196
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,280
always wants to know how to give.

197
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,040
But being true to yourself is also very important.

198
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:07,760
It's easy in this way

199
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,280
but only

200
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,160
to neglect yourself.

201
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,120
Should I do a magic trick?

202
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,040
Okay.

203
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:37,920
Sure.

204
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,880
Come on.

205
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,240
I have a deck of cards. Who wants to help me?

206
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,880
Wang Jue?

207
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,760
I'll help you.

208
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,160
I'll show you the most classic one.

209
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,240
You pick a card, and I'll guess it.

210
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,040
Okay.

211
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,880
I'll put it here first.

212
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:01,880
Then...

213
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,360
You can cut the deck.

214
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,400
Can I shuffle the cards?

215
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,040
Not yet.

216
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,960
He made the atmosphere a bit different.

217
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,240
A bit happier.

218
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,360
Just follow my lead.

219
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,720
Just cut the deck.

220
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,800
Yes, follow instructions.

221
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,560
Alright.

222
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,400
I'll take it.

223
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,120
Let me take a look.

224
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,600
Okay.

225
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,000
And then?

226
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,120
Put it back.

227
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,800
Put it back.

228
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,440
Okay.

229
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,000
Now you can shuffle.

230
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,320
Just a simple shuffle.

231
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,240
Alright.

232
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,200
Let's see.

233
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,560
Come on.

234
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,520
I need to think carefully.

235
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,400
I don't know.

236
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,360
You...

237
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,520
Zihan is paying attention to him.

238
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,560
I guess it's this.

239
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,000
The setup has begun.

240
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,080
Which card are you?

241
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,280
I'm the black club Jack.

242
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,040
Turn it over.

243
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,040
It's time to witness a miracle.

244
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,640
Amazing.

245
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,560
You're an expert, right?

246
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,480
Ruilong is incredible.

247
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,440
Sure.

248
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,400
Awesome.

249
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,080
That's brilliant.

250
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,920
Used the most awkward way

251
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,800
to resolve

252
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,200
an even more awkward situation.

253
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,720
Did you see that?

254
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,080
Let me show everyone a magic trick.

255
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,120
The charm of Ruilong is

256
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,160
everyone really comes here for love.

257
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:05,720
He truly is

258
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,600
here to perform magic.

259
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,280
But I also look forward to seeing him

260
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,040
in a romantic relationship.

261
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,000
Ma Boxian and I

262
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,120
are already his number one

263
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,360
fans.

264
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,240
Yeah.

265
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,160
This book seems amazing.

266
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,920
This was specially

267
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,920
made for this show.

268
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,600
It's not the one sold on the market.

269
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,240
With me,

270
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,720
"The Answer to Heartbeat" was developed together

271
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,120
with our teacher Qianzhuang

272
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,280
collaboratively.

273
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,920
This book is really great.

274
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,000
It will definitely give you the most accurate answer.

275
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,120
Will I get rich tomorrow?

276
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,400
That won't work.

277
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,040
It can only predict things related to emotions.

278
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,720
If you ask whether you'll get married next year,

279
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,840
maybe it can answer that.

280
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,360
No, go ahead and ask.

281
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,320
Will you end up alone?

282
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,680
But I think this book's

283
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,000
biggest charm is that

284
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,880
you can, at any time,

285
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,360
when you're feeling a bit lost

286
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,880
or helpless,

287
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,560
when you want someone to talk to,

288
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,440
it can be

289
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,040
your

290
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,000
little friend.

291
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,400
Yeah.

292
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,480
So, in your emotional relationships

293
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,680
or in life,

294
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,480
have you ever

295
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,120
really believed in fate at any moment?

296
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,640
Yes.

297
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,160
I ask the heavens to grant me...

298
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,680
Because I think

299
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,920
timing, location, and people are all very important.

300
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,800
If it's a

301
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,880
really good

302
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,720
relationship,

303
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,480
whether it's with a friend

304
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,440
or a lover,

305
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,840
I feel it's a gift from above.

306
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,720
If this relationship doesn't feel quite right,

307
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,280
then it has taught me a lot.

308
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,480
It's been a lesson.

309
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,960
My thoughts are very similar to Hani's.

310
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,040
I also tend to follow

311
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,680
fate and destiny.

312
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,960
Actually, what I think is very similar to you.

313
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,840
That is to say,

314
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,120
just think about it,

315
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,960
there are so many people in the world,

316
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,880
you could meet

317
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:30,960
any possible partner,

318
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,120
any possible partner.

319
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,560
You must have that special connection.

320
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,680
But once you have that connection,

321
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,840
this good beginning,

322
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,160
what you do afterwards

323
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,960
Yes.

324
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,360
I think

325
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,640
I approach things in stages.

326
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,760
Love is

327
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,480
one of the few things that can't be gained just by effort.

328
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,080
It's not something you can obtain only by working hard.

329
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,560
So I feel

330
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,600
in the initial stage,

331
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,280
I still think

332
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,320
there is a certain

333
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,200
element of fate involved.

334
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,480
But once you've decided

335
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,840
to start this relationship,

336
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,280
in the later part,

337
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,320
during this process,

338
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,080
I think I am

339
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,160
the type who fights for it.

340
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,200
I try to take happiness

341
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,200
and work hard to hold it in my own hands.

342
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,560
I actively create opportunities.

343
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,920
What Teacher Chun Ye shared

344
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,960
makes me feel

345
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,200
that maybe nowadays more people

346
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,040
realize

347
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,240
that among a group

348
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,200
of possible people,

349
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,240
they meet one

350
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,920
and then both work hard together

351
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,800
to turn a possible person into the right person.

352
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,760
Yes, that's my view on relationships.

353
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,240
Fate is predetermined.

354
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,320
Luck is your own.

355
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,640
Why is it called "destiny"?

356
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,240
It first plants a seed.

357
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:21,920
There will always be luck

358
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,040
before it bears fruit.

359
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,520
So our audience members

360
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,480
can also go on Weibo and use the hashtag

361
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,320
Do you believe in destiny in love?

362
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,560
We can speak freely

363
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,040
Our official account will interact with everyone in real time

364
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,920
You might get selected

365
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,840
and receive a surprise gift

366
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,320
How do you feel about joining Heartbeat Cabin?

367
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,600
I feel everyone is very enthusiastic

368
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,240
and treats me really well

369
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,680
There are also two puppies

370
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,440
Nicole and Winnie are really cute

371
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,200
Yes

372
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,280
I brought a few bottles for everyone

373
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,040
Master Kong Jasmine Honey Tea

374
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,920
Let's drink and chat

375
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,600
Thank you

376
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,720
It's my favorite flavor

377
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,960
Such a refreshing jasmine fragrance

378
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,280
It blends perfectly with the tea aroma

379
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,600
Yes, I really love the taste of honey tea

380
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,960
It tastes fresh and soothing

381
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,960
And there's a subtle sweet aftertaste

382
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,680
Indeed

383
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,240
Welcome to Heartbeat Cabin

384
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:13,800
Cheers

385
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,800
Thank you

386
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,280
What's that guy's name?

387
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:23,840
Herry (Liu Zihan)

388
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,880
His name is Liu Zihan

389
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,800
Liu Zihan

390
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,000
He's about the same age as you

391
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,600
Born in 1995

392
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,080
Born in 1995

393
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,600
I guess he's probably

394
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,480
a few months older than me

395
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm finally not the oldest one

396
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,920
Yifan said he (Liu Zihan)

397
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,920
seems to be a bit younger than you

398
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,520
Alright, I'm still the oldest

399
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,240
Were you surprised?

400
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,400
To see the new male guest today?

401
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,560
Not really.

402
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,560
At first glance,

403
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,320
When I first saw him,

404
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,240
he looked so tall.

405
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,640
I wish I were that tall.

406
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,240
I really wish I could be that tall.

407
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,160
He was even standing on tiptoe.

408
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:13,960
So cute.

409
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,600
Now you're starting to reflect on yourself, right?

410
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,000
Guys do.

411
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,760
Really.

412
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,640
Of course they do.

413
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,800
Seeing someone that tall,

414
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,240
and with such a good physique,

415
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,120
guys, more or less,

416
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,440
will feel some pressure.

417
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,240
I'm really curious,

418
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,760
Xu, you're so handsome,

419
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,760
do you still care about these things

420
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,120
and feel insecure?

421
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,080
Yes.

422
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,360
What's wrong?

423
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,520
I feel like I have a bit of that too.

424
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,720
One-sided feelings.

425
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,440
What do you think?

426
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,560
I feel like the way she responds

427
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,440
is that kind of

428
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,520
you know what I mean,

429
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,000
just

430
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,920
very polite.

431
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,440
Just friends.

432
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:10,880
So,

433
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,720
I feel sad.

434
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,080
I got emotionally involved.

435
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,440
Actually, I don't know.

436
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,480
So just now,

437
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,720
I came across "The Answer to a Crush" again.

438
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,440
I just felt

439
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:22,880
there's this feeling

440
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,720
of not knowing what I'm doing.

441
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,200
Not knowing what I'm doing.

442
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,000
Not knowing what I'm doing.

443
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,680
You just feel like

444
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,320
I feel that way too.

445
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:38,800
What am I doing?

446
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,760
Who does he actually like?

447
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,960
I can't tell right now.

448
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,120
I think Ruilong is also talking about his own feelings.

449
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,240
What am I doing?

450
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,200
I don't know.

451
00:17:59,200 --> 00:17:59,960
I really don't know.

452
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,440
I've never been in this kind of situation before.

453
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,840
You really fell for them.

454
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,400
Really fell for them.

455
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,200
Yeah, it's definitely real feelings.

456
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,440
Yeah.

457
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,120
Getting caught up in your own emotions

458
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,600
feels very real.

459
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,280
It's so real.

460
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,640
Take it slow.

461
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,000
You really have to take it slow.

462
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,920
There's still plenty of time.

463
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,840
It seems like it's better for him to take it slow right now.

464
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,000
Yeah.

465
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,280
Can I text you?

466
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:51,920
Don't say anything.

467
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,680
I just had this

468
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,920
urge to text you too.

469
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,200
Actually, let me tell you,

470
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,160
do you feel anything about their interaction?

471
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:01,680
Actually, it's still

472
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,800
really genuine.

473
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,400
Very genuine.

474
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,520
So genuine.

475
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,240
They're great, the "Jiao Long" duo.

476
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,200
Xiao Jiao's conversation

477
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,880
was very sincere and genuine.

478
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,800
It expressed her true feelings.

479
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,280
How to let go of oneself

480
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,880
and how to learn to love oneself better.

481
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,280
I think this

482
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,040
is especially important.

483
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,080
But what does it mean to love yourself?

484
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,560
You can treat yourself

485
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,720
as your own best friend.

486
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,000
Often,

487
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,520
when we look at our friends,

488
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,400
we see many of their strengths.

489
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,040
But when we look at ourselves,

490
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,600
we tend to see many flaws.

491
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,200
Right.

492
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,600
And when the same thing happens,

493
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,520
if it's your best friend who did it,

494
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,440
you might say to them,

495
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,960
"You've already done well enough."

496
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,800
But if it's yourself,

497
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,800
you might think,

498
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,240
"How could you do it like this?"

499
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,120
Right, so one

500
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,200
simple technique

501
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,480
is to treat yourself

502
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,960
as your own best friend.

503
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,480
Think about how you would treat them,

504
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,600
how you would see them.

505
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,440
Zihan's arrival really is

506
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,000
making our Xiao Jiao

507
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
and Dr. Fang

508
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,680
quite anxious.

509
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,880
Yes, they care a lot.

510
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,240
Like Xiao Jiao mentioned,

511
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,040
one issue is

512
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,160
he feels his affection is one-sided.

513
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:09,920
Right.

514
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,720
Actually, this word

515
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,640
used in this context

516
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,600
feels pretty heavy to me.

517
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,560
If you were Xiao Jiao,

518
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,400
what do you think he should

519
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,640
do at this moment?

520
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,440
If he wants to stay true to himself,

521
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,880
maybe he should just keep doing

522
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,360
what he's doing now.

523
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,480
Because his goal

524
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,760
isn't necessarily

525
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,280
to get a response from Rulan.

526
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:28,920
But maybe

527
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,760
at least he won't

528
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,120
leave himself with regrets.

529
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:41,800
What?

530
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,200
A message just came in.

531
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,160
When a newcomer moves in,

532
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,560
they get a special privilege to invite someone on a date.

533
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,800
He can invite

534
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,240
any member of the opposite sex

535
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,600
for a one-on-one date.

536
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,520
And

537
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,160
the other person can't refuse.

538
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,160
Invite someone on a date?

539
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,440
Yes.

540
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,480
It's a newcomer privilege.

541
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,400
He'll invite a girl in person.

542
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,880
He'll invite a girl in person.

543
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,080
Looking forward to it.

544
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,560
I think it will be Chichi.

545
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,960
I just made a prediction.

546
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,000
Who?

547
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,360
The Chinese doctor said I have too much dampness.

548
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,960
You can tell just by looking at the tongue.

549
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,200
Let's not check today.

550
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:35,840
Maybe.

551
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,840
Maybe Duoduo will too.

552
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,320
You guys probably don't ski.

553
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,840
I can do both snowboarding and skiing.

554
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,520
Me too.

555
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,120
What do you think my

556
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,000
MBTI type is?

557
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,400
What is it?

558
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,440
ENFJ.

559
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,560
Is it that easy to guess?

560
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,600
Then can you guess mine?

561
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,440
ENTJ.

562
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,520
Both are J types.

563
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,560
It's more comfortable together.

564
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,120
Long time no see.

565
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,080
Long time no see.

566
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,560
She is a museum guide.

567
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,400
She gives tours.

568
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,760
That's awesome.

569
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,920
Wang Jue might have a chance.

570
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,760
Chichi.

571
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,480
Chichi.

572
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:34,920
Who?

573
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,760
Who?

574
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,880
Indeed, during this process,

575
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,200
except for Lu Yuan,

576
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,440
he has interacted with everyone.

577
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,080
There are connections with each person.

578
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,680
So in this process,

579
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,800
how should he choose?

580
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,600
Next, we're about to move on to

581
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,320
Next, we're about to move on to

582
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,840
our official reasoning session.

583
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,720
This time, for the reasoning,

584
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,360
we'll be doing it individually,

585
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:00,800
in a solo format.

586
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,480
in a solo format.

587
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,400
The Cupid who guesses correctly

588
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,160
will receive a Heartstone.

589
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,840
So now,

590
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,760
everyone can

591
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,840
on their own small blackboard

592
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,160
make their own choice.

593
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,880
Who do you think Zi Han will invite?

594
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,200
Just put the photo of whoever

595
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,840
next to his.

596
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,880
He won't end up choosing his friend, right?

597
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,880
That would be so weird.

598
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,640
Who did you all pick?

599
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,000
I'm really curious.

600
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,440
Chi Chi.

601
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:26,840
Chi Chi.

602
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:27,960
But I'm choosing between

603
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,800
Chi Chi and Duo Duo.

604
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,760
I'm deciding between them.

605
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,880
I don't think it'll be Duo Duo.

606
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,600
Duo Duo is too much like a friend.

607
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:33,960
I'm going with Chi Chi.

608
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,200
Because I think that

609
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,880
he expressed that

610
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,960
the two of us are both J types (Judging personality),

611
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,000
so we can get along well.

612
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,600
We're pretty much on the same wavelength.

613
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,320
I think it's pretty obvious.

614
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,360
So, Chi Chi.

615
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,280
I think Duo Duo has a great personality.

616
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,400
And if they're together,

617
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,760
they can freely share and express themselves.

618
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,080
I think that's really important.

619
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:51,840
I am...

620
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,080
Why do I feel like it's

621
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,840
who?

622
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,120
I actually chose Wang Jue too.

623
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,160
Why do I think it's Wang Jue?

624
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,120
First of all, I actually hope

625
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,080
Wang Jue

626
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,600
would take her eyes

627
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,920
off Le Chen

628
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,600
and look away.

629
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,280
Look away.

630
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,280
One,

631
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,400
two,

632
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,800
I think

633
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,600
what if the two of them really like skiing?

634
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,040
Actually, their

635
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,320
chemistry and those little details

636
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,280
can be understood.

637
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,040
Okay.

638
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,280
I want to create a surprise.

639
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,800
And then Yifan and

640
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,160
Lanlan came in together.

641
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,480
So after Lanlan came in,

642
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,400
the boys didn't really

643
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,160
say they felt awkward.

644
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,440
So those two interacted the least.

645
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,440
I was thinking,

646
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,360
could they be the dark horse?

647
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,560
The two people who interacted the least

648
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:41,960
and then

649
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,960
ended up being invited out.

650
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:43,680
Because I think

651
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,560
he might think

652
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,960
explaining that

653
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,800
museum thing

654
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,480
is really cool.

655
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,920
Then I want to make a bet with you.

656
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,560
If I win the bet,

657
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,520
you give me your Heartstone.

658
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,000
Do you dare?

659
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,840
How are you two exactly the same?

660
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,160
No wonder you two have the same personality.

661
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,480
Life is about taking risks.

662
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,760
Yes, I agree with that.

663
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,360
Don't provoke my competitive side.

664
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,600
I've thrown it out.

665
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,040
I've even thrown out my box.

666
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,680
Since that's the case,

667
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,520
But I want two.

668
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,320
Okay, including the box.

669
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,040
I'm giving you everything.

670
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,480
Alright.

671
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,000
Honey, let me give you a heads up.

672
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,360
I had the most last season.

673
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,600
How did you win?

674
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,920
You used these tactics, didn't you?

675
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,920
Last season, I was called "the strongest in the universe."

676
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,200
But bro, you're really too conservative.

677
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,400
Because I also think that's true.

678
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,040
You won't step out of your comfort zone this way.

679
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,920
No way.

680
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,440
I have to push you now.

681
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,560
You need to have the courage to face risks.

682
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,360
Life is a "game."

683
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,440
When jasmine blooms, it's a sign of excitement.

684
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,480
Next, we move on to

685
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,760
Master Kong Jasmine Tea's refreshing and exciting moment.

686
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,840
Everyone, the thrilling moment has arrived.

687
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,600
So, in the end,

688
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,920
Which Cupids can

689
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,400
successfully get the raw gem?

690
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,320
We'll reveal it soon.

691
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,080
My heart is really pounding.

692
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,600
It's happening.

693
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,600
Who is it?

694
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,480
Went up to the second floor.

695
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,720
So it's one of those on the second floor.

696
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,360
One of the three girls.

697
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,200
Who is 8202?

698
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,160
Who?

699
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,680
Who?

700
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,320
Who?

701
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,080
Who?

702
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,800
Yifan.

703
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,400
Is Chichi here?

704
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,680
Alright, Chichi is here.

705
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:56,680
It's over.

706
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:57,880
She's not.

707
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,680
I've already lost.

708
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,560
Is Chichi here?

709
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,040
But...

710
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,120
She already washed her face.

711
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,280
Then can you ask her for me?

712
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,360
If she has time.

713
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:11,600
To go...

714
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:12,640
On a date.

715
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,720
Then wait a moment.

716
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,520
I'll ask her right now.

717
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:16,960
Wait a second.

718
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,120
Hold on a moment.

719
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,800
Still need someone to pass the message.

720
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,640
Um...

721
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,480
Brother Herry.

722
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,080
He asks when you're free.

723
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,120
To go on a date.

724
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,520
Give me a time quickly.

725
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,240
He's still at the door.

726
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,920
What time can I say?

727
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,840
Do I have any time to choose?

728
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,480
I...

729
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,800
I'm free after work.

730
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,560
I'll ask.

731
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,760
Sorry.

732
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,440
She's really happy.

733
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:55,920
Yes.

734
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:02,600
Is that okay?

735
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,480
She can.

736
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,080
Thank you.

737
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:08,840
Alright.

738
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:10,720
Get some rest early.

739
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,640
Why didn't I hear anything from the audience?

740
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,880
Where's the applause for us?

741
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,000
Can you clap a bit harder?

742
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,520
Didn't you see "The Strongest in the Universe"?

743
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,360
Is it back?

744
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,440
Someone else guessed it right.

745
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,280
How did everyone...

746
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:28,920
I mean,

747
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:29,680
Yeah.

748
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,720
Let's also congratulate

749
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,960
Chun Ye for winning

750
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,200
I am

751
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,560
"The Strongest Sidekick in the Universe."

752
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,560
Is that still not enough?

753
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,720
That's awesome.

754
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,080
Also awesome.

755
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:38,680
Let me tell you,

756
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,560
the rest of us

757
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,520
we gained courage.

758
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,440
Yeah.

759
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,840
We need courage just to live.

760
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,600
At times like this,

761
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,760
because of all this buildup,

762
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,960
that's why you two shine so brightly.

763
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,080
We ignite ourselves

764
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,040
to light up others.

765
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:49,800
To light up you two.

766
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,480
I have a gift for you.

767
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,160
Do you know?

768
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:56,840
Look.

769
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,080
The "charity" of the winner.

770
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:58,360
I want it.

771
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,920
No, really.

772
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,680
What?

773
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,200
But I think you can guess.

774
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,400
Maybe you can guess it.

775
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,360
There really is.

776
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,640
It can't be a guest, right?

777
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,080
A guest gave you a gift.

778
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,520
They sent a male guest.

779
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,360
Specially from under the table.

780
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,760
Pulled out a male guest.

781
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,280
So fast?

782
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,440
Do you want to see?

783
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,160
Yes.

784
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,880
What is this?

785
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,520
No way.

786
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:23,720
What is this?

787
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,560
What is it?

788
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,480
Hurry and open it.

789
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,320
So happy.

790
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,320
I love watching others receive gifts.

791
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,160
What?

792
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,640
A pearl necklace.

793
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,920
Do you still remember last time?

794
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,920
Lanlan and the others.

795
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,720
This is them opening the oyster.

796
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,120
One pearl or a whole strand?

797
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,400
The two of us are still discussing it.

798
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,960
They think a single pearl looks nice.

799
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,320
But I think a whole strand looks pretty good too.

800
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,760
A whole strand is also beautiful.

801
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,600
It looks great.

802
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,080
Everything gets a response.

803
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,880
Brother Xu is just...

804
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,440
Brother Xu, you really...

805
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,480
Why are you still single?

806
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,080
I don't get it.

807
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,040
Help me out, thanks.

808
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,600
Stacking them looks great.

809
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,800
Looks good.

810
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,840
I got up really early this morning.

811
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,280
I was worried I'd have dark circles.

812
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,440
Speaking of that,

813
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,600
I have something fun.

814
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,720
You can try it out.

815
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,080
Look.

816
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,360
That's amazing.

817
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,240
This is the Marubi Peptide Red Pen Eye Cream.

818
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,160
It has their exclusive massage head design.

819
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,360
It even has a built-in microcurrent.

820
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,800
You can give it a try.

821
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,360
Just hold this metal part with your hand.

822
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,240
It forms a closed circuit with your body.

823
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,120
It will vibrate.

824
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,680
It helps the eye cream absorb better.

825
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,280
And inside,

826
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,240
it also contains 25%

827
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,640
of high-concentration peptides.

828
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,360
Roll it around a bit,

829
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,160
and it quickly fades dark circles.

830
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,080
The next day, your eyes look bright after using it.

831
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,240
I'm really tempted.

832
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,640
You have to let me try it.

833
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,440
Of course.

834
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,560
Thank you.

835
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,440
Changed to a different style of clothing.

836
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:21,880
Here I am.

837
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,360
Looking forward to it.

838
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,600
Hello.

839
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,160
Hello.

840
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,200
Hello.

841
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:56,800
You've worked hard.

842
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,000
You had a tough day today.

843
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,720
I came right after finishing work.

844
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,720
Let's walk around.

845
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,360
Sure.

846
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,880
It's so beautiful here.

847
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,720
Yes, I was looking at the sky.

848
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,120
Isn't it better to be outdoors?

849
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,320
There are mountains, water, and bamboo.

850
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,320
So beautiful.

851
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,560
Zihan is really good at picking places.

852
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,640
Chose an outdoor spot.

853
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,240
I really love the outdoors.

854
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,600
It's better than walking in the city.

855
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,240
Yeah.

856
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,040
Thank you so much.

857
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,200
You pulled me out of this place in Shanghai—

858
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,880
—out of my cubicle.

859
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,640
Their outfits match well.

860
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,160
They really look like a couple.

861
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,520
Yeah, what's going on?

862
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,400
Have you ever tried kayaking?

863
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,360
No.

864
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,080
Have you?

865
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,840
I have.

866
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,040
But I'm not that skilled.

867
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,560
Please put on a life jacket.

868
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,760
Okay.

869
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,600
Okay.

870
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,240
I'll help you get on.

871
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,000
Is it okay now?

872
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,800
All set.

873
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,120
This

874
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,400
This one is a bit narrow

875
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,400
It's a bit cramped for me

876
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,440
The boat is really small for him

877
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,560
His legs

878
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,920
are too long

879
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,320
Then you sit in the back one

880
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,920
Wait a second

881
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,240
Is this okay?

882
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,040
Are you ready?

883
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,520
Yes

884
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,040
Let's go

885
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,360
We're off

886
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,800
Start singing

887
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,160
How does it feel?

888
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:20,840
Pretty good

889
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,560
I really want to paddle away

890
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,120
Where do you want to paddle to?

891
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:25,840
Just keep paddling

892
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:26,720
Paddle where?

893
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,240
Come on, charge!

894
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:27,720
Charge!

895
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,480
We're about to hit a tree

896
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,040
Look how in sync those two are

897
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,720
Are we in sync?

898
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,640
We're completely opposite

899
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,480
Totally opposite

900
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,240
Yeah

901
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,360
This is real "social butterfly" energy

902
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,720
Even with strangers, you have to

903
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,960
say hello

904
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,640
I just love to

905
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,720
talk to strangers

906
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,160
If I get

907
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,560
recognized

908
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,680
I just ask if they want a photo together

909
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,080
I really love chatting with people

910
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,320
You're so naturally outgoing

911
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,960
I'm actually pretty

912
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:18,800
naturally outgoing

913
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,960
There's a hole over there, let's go in.

914
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,920
It does feel a bit scary.

915
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,440
So you don't like this kind of thing?

916
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,680
Scary stuff, right?

917
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,760
Yeah, I'm timid.

918
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,120
I also have a fear of heights.

919
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,520
You have a fear of heights?

920
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,680
I get dizzy as soon as I stand up.

921
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,720
That's hilarious.

922
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,240
Do you like amusement parks?

923
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:00,960
I do.

924
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,880
And I like riding roller coasters.

925
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,240
Have you ever been to a theme park?

926
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,080
No, I haven't.

927
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,320
Got it.

928
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,520
I think saying "got it" is really cool.

929
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,240
Understood.

930
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:14,680
Got it.

931
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:15,800
Got it.

932
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,880
We can go ride a roller coaster next time.

933
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,280
What's that?

934
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:20,640
It's just—

935
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,240
The most thrilling roller coaster.

936
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,720
But you said you're afraid of adventure.

937
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,680
I'm just timid.

938
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,880
It doesn't conflict with being adventurous.

939
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,840
Being timid and adventurous aren't mutually exclusive.

940
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,800
I'm hooked.

941
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,000
This line is about the boy.

942
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,360
She still has a good impression of him.

943
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,360
Right, Shi Ce?

944
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,280
That's it, it's done.

945
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:52,960
Now I'm following your moves.

946
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,080
It's really harmonious.

947
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,760
Let’s row our oars together.

948
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,600
I don't want to go back.

949
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,200
Is it this way of doing things?

950
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,000
It really gets rid of the "work vibe."

951
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:07,880
All my colleagues are at work.

952
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,520
But I'm on vacation.

953
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,120
Yeah, I'm in Anji.

954
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,000
If I didn't have to work,

955
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,680
and could be in a place like this every day,

956
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,400
it would be pretty nice.

957
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,440
Actually, you can just lie down here too.

958
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,120
Just go with the flow for a while.

959
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:24,800
It's really nice.

960
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,360
The atmosphere between those two is very comfortable.

961
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,600
It's very natural.

962
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,280
You two don't seem very balanced.

963
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,600
Really?

964
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,280
Yeah, I'm worried the boat might tip over, right?

965
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,480
Really? The front of the boat is too heavy.

966
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,160
Let's switch.

967
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,000
I'll get off first.

968
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,600
It's very natural.

969
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,040
Let's switch.

970
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,160
Okay.

971
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,680
We'll just cross it directly later.

972
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,120
We're heading out.

973
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,080
Let's go.

974
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,520
This feels great.

975
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,160
Yeah.

976
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,440
So, what do you usually like to eat?

977
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,200
I prefer hotpot.

978
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,880
I love it too.

979
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,160
There's nothing

980
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,720
that a hotpot meal can't fix.

981
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,600
I'm just like you.

982
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,440
That's so sweet.

983
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,120
Then you must really like traveling too.

984
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,000
I love traveling.

985
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,960
Me too.

986
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,480
Have you ever gone rafting?

987
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,920
I have.

988
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,160
I never have.

989
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,520
There will be plenty of chances.

990
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,840
I feel like, among all the girls,

991
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,760
I'm the most introverted.

992
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,680
Didn't you say when someone is in control

993
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,800
you just want to take a break?

994
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,840
I think when no one

995
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,440
is in control,

996
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,520
you have to say it's all

997
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,480
a sign of being responsible.

998
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,040
Really?

999
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,440
You're so good at complimenting people.

1000
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,120
Because I'm the same.

1001
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:16,720
Just like you.

1002
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,080
Let's go.

1003
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,320
Do you want me to help you?

1004
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,000
You're welcome.

1005
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,280
You're welcome.

1006
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,040
I think those two are together now.

1007
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,440
I think they have that vibe.

1008
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,480
That environment

1009
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,280
makes it easy to feel that vibe.

1010
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:52,800
Yeah.

1011
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,200
Mainly, they're really on the same wavelength.

1012
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,280
Is it barbecue today?

1013
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,320
Yeah.

1014
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,760
Are there a lot of mosquitoes in places like this?

1015
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,680
A lot.

1016
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:06,880
Yeah.

1017
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,400
Let me give you some mosquito repellent first.

1018
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:11,960
I'll help you put it on.

1019
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,080
Okay.

1020
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:13,720
Let's see where you want to put it.

1021
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,960
Why didn't you ask which one I wanted?

1022
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,840
They all feel the same.

1023
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,080
They all feel the same.

1024
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,720
I want this one.

1025
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:25,720
Alright.

1026
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,760
Where should I put it?

1027
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,480
Stick it here.

1028
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,240
It's on.

1029
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,600
It's on.

1030
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,080
Okay.

1031
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,040
Let me spray some of that on you first.

1032
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:41,880
Mosquito repellent spray.

1033
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,600
Did he prepare all these things?

1034
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,200
Yeah.

1035
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,040
He prepared everything.

1036
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,200
That's impressive.

1037
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,640
Turn around.

1038
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,000
Do you attract mosquitoes?

1039
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,240
I do.

1040
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,040
Then you can attract more of them.

1041
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,720
I really feel like the two of them are getting closer.

1042
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,880
I didn't expect that.

1043
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,240
It was beyond my expectations.

1044
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,520
I wanted to get some advice from you.

1045
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:12,760
What?

1046
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,120
Like, how to quickly adapt to this

1047
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:14,640
(life in Heartbeat Apartment).

1048
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,840
Actually, I just got used to it myself.

1049
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,360
I haven't adapted yet.

1050
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,000
I was really stressed out last night.

1051
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,880
Mainly because it's an unfamiliar environment.

1052
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,280
And I'm not familiar with many people here.

1053
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,320
But you're better off.

1054
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,960
You already have friends here.

1055
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,960
So what is there to worry about?

1056
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,440
Yeah.

1057
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,560
I really didn't expect such a coincidence.

1058
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,920
And then I ran into a friend.

1059
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,720
Before, the two of us were just

1060
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,440
at a friend's gathering in Beijing.

1061
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,000
That's how we met.

1062
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:41,880
Yeah, and then later

1063
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,360
she went back to Shanghai and we didn't really keep in touch.

1064
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,320
I didn't expect the world to be so small.

1065
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,440
That we could meet again here.

1066
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,360
I was really surprised yesterday.

1067
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,800
He started talking about

1068
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,960
their relationship.

1069
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,800
To ease her concerns.

1070
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,320
Yeah, don't misunderstand.

1071
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,320
Yeah, don't misunderstand.

1072
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,160
It's also a kind of

1073
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:54,920
reporting, in a way.

1074
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,440
Yeah.

1075
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,360
Just telling you what happened to me yesterday.

1076
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,400
Don't overthink it.

1077
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,280
She's always like that,

1078
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,120
always picking on me.

1079
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:05,920
Yeah.

1080
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,880
Isn't that what friends do?

1081
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,000
Are you hungry?

1082
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,720
Hungry.

1083
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,480
Super hungry.

1084
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,640
Do you know how?

1085
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,640
This.

1086
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,200
Pick it up and take a look.

1087
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,240
Will we be able to eat today?

1088
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,560
We can eat.

1089
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,520
I'll just do it my way.

1090
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,240
Okay.

1091
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,400
Do you eat spicy food?

1092
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,400
I eat very spicy.

1093
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,000
Go on.

1094
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,560
I'm fine.

1095
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,000
Go on.

1096
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,040
If you want to continue, I'll add more.

1097
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,200
But it can also stay like this.

1098
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,600
The flavor comes out quickly.

1099
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,200
Do you want to sit over here?

1100
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,120
Because the smoke is drifting that way.

1101
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,120
I'll sit over there.

1102
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,440
If there's too much smoke, I'll move over here.

1103
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,160
Right.

1104
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,440
Look, this is good smoke.

1105
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,680
Even the smoke is helping.

1106
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,360
Right.

1107
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,440
Grilled lamb chops.

1108
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,160
Grilled lamb chops.

1109
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,360
A bit.

1110
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,160
Difficult.

1111
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,400
Let's try it.

1112
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,200
Do you want to try?

1113
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,240
Sure.

1114
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,600
You come and try.

1115
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,240
Where's the oil?

1116
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,320
Oil.

1117
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,440
Here.

1118
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,520
Add oil first.

1119
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,280
Seal in the flavor.

1120
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,320
Professional.

1121
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,440
Those two are really laughing happily.

1122
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,600
I like the current atmosphere.

1123
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,200
The light right now.

1124
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,200
At night.

1125
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,040
Are you looking forward to meeting the people in the cabin?

1126
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,200
What kind of people do you expect?

1127
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,040
For example,

1128
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,040
In what way?

1129
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:51,600
What do you mean?

1130
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,480
Just everyone.

1131
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,520
Just the girls.

1132
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,440
For me,

1133
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,000
I hope to meet someone

1134
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,680
whose values are similar to mine.

1135
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,080
And it would be best if

1136
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,920
we have common interests and can have fun together.

1137
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,800
So you're the friendship type, right?

1138
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,560
How do you think the friendship type shows itself?

1139
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,720
It's also about being able to have fun together.

1140
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,680
And then,

1141
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,120
Lovers should be the best of friends.

1142
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,160
What kind of person can become your friend?

1143
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,720
People who hide things

1144
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:37,960
can't become my friends.

1145
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,960
That's really spot on.

1146
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,640
I think my friends are basically

1147
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,920
First of all,

1148
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,960
they have to be like me,

1149
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,400
very straightforward.

1150
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,440
Say whatever's on their mind.

1151
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,280
Very sincere.

1152
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,080
My identity is being straightforward.

1153
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,960
Show your true self.

1154
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,400
What do you think about the guys in the cabin?

1155
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,440
How are the boys?

1156
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,760
There are some quality issues.

1157
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,880
Like yesterday, Lanlan said

1158
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,640
she thinks everyone is

1159
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,440
masters of deadpan jokes

1160
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,240
the best at it

1161
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,320
Like Brother Jiao

1162
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,320
he cleans every day

1163
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:23,880
that's really nice

1164
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,200
it's good to notice things that need doing

1165
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,320
Lechen cooks

1166
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,320
He made all the food yesterday, right?

1167
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,200
Not bad

1168
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,680
It won't jump up here, will it?

1169
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,040
If it jumps up, it'll go straight in here

1170
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,520
Do you eat this?

1171
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:45,960
Eat what?

1172
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:46,880
Bullfrog.

1173
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,600
I used to really like eating it.

1174
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,400
Now it's just okay.

1175
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:51,360
How about you?

1176
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,080
I'm not picky about food.

1177
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,480
Me too.

1178
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:55,920
I eat everything.

1179
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,480
I eat everything too.

1180
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:01,320
Even with durian,

1181
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,760
I eat the whole thing at once.

1182
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,240
And I really love eating it.

1183
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,040
Durian desserts.

1184
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,080
You two are a perfect match.

1185
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,520
Both durian lovers.

1186
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,680
I absolutely love desserts.

1187
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,400
Doesn't that mean you should be together?

1188
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:19,760
No.

1189
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,320
That means you can't date anyone else.

1190
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:22,960
Go on dates with anyone else.

1191
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,360
A match made in heaven.

1192
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,840
I also quite like puppies.

1193
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,520
You like puppies?

1194
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,920
I like both puppies and kittens.

1195
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,480
Now we're talking about walking dogs.

1196
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,080
Walking dogs.

1197
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,040
So what's your favorite dog?

1198
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,640
I like Border Collies.

1199
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,480
My favorite dog is Alaskan Malamute.

1200
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:45,960
But I haven't walked one yet.

1201
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,400
That's okay.

1202
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,760
There will be another chance next time.

1203
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,320
This conversation is something else.

1204
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,360
The dog would say, in my whole life,

1205
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,600
I've never been walked like this.

1206
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:57,840
The dog would say, this is too much.

1207
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:08,320
Judging by your appearance

1208
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,760
you seem like someone who would be fierce.

1209
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,760
Am I fierce?

1210
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,440
When I saw you last night

1211
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,640
at our first meeting,

1212
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,200
I felt a strong sense of pressure.

1213
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,240
Hello.

1214
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,680
Your aura is quite strong.

1215
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,120
Hello.

1216
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,240
What about now?

1217
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,120
Not anymore.

1218
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,040
Not anymore.

1219
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,760
After talking for a while,

1220
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:43,800
you're actually very funny.

1221
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,800
The art of language.

1222
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,520
See, this is a girl

1223
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,600
giving you high praise.

1224
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,360
Let me take a picture of you here.

1225
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,480
Just press this to take it.

1226
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,480
Three, two, one.

1227
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,800
You're really good at posing.

1228
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,240
How come, with a hundred poses I do,

1229
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,160
you never change yours?

1230
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,920
Why do you lift this?

1231
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,800
This is great, I like it.

1232
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,920
I think Chichi will fall for him.

1233
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,360
Because she was already smiling over there.

1234
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,120
She was blushing from smiling so much.

1235
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,200
It was obvious.

1236
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,520
Her reaction clearly shows

1237
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,680
she still likes Zihan.

1238
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,120
About her invitation,

1239
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,960
just now, during that scene,

1240
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,080
I couldn't even hear what they were saying.

1241
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,160
Just looking at their eyes and smiles,

1242
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,400
the corners of their mouths,

1243
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:43,960
the way they lingered,

1244
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,120
everything about them

1245
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,200
was lifted up, pulled up.

1246
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,160
It's hard for it to come down.

1247
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,160
I think the two of them

1248
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,680
Look, just now they wrote two words again.

1249
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:55,520
It's done.

1250
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,240
This episode was really worth coming to.

1251
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,280
Now they've already become a couple.

1252
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,920
Then we'll take your good wishes.

1253
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,440
From Chichi's perspective,

1254
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,520
I think there are two reasons why she was moved.

1255
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,120
The first one, Chichi already mentioned.

1256
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,920
I don't like people who hide things.

1257
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,360
She definitely likes people who are special,

1258
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,680
straightforward and direct.

1259
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,360
And then,

1260
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,280
he asked, "Have you ever been to

1261
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,240
a theme park?"

1262
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:17,960
She said she hadn't.

1263
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:18,760
"Got it."

1264
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:19,240
That's it.

1265
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,320
Just those two simple words,

1266
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,760
show how straightforward he is.

1267
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,000
Chichi would definitely like that.

1268
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,480
The second point is also important.

1269
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,240
From a girl's perspective, it's the contrast.

1270
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,560
She just said,

1271
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,720
"You seemed so fierce when you came in,"

1272
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,480
hands in pockets, looking super cool.

1273
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,880
But when he was rowing the boat,

1274
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,720
he told Chichi,

1275
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,840
"I'm actually timid."

1276
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:37,360
And you said you're afraid of adventure.

1277
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,760
I'm just timid,

1278
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,120
but that doesn't mean I can't take risks.

1279
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:42,920
He brings a kind of

1280
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,320
in front of others,

1281
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,680
he's the cool guy,

1282
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:49,200
but in front of you, he's a little fool.

1283
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:50,800
So I think

1284
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:51,920
this contrast

1285
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,240
is also attractive to girls.

1286
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,440
So I think this date

1287
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,440
was really high-quality.

1288
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,320
I think there's something really important.

1289
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,560
He tried to explain.

1290
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,880
His relationship with Lanlan.

1291
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:05,440
Hurry up and say it.

1292
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,040
I think girls can sense this.

1293
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,280
He really cares about her.

1294
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,160
So he makes a special effort to

1295
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,280
point this out.

1296
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,080
He reports his relationship with this girl to you.

1297
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,440
So you won't misunderstand.

1298
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:15,960
And I think

1299
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,120
guys at this moment

1300
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:18,480
are actually really cute.

1301
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:20,520
I completely agree.

1302
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,160
With what Xu said.

1303
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,800
He’s articulate and knows how to express himself.

1304
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,000
He’s quite smart.

1305
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:25,920
And he’s good at communicating.

1306
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,280
He can express himself and clear up misunderstandings.

1307
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,760
I think this kind of guy really makes people

1308
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:31,480
feel at ease.

1309
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:32,880
Feel at ease and even moved.

1310
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,160
Because I think a lot of times,

1311
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,800
girls tend to be a bit awkward.

1312
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:38,120
They care a lot but don’t say it.

1313
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,040
I’m like that too.

1314
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:39,920
A bit awkward in this way.

1315
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,320
So at times like this,

1316
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:43,360
I really need a guy who can communicate well.

1317
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,360
Actually, among regular friends,

1318
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,920
you don’t really report your whereabouts.

1319
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:47,600
Right.

1320
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,560
You only do that when you have feelings for someone.

1321
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:52,160
You can’t help but share what you’re doing.

1322
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,160
And this act of reporting

1323
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,040
can easily make someone’s heart flutter.

1324
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:54,880
It’s really sweet.

1325
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:55,920
Yeah.

1326
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,680
Right now, you can really feel

1327
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,240
the way these two interact.

1328
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:00,680
The signals are

1329
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:01,800
pretty obvious.

1330
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:02,560
The signals are strong.

1331
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,040
Very strong, almost overflowing.

1332
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:05,600
It makes us look forward to

1333
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,600
how they’ll get along in the future.

1334
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:07,920
What it will be like.

1335
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:50,520
Let's go.

1336
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:52,880
Let's go for a walk together (Nicole).

1337
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,480
Yu Xing is quietly approaching.

1338
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,240
Do you know about this trash?

1339
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:55,880
Do you know where they throw it?

1340
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:57,040
Your trash.

1341
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:57,720
You can leave it at the door.

1342
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:59,000
You can take it over when you walk the dog.

1343
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,320
Leave it at the door, right?

1344
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,400
Yes, leave it at the door.

1345
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,280
I'll take it later.

1346
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,200
Take it over.

1347
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:04,960
What should we do now?

1348
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,080
Do you want to come along?

1349
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:06,960
It's fine, just follow.

1350
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,120
He really followed.

1351
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:09,640
Okay.

1352
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:10,160
Why?

1353
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:10,800
This season of "Signal of the Heart"

1354
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,520
is so good.

1355
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:12,840
Its shape

1356
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,520
is just like tamagoyaki.

1357
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,280
I just want to make tamagoyaki.

1358
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,440
Really? I love eating it.

1359
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:17,920
Let me beat it.

1360
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:18,840
I'm super fast at beating.

1361
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:19,600
Okay.

1362
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,280
This is so delicious.

1363
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,080
Thank you.

1364
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,480
This is so delicious.

1365
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:26,480
So delicious.

1366
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,480
I'm so happy everyone likes it.

1367
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,680
The first one with a clean plate.

1368
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:29,720
The first one with a clean plate.

1369
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,480
Le Chen's key is missing.

1370
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:34,400
What?

1371
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:35,600
That secret message of affection.

1372
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:36,080
Who is it?

1373
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,880
It should be Duo Duo or

1374
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:38,520
Lu Yuan.

1375
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:39,440
Have you eaten?

1376
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,080
I brought roast duck.

1377
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:41,000
You really brought roast duck?

1378
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,400
Really brought roast duck.

1379
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,760
It must be Lu Yuan.

1380
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:44,400
Your secret

1381
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,080
is about to be revealed.

1382
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,360
Just wait to be invited.

1383
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:47,840
Duo Duo.

1384
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:48,720
Duo Duo opened it.

1385
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,080
It's Duo Duo.

1386
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,520
We're about to ride the little train.

1387
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:53,560
Hurry and tell me who.

1388
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,680
Who is it?

1389
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:56,760
Who?

1390
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,120
I really want to know.

1391
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:58,880
Who is it?
