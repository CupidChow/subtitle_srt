1
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,560
My name is Yang Ruqing

2
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,840
I'm Hou Zhuocheng

3
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,720
We're both guests for season six

4
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,680
Today we've arrived at

5
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,960
Heartbeat Apartment

6
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,480
It's divided into a sleep zone
and a living zone

7
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,400
This little house feels so spacious

8
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,800
That's a windmill

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,200
So fresh, so romantic

10
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,160
Let's go

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,840
Windmill

12
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,200
Why are there so many windmills here?

13
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,680
Because the wind's blowing

14
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,040
That means hearts are fluttering

15
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:16,640
Okay

16
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,120
Let's go

17
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,600
Follow me

18
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,200
This is the living room

19
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,160
Looks like it can fit a lot of people

20
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,960
Of course, if there are too many people

21
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,760
they can sit on the floor like Hou Zhuocheng

22
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,200
I usually just

23
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,320
I just lie on the floor now

24
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,520
This sofa looks really comfy

25
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,400
Go ahead, try lying down

26
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,560
There's a ball here too

27
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,280
Throw it over there

28
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,520
Or I can switch and film you

29
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,840
This is the kitchen

30
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,360
This is where we cook

31
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,200
Feels nostalgic

32
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,040
I think this is actually nicer than

33
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,880
the little house we had back then

34
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,040
The cooking environment here

35
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,360
feels more like a drama set

36
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:00,840
Yeah, for example

37
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,400
Yeah, for example

38
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,440
You wake up every morning

39
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,280
and walk out from here

40
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,920
and see me working hard cooking there

41
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:05,920
Then you say

42
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,840
Then you send me a heartbeat message

43
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,480
Never mind

44
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,520
Not funny at all

45
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,520
It's raining outside

46
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,360
If they're inside the house

47
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,360
but dating outside

48
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,680
and it suddenly rains, what then?

49
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,080
That's romantic too

50
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,920
Getting soaked together is romantic

51
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,520
The best part isn't the rainy day

52
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,120
It's sharing shelter with you from the rain

53
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,720
Living zone

54
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:45,880
Hurry

55
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,600
Finally

56
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,120
This one's exposed

57
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,760
This is

58
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,440
Wait a second

59
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,680
This needs a close-up

60
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,080
This

61
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,000
Setting off fireworks

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,440
So romantic

63
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,080
We've now arrived

64
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,880
in the Heartbeat Apartment kitchen

65
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,280
Today's main goal is

66
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,760
to gossip for you all

67
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,000
and ask about their relationships

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,680
Yes

69
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,560
What's for dinner tonight?

70
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,040
It's prepared by Chef Hou for you

71
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,920
Hotpot

72
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,120
Hotpot

73
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,240
Hotpot brings people closer together

74
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,160
It's a really great food for that

75
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,160
Back to my old profession again

76
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,360
"Cook"

77
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,080
Yeah, I cook once every two years

78
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,480
Don't roast me

79
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,000
Hurry, food's coming

80
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,680
Hurry, food's coming

81
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,440
Food's here

82
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,800
Shouldn't you shake hands when people come in?

83
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,280
Hello, everyone

84
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,160
Hello

85
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,440
Hello

86
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,560
Hello, everyone

87
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,760
Hello, everyone

88
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,880
Hello, that's great

89
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,680
So much food

90
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,680
Take a seat

91
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,280
Okay

92
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,920
Hello

93
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,760
Let's introduce ourselves

94
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,760
My name is Yang Ruqing

95
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,600
This is Hou Zhuocheng

96
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,880
And we're both season six guests

97
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,640
My name is Xu Rulan

98
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,360
You look much better than in the video

99
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,000
My name is Sun Hanqing

100
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You can call me Chichi

101
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Chichi, got it

102
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,560
Hello, I'm Xiaoyuan

103
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,840
Where are you all from?

104
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,160
I'm from Jiangxi, Nanchang

105
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,960
So you can handle spicy food

106
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,440
Yeah, we're having hotpot today

107
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,800
Here's the sauce station we set up for you

108
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,600
Let me mix mine

109
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,080
This

110
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,760
Our photos

111
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,240
Yeah

112
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,280
I remember this one

113
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,600
I saw you two take this one

114
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
This one too

115
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,960
My favorite is this one

116
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,960
Looks great

117
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,240
So did he

118
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,080
slide down this slide?

119
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,200
We've all slid down

120
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:05,800
This

121
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,760
They've all slid down

122
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,280
"Gloriously wounded"

123
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,080
You must be pretty hungry, right?

124
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,440
You’ve been waiting for us a long time?

125
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,880
Had a little something at noon.

126
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,200
He didn’t eat.

127
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,120
Just saving up for hot pot.

128
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,680
Do you have a “chef” this season?

129
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,080
Yes.

130
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:25,880
Who is it?

131
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,760
Wang Lechen.

132
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,840
And Little Doctor Fang.

133
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,360
Of course.

134
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,480
So the “chef” is the one who finds love.

135
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,720
Where did you come from?

136
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,720
I’m from Shanghai.

137
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,240
From Shanghai.

138
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,680
Yeah.

139
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,800
That’s pretty close.

140
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,760
We just moved from Beijing to Suzhou.

141
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,560
Why did you want to move to Suzhou?

142
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,200
We were just thinking—

143
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,480
About the next step in life,

144
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,120
we need to settle on

145
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,360
a place to live long-term.

146
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,240
Because I really like

147
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:55,720
the feeling Suzhou gives me.

148
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,920
The feeling Suzhou gives me.

149
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,440
How long have you been here?

150
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,840
Just finished moving everything in.

151
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,080
Still in the honeymoon phase.

152
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,520
Actually, Herry (Liu Zihan) too—

153
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,640
He didn’t move from Beijing to Shanghai.

154
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,240
He just arrived.

155
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,480
And I think right now he’s probably

156
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,280
also in an adjustment phase.

157
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,000
So you’re in the same city now?

158
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,280
Yeah, both in Shanghai.

159
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:18,840
After leaving the little house—

160
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,640
After leaving the little house—

161
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,360
Did things change between everyone?

162
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,640
Quite a lot.

163
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,560
Let me think.

164
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,160
I’ll pick two to share.

165
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,600
After leaving the little house,

166
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,720
I think it’s just—

167
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,600
He’s a super clingy person.

168
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
Clingy.

169
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,720
Really, really clingy.

170
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,880
You wouldn’t guess.

171
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,560
He’ll hang onto you.

172
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,360
Stick to you, that kind.

173
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,320
He calls himself “Little Darling.”

174
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,320
“Little Darling.”

175
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,200
So sweet.

176
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,680
So sweet.

177
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,640
We’ve pretty much left the Heartbeat Apartment.

178
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,240
It’s been exactly one month.

179
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,120
Exactly one month.

180
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,160
You guys—

181
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,720
So,

182
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,040
how often do you see each other?

183
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,000
I think we’ve met

184
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,800
at least fifteen times.

185
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,520
That many?

186
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,320
So, every other day.

187
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,800
Does he visit you on weekends?

188
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,920
He does.

189
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,880
Every weekend.

190
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,640
Every time.

191
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,880
That’s adorable.

192
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,000
It’s honestly not easy.

193
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,800
Weekends are his only time off.

194
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,080
He thinks

195
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,000
even if he drives over just for a meal,

196
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,920
it’s worth it, even if he has to go back.

197
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,120
Little Doctor Fang is really great.

198
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,040
We should call him Big Doctor Fang now.

199
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,160
He’s so generous.

200
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,880
That’s truly wonderful.

201
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,480
The honeymoon phase.

202
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,920
Totally inseparable.

203
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,800
What about Xiaoyuan?

204
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,640
After we left the Heartbeat Apartment,

205
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,120
After leaving the Heartbeat Apartment,

206
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,560
we could only meet on weekends.

207
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,200
So maybe once

208
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,360
a week, something like that.

209
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,680
He’s always traveling for work.

210
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,480
He’s rarely in Hangzhou.

211
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,520
Last week,

212
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,480
we met up to play mahjong.

213
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,040
Was it with your friends?

214
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,920
Or with someone else?

215
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,800
It was our friends.

216
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,040
One of my friends,

217
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,520
just my friend,

218
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,360
and one of his friends.

219
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,080
Right.

220
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,040
Is there an age difference

221
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,240
between you and the guy?

222
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,000
Is there a bit of an age gap?

223
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,760
Yes.

224
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,560
Zihan is five years older than me.

225
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,040
I’m four years older than him.

226
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,800
I think age doesn’t matter for men.

227
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,240
What matters is how he treats you.

228
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,560
Isn’t a man’s charm

229
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,200
his ability to solve problems?

230
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,280
Exactly.

231
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,200
And some people

232
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,440
have that ability from a young age.

233
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,200
He actually

234
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,000
didn’t get it from dating a lot.

235
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,640
He just lives well on his own.

236
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,640
So he can help

237
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,880
you live well together with him.

238
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,800
Do you ever feel any friction?

239
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,760
What kind of friction?

240
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,000
Right after leaving the Heartbeat Apartment,

241
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,920
I felt

242
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,720
sometimes

243
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,360
one person’s world

244
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,320
and another’s world

245
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,240
when they intertwine,

246
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,520
there’s bound to be

247
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,240
some collision.

248
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,800
Yeah, like tectonic plates.

249
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,680
There will be collisions.

250
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,960
Like two islands

251
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,920
merging together,

252
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,000
they have to blend.

253
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,880
That can cause small conflicts.

254
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,960
So it’s totally normal.

255
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,360
A lot of people ask

256
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,360
if he always listens to me at home,

257
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,280
or if he listens to me on big things

258
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,360
and to him on small things.

259
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,000
That kind of division—

260
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,840
we don’t really do it that way.

261
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,800
For us,

262
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,160
it’s about each specific thing.

263
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,200
Like ordering fruit,

264
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,440
he might go to one fruit shop,

265
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,640
I go to another.

266
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,680
We see whose fruit

267
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,280
tastes better in the end.

268
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,800
And consistently tastes good.

269
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,040
That works.

270
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,600
Then the next person

271
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,880
gets the “right” to order fruit

272
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,040
for that round.

273
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,160
If I do better

274
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,160
than him at this,

275
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,760
he’ll automatically hand over

276
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,600
the “right” to me.

277
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,400
That’s how it goes.

278
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,760
We divide things up

279
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,760
by who’s better at what.

280
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,440
Who’s more suited

281
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,800
to each task.

282
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,160
There are lots of interesting questions about this.

283
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,880
So we just

284
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,680
answer the question.

285
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,560
That’s it.

286
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,640
Let’s do a sample.

287
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,720
I’ll pick a blue one.

288
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,360
That’s a tough one.

289
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:17,920
Let’s pick another.

290
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,520
Too sharp, pick another.

291
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,160
What? You can’t tell us?

292
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,280
What?

293
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,600
Then she’d lose that friend.

294
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,120
She’d lose that friend.

295
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,720
You jinx, keep quiet!

296
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,600
Will Princess Lanlan pick a blue one?

297
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,400
She will.

298
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,000
Why is hers so sweet?

299
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,440
“Spectating”

300
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,680
I call him Little Doctor Fang—

301
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,520
Little Doctor Fang,

302
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,880
even though it sounds so formal.

303
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,880
Do you get it?

304
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,000
I get it.

305
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,880
Yeah.

306
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,280
Didn’t we also call him Doctor Fang

307
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,120
in the Heartbeat Apartment?

308
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,800
No, it’s just—

309
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,840
You added “Little.”

310
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,200
Yeah, he said

311
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,520
no one calls him Little Doctor Fang.

312
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,520
It’s either Little Fang or Doctor Fang.

313
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,600
But Little Doctor Fang

314
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,080
just feels inexplicably affectionate.

315
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,880
Little Doctor Fang.

316
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,960
And then—

317
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,080
When he wears a shirt,

318
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,840
I always get butterflies.

319
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,400
When he’s in a shirt,

320
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,680
he’s even more “Little Doctor Fang.”

321
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:36,880
Exactly.

322
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,520
That’s the feeling.

323
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,920
What does he call you?

324
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,560
Princess Lanlan.

325
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,720
Princess Lanlan.

326
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,040
You wouldn’t guess, Doctor Fang.

327
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,440
I'm so curious.

328
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,720
I think the two of us are just

329
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,920
If I don't reply to him for a while,

330
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,480
I'm just transferring at the train station.

331
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,280
He might worry that I'm upset.

332
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,680
Then he sends me tons of explanations.

333
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,480
This kind of situation

334
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,240
I think

335
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:28,840
he's really cute.

336
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,280
So I tell him,

337
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,200
I'm not angry.

338
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,040
I'm really not upset or anything.

339
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,240
Please don't think I'm upset.

340
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,280
Is it that guys lack a sense of security?

341
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:46,920
Or

342
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,720
maybe he's just a bit cautious.

343
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,960
Yes, actually when we're together,

344
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,280
there are moments like this.

345
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,640
Maybe my focus

346
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,360
is on the problem itself.

347
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,440
I'm always trying to solve the issue.

348
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,520
That's my way of thinking.

349
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,480
Herry (Liu Zihan) is more

350
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,720
emotion-driven.

351
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,760
And when he expresses himself,

352
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,960
he starts by addressing emotions.

353
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,120
But I might

354
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,680
rush to solve the problem first.

355
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,000
And I'm very direct when I speak.

356
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,240
So sometimes

357
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,120
I'm afraid I might hurt his feelings.

358
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,760
It's not really necessary.

359
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,600
Don't think that way.

360
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,560
I just feel like

361
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,560
from a guy's perspective,

362
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,640
he definitely cherishes this relationship.

363
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,920
That's why

364
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,960
he seems so careful.

365
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,160
I think you can first figure out

366
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,840
what's causing his fear.

367
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,840
He's afraid you'll leave him.

368
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,880
Darn it, hope it's not me.

369
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,120
First, maybe

370
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,360
you've shown negative emotions before

371
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,120
and he picked up on that.

372
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,360
So now he's extra cautious.

373
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,960
Second, maybe his past experiences

374
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,720
make him think

375
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,960
girls get upset easily.

376
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,120
So he feels he needs to go along with you.

377
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,400
He just tries to go along.

378
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,160
So I think you should

379
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,640
address the root of his fear.

380
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,960
Find out what the real reason is.

381
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,800
Then talk it out.

382
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,320
About this issue.

383
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,880
Because I think when two people

384
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,520
interact,

385
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,400
clashing opinions is what I find interesting.

386
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,480
So I really want to hear

387
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,080
the other person's perspective.

388
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,240
But if

389
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,360
the other person cares more about your feelings

390
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,120
and doesn't share their own views,

391
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,880
I feel like

392
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,920
they're just agreeing with me.

393
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,640
At first,

394
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,120
everyone has things they don't want

395
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,360
to be seen by others right away.

396
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,560
to be seen by others right away.

397
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,600
I think you can use actions

398
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,440
to give him a sense of security.

399
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,680
Help him lower his guard faster.

400
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,600
So how do I

401
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,680
get the other person

402
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,760
to share more of their thoughts?

403
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,640
I actually want to see

404
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,720
the real person inside.

405
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,360
Have a deep conversation.

406
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,000
But we don't have as much time as Princess Lanlan.

407
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,040
It's not as long.

408
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,680
Lots of deep talks.

409
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,360
You two probably have lots of deep talks.

410
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,920
Actually, Little Doctor Fang

411
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,320
isn't someone who really likes

412
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,400
deep conversations.

413
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,520
Especially at the beginning.

414
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,360
But I told him,

415
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,320
I'm someone who

416
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,280
needs that kind of connection.

417
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,640
Like mental communication,

418
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,240
or deep conversations.

419
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,120
To understand each other better.

420
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,920
We're in a long-term relationship.

421
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,000
So I hope

422
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,120
we can both

423
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,520
see the real person early on.

424
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,920
Because we'll

425
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,400
face many things and challenges together.

426
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,520
"Lan Jie"

427
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,160
So from now on, I'll call you "Lan Jie".

428
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,840
At first, you should state your needs.

429
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,600
And when you do,

430
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,640
the guy will definitely

431
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,360
be happy if the girl he likes needs him.

432
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,600
He'll feel happy himself.

433
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,880
It shows that to him,

434
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,720
you're very important.

435
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,120
You also rely on him a lot.

436
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,040
When you face trouble, you think of him.

437
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,680
Yes.

438
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:42,720
Right.

439
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,200
It's true, nothing was said or expressed.

440
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:44,520
Right.

441
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,720
A strong Chinese woman for life.

442
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,400
I am a bit strong-willed.

443
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,320
I think it depends on the situation.

444
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,480
If it's because of the other person,

445
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,920
and a conflict happens,

446
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,840
I hope he'll sort it out himself

447
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,320
and come to me right away.

448
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,040
Actually, I'm curious

449
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,920
about Xiaoyuan and Lechen's progress.

450
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,320
It's still

451
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,440
pretty slow.

452
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,960
Every couple has their own

453
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,160
pace and progress.

454
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,640
They might not even be a couple.

455
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,440
It's just that nothing was said.

456
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,560
After leaving the little house,

457
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,960
things didn't suddenly get much better.

458
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,840
Nor did things suddenly

459
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,640
get much worse, either.

460
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,600
It's still like in the little house—

461
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,240
how everyone was inside,

462
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,640
and how things are outside.

463
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,080
The pace is still the same.

464
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,800
So is this pace set by you?

465
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,240
Honestly, I feel like

466
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,720
but maybe he's someone

467
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,360
who moves even slower than I do.

468
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,000
Maybe both sides have

469
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,560
a bit of a mismatch

470
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,200
in their pace.

471
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,000
That's how it is.

472
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,000
I think it's also because you're starting school soon.

473
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,080
In a relationship,

474
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,120
if you want it to last,

475
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,160
going long-distance right away is tough.

476
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,840
Because there are many things

477
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,920
you haven't built yet.

478
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,760
So I think

479
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,240
you're not exactly

480
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,160
in no rush right now.

481
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,520
I think deep down, you're a bit anxious.

482
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,160
A little, yes, but...

483
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,360
Isn't he anxious?

484
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,840
He...

485
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,080
He's a bit better than before.

486
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,400
Because back in the little house,

487
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,000
he was really, really slow.

488
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,120
I think you could just

489
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,360
bring this up and talk about it directly.

490
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,120
Like, the fact you'll be long-distance soon.

491
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,840
Have you two discussed it?

492
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,720
We've talked about it.

493
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,480
But it feels pretty stressful.

494
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,640
Does he feel like you're

495
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,200
pushing him to make a decision?

496
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,000
A little, yes.

497
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,720
But I think

498
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,400
if it were me,

499
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,440
I'd see this as

500
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,240
a pretty urgent matter.

501
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,520
But actually,

502
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,400
since leaving the little house,

503
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,240
it's been a month now.

504
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,760
We only meet on weekends.

505
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,320
And during the week,

506
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,480
we just chat a bit on WeChat.

507
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,920
But on WeChat,

508
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,920
we can't really talk about deep topics.

509
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,600
It's definitely not as direct

510
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,680
as face-to-face.

511
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,800
So I think it's still better

512
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,720
to take things slowly.

513
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,720
Just try to meet more often.

514
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,240
Yeah.

515
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,640
But going long-distance later

516
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,760
will slow things down even more.

517
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,880
How much time do you have left before school?

518
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,960
How much time do you have left before school?

519
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,800
Are you going to ask?

520
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,480
How much time do you have left?

521
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,400
It's not like you're never coming back.

522
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:44,560
Really.

523
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,600
That's crucial.

524
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,560
Maybe after I start school,

525
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,520
I'll have to go to Beijing.

526
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,840
In a month,

527
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,360
we might only meet two or three times.

528
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,160
That's how it'll be.

529
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,320
So I'm thinking,

530
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,760
when we can't see each other that often,

531
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:01,120
how can we both maintain

532
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,440
a balance between love and life?

533
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,920
Long-distance still needs a goal.

534
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,360
If you're in Beijing,

535
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,440
will you consider coming back to Hangzhou after graduation?

536
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,680
I'll return to the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai area.

537
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,760
Right, so that's something to look forward to.

538
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,160
It means you two have

539
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,720
a future where you can be together long-term.

540
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,880
So during this period,

541
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,520
both sides really need to

542
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,440
put in more effort.

543
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,840
I have a tip.

544
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,880
In psychology,

545
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,000
there's something called the Thirty-Six Questions—
a set of psychological questions to deepen relationships.

546
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,320
The questions in the Thirty-Six Questions

547
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,120
can quickly bring you closer

548
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,320
in terms of your outlook on life

549
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,880
and values.

550
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,720
The more you get to know someone,

551
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,360
the more special they become to you.

552
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,040
Because really,

553
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,480
spending time to understand someone

554
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,400
in all aspects

555
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,440
means you invest more energy in them.

556
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,640
Much more, actually.

557
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,240
So in your heart,

558
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,320
they'll definitely be

559
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,480
different from everyone else.

560
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,120
The Little Prince loved his rose

561
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,720
because he spent so much time on her.

562
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,640
So let him come see you a few more times.

563
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,640
I think that's totally fine.

564
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,080
And when he comes to see you,

565
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,040
you should appreciate and understand

566
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,040
his effort.

567
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,320
So have your feelings for him

568
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,520
changed at all?

569
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,920
Not really.

570
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,840
That's fine then.

571
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,120
Just stick to what you want to do.

572
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,720
As long as you're comfortable.

573
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,560
I think I'll still

574
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,920
go with whatever makes both of us

575
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,240
feel more comfortable together.

576
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,920
You have your own pace.

577
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,840
Don't rush just because someone else "finished."

578
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,400
Don't hurry to "finish" yourself.

579
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,160
Are you curious about what guys think?

580
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,480
Do they talk about us to you?

581
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,400
Do you think guys might feel

582
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,480
that it's totally fine?

583
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,960
I don't think so.

584
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,320
I think guys might actually

585
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,320
be really confident.

586
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,640
Hello.

587
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,360
Hello.

588
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,240
Hello.

589
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,320
Hello.

590
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:08,840
So handsome.

591
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,160
Hello.

592
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,160
Nice to meet you.

593
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,240
Have a seat.

594
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,320
Little Doctor Fang

595
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,400
Today you need to come clean.

596
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,240
Okay.

597
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,080
How are you two doing lately?

598
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:23,800
No problem.

599
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,240
I think we're heading

600
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,720
in a positive direction.

601
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,320
Definitely.

602
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,280
Actually, it's all good.

603
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,280
I think it's gotten even sweeter.

604
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,040
She's adorable every day.

605
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,280
Like a sweet, cute little bunny.

606
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,320
You don't need to tell me that.

607
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,800
Have you chatted this past week?

608
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,360
Yes.

609
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,960
Sent some emojis.

610
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,080
And some couple memes.

611
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,720
Talked about things

612
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,880
we hadn't discussed in the apartment.

613
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,200
We meet every weekend.

614
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,080
Sometimes she comes to me, sometimes I go to her.

615
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,040
And then we happened to

616
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,920
wait at a crosswalk for the light.

617
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,400
She was across, I was on this side.

618
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,280
She was wearing something blue

619
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,000
— anyway, a super pretty outfit.

620
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,560
Even in a crowd,

621
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,520
I spotted her instantly.

622
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,160
That moment was so sweet.

623
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,080
She'd wave at me from afar.

624
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,360
Yeah, just smiling over there.

625
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,560
The way she treats me

626
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,560
is different from how she treats others.

627
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,680
So I feel really

628
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,920
happy and lucky.

629
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,120
The changes she's made for me,

630
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,080
I've noticed all of them.

631
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,840
I hope we keep getting better together.

632
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,320
I think that's called being brave in love.

633
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,000
She told us

634
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,440
that with many things,

635
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,880
you might be too easygoing.

636
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,600
Like,

637
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,400
maybe it's just

638
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,240
I don't know how to put it.

639
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:03,640
For example,

640
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,960
last time, EatEat told us

641
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,800
like if I ask you what to eat today,

642
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,960
and you reply,

643
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,800
"What do you think?"

644
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,360
She throws the question to you,

645
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,160
and feels like

646
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,040
you just toss it back to her.

647
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,360
In my view,

648
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,920
if we have this kind of question,

649
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,480
I usually go along with others.

650
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,240
More often than not.

651
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,880
But she thinks maybe

652
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,760
I'm always just agreeing with her.

653
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,640
So I don't really show

654
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,880
my own thoughts.

655
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,680
Girls feel that

656
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,640
if you always go along,

657
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,120
she'll worry

658
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,840
you're bottling up your feelings.

659
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,880
And one day, you might explode.

660
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,880
That could hurt the relationship.

661
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,040
So if you act more like yourself,

662
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,160
it'll feel more comfortable.

663
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,840
And things will last longer.

664
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,680
I agree, I totally agree.

665
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,760
A great partner is someone

666
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,480
who can keep the relationship strong

667
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,680
while doing what comes naturally.

668
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,560
I really understand her

669
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,120
point of view.

670
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,480
She actually hopes

671
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,240
to set you apart from others

672
00:23:59,240 --> 00:23:59,880
— to make a distinction.

673
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,400
A distinction.

674
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,800
It's all in the details.

675
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,840
She might find them cute or special.

676
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,680
Getting a bit flustered.

677
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,840
A little flustered now.

678
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,880
I believe that later on,

679
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,480
we can make up for

680
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,080
not being in Zhoushan

681
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,440
and missing out on fun with everyone.

682
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,680
We can create lots of

683
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,400
great memories of our own.

684
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,040
I think that's great.

685
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,480
Last time, I also talked with Xiaoyuan.

686
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,040
She said maybe your pace

687
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,880
is a bit slower.

688
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,240
But you're still getting to know each other.

689
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,800
Honestly,

690
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,440
I think the apartment is

691
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,560
a really rare opportunity.

692
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,880
It lets two people really focus

693
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,760
on their relationship.

694
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,000
But

695
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,160
I do have a lot of concerns.

696
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,960
We still have to return to real life.

697
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,880
What you have to face

698
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,360
are these problems and challenges.

699
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,400
There really are

700
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:57,920
differences in life stages

701
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,880
between two people.

702
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,880
Because for sure,

703
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,080
past experiences have an impact.

704
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:04,880
Right.

705
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,000
I respect that everyone

706
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,680
has their own past wounds

707
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,280
and some stress responses.

708
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,680
But if, in a relationship,

709
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,280
because of past experiences,

710
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,720
you start to have expectations

711
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,000
or assumptions about the next person,

712
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,160
or fears,

713
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,280
don't you think

714
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,080
that's not really fair to her?

715
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,280
Yes.

716
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,360
I'd like to ask for advice.

717
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,160
Did anything happen between you before?

718
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,560
After the show ended,

719
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,720
the two of us broke down our old selves,

720
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,080
and started to rebuild.

721
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,320
The feelings for each other

722
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,880
maybe need to reset our impressions

723
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,440
completely back to zero,

724
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,240
then, in real life,

725
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,280
we interact as a normal couple,

726
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,360
getting to know each other.

727
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,720
And then,

728
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,440
fall in love again, over and over.

729
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,040
I understand.

730
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,520
I feel like, just as you said,

731
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,200
the two really return to real life.

732
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,360
You need to break things down again,

733
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,760
and get to know each other anew.

734
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,840
With a solid foundation,

735
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,840
you move on to the next stage.

736
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,720
I think that feels more genuine

737
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,960
and even more stable.

738
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,640
She’s starting grad school in September.

739
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,920
She’s truly outstanding.

740
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,640
And then,

741
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,680
she got a guaranteed spot for grad school.

742
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,760
After she goes back,

743
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,880
it’s a new chapter in her life.

744
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,080
We asked her about it.

745
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,480
She didn’t give a

746
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,880
definite answer about your relationship.

747
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,320
I think we should leave it to time.

748
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,600
We meet again, Haitao.

749
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,280
We meet again.

750
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,120
Hello.

751
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,600
Hello, teachers.

752
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,080
Hello.

753
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:41,800
Hello, teachers.

754
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,600
You sit with Hani.

755
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,240
I want to sit with Xu too.

756
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:47,520
Sure.

757
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,040
Zihan, do you want to sit next to me?

758
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,120
Well, everyone’s seated.

759
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,600
It’s all good.

760
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,480
Welcome to our family.

761
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,200
Welcome, all our friends.

762
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,480
One after another.

763
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:05,920
"Awesome!"

764
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,200
We’re just great.

765
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,120
Our whole big family is here.

766
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,840
We’re thriving, you know.

767
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,200
So, Ma Boqian, let’s start with you.

768
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,640
You talk about

769
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,120
how Zihan’s been lately.

770
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,200
How things are going.

771
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,240
Just chat a bit.

772
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,480
Are you happy?

773
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,120
I’ve been pretty happy lately.

774
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,280
No, can you ask something important?

775
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:32,560
Because after watching the finale,

776
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,280
After watching the finale,

777
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,960
I cried so hard I almost passed out.

778
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,160
Then you ask the key question.

779
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,600
Go ahead.

780
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,760
Are you really happy?

781
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,440
Is it that kind of

782
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,040
What stage are you at now?

783
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,720
Yeah, what’s your current status?

784
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,960
Yeah, what’s the status?

785
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,680
It’s a rather

786
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,040
very happy and blissful state.

787
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,320
And we

788
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,400
also have lots of

789
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,080
adjustments offline.

790
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,320
We try to use

791
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,040
a comfortable way to get along.

792
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,520
Chichi, share with us.

793
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,560
Duoduo is really observant.

794
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,560
Share with Chichi again.

795
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,080
Let’s talk.

796
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,480
About your recent situation.

797
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,080
How do you feel about it?

798
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,280
Because maybe from

799
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,720
a twelve-person big family,

800
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,480
suddenly stepping out,

801
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,360
back to real life.

802
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,240
So, Zihan and I, afterwards,

803
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,000
also wanted to

804
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,720
continue the heartbeat from the little house.

805
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,920
For example, after work,

806
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,680
when I’m free,

807
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,920
we go out to eat together.

808
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,840
We hang out on weekends too.

809
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,520
We actually see each other quite often.

810
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,160
There are lots of happy moments.

811
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,920
We’ve gotten to know each other better

812
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,800
and understand each other more fully.

813
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,480
It’s pretty good.

814
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:46,800
Good.

815
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,040
Our seating arrangement

816
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,080
Ruilong and Duoduo

817
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,240
Our moves today are all pretty "mysterious."

818
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,920
You handled the transition really well.

819
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,720
How has Yuxing been lately?

820
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,440
Pretty good recently.

821
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,400
Yeah, I've been quite happy too.

822
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,000
Yeah.

823
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,920
Pretty happy.

824
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,960
Yeah, especially today.

825
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,160
Just being with everyone in the house.

826
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,160
Getting together again.

827
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,280
Has Yuxing watched our show lately?

828
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,040
Yeah, he has.

829
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,400
He has.

830
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,680
He saw some of his own

831
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,720
Well,

832
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,280
abstract expressions.

833
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,360
There’s a bit of

834
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,280
a third-person perspective.

835
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,240
I realized I really do have

836
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,240
some abstractness.

837
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,880
As for understanding Yuxing,

838
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,720
there’s one thing that’s a bit much.

839
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,440
Is it late now?

840
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,920
Is it late now?

841
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,320
Eight o'clock.

842
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,120
It’s past that now.

843
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:40,840
And you still...

844
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,120
Yeah, I was thinking back then

845
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,040
eight o'clock should be fine.

846
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,440
Not too late.

847
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,160
I do have a question.

848
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:50,560
Well,

849
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,120
You mentioned "Iron Kid Train Hero."

850
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,280
So you really watched it as a kid?

851
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:53,680
"Iron Kid Train Hero"?

852
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,000
I really did watch "Iron Kid Train Hero."

853
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,040
We're the same age.

854
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:56,840
I get you.

855
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:57,960
I had the whole set of toys.

856
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,640
I thought it was great.

857
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,600
You've got good taste.

858
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,680
Have you seen it?

859
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,600
No.

860
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,720
He hasn't seen it either.

861
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,240
Yeah.

862
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,720
It's cool.

863
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,240
That's the end of the chat.

864
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:08,760
That's the end of the chat.

865
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,520
That's all I wanted to say.

866
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,800
I think it's awesome he likes "Iron Kid Train Hero."

867
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,800
That's impressive.

868
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:12,840
Yeah.

869
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,080
Where do you want to sit?

870
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,840
Go chat with Brother Jiao.

871
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,120
Old Xu, sit here.

872
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,800
This is a "banquet with rotating seats."

873
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,880
Yeah, it really is a "banquet with rotating seats."

874
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,280
Jiao, come chat with us.

875
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:41,800
Jiao.

876
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,920
No problem, Tao.

877
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,800
How have you been lately?

878
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:44,880
Lately...

879
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,320
To be honest,

880
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,680
I've been through it all.

881
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,080
Go ahead.

882
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,560
When I record some shows,

883
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,560
I also go through these things.

884
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,800
Recently, I've probably received a lot

885
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,000
I think

886
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,520
some of it is feedback from everyone,

887
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,200
and some are suggestions.

888
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,560
Honestly, at first,

889
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,760
there was a bit

890
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,440
I felt a little sad emotionally.

891
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,200
But

892
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,320
But actually, I think it's okay.

893
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:13,000
Because as long as it's advice,

894
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,800
as long as it's "feedback,"

895
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,480
it all helps me

896
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,680
maybe become better in the future.

897
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,280
If there's something I didn't do well,

898
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,680
I actually want to

899
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,520
improve and grow.

900
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,600
Yeah.

901
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,040
Because I think

902
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,000
don't label things as good or bad.

903
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,080
I don't think anything is truly bad.

904
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,120
Everyone has their own qualities.

905
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,880
And we all really like Jiao.

906
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,360
I think you have a lot of

907
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,200
great qualities.

908
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,600
Like your courage and sincerity.

909
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,080
I think that's really moving.

910
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:44,560
Yeah.

911
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,320
You really take care of everyone.

912
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,240
You're very thoughtful about your friends' feelings.

913
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,960
I think these are strengths in life,

914
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,480
no matter where you are.

915
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:53,520
Because

916
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,480
you're actually

917
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,400
a very attentive and careful person.

918
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,400
Actually, Ma,

919
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,200
Ma Boqian shared a topic

920
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,800
and I think he put it well.

921
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,880
It's that we need to

922
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,680
learn to give love,

923
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,280
but also learn to hold back.

924
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,880
Love is mutual,

925
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,880
it needs room to breathe.

926
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,240
Don't force yourself.

927
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,120
If you're upset, talk to friends and let it out.

928
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,880
You don't have to be thoughtful all the time.

929
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,920
Yeah, it's fine.

930
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,080
See, you're crying again.

931
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,920
No,

932
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,920
it's okay.

933
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,520
But you're definitely a great friend.

934
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,440
And a really good person.

935
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:25,960
We see that.

936
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,520
Your relationships with everyone

937
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,800
are really amazing.

938
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,480
Thank you, everyone.

939
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,480
Because I think

940
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,320
romantic relationships aren't the only kind.

941
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,760
Hani, do you have anything

942
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,560
you want to say to Ruilong?

943
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,480
Let's be open.

944
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,360
Since we're talking like this,

945
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,400
let's speak up.

946
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,720
Because I saw

947
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,280
so many people I really like.

948
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,080
So I got really excited.

949
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,120
I've been "watching the drama" from here to there.

950
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:52,800
Chichi.

951
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,960
Can we switch seats?

952
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,000
I want to grab some melon.

953
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,800
Sure, go ahead.

954
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,520
So, how is it?

955
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,520
Because I'm talking about those two.

956
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,600
Actually, everyone knows on the show

957
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,160
that Ma and I really like Ruilong.

958
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,000
We really support Ruilong.

959
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,240
So I've been asking

960
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,240
about their follow-up.

961
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,320
When you asked, who answered for them?

962
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,040
How did they respond?

963
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,040
Tell us.

964
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,960
I think in the apartment,

965
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,160
everyone is really great.

966
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,720
I...

967
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,760
I think

968
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,840
so

969
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,480
Ruilong, you're so slow.

970
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,880
Our show is for members.

971
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,920
But let me say something.

972
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,680
They were the first to

973
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,800
have a private dinner together.

974
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,880
Darn it, everything's exposed.

975
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,440
Darn it.

976
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,480
Darn it, they don't even know.

977
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,160
Shocking—Duoduo and Ruilong

978
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,960
had dinner together after the show.

979
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,720
What led to that?

980
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,880
The two of them went out to eat.

981
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,880
Wait, Ruilong, you need to explain clearly.

982
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,320
Ruilong.

983
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,320
Ruilong, that's not how you usually speak Chinese.

984
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,280
Please, say it properly.

985
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,520
Come on, seriously.

986
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,480
Well, because of Ruilong...

987
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,320
Sit down.

988
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,000
I saved you a seat.

989
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,400
You've always come.

990
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,400
Who invited whom?

991
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,200
Privately.

992
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,760
I didn't get an answer.

993
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,280
Did you know that?

994
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,680
You know what was funny just now?

995
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,480
When we went to the little house,

996
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,360
the one we talked to most was him.

997
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:33,880
And him, too.

998
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,720
I really asked him three questions.

999
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,280
He replied with just one word.

1000
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,280
Yeah, just a single word.

1001
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,760
That's how often, so...

1002
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,680
I think you should stay seated.

1003
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,720
Otherwise, it won't make sense.

1004
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,200
I wanted to get some "outside help."

1005
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,120
Yes.

1006
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:47,760
You.

1007
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,160
Can I?

1008
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:49,960
Right.

1009
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,320
Duoduo, help him out.

1010
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,240
About him...

1011
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,280
How about this, you sit here.

1012
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,480
I'll stand, I'll stand behind him.

1013
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,440
I'm sitting.

1014
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,840
During this process,

1015
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,200
whether it's Ma Boxian,

1016
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,320
or Hani,

1017
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,000
even when we're watching the show,

1018
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,280
we hope you two interact more.

1019
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,720
We did, we talked a lot.

1020
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,200
We actually had a great time chatting.

1021
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,800
And we were really open.

1022
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,320
Because I came to Changsha recently,

1023
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,400
to film the Watch Party.

1024
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,040
Then the two of us met up offline.

1025
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,360
We had another

1026
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,600
long, open conversation.

1027
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,520
And at the end,

1028
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,880
well, just the two of us,

1029
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,880
we hugged.

1030
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,840
How did you hug?

1031
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,640
Just like...

1032
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,520
Just a quick hug.

1033
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,520
A bro hug.

1034
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,400
We shared what's on our minds.

1035
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,440
Yeah, we said everything we felt.

1036
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,360
Let me be direct.

1037
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,160
I...

1038
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,040
Right now,

1039
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,760
I'm seeing someone.

1040
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:40,720
Getting to know them.

1041
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,480
Are they here?

1042
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,160
No, not here.

1043
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:50,720
Ruilong.

1044
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,600
If you find your other half,

1045
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,720
I'm truly happy for you.

1046
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,800
Because I'm anxious.

1047
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,360
You're slow.

1048
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:55,840
Yeah.

1049
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,480
But someone will match your pace.

1050
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,960
Someone who resonates with you.

1051
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,080
Duoduo, share with us.

1052
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,480
How have you been lately?

1053
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,880
I've been feeling pretty good lately.

1054
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,640
After I left,

1055
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,800
I went back to

1056
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,760
my old routine.

1057
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,560
I regularly

1058
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,760
go cycling and diving.

1059
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,080
Honestly, I'm really happy.

1060
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,120
I chose when to start my trip,

1061
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,880
and ending it felt complete.

1062
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,040
After gaining new perspectives,

1063
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,360
I feel even more fulfilled.

1064
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,520
I got what I wanted from this.

1065
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,880
It made me more determined.

1066
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,920
The journey matters more.

1067
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,080
I'm happy.

1068
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:25,880
I got to experience

1069
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,120
life in a little house like this.

1070
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,240
Yeah.

1071
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,080
And I think with...

1072
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,120
Should we chat with Jue'er?

1073
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,240
Yeah, Jue'er, how have you been?

1074
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,040
You guys suddenly seem like

1075
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,240
an interview show.

1076
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,880
Because this is important.

1077
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,000
The most important question.

1078
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,920
Right? Have you been happy lately?

1079
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,280
I've been pretty happy lately.

1080
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,040
It feels like a lot of things before,

1081
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,400
because of life or work,

1082
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,520
we're no longer in the same city.

1083
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,080
Friends I rarely talked to,

1084
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,520
found me again through this show.

1085
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,840
Because Jue'er watched the show with us,

1086
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,240
we can still feel

1087
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,600
she's so Northeastern.

1088
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,520
She's bold and brave.

1089
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,920
But we all sense

1090
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,760
your genuine honesty.

1091
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,840
And you're really pure and cute.

1092
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,440
I...

1093
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,080
Live a simpler life.

1094
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,560
It's nice. Just be yourself.

1095
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,440
Yeah.

1096
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,360
Be yourself comfortably.

1097
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,080
Okay.

1098
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,320
Alright, so...

1099
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:17,960
Minghao.

1100
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,880
You two,

1101
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,400
had a great time in Xinjiang.

1102
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,040
Let's ask now.

1103
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:22,720
Yeah.

1104
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,280
Let me reveal something about myself.

1105
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,240
It's because of the two of them

1106
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,280
I heard a lot of Minghao's voice clips

1107
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,240
Thank you all

1108
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,000
Minghao kept on

1109
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,760
Minghao, tell us what's going on over there

1110
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,240
Share a bit about how things are now

1111
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,400
There's room for one more here now

1112
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,160
Isn't that a coincidence

1113
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,520
Why is there always a spot for me

1114
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,120
See, I'm really so lucky

1115
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,200
When I watched that scene of you two

1116
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,560
It truly felt so wonderful

1117
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,560
I felt the same when I watched

1118
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,920
Members should watch it too

1119
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,680
There are so many

1120
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,520
Of course

1121
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,640
Some of Lechen's actions

1122
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,240
Made me cry twice

1123
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,400
I cried twice too

1124
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:05,800
Really

1125
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,000
Then we cry at the same things

1126
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,880
Yes, it's what he does

1127
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,320
It really moves

1128
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:11,920
It touches my heart

1129
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,080
Yes, it touches you

1130
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,120
And me too

1131
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,320
No regrets, for sure

1132
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,240
I think this experience

1133
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,680
is truly so rare and precious

1134
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,280
I think choosing to enter the little house

1135
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,600
I haven't regretted it so far

1136
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,640
Now, in our relationship

1137
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,680
it's kind of a

1138
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,400
What kind of state is it

1139
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,760
When did you last meet

1140
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,800
Did you eat together

1141
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,240
Yes

1142
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:37,680
Yes

1143
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,680
Many times

1144
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,080
Great at picking restaurants

1145
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,200
Where did you meet

1146
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,840
In Hangzhou

1147
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,440
What did you eat

1148
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,640
What did you talk about

1149
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,280
How could I tell you what we talked about

1150
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,160
Not telling me

1151
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,000
They want to know

1152
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,280
Actually, our dynamic in the little house

1153
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,160
is just the same

1154
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,720
It's just that in the little house

1155
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,560
we interacted more often and closely

1156
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,200
But after leaving the little house

1157
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,200
he has a lot of work

1158
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,640
He often travels for work to other places

1159
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,880
So the time we spend together

1160
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,440
is less than in the little house

1161
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,440
What do you call each other in private

1162
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,920
There are so many

1163
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,920
So many

1164
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,520
Well

1165
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,880
"Boss Lu", "Little Yuan"

1166
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,480
"Boss Yuan"

1167
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,280
It depends on what I want

1168
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,200
I call him whatever fits

1169
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,200
Okay, give us an example

1170
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,280
Like, what do you want to do

1171
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:37,760
Sometimes I call him "Brother Wang" or "Brother Chen"

1172
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,920
If I want advice

1173
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,440
I call him "Teacher Wang"

1174
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,800
For guidance

1175
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,160
If I want a good restaurant

1176
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,240
"Chef"

1177
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,000
"Chef"

1178
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,040
Call Wang "Chef"

1179
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,120
Say we want to go see a movie now

1180
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:52,960
How do you say it

1181
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,600
Then it's Wang Lechen

1182
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,160
When we watched confession night

1183
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,240
That feeling was also

1184
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,560
full of twists and turns

1185
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,840
We really returned to

1186
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,760
real life afterwards

1187
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,120
and faced some issues

1188
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,680
But both of us have

1189
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,960
a positive attitude

1190
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,280
We face it together

1191
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,320
But I think no matter what

1192
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,040
just follow your

1193
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,960
every decision you make in the moment

1194
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,800
Whether it's then

1195
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,640
or in the future

1196
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,120
Don't leave any regrets for yourself

1197
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,160
I think especially

1198
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,480
after living in the little house

1199
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,920
you understand our feelings even more

1200
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:31,960
This

1201
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,560
Yifan did a great job with this

1202
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,080
Right

1203
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,680
How's Yifan been lately

1204
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,600
Pretty good

1205
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,200
Pretty good

1206
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,080
Feels like they've returned to themselves

1207
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,720
Still the "Happy Puppy" every day

1208
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,880
And I think what Tao said

1209
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,960
makes a lot of sense

1210
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,640
The little house is

1211
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,520
I think it's a part of life

1212
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,880
a very special environment

1213
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,760
and also an opportunity

1214
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,880
So seize this opportunity

1215
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,600
Don't have any regrets

1216
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,040
Did you have a private get-together last time

1217
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,680
Yes, we meet up often

1218
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,960
Princess Lanlan and I are the type

1219
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,600
We finish work at about the same time

1220
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,680
We both get off at five

1221
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,680
We usually get hungry around four

1222
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,560
Want to grab a meal

1223
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,520
Then one of us texts, "Want to eat?"

1224
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,560
And then we head out

1225
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,000
Just meet up right away

1226
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,240
Come on

1227
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,120
Next, we'll go with

1228
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,960
Come on, you two

1229
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,720
I'll help him out

1230
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,720
You're bolder with questions

1231
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,560
You mentioned a myopic afterimage, right

1232
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,480
Visual afterimage

1233
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,440
You mentioned an afterimage.

1234
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,520
So why did you choose

1235
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,480
to use the word "afterimage"

1236
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,200
instead of "astigmatism"?

1237
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,320
Just stare at that light.

1238
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,120
I'll stare at the light.

1239
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:48,800
Stare at the light for ten seconds.

1240
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,280
Ten seconds.

1241
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,800
So actually, in your eyes,

1242
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,280
it's really like this.

1243
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,200
Yeah, she's always there in my eyes.

1244
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,280
Yeah, she's always there in my eyes.

1245
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,520
For example, if you look at me now,

1246
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,840
my face is actually hers.

1247
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,960
That's how it is.

1248
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,520
Yes.

1249
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,560
Then you should just look at her.

1250
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,440
Ma Bokian, it's not just you.

1251
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,080
Everyone here sees Princess Lanlan.

1252
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,640
"Teacher Ma" is moving too slowly.

1253
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,320
Little Doctor Fang, I have a question.

1254
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,480
When you confessed at the end,

1255
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,800
you kept adjusting your posture, right?

1256
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,400
Did you ever have

1257
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,760
the urge to

1258
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,480
want to kiss her?

1259
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:28,520
Did you feel that way?

1260
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,400
Really? Did you?

1261
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,720
But now, the two of you—

1262
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,080
what stage are you at?

1263
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,080
Take a guess.

1264
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,640
Okay, I'll guess.

1265
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,000
I'll make a bold guess then.

1266
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,200
Go ahead, be bold.

1267
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,760
You hug each other now.

1268
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,960
It's definitely more natural

1269
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:47,800
than on confession night.

1270
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:48,640
Right.

1271
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,080
I don't believe it.

1272
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:51,840
Xu doesn't believe it either.

1273
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,680
Want to prove it to us?

1274
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,800
Then show us, prove it.

1275
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,240
Okay.

1276
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,120
I can't take it anymore.

1277
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,360
We're in Yunnan now.

1278
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,080
This place is so beautiful.

1279
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:12,760
It's so big.

1280
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,880
I can use five pillows when I sleep alone.

1281
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:18,640
This looks great.

1282
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,040
Don't move.

1283
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,320
Not moving.

1284
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,280
No smiling.

1285
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:28,840
Does your camera not have a strap?

1286
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:29,560
No strap.

1287
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:30,320
Nothing at all.

1288
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,320
No lens cap either.

1289
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:32,960
Just like your style.

1290
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,720
Slow down.

1291
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:37,600
Let's go.

1292
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:40,720
Go slower.

1293
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,200
Wipe it.

1294
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,880
It's fine.

1295
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:46,680
I'm so beautiful.

1296
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,400
My least noteworthy strength.

1297
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,520
The necklace is crooked.

1298
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,440
Let's take another one, come on.

1299
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,400
Were your legs always this long?

1300
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:55,840
Oh my!

1301
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,400
Feels like fifth or sixth grade.

1302
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,720
Herry was fair-skinned before.

1303
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:00,880
Yeah, he was.

1304
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,120
Did folk dance as a kid.

1305
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,000
Old Fang doesn't look much different.

1306
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,520
Just has one ID photo.

1307
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,320
You must have one.
