1
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,920
Here we come.

2
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,640
This romantic journey

3
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,880
will begin at our

4
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,160
island.

5
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,560
Imagine feeling the sea breeze,

6
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,960
watching the sunset together,

7
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,080
along the horizon.

8
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:11,960
This feeling—

9
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,240
who wouldn't be moved?

10
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,200
It feels so romantic.

11
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:14,760
Without further ado,

12
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,560
let's first take a look at

13
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,880
their first meeting on the island.

14
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,760
We're here.

15
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,960
Come on, let's watch.

16
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,120
Looking forward to it.

17
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,400
Curious.

18
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,120
The first guy.

19
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,480
Jin Yuxing.

20
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,920
Devoted partner.

21
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,640
He seems to be in good shape.

22
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,800
Looks like he works out.

23
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,480
Yeah.

24
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,400
His hairstyle

25
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,680
is quite unique.

26
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,240
Pulling off this hairstyle

27
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,240
definitely requires

28
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:01,680
some confidence.

29
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,720
He looks really handsome.

30
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,720
Here he comes.

31
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,560
The first girl.

32
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,400
Her outfit is beautiful.

33
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,440
It almost feels like a commercial.

34
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,120
She has a classical beauty.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,800
She seems gentle.

36
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,760
Wang Jue.

37
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,040
Supportive partner.

38
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,320
Supportive (partner).

39
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,280
Here she comes.

40
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,560
Hello.

41
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,440
Hello.

42
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,240
Hello.

43
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,080
Hello.

44
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,320
I think he's a bit shy.

45
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,760
Do you know which way to go?

46
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,240
It should be along this road.

47
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,080
We should get there if we go down.

48
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,520
Okay.

49
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,680
Because it seems like we're in Nanzhi now.

50
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,000
At this place.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,720
Yes.

52
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:23,880
Let's go.

53
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,000
The girl is very outgoing.

54
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,960
You seem pretty tall.

55
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,200
You're tall too.

56
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,800
Yeah, I feel like you're almost

57
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,960
as tall as me.

58
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,440
Haitao, you're really tall too.

59
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,480
I'm actually not short.

60
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,960
Which side is it?

61
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,760
It should be here.

62
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,880
Is it there?

63
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,640
I think so.

64
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,040
Let's sit here for a while first.

65
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,680
Okay, let's go down.

66
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,640
Which side do you want to sit on?

67
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,640
I...

68
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,640
I...

69
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,000
You choose first.

70
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:06,600
I...

71
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:07,960
I...

72
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,800
Then I'll sit here.

73
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:10,520
Okay.

74
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:10,920
Okay.

75
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,800
Then I'll just...

76
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,600
sit across from you.

77
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,000
Okay.

78
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,120
There's a pot of water right here.

79
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,080
It should be drinkable.

80
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,600
Do you want some hot water?

81
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,440
Or would you rather have...

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,320
The guy is quite a gentleman.

83
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,280
The girl is too.

84
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,800
She just asked him which side he wanted to sit on.

85
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,240
I can just pour some water.

86
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,520
She's a little shy.

87
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,360
Okay, thank you.

88
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,120
Sorry to trouble you to pour it yourself.

89
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,120
It's fine, you can just sit.

90
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,200
It's just the two of us now.

91
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:04,880
Yeah.

92
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,600
He's really nervous.

93
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,600
The guy is nervous.

94
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,320
The girl is okay.

95
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,600
May I ask, you are...

96
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,600
...from where?

97
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,560
I...

98
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,640
I'm from Yiwu, Zhejiang.

99
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,840
What about you?

100
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,240
I am...

101
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,480
I'm from the north.

102
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,880
You're from the north?

103
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,000
So I am...

104
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,920
a new Hangzhou resident.

105
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,400
Sort of.

106
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,800
So when you were little, you were in...

107
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,880
...a city in Liaoning...

108
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,640
...a mysterious city.

109
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,480
Which city?

110
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:50,880
Tieling.

111
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,480
Haicheng.

112
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,080
The biggest city in the universe.

113
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,960
Where is that?

114
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,160
Tieling.

115
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,120
Tieling.

116
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,480
That's very close to my home.

117
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,520
No wonder you're so tall.

118
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,000
Not really.

119
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,120
You're tall too.

120
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,160
He's getting nervous.

121
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,240
I think the sound of the sea is quite soothing.

122
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,000
The sound of the sea.

123
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,320
Sea cucumber.

124
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,240
Yeah.

125
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,840
I mean the sound of the waves.

126
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,800
The sound of the sea.

127
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,480
Yeah.

128
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,720
Sea cucumber.

129
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,320
I also heard it as "sea cucumber."

130
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:46,800
Sea cucumber.

131
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,360
I thought we were going to talk about health supplements.

132
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,400
But haven't you ever had that feeling

133
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,680
when you suddenly meet a girl

134
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,640
and you get really nervous

135
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,720
and end up saying the wrong thing?

136
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,480
You really don't know what to say.

137
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,160
I know.

138
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,320
That happens to me a lot.

139
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,120
Really.

140
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,360
Because I get nervous easily.

141
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:56,880
Because I get nervous easily.

142
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,840
That's cute.

143
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,280
I forgot to introduce myself.

144
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,760
My name is Wang Jue.

145
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,320
Jue is

146
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,920
the character for "king" with "jade" next to it.

147
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,640
The king among jade?

148
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,440
Is that right?

149
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:23,880
Yeah.

150
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,520
Exactly, the king among jade.

151
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,680
Because my nephew

152
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,000
also has the character "Jue" in his name.

153
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,360
No wonder.

154
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,600
Really?

155
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,800
Yes, he has "Jue" in his name.

156
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,320
Back then, I

157
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,520
looked into it.

158
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,480
That's quite a coincidence.

159
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,320
A lot of people mispronounce my name.

160
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,040
That's great.

161
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,720
If it were you,

162
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,600
you would definitely get it right.

163
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,720
Yes.

164
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,240
What's your name?

165
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,680
My name is Jin Yuxing.

166
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,560
"Jin" as in "gold".

167
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,720
And "Yu" is

168
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,240
the "Yu" from "Dayu controls the flood".

169
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,080
The "Yu" from "Dayu controls the flood".

170
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,120
"Xing" as in "industry".

171
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,440
Because it's a polyphonic character.

172
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,240
And then,

173
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,000
out of ten people I meet,

174
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,520
about nine will pronounce it as

175
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,320
"Xing".

176
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:09,720
Yes.

177
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,040
Jin Yuxing.

178
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,280
If you call me Jin Yuxing,

179
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,440
I'll respond too.

180
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,560
Jin Yuxing.

181
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,360
That's fine too.

182
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:20,960
If you call me Wang Yu,

183
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,120
I'll respond as well.

184
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,880
I'll respond too.

185
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,080
This is just the beginning.

186
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,720
There's already a little spark.

187
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,160
The atmosphere is nice.

188
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,640
Next.

189
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,560
He's so handsome.

190
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,320
He has a gentle kind of handsomeness.

191
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,000
Sunny.

192
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,280
He has a sunny, handsome vibe.

193
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,480
His head-to-body ratio is like one to nine.

194
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,760
His proportions are great.

195
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,480
Wang Lechen.

196
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,960
If his name is Wang Lechen,

197
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,840
he would respond too.

198
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,440
Hello.

199
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,360
Hello.

200
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,360
Hello.

201
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,880
Hello.

202
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,440
Hello.

203
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,280
Hello.

204
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:38,960
Hello.

205
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,840
Sit.

206
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,440
Sit.

207
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:41,840
Which side?

208
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,640
Sit.

209
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,400
She wants him to sit next to her.

210
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,280
Choose any seat.

211
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,880
Those three seats are still empty.

212
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,000
Then I'll sit here.

213
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,680
My name is Wang Lechen.

214
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,600
Wang Lechen.

215
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,720
His name really is Wang Lechen.

216
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,600
Hello, Wang Lechen.

217
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,720
Sit.

218
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,360
My name is Wang Jue.

219
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,720
Your last name is Wang too.

220
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,560
My name is Wang Lechen.

221
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,520
The "Le" from "happy".

222
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,400
The "Chen" from "morning".

223
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,360
A happy morning.

224
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,680
My name uses the "Wang" radical with the jade character "Jue".

225
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,120
That "Jue", you know it?

226
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,920
Do you know it?

227
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,240
Wang Lechen.

228
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,520
Jin Yuxing.

229
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,720
It's obvious that compared to—

230
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,120
He's more attentive than the first guy.

231
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,800
It's a simple name.

232
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,000
She glanced several times.

233
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,200
She glanced several times.

234
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,480
Your name is—

235
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,840
My name is Jin Yuxing.

236
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,120
Okay, got it.

237
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,520
Jin Yuxing.

238
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:08,920
Brother Xing.

239
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,400
Jin Yuxing.

240
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,000
Brother Xing.

241
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:11,720
It's fine.

242
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,080
Just call me Yuxing.

243
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:19,920
There's water.

244
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:21,920
I'll do it.

245
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,040
Okay, thank you.

246
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,520
Let me, I'll pour it for you.

247
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:30,800
Thank you.

248
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,120
Suddenly,

249
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,120
it got a little awkward.

250
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,960
She kept staring at him.

251
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,840
Has anyone ever told you that you look like—

252
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,680
Like who?

253
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,440
Who?

254
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,280
Like who?

255
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,760
You have the vibe of a "man straight out of a comic".

256
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,040
The feeling of a "Sima man"

257
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,400
What kind of man?

258
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,560
It's my first time hearing this term too.

259
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,120
What kind of man?

260
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,280
What kind of man?

261
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:23,880
What kind of man?

262
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,000
It's okay.

263
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,080
It's fine.

264
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,800
Is it a celebrity?

265
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,840
Is it a celebrity?

266
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,440
No.

267
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,560
"Sima man"

268
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,320
The "si" from "refined and orderly"

269
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:37,680
Slow?

270
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,760
Is it the "man" from "slow to warm up"?

271
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,480
Is that what it means?

272
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,560
Maybe.

273
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,880
Really, it's my first time.

274
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,120
I just heard it and didn't understand.

275
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,000
"Sima man"

276
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,240
Bro, you are a "Sima man".

277
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,320
Yeah, it's like from a comic book.

278
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,520
A guy who walked out of a comic.

279
00:12:59,160 --> 00:12:59,800
It describes beauty.

280
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,360
It means so handsome it's unreal.

281
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,120
What kind of man is Mr. Xu?

282
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,520
He's a "Sima man".

283
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,440
A title.

284
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,480
A title.

285
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,040
It's a kind of...

286
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,600
Title.

287
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,440
Title.

288
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,000
I'm a little embarrassed.

289
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,400
I think those two have a chance.

290
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,520
She really keeps staring at him.

291
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,520
Keeps staring.

292
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,880
It's obvious.

293
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,120
She's interested.

294
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,040
Do you usually exercise?

295
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,760
Not bad.

296
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,520
I've been working out recently.

297
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,840
Now, every morning,

298
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,480
I go to the gym at 7:30.

299
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,520
Then I go to work at 8:30.

300
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,000
It's like an old person's life.

301
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,320
Very disciplined.

302
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,440
She likes this kind of

303
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,560
disciplined guy.

304
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,160
I want to ask girls,

305
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,360
do girls like this kind of

306
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,000
disciplined guy?

307
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,120
Yes.

308
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,040
Would you?

309
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,240
Like.

310
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,280
Definitely like.

311
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,640
No one dislikes disciplined people.

312
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,160
Right, regardless of gender.

313
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,280
But I want to be

314
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,400
the one who breaks his discipline.

315
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,680
It's because of her appearance

316
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,400
that it will break

317
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,600
some guys' original

318
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,160
inherent

319
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:23,960
rhythm.

320
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,080
But it will show charm.

321
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,920
It's needed.

322
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,000
I wanted to ask which city you're from.

323
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,440
Me?

324
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,240
I don't know if you

325
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,560
have ever heard of Jinyun Shaobing.

326
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,920
I know it. I'm from Zhejiang.

327
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,560
Where are you from?

328
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,480
I know, I'm from Yiwu.

329
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,640
You're from Yiwu?

330
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,840
Then I'm from Lishui, that's very close.

331
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,400
Jinyun.

332
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:48,720
Very close.

333
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,240
Yeah.

334
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,400
I'm from Liaoning.

335
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,000
I've settled here in Hangzhou.

336
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,400
It's actually the same city.

337
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,640
That's a big plus.

338
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,840
I can't tell from your accent.

339
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,480
Maybe you'll notice it later.

340
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,000
She's really been paying attention to him.

341
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,600
It's actually the same city.

342
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:16,960
Yeah.

343
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,360
That feeling

344
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,600
makes you feel even more

345
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,160
like it's fate.

346
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:20,760
Yeah.

347
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,800
Here she comes.

348
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,600
So pretty.

349
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,080
Ke Ailin.

350
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,960
Friendship-type lover.

351
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,440
So cute.

352
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,320
So, you...

353
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,600
Are you usually in Hangzhou?

354
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,840
Where are you?

355
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,120
In Gongshu District.

356
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:56,640
That's so far.

357
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,400
Here she comes.

358
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,680
Done

359
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,440
Hello

360
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,480
Hello, everyone

361
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,440
Hello

362
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,200
Hello, Duoduo (Ke Ailin)

363
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:21,720
Very generous

364
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,880
I'll sit for a while first

365
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,120
Quite relaxed

366
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,920
I really envy that kind of personality

367
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,080
My name is Wang Jue.

368
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,520
Jue is written with the Wang radical and the jade character.

369
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,240
Okay, Wang Jue.

370
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,800
My full name is Ke Ailin.

371
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,040
Ke, as in the "Ke" from "A Dream of Nanke."

372
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,120
Then "Ai" is the "Ai" from "love."

373
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,560
"Lin" is the "Lin" with two trees.

374
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,600
And my nickname is Duoduo.

375
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,920
Maybe that's a bit easier to remember.

376
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,480
Duoduo (Ke Ailin)

377
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,000
Duoduo (Ke Ailin)

378
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,600
So what's your nickname?

379
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,800
My nickname?

380
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,280
Xingxing.

381
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,280
Xingxing.

382
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,520
Actually, my family usually calls me Yu Xing.

383
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,200
Jin Yuxing.

384
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:15,920
Yes.

385
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,120
Jin Yuxing.

386
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,120
Okay.

387
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:21,840
So,

388
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,200
What about you?

389
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,280
My name is Wang Lechen.

390
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,600
Wang Lechen.

391
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,360
Chenchen.

392
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,440
Chenchen.

393
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,240
It's obvious.

394
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,480
This girl definitely likes him.

395
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,600
Yes, it's obvious.

396
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,920
She definitely likes him.

397
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,760
Chenchen.

398
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,320
Either is fine, that's okay.

399
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,160
Chenchen

400
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,040
I want to ask where you're from.

401
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,360
Hangzhou, Zhejiang.

402
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,720
My hometown is in Anhui.

403
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,960
Where in Anhui are you from?

404
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,000
Wuhu, Anhui.

405
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,080
You have a very cute personality.

406
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,960
Wuhu.

407
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,240
I'm in Gongshu District.

408
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,000
Then we're really close.

409
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,120
That's great.

410
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,080
Very close.

411
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,520
I'm at the junction of Gongshu and Shangcheng.

412
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,840
I can come hang out with you.

413
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,720
Sure.

414
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,920
You can come hang out with me more often.

415
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,520
Okay, I've already booked it.

416
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,240
No problem.

417
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,640
I'll introduce all my friends to you.

418
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,480
My friends are all the type who are

419
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,680
"happy little dogs,"

420
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,960
or "happy big dogs,"

421
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,520
just really cheerful people.

422
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,600
Those two have started "dating."

423
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,040
Yeah.

424
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,680
But I'm still quite a homebody.

425
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,480
I feel like my friends in Hangzhou

426
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,280
aren't that many.

427
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,800
I want to ask about your

428
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,840
MBTI (personality type).

429
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,680
Guess.

430
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,280
Do we even need to guess?

431
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,680
Take a guess.

432
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,680
Definitely an E (extrovert).

433
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,080
Yes, I'm an extrovert.

434
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,960
Very outgoing.

435
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,880
A total extrovert.

436
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,760
ENFJ.

437
00:18:59,280 --> 00:18:59,600
Yes.

438
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,360
I'm an ENFJ.

439
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,440
That's impressive.

440
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,400
I just guessed.

441
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,320
Do you have any pets?

442
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,720
I think you're a dog person.

443
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,320
It's definitely a cat.

444
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:32,880
Yes.

445
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,040
You guessed right.

446
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,720
One daughter, one son.

447
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,520
A sister and a brother.

448
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,880
That's just like my cats.

449
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,560
Really?

450
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,360
What do you have at home?

451
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,680
Also two.

452
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,720
One is a Munchkin.

453
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,400
The other is

454
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,560
a British Shorthair.

455
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,360
The bigger one is the Munchkin.

456
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,800
It only comes to you when it wants to be close.

457
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,560
That's when it comes over.

458
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,560
Usually, it doesn't even like being brushed.

459
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,440
I see.

460
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,920
So what do you do about brushing?

461
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,040
I don't brush it, so its fur gets all tangled.

462
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,240
That's so funny.

463
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,240
I'm so jealous.

464
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,160
I definitely want to have a kitten.

465
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,480
What do you like to do in your free time?

466
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,480
Work out.

467
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,160
I basically get up every morning

468
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,920
to exercise.

469
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:27,960
Just like him

470
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:29,960
Like this

471
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,560
(A shared hobby) has appeared

472
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,720
Really?

473
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,520
Are you serious?

474
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,320
You doubt me

475
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,880
You don't believe me

476
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,840
Those two are totally in sync

477
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,280
I'll call you tomorrow

478
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,280
Impressive

479
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:52,680
Amazing

480
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,480
You do cardio on an empty stomach

481
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:57,840
Yeah

482
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,120
Don't you get dizzy?

483
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,760
No

484
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,160
Actually, I feel like my body

485
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,120
has endless energy every day

486
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,320
I'm jealous

487
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,000
Please be kind to us in our twenties

488
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,920
Twenty seconds

489
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,480
Be kind to what?

490
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,200
Be kind to what?

491
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:17,920
People in their twenties

492
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,400
People in their twenties

493
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,920
That's hilarious

494
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,560
I've hit a knowledge blind spot

495
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,840
I'm just curious

496
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,520
That's all

497
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,360
Duo Duo's (Ke Ailin's)

498
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,480
has such a nice personality

499
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,120
Ke Ailin and Wang Lechen are so alike

500
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,040
And it feels like

501
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,880
they just click instantly

502
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,960
The sweet type

503
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,880
Hello, everyone

504
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,440
Mr. Jin Yuxing suddenly became capable

505
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,840
It just feels right

506
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,160
Mr. Jin Yuxing is good

507
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,080
Yeah

508
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,160
Suddenly became capable

509
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:23,960
Hello

510
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,840
Hello, everyone

511
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,480
Hello

512
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,760
Looks like we sat in the wrong seats

513
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:30,840
Sit here

514
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,600
Okay

515
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,080
Have you been here long?

516
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,800
Not really

517
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,640
Not too long

518
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,800
About an hour or so

519
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,800
Actually, we started chatting yesterday

520
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,680
You've been talking for that long?

521
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,600
Then I missed a lot

522
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,600
Just kidding

523
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,680
I haven't introduced myself

524
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,760
My name is Lu Yuan

525
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,080
You can call me Xiaoyuan or Yuanyuan

526
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,920
It's the "yuan" from "far away"

527
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,520
Is that right?

528
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:56,800
Yes

529
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,680
The "yuan" from "near and far"

530
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,320
Yes

531
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,080
What about you?

532
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,640
My name is Duoduo (Ke Ailin)

533
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,600
And my full name might be hard to remember

534
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,440
It's Ke Ailin

535
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,320
Okay

536
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,360
My name is Wang Jue

537
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:06,800
Alright

538
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,080
What about you two?

539
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:14,760
You go ahead, Xingxing (Jin Yuxing).

540
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:15,920
Okay, Xingxing (Jin Yuxing).

541
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,760
Okay, Xingxing (Jin Yuxing).

542
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,920
My name is Jin Yuxing.

543
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,280
My name is Wang Lechen.

544
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,560
Okay.

545
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,000
What were you talking about?

546
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,680
We just talked about

547
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,000
whether we have pets at home.

548
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,440
And then we talked about

549
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,480
our MBTI personality types.

550
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,200
And also the sports we like.

551
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,560
What we like to eat.

552
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,880
And also

553
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,600
I have two cats.

554
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,560
She wants to have a cat.

555
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,680
He has two cats.

556
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,200
He

557
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,880
I have a dog.

558
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,000
A Bernese Mountain Dog.

559
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,280
So energetic.

560
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,280
Excellent at managing the situation

561
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,720
I guess you're an extrovert

562
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,920
And then

563
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,680
ENTP

564
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,000
No

565
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,520
ENTJ

566
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,160
Smart

567
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,760
We're done for

568
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,920
We're surrounded by extroverts

569
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,720
We're surrounded

570
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,480
So we're their "toys," right?

571
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,720
Yeah

572
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,720
"Toys"

573
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,440
I've never seen so many at once

574
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,000
Extroverts

575
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,680
He can't really handle it

576
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,560
What else did you talk about?

577
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,160
We talked about hobbies

578
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,280
I usually like sports

579
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,040
I'm pretty active

580
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,640
Yeah

581
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,000
Most of my hobbies are related to sports

582
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,840
I'm actually a lot like Ke Ailin

583
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,080
We both like being active

584
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,360
I might be

585
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,880
A bit more of a homebody

586
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,400
So I might like

587
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,640
Dancing or jogging when I have free time

588
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,040
Something like that

589
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,080
You can dance?

590
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,400
Yeah, a little

591
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,920
Do you want to drink this?

592
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,320
Okay.

593
00:24:59,320 --> 00:24:59,960
It's over there.

594
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,320
Get me a bottle, please.

595
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,080
Thank you.

596
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,640
Did we not talk about this?

597
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,160
Did we not mention it?

598
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,080
What does she (Lu Yuan) like?

599
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,760
You're starting to ask questions on your own.

600
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,080
Cool.

601
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,880
Jin Yuxing has style.

602
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,520
Did we not talk about what she likes?

603
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,960
Right, what do you like?

604
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,760
Hobbies.

605
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,520
Hobbies.

606
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,520
Yeah.

607
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,440
Let me think.

608
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,440
I usually read

609
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,960
essays or world literature

610
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,320
a bit more often.

611
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,520
And I especially like to buy those

612
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,400
second-hand

613
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,640
the more worn-out the book, the better.

614
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,080
I like reading other people's notes in them.

615
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,360
Yeah, I specifically look for books like that.

616
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,200
To see the thoughts of many different people.

617
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,320
That's so cool.

618
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,320
Feels really intellectual.

619
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,520
When I borrow books,

620
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,360
I also pick the most worn-out one in the library.

621
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,520
That's a great reading habit.

622
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,760
Do you guys have any favorite movies?

623
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,880
I like watching movies.

624
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,800
Which one is your favorite?

625
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,960
I think it might be "Let the Bullets Fly."

626
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,800
"Let the Bullets Fly."

627
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,040
How about you?

628
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,160
My favorite one

629
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,440
Titanic

630
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,200
Titanic

631
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,760
I've rewatched it too

632
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,200
Yeah, back in the day

633
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,560
when movie tickets were still cheap

634
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,240
but it still ranked

635
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,800
Yeah, it ranked at the box office

636
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,000
fourth on the box office chart

637
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,200
Yeah

638
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,120
I think that's really impressive

639
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,720
It's truly an amazing movie

640
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,800
The two of them are already chatting privately

641
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,560
What do you study?

642
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,240
I study mathematics

643
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,160
You study mathematics?

644
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,560
Mathematics

645
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,680
That's such a contrast

646
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,240
Impressive

647
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,880
This, in

648
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,840
With Yuan Yuan, this definitely earns points

649
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,400
I study English

650
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,560
That's great, let's start a tutoring class

651
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,800
Tutoring class

652
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,040
That's a bit much, isn't it?

653
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,560
Jin Yuxing was never online before.

654
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,280
But

655
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,520
when Lu Yuan showed up,

656
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,200
I felt like he was online.

657
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,800
He started asking questions proactively.

658
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,000
Wang Jue, towards

659
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,520
Wang Lechen,

660
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,480
as for Wang Lechen,

661
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,520
still has a good impression.

662
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,040
Yeah.

663
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,400
I think it's pretty obvious.

664
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,600
She even calls him Chenchen.

665
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,000
I think for a girl,

666
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,880
that's quite important.

667
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,720
I think being able to

668
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:30,560
use a nickname with repeated characters

669
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,680
and giving him a pet name

670
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,000
means she must be

671
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
quite interested in this boy.

672
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,280
But as for Wang Lechen,

673
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,040
he actually has a good impression of Ke Ailin.

674
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,000
Yes.

675
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,720
Because their

676
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,240
personal interests

677
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,680
are very similar.

678
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,000
They have a lot in common to talk about.

679
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,200
Right now, I'm rooting for

680
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,440
Wang Jue and Chenchen (Wang Lechen).

681
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,000
Wang Jue and

682
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,640
Chenchen (Wang Lechen).

683
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,080
Yeah.

684
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,040
I'll just throw this out there for now.

685
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,040
It really does look quite similar.

686
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,440
Yeah.

687
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,480
I feel like maybe there should be

688
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,520
a few more people.

689
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,560
Yeah, I think so too.

690
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,880
Maybe more people will show up later.

691
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:00,960
Yes.

692
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,760
I think so too.

693
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,760
I'm kind of looking forward to it.

694
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,520
Here they come, here they come.

695
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,840
Her skin is so fair.

696
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,160
So beautiful.

697
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,320
She really looks great.

698
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,280
Here she comes.

699
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,880
Here she comes.

700
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,000
What does that mean?

701
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,280
Separated.

702
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,120
At two different locations.

703
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,200
That's so exciting.

704
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,680
Parallel universes.

705
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,880
I've got goosebumps.

706
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,520
Looking forward to it.

707
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,840
Xu Rulan.

708
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,440
Look, her name is Xu Rulan.

709
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,520
She's also wearing a light blue dress today.

710
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,120
Yeah.

711
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,800
Very elegant.

712
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:30,800
Here she comes.

713
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,480
Here she comes.

714
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,560
Here she comes.

715
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,560
Come on.

716
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,680
Hello

717
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,320
Hello

718
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,240
Hello

719
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,000
Ruilong

720
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,440
Hello

721
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,200
Hello

722
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,920
Hello

723
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:06,960
Hello

724
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,880
Ruilong

725
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,680
Ruilong

726
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,800
Hello

727
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,760
You can call me Lanlan (Xu Rulan)

728
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,800
The "lan" as in "blue"

729
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,280
That's right

730
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,840
Lanlan (Xu Rulan)

731
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,040
Please have a seat

732
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,280
He looks so cute when he smiles

733
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,920
He's nervous

734
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,400
Would you like something to drink?

735
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,320
I just had something

736
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,800
Did you just arrive?

737
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,800
Yes, I just got here

738
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,920
I've been here for five minutes

739
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,960
He spent a long time twisting that bottle cap

740
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,960
In a moment, Lanlan (Xu Rulan) will say, "Let me do it"

741
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,320
Have you been here before?

742
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,120
This island

743
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,480
Never

744
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:05,920
Never

745
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,520
What about you?

746
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,400
It's my first time too

747
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:07,960
Yes

748
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,600
Is it good?

749
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,360
This one is pretty good

750
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,960
It's jasmine flavored

751
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,280
He's nervous.

752
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,920
So what's your name?

753
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,280
My name is Ruilong.

754
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,080
Ruilong.

755
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,440
My name is...

756
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,120
Xu.

757
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,320
Xu, with the character that has two people.

758
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,320
Ru, as in "if".

759
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,320
Lan, as in "blue".

760
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,000
Are you...

761
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,320
Are you Chinese?

762
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,360
Born in Switzerland.

763
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,600
But I'm Chinese.

764
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,080
What about you?

765
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,760
I'm from Shanghai.

766
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,560
I'm Shanghainese.

767
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,480
That's pretty cute.

768
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,320
I'm Shanghainese.

769
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,840
Why is it that every time...

770
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,320
everyone says this to me?

771
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,480
The only phrase they know (in Shanghainese).

772
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,280
Is...

773
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,400
He's so shy.

774
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,520
Ruilong must be quite young.

775
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,880
He's really simple and honest.

776
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,640
I'm more introverted.

777
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,320
So I don't talk much.

778
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,280
It's okay.

779
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,120
Just relax.

780
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,480
Say whatever you want.

781
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,880
If you don't want to talk, we can just be quiet.

782
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,720
Either way is fine.

783
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,280
So you're an introvert?

784
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,080
Yeah.

785
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,640
Definitely an introvert.

786
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,560
I can tell.

787
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,520
Tactical water drinking.

788
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,680
Seriously, you're about to finish a whole bottle.

789
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,400
It's fine.

790
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,960
I need to practice first.

791
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,680
Try to be a bit more extroverted.

792
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,240
Just relax.

793
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,720
I feel like it's kind of forced.

794
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,440
Making an introvert

795
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,760
act like an extrovert.

796
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,680
Ruilong is really just happily being silly.

797
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,160
I think this awkwardness is actually pretty cute.

798
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,760
I think that kind of boy

799
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,800
the clumsy, silly type

800
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,880
is actually really cute.

801
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,640
No, I'm just looking forward to him

802
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,480
having a bunch of bottles

803
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,280
already opened on his table later.

804
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,800
I can totally picture it.

805
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,160
Here he comes.

806
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,040
He's here.

807
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,320
This guy wears glasses.

808
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,760
Fang Yijiong.

809
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,720
Possessive lover.

810
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,800
Another new friend is here.

811
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,920
Hello.

812
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,240
Hi.

813
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,080
I'll sit here.

814
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,480
My name is Fang Yijiong.

815
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:39,960
Fang Yijiong.

816
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,680
Okay.

817
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,760
Fang Yijiong.

818
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,160
"Yi" as in "the more the better."

819
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,720
"Jiong" as in "bright and spirited."

820
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,840
Everyone usually calls me Xiao Fang.

821
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,640
Okay, Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong).

822
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,920
My name is Xu Rulan.

823
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,800
Xu Rulan.

824
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,840
Yes, you can call me Lanlan.

825
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,960
"Lan" as in the color blue.

826
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:01,800
Alright.

827
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,400
My name is

828
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,080
Ruilong.

829
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:13,760
Ruilong.

830
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:14,760
Yes.

831
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,200
Xu Rulan.

832
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,720
Yes.

833
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,720
You're called Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong).

834
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,120
Xiao Fang.

835
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,280
Okay, Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong).

836
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,480
I really like watching this kind of thing.

837
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,080
Where are you from?

838
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,240
Me?

839
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:38,760
Hangzhou.

840
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,960
Where are you two from?

841
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,720
We're both from Shanghai.

842
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,360
Shanghai.

843
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,480
Are you

844
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,680
mixed race?

845
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,000
I just asked the same question.

846
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,440
Yes.

847
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,160
I'm mixed race.

848
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,360
My dad is Swiss.

849
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,920
My mom is from Guangzhou.

850
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,680
Here we go again.

851
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:08,960
Can I drink this?

852
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,160
Of course.

853
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,440
This one is a bit lighter.

854
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,920
You’re really handsome.

855
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,320
That was so sudden.

856
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,680
You’re really handsome.

857
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,720
Is he so handsome that you can’t even look at him directly?

858
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,320
You’re handsome too.

859
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,880
I can tell you’re both pretty introverted.

860
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:03,960
There you go again.

861
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,080
Then let’s talk more.

862
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,240
Yeah.

863
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,320
You guys

864
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,520
Do you like plants?

865
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,160
What do you mean?

866
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,160
This conversation is going off track.

867
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,440
Alright, that’s a really weird question.

868
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,200
He’s answering his own questions.

869
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,840
Okay, this topic is a bit too weird.

870
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,600
I like plants.

871
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,960
I used to grow some when I was little.

872
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,440
All sorts of random plants.

873
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,880
I might go hiking.

874
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,720
When I go hiking,

875
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,600
And then?

876
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,360
I secretly take a little plant home.

877
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,960
I prefer animals.

878
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,520
Animals?

879
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,440
I have a kitten.

880
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,120
I have a kitten too.

881
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,960
I also have a puppy.

882
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,000
I don’t have that.

883
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,200
So your kitten is...

884
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,160
The clingy type?

885
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,880
Yeah, it has a really good temperament.

886
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,880
My cat isn’t clingy.

887
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,520
Maybe.

888
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,600
Do pets’ personalities follow their owners?

889
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,680
Not really.

890
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,440
It loses interest quickly.

891
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:12,960
I’m not like that.

892
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,280
That sentence...

893
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,080
Alright.

894
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,120
When you hear this, it's like...

895
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:21,920
someone who knows how to chat.

896
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,600
Yeah.

897
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,400
It's just a passing interest.

898
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,160
I'm not like that.

899
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,600
Okay.

900
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Lanlan (Xu Rulan) probably likes

901
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:32,880
Ruilong.

902
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,680
No.

903
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,240
Mr. Ma is online.

904
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,280
Time for some science facts.

905
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,480
About Xiaofang (Fang Yijiong),

906
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,440
Xiaofang (Fang Yijiong) probably

907
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,240
has feelings.

908
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,160
Xiaofang (Fang Yijiong) also

909
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,960
I mean, they both have feelings for each other.

910
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,160
Yeah, it's mutual.

911
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,400
Now Ruilong is the awkward one in the middle.

912
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:45,680
Got it.

913
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,880
Ruilong is so cute.

914
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,360
Ruilong is really adorable.

915
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,320
Seriously, so cute.

916
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,320
Ruilong is so genuine, absolutely real.

917
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,280
Yeah, just looking around.

918
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,760
And drinking that Kang Shifu jasmine honey tea.

919
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,960
Then quietly asks,

920
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,080
"Do you guys like plants?"

921
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,640
Yeah.

922
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,200
He just wanted to start a conversation.

923
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,160
But ended up

924
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:00,840
Xu Rulan and Fang Yijiong started chatting.

925
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,600
He asked this question,

926
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,400
"My topic is kind of silly."

927
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,280
But then Xu Rulan and Fang Yijiong

928
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,680
got into it.

929
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,800
Someone's coming.

930
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,360
Wang Yifan.

931
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,360
A beautiful girl just arrived.

932
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,200
Hello

933
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:36,840
Hello

934
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,240
Hello

935
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,080
Hello

936
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,920
Hello

937
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,520
Find a place to sit for now.

938
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,400
I'll sit here.

939
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,360
Okay.

940
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,960
Hello

941
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,280
My name is Wang Yifan.

942
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,160
Wang Yifan.

943
00:39:59,160 --> 00:39:59,880
Yes.

944
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,080
Alright, Wang Yifan.

945
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,120
My name is Fang Yijiong.

946
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,280
Fang Yijiong.

947
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,160
Yes.

948
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,120
Call me Xiao Fang.

949
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,640
Xiao Fang, okay.

950
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,120
My name is Xu Rulan.

951
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,240
You can call me Lanlan.

952
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,080
Lanlan.

953
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,680
Okay.

954
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,720
Just call me Ruilong.

955
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,200
Ruilong.

956
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:18,880
Ruilong.

957
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,480
Ruilong.

958
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,120
Okay.

959
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,000
Full name?

960
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,200
Yes, full name.

961
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:23,520
Okay.

962
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,880
Ruilong, you must be mixed race, right?

963
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,240
Yes, I am mixed race.

964
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,720
You can guess what he is.

965
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:32,840
Take a guess.

966
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,680
Swiss.

967
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,320
Swiss, yes.

968
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,880
But isn't there a "Long" (dragon) in your name?

969
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,400
Does that have any special meaning?

970
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,480
The "Long" from "Chinese dragon"

971
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,400
That's a cool name.

972
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,200
So, can you cook?

973
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,480
I can cook spicy food.

974
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,880
I like eating spicy food.

975
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,120
But I can't really handle it.

976
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,520
Just a little bit and—

977
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,640
my whole body starts sweating.

978
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,480
Then come back after you finish eating.

979
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,800
I was just about to ask.

980
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,600
Your glasses—

981
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,840
do they not have lenses?

982
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,160
Maybe it's just my angle.

983
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,080
I can sense that his glasses do have lenses.

984
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,320
You can tell there are lenses?

985
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:19,680
Yeah.

986
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,040
Because when you turn to the side,

987
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,560
the lenses

988
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,640
look a little different.

989
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:24,760
Really?

990
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,160
I'm a bit far away,

991
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,120
so I can't see clearly.

992
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:29,920
My eyesight isn't great.

993
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,560
If your eyesight isn't good, you could

994
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:36,840
get it checked.

995
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,560
This conversation of his—

996
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,720
go get it checked.

997
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,640
That joke was really...

998
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,640
That, that was too much.

999
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,600
Yeah.

1000
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,120
Just kidding.

1001
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,240
Okay.

1002
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,280
Sorry.

1003
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,480
He's got a really sharp tongue.

1004
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,000
An introvert.

1005
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,520
On a hellish level.

1006
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,880
Introvert jokes.

1007
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,440
I'm used to it.

1008
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,160
I'm used to it.

1009
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:02,920
Sorry.

1010
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,560
Next time, I'll cook something so spicy it'll "kill" you.

1011
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,080
I'll secretly put Sichuan peppercorns in his food.

1012
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,840
You better watch out.

1013
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,560
You better watch out.

1014
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,240
Extra numbing, extra spicy.

1015
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,160
Sorry.

1016
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,560
It's fine.

1017
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,000
No big deal.

1018
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
She's so open and generous.

1019
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,640
The guy in the car just now was so handsome.

1020
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,320
So cool.

1021
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,560
Jiao Zhiheng.

1022
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,320
His looks are a bit tough.

1023
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:52,920
Someone's coming.

1024
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,400
Hello.

1025
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,840
Hello.

1026
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,440
Hello.

1027
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,160
Hello.

1028
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:07,840
Hello.

1029
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,880
Pick a seat yourself.

1030
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,600
My name is Jiao Zhiheng.

1031
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,400
Jiao Zhiheng.

1032
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,280
Yes, Jiao Zhiheng.

1033
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,720
What would you prefer us to call you?

1034
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,040
You can call me Xiao Jiao.

1035
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,480
Yeah, the last two characters of my name are a bit hard to remember.

1036
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,000
Okay.

1037
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
The "Jiao" from "anxious," yes.

1038
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:26,680
Alright.

1039
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,400
Xiao Jiao.

1040
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,320
My name is Ruilong.

1041
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,600
Ruilong.

1042
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,200
So cool.

1043
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,240
My name is Fang Yijiong.

1044
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,560
Fang Yijiong.

1045
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,480
You can call me Xiao Fang.

1046
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,080
Okay.

1047
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,720
My name is Wang Yifan.

1048
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,720
Just call me Yifan.

1049
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,520
Alright.

1050
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,280
My name is Xu Rulan.

1051
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,480
You can call me Lanlan.

1052
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:45,360
Okay.

1053
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,240
Lanlan.

1054
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:48,560
Yes.

1055
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,080
Why don't you have a seat?

1056
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:01,560
Okay.

1057
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:07,840
Jiao Zhiheng

1058
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,680
Yes, Jiao Zhiheng.

1059
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,600
You remembered, that's good.

1060
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,200
Did you notice?

1061
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,400
Ruilong

1062
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,440
Mixed race.

1063
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,360
It's very obvious.

1064
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,040
Yes.

1065
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,000
So handsome.

1066
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,200
So cute.

1067
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:30,840
Switzerland.

1068
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:31,840
Switzerland, right.

1069
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,440
So did you grow up in Switzerland?

1070
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,440
Or...

1071
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,640
I lived in Shanghai for ten years.

1072
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,560
Then, when I was in high school,

1073
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,280
I went back to Switzerland.

1074
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,880
Then I went to university.

1075
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,000
At ETH Zurich.

1076
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:44,920
ETH Zurich.

1077
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,000
Really?

1078
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:46,760
Yes.

1079
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,240
That's awesome.

1080
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,480
You're really a top student.

1081
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,360
He's amazing.

1082
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,480
So you're from the German-speaking region?

1083
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:53,800
Yes.

1084
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,640
German-speaking region.

1085
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,080
Do you speak any German?

1086
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,080
Not very well.

1087
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,160
The call is encrypted now.

1088
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:03,520
Yes.

1089
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,120
What should we do?

1090
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,280
That's really impressive.

1091
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,520
So are you an E type (extrovert)?

1092
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,200
Or an I type (introvert)?

1093
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,920
I guess you're somewhere in between.

1094
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,360
In the middle.

1095
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,920
Not E (extrovert),

1096
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:15,560
not I (introvert).

1097
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,200
Maybe it's like

1098
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,120
when your energy runs out, you just drop down.

1099
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,040
Then you become an I (introvert).

1100
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:20,680
Not E (extrovert),

1101
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:21,160
not I (introvert).

1102
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,000
That sounds so carefree.

1103
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:22,920
So among us here,

1104
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,320
who

1105
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,320
is an E type (extrovert)?

1106
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,200
You can guess.

1107
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,760
If you guess right, there will be applause.

1108
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:30,440
Guess what I am.

1109
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:30,960
E type (extrovert).

1110
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:32,840
Guess about Lanlan (Xu Rulan).

1111
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,680
Lanlan (Xu Rulan) is also

1112
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:38,840
also an E type (extrovert).

1113
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:40,560
Applause.

1114
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,400
There's applause here.

1115
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:43,920
So accurate.

1116
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,680
Are you an intuitive type of person?

1117
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:48,880
Yes, I'm an N type (intuitive).

1118
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:49,800
N type (intuitive), right?

1119
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:51,520
Are you too?

1120
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,720
Yes, I am too.

1121
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:54,640
So many N types (intuitive) here.

1122
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,920
Do you run out of energy quickly?

1123
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,320
It's okay.

1124
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,560
Do you guys still have battery?

1125
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,720
There's a little left.

1126
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,440
Do you still have some?

1127
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,400
It's about to shut down.

1128
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,480
You never turned it on.

1129
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,200
So cute.

1130
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,200
But Ruilong never turned it on.

1131
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,760
It's about to shut down.

1132
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,840
It's about to shut down.

1133
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,040
Carry me out later.

1134
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:22,440
No.

1135
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,520
Go borrow a power bank.

1136
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,440
I brought one.

1137
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,400
I feel like the weather on this island

1138
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:32,920
is rather cold.

1139
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,720
Should we close the door then?

1140
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,040
(I'll go) close the door.

1141
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,520
How about we just close it?

1142
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,320
Let's close it. I'll do it.

1143
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,240
Thank you.

1144
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,000
Hurry, who will close it first?

1145
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,720
That's brave.

1146
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,600
Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng)

1147
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,600
This is just the beginning.

1148
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,240
And already there's a bit of

1149
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,320
a small spark.

1150
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:17,840
By the way, have you guys

1151
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,600
taken that travel version of the love personality test?

1152
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:21,520
Yeah, I did.

1153
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,720
I'm the responsible type.

1154
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:24,080
Which type?

1155
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:24,560
Which type?

1156
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:25,480
Responsible type.

1157
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,160
I'm the friendship type.

1158
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:28,680
Me too, friendship type.

1159
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,000
All friendship-type lovers.

1160
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,960
What a coincidence.

1161
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:33,960
Do you think it's accurate?

1162
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,680
I think it's pretty accurate.

1163
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,880
I should be

1164
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:38,960
the possessive type.

1165
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:41,880
The comrade type.

1166
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,400
Comrade type.

1167
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,960
Sounds very loyal.

1168
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,440
It says it's a kind of absolute mutual possession.

1169
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,800
So your "comrade" is

1170
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,720
comrade or possessive?

1171
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,160
The Chinese listening test has started.

1172
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,440
Ruilong is really cute.

1173
00:47:58,760 --> 00:47:59,680
The second one is "possessive."

1174
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,240
It's "possessive."

1175
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,920
Possession of a person or an object.

1176
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:03,760
Right.

1177
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,280
It should account for about

1178
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,160
seventy percent, I think.

1179
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,720
Seventy percent accuracy.

1180
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,360
That's so precise.

1181
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,400
Looks like Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong) is

1182
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,120
a very possessive person.

1183
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,640
Only he is possessive.

1184
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,040
A boy came up to me and said,

1185
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,160
"My personality trait is being possessive."

1186
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,200
Right at the first meeting,

1187
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,920
I would feel a bit pressured.

1188
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:29,400
I wouldn't.

1189
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,000
Because I also really like possessive types.

1190
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,320
Being possessive should

1191
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,400
still be quite attractive, right?

1192
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,160
Because he will be especially

1193
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,480
clear in saying

1194
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,400
what he wants to express,

1195
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,680
what his needs are,

1196
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,280
and whether you can accept them.

1197
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,560
So for this matter,

1198
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:42,640
what should I do?

1199
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:43,800
Then he will definitely have

1200
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,840
a lot of motivation.

1201
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,520
So, all of you

1202
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,920
came here by that boat?

1203
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:52,400
Yes.

1204
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,440
Then did you also come from Shanghai

1205
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,320
by boat?

1206
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,720
You too?

1207
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:57,160
Yeah.

1208
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:57,680
You too?

1209
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,640
We all did.

1210
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:59,560
How did you get here?

1211
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,080
I took a boat from Hangzhou.

1212
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,360
Do you know how to get here by boat?

1213
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:06,880
I don't know.

1214
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,280
How do you get here by boat?

1215
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,920
From Qiantang River.

1216
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,000
Really?

1217
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,080
You came from Qiantang River by boat?

1218
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:17,680
I swam here.

1219
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,000
That's fake.

1220
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,400
Is that even possible?

1221
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:22,800
Wait a second.

1222
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:24,800
Just joking.

1223
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,240
I get your joke.

1224
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,480
Xu Rulan gets Fang Yijiong's joke.

1225
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,360
Yeah.

1226
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,520
I flew here.

1227
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,800
I parachuted down.

1228
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,520
Air-dropped.

1229
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:39,720
You're the coolest.

1230
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,120
A subtle atmosphere

1231
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,120
That first meeting they had

1232
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,400
The impression is very important

1233
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,240
Yes

1234
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:56,640
I think Jiao Zhiheng and Fang Yijiong

1235
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:57,400
are probably both interested in Lanlan (Xu Rulan)

1236
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,160
have some interest

1237
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:58,520
I think

1238
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,320
Lanlan (Xu Rulan)

1239
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,760
is the type who, from the start,

1240
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,400
draws people’s attention

1241
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,200
So my impression is probably the same

1242
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,160
as Ma Boxian’s

1243
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:04,720
I just think

1244
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:05,360
Fang Yijiong and Jiao Zhiheng

1245
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,320
are both quite focused on Lanlan (Xu Rulan)

1246
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,320
But I think Lanlan (Xu Rulan)

1247
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,520
pays more attention to Jiao Zhiheng

1248
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,720
Yes, I agree

1249
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:15,160
Even though in the end he said

1250
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:16,400
she understood Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong)

1251
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,120
But as for her,

1252
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:18,920
her extroverted personality

1253
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,280
means she's the kind of friend who

1254
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,360
like, "I get you,"

1255
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:22,080
will pick up on what everyone says.

1256
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,880
Yeah, but her

1257
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,400
understanding, I feel like it's not really

1258
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,160
I think Lanlan (Xu Rulan) right now

1259
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,600
actually isn't sending out any signals.

1260
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:29,400
She's just observing.

1261
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,240
Yeah, I feel the same way.

1262
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,520
I'm pretty much the same as them.

1263
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,080
We still need to observe a bit more.

1264
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,240
Let's keep going then.

1265
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:44,800
So beautiful.

1266
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,080
Let's walk around.

1267
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:46,720
Let's go.

1268
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:49,520
So beautiful.

1269
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,360
So beautiful.

1270
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,520
Can you make things by hand here?

1271
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:55,480
Yes, it's handmade.

1272
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:58,960
Thank you.

1273
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,200
Did you make this yourself?

1274
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,360
Yes, I made it myself.

1275
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,200
Do you want it?

1276
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:09,680
Are there any other tasty things over there?

1277
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:11,200
You can go take a look.

1278
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:11,640
Okay.

1279
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,280
The two of them have already chatted privately.

1280
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,200
Sugar oil cake.

1281
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:15,800
Do you want to try it?

1282
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:16,440
Never mind.

1283
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:19,840
This is really meaningful.

1284
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:20,400
Do you want to try it?

1285
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:20,720
Okay.

1286
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,920
Can you help me hold this?

1287
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:23,320
Sure.

1288
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:23,760
Thank you.

1289
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,400
I'm going to get something to eat.

1290
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:35,320
Are there any waffles left?

1291
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,160
No, they're all gone.

1292
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:36,880
There are still four pieces left.

1293
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:37,920
Four pieces.

1294
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:40,960
Should we share them with them?

1295
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:42,640
They're busy.

1296
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:46,360
So considerate.

1297
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,760
This is really fun.

1298
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,560
This is truly joyful.

1299
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,040
It's over.

1300
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,040
That was so much fun.

1301
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,360
I think you look really cool.

1302
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,800
First, we need to catch up with them.

1303
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,840
This car is pretty fun.

1304
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,160
Hello.

1305
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,960
Why can't it go faster?

1306
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,080
What is Jiao Zhiheng doing?

1307
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,400
Picking up trash.

1308
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,160
Cool.

1309
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:41,840
This is a big plus.

1310
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:42,640
Cool.

1311
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:43,280
Stylish.

1312
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:47,880
Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng)

1313
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,400
Do you want to give it a try?

1314
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:51,920
Okay.

1315
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:52,520
I'll give it a try.

1316
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:57,840
Hello.

1317
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,560
You drive so fast.

1318
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,200
I can't even catch up.

1319
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,280
You made her laugh.

1320
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:12,560
I'll stop driving now.

1321
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,960
He was supposed to go play.

1322
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:16,920
You can go for another round.

1323
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:17,880
Go for another round.

1324
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:18,320
With him.

1325
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,280
The sightseeing trio

1326
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,640
We’re the wind-chilling trio

1327
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:32,480
Yeah

1328
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,000
Aren’t you cold?

1329
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:33,680
Just put this on

1330
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,560
Do you want one?

1331
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,360
I have one

1332
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:36,080
Another one

1333
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:36,440
It’s fine

1334
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:37,480
No need for another one

1335
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:45,880
Bye

1336
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:52,880
Ruilong is really happy

1337
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,160
I’m back

1338
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:55,920
Let’s go

1339
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,720
Let’s switch cars and race again

1340
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,040
Want some candy?

1341
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,440
I still have snacks on me

1342
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:09,480
There’s a bit of candy

1343
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,600
He gave them candy

1344
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,360
Thanks

1345
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,240
Thank you

1346
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,200
Still driving?

1347
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,680
Ruilong really wants to play

1348
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,400
Ruilong seems like the type who loves to

1349
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,040
try things

1350
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,560
A big kid who loves trying new things

1351
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,280
Look, he’s really simple and honest

1352
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,520
All by himself

1353
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,040
It’s at this moment that Ruilong feels

1354
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:45,280
he’s truly relaxed

1355
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,360
He’s really relaxed

1356
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,000
Because right now

1357
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:47,920
it’s just Ruilong

1358
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:48,640
who’s really having fun

1359
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:49,640
Yeah

1360
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:56,880
Sorry to keep you waiting

1361
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,440
Are you guys cold?

1362
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:00,960
It’s okay

1363
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,720
I think we can head back first

1364
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:05,160
Okay

1365
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,000
Who is he looking at?

1366
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,480
Who is he looking at?

1367
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,400
Should the two of us take one car?

1368
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:21,440
Who?

1369
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,320
He sent a signal directly.

1370
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:25,760
Look.

1371
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:26,640
That's very proactive.

1372
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,360
He knows exactly what he wants.

1373
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,320
Very proactive.

1374
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:29,960
Yeah.

1375
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,040
Should the two of us take one car?

1376
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,720
It's just because there are two cars.

1377
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:41,480
You can get in this one.

1378
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,080
Okay.

1379
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,200
The possessiveness is showing.

1380
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:51,920
But...

1381
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:53,480
Let me guess.

1382
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:55,760
No.

1383
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:56,720
This...

1384
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,160
Feels a bit like a battle.

1385
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:00,400
Thanks.

1386
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:11,920
Feels like there's a secret.

1387
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:14,600
Those two.

1388
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,920
I'm really curious.

1389
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,360
It's a bit gossipy.

1390
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,400
Feels like Fang Yijiong is a bit jealous.

1391
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:22,200
I guess it's Jiao Zhiheng.

1392
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,720
Sent to Lanlan (Xu Rulan).

1393
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:24,640
Definitely.

1394
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:26,920
What does that mean?

1395
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:31,560
Did the phone ring?

1396
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:32,760
What's this?

1397
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:37,200
Now,

1398
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,080
the only

1399
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:40,640
and precious sunset time on the island will be released.

1400
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:41,640
A dating opportunity.

1401
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:42,560
Please send

1402
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:44,560
the name of the opposite-gender guest you've carefully considered

1403
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,440
to this device.

1404
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:47,560
The first person to send

1405
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:50,120
will get the only invitation this time.

1406
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,000
Then I think it's Jiao Zhiheng.

1407
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,720
He's someone who really takes the initiative.

1408
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:57,120
See?

1409
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,200
He's making his move.

1410
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,480
This side is also starting the same rule.

1411
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:06,080
Who?

1412
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,520
Looks like you got a message.

1413
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:12,680
I got a message.

1414
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:14,680
Who sent me a message?

1415
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:23,400
Lu Yuan's invitation.

1416
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:26,800
Who do you think she'll choose?

1417
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,240
I think it's Jin Yuxing.

1418
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:30,960
Those two will definitely pick each other.

1419
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:31,480
For sure.

1420
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,480
Where are you going?

1421
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,200
I'm coming, I'm coming.

1422
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,520
This is Jin Yuxing.

1423
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:43,720
Are you free later?

1424
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:45,520
Yes, I'm free.

1425
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:48,120
Can I invite you to watch the sunset?

1426
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,840
Can I invite you to watch the sunset?

1427
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,520
That's great.

1428
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,560
It's over here.

1429
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:55,120
This one too.

1430
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:55,640
This is it.

1431
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:57,480
This must be it.

1432
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,400
Girls have this kind of personality.

1433
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,400
Very likable, very generous.

1434
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,120
Just say it directly.

1435
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,040
Very straightforward.

1436
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:03,200
Okay.

1437
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:03,920
Alright.

1438
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:05,080
Bye.

1439
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:07,680
Bye.

1440
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:09,720
Bye.

1441
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:10,160
Bye.

1442
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,600
Why are we watching them leave?

1443
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,960
How about we just stand here and watch for a bit?

1444
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,160
Have you ever seen a sunset?

1445
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,320
Yes, I have.

1446
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,560
Have you been to West Lake?

1447
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:28,120
Yes, I have.

1448
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,600
The sunset at West Lake is really beautiful.

1449
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,240
Really?

1450
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,800
Because there's a blue hue.

1451
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:32,960
Its afterglow.

1452
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:33,840
Yeah.

1453
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:34,480
It's especially beautiful.

1454
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:34,960
It really is.

1455
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,040
Actually, walking together looks really nice.

1456
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:39,440
Yeah.

1457
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:43,160
Thank you.

1458
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,520
Thanks for carrying my bag.

1459
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,040
No problem.

1460
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,440
Can you do it?

1461
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:50,800
Why won't it go in?

1462
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:51,640
Let me help you.

1463
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:52,040
Okay.

1464
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:53,760
Thank you.

1465
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,280
It's nothing.

1466
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,400
Such a thoughtful person.

1467
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,520
Do you get carsick easily?

1468
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,280
I'm okay. Do you?

1469
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,080
I'm fine too.

1470
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:08,880
Me too.

1471
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,240
Did you get seasick on the boat yesterday?

1472
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:10,880
No.

1473
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,040
I feel like being on a boat

1474
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,480
lying there is actually pretty comfortable.

1475
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:15,000
Yeah.

1476
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:15,760
It's quite comfortable.

1477
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:16,560
It's good for sleeping.

1478
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:17,600
I think so.

1479
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:17,960
Alright.

1480
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,440
Don't you think it's a bit like a cradle?

1481
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,720
The way it rocks like that.

1482
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,000
Did you study math for both your undergraduate and graduate degrees?

1483
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,760
Both were in math?

1484
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:28,640
No.

1485
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:29,480
I just

1486
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:31,280
studied math for my undergraduate.

1487
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,280
Math is so hard.

1488
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,480
I think math is hard too.

1489
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,600
But you still studied math?

1490
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,120
It's not because I'm good at math.

1491
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:41,480
It's because

1492
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:44,480
I think math is a fundamental science.

1493
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,920
When choosing a major for graduate school,

1494
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,920
it gives you more options.

1495
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,720
Math is really brain-intensive.

1496
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:52,720
Yeah.

1497
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:57,760
Do you have any books you especially like to read?

1498
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,600
The last one was "Poor Charlie's Almanack."

1499
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,800
"Poor Charlie's Almanack."

1500
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,360
It's a very famous book.

1501
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:06,440
So what's your favorite book?

1502
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:08,280
I like reading works by Sanmao.

1503
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,480
"The Stories of the Sahara."

1504
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,680
And also novels by Yu Hua.

1505
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,280
For me, reading books

1506
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:14,640
sometimes can also

1507
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:15,880
help me learn a lot of new things.

1508
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,160
Whether it's reading storybooks

1509
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:18,480
or any other kind of book,

1510
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,000
Yes.

1511
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,640
Education always has a lagging effect.

1512
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:22,800
Right.

1513
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,080
Have you taken the teacher qualification exam?

1514
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:25,040
No.

1515
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,080
Why do you ask?

1516
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:26,520
Because

1517
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:27,680
what you just said

1518
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:28,520
really sounds like

1519
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:30,280
something that would appear on the teacher qualification exam.

1520
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:31,560
You've taken it?

1521
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:32,280
I have.

1522
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:32,680
I see.

1523
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:33,080
Yeah.

1524
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:33,480
I...

1525
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:34,040
What question?

1526
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,400
Like the questions on that exam.

1527
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,040
"Education always has

1528
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,200
a lagging effect."

1529
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:40,720
I

1530
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,720
I just think this point of view is correct.

1531
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:44,880
It's a good perspective.

1532
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,480
Like when you read books,

1533
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:48,480
or travel,

1534
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:49,080
Yeah.

1535
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:50,640
or socialize outside,

1536
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,880
it's all to broaden your horizons.

1537
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:53,720
Right.

1538
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,040
Every road you've walked,

1539
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:55,960
every book you've read,

1540
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,200
they all have an impact.

1541
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,760
Yeah, I think so too.

1542
01:00:58,760 --> 01:00:59,680
So you're absolutely right.

1543
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:02,920
The two of them really get along well.

1544
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:03,480
Yeah.

1545
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:05,600
You can feel that their conversations

1546
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:06,760
are very smooth.

1547
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,400
They both seem really smart.

1548
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:09,920
Yeah, steady.

1549
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:11,720
Let's go.

1550
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,200
It's beautiful.

1551
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:20,040
That's the lighthouse.

1552
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:21,280
Really.

1553
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,800
It's not like the lighthouse I imagined.

1554
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,560
Not quite the same.

1555
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:27,640
It kind of looks like the one in Harry Potter.

1556
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:28,680
Yeah.

1557
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:29,640
And also a bit like

1558
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:31,480
the "Eye of the World" in Marvel.

1559
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,360
Yeah.

1560
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,040
Can we go up there?

1561
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:37,240
We can go inside and take a look.

1562
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:37,640
Sure.

1563
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,160
I'll go up first.

1564
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,240
Okay.

1565
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,920
It might be inconvenient since you're wearing a dress.

1566
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,560
That's a plus.

1567
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:48,360
You can take your time.

1568
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:00,000
It should be

1569
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,160
through this feature

1570
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:04,200
that the light can be spread farther and brighter

1571
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,080
Look at this part

1572
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:07,480
There's one in the middle

1573
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:08,080
a light

1574
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:08,480
Yes

1575
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:09,800
It looks pretty nice

1576
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:12,800
Okay

1577
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:14,480
Let's go down

1578
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,640
We can go outside to take a look

1579
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:21,600
That's pretty good

1580
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,200
Very thoughtful

1581
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:25,960
Be careful

1582
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:27,640
Your hand

1583
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:29,280
Thank you

1584
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:31,480
Thanks

1585
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:32,760
Naturally

1586
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:34,320
It's here

1587
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,080
There's another door here

1588
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:37,160
How did I not notice that

1589
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,320
You can go out through this

1590
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:38,960
Yes

1591
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:45,920
It's even redder now

1592
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:46,400
Look at this sunset

1593
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:47,080
It's beautiful

1594
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:47,480
Yes

1595
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:50,640
Watching the sunset from here

1596
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:51,680
is actually quite romantic.

1597
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:52,200
Yeah.

1598
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:54,920
Your favorite flower

1599
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:55,600
is the sunflower.

1600
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:56,320
Sunflower.

1601
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:59,400
Yes, because it grows towards the sun.

1602
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,040
I prefer this kind of positive and uplifting vibe.

1603
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:03,720
Yeah, me too.

1604
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:05,800
So when my friends come to see me,

1605
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,480
they bring a bouquet of sunflowers.

1606
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:08,960
That's so nice.

1607
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:09,320
Yeah.

1608
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,600
Your friends really know how to make things special.

1609
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,000
My friends are very romantic.

1610
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:14,880
Jin Yuxing should bring her

1611
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:15,640
some sunflowers next time.

1612
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:17,440
I was just thinking the same thing.

1613
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,440
We can take a photo.

1614
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,040
Sure.

1615
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:22,080
I brought a Polaroid.

1616
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:22,880
Can you take a picture for me?

1617
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:23,680
Okay, sure.

1618
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:25,800
But just to be safe,

1619
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:26,440
should we

1620
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:27,880
take one with the phone first?

1621
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:29,240
That way we can check the composition.

1622
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:29,800
And then

1623
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:30,160
that's fine too.

1624
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,280
You're pretty good at this.

1625
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,080
Checking the composition.

1626
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,360
Her feedback is really positive too.

1627
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,960
I want to get a bit of the sunset in the shot.

1628
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:37,520
Get closer to you?

1629
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,080
Yeah, a little closer.

1630
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:41,320
Looks good.

1631
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,080
Thanks.

1632
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:44,640
Now I'll take one with the Polaroid.

1633
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:45,560
Wait a second.

1634
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:46,600
This way will look better.

1635
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,320
The photo looks great.

1636
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:49,960
Really?

1637
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:50,640
Yeah.

1638
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:51,640
It really does look good.

1639
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:55,840
Your skills are impressive.

1640
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:58,480
Let me take a photo for you.

1641
01:03:58,960 --> 01:03:59,560
Okay.

1642
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:00,440
Come on.

1643
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:01,360
Three,

1644
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:02,120
two,

1645
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:03,000
one.

1646
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,000
This one turned out well.

1647
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:07,960
Jin Yuxing really gets more impressive as time goes on.

1648
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:09,400
He's a person with a charming personality.

1649
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:10,960
He talks less and does more.

1650
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:11,280
Yeah.

1651
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,000
He's handsome.

1652
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:12,400
Yeah.

1653
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,680
Definitely reliable and handsome.

1654
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,000
Looks like we can see the sunset now.

1655
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:18,480
It's so beautiful.

1656
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:22,920
So beautiful.

1657
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,600
I've never seen it before.

1658
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,240
A sunset over the sea.

1659
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:26,600
Me neither.

1660
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:27,360
And it

1661
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:28,800
really does come down from the sky.

1662
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,480
It comes down from above the clouds like that.

1663
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:33,920
It's so beautiful.

1664
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,320
It's really romantic.

1665
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:37,080
They've had a great start.

1666
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:37,800
Yeah.

1667
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,560
This beginning is just wonderful.

1668
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,800
It feels so romantic.

1669
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:46,880
Because usually,

1670
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,240
people can't really look at the sun.

1671
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:51,120
You just can't look at it with the naked eye.

1672
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,320
But the sun gives us a moment

1673
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:56,040
when people can calmly gaze at it.

1674
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:01,840
So romantic.

1675
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:02,600
And this environment

1676
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,120
makes it hard not to feel romantic.

1677
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:04,800
Yeah.

1678
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,800
This setting really adds to it.

1679
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,600
You feel like being in the right environment

1680
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:09,720
is also very important.

1681
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:11,040
It's so important.

1682
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,240
Especially at the beginning.

1683
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:15,600
Today's sunset

1684
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:17,520
looks a lot like

1685
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:18,920
a rooster laying an egg.

1686
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:20,560
Now it's tucked into a pocket.

1687
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:22,560
You're so good at describing things.

1688
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:25,720
I think

1689
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:28,320
the destination of a trip isn't that important.

1690
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:30,440
What's important is who you go with.

1691
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:31,360
That's right.

1692
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:37,920
I want to take

1693
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,960
a Polaroid photo of the two of us.

1694
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:40,800
Sure.

1695
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:42,720
It's crooked.

1696
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:43,520
Move it over a bit more.

1697
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,040
Like this?

1698
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:44,640
That's good.

1699
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:46,640
Looks great.

1700
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:57,640
Why are you still looking at yourself and smiling?

1701
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,000
Because I think it's really interesting.

1702
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:02,520
But I actually think that

1703
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:07,360
physical photos you can hold are more precious.

1704
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:09,320
Because now everything is digital photos.

1705
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,080
But this one,

1706
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:13,040
there might only be this one, unique copy.

1707
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:15,840
Jin Yuxing is actually quite thoughtful.

1708
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:17,520
Look at the way he expresses himself and does things.

1709
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:19,440
It's an honor.

1710
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:20,880
To be able to take this photo of you.

1711
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,800
Then I should thank you for bringing the Polaroid.

1712
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:26,880
You're welcome.

1713
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:28,480
I'm happy.

1714
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:33,400
Did you expect today that you would

1715
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,320
be invited?

1716
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:37,200
No.

1717
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:43,920
But still, thank you

1718
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:46,280
for being willing to watch the sunset with me.

1719
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:48,160
It's my honor.

1720
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:51,120
That's so sweet.

1721
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:52,440
I'm loving this.

1722
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:59,080
He's really nothing like when he was first sitting in that chair.

1723
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:01,440
It's like he's a completely different person.

1724
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:02,280
Because some people

1725
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:03,560
can only truly show themselves

1726
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,400
when things are quiet, or when it's one-on-one.

1727
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:08,240
That's when their real self comes out.

1728
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:11,040
And I think when two people are sitting in a car,

1729
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:14,320
it feels like the distance between them is closer.

1730
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:16,520
That's because their hearts are closer.

1731
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,480
Do you usually get carsick?

1732
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:26,360
No, I don't.

1733
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:27,000
Okay.

1734
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,880
As long as there aren't frequent sudden stops, it's fine.

1735
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:31,400
Got it.

1736
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,560
I have to take a couple of photos of this sunset.

1737
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:37,520
Alright, I'll drive slower then.

1738
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,120
He's very considerate.

1739
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:43,160
The whole sea looks pink.

1740
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:43,840
Yeah.

1741
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:45,760
Yesterday's sunset wasn't this beautiful.

1742
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:49,840
The sunset invitation turned into a sunset glow invitation.

1743
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:54,080
Sunrise and sunset—

1744
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:56,040
Which one do you like more?

1745
01:07:58,120 --> 01:07:59,320
Actually, I was just about to say—

1746
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:00,120
That is,

1747
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:00,880
During the day,

1748
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,600
my favorite time is when the sky is glowing at sunset.

1749
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:03,640
At sunset.

1750
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:04,840
Yeah.

1751
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:08,840
It's so beautiful.

1752
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,280
It's getting dark.

1753
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:14,320
Then we can—

1754
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:15,040
have dinner.

1755
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:15,480
Sure.

1756
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:20,720
The cliffside restaurant.

1757
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:27,440
Where do you want to sit?

1758
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:28,480
I'll sit here.

1759
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:28,880
Okay.

1760
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:31,800
Thank you.

1761
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:35,520
Are you feeling a bit—

1762
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:35,920
I'm fine.

1763
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:40,400
Hello, may I take your order?

1764
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,160
He always pays attention to

1765
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:45,080
the details.

1766
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:45,600
Can I take a look?

1767
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:46,880
This is the menu.

1768
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:47,520
Thank you.

1769
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:54,080
I want to have one.

1770
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:55,520
Matcha mille crepe.

1771
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:55,960
Okay.

1772
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:56,920
Do you need anything else?

1773
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:58,720
Take a look.

1774
01:08:58,720 --> 01:08:59,120
Alright.

1775
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,280
Did you order the squid tentacles?

1776
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:03,720
No.

1777
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:04,720
No. Do you want some?

1778
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:06,560
I’ll eat it. I’m not picky.

1779
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:07,640
Add one order of squid tentacles.

1780
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:08,400
Okay.

1781
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:08,920
You’re eating it, right?

1782
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:09,400
Yes, I am.

1783
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:09,920
Alright.

1784
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:11,160
Jiao Zhiheng is so thoughtful.

1785
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:11,640
Yeah.

1786
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:15,880
Have you seen "Me Before You"?

1787
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:17,520
It’s really good.

1788
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:18,880
"Me Before You."

1789
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:20,640
I haven’t.

1790
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:22,400
You should check it out.

1791
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:23,760
Okay, I’ll watch it later.

1792
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:25,680
"Me Before You."

1793
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:26,520
Yeah.

1794
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:28,600
I’ll make a note of it.

1795
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:31,080
He’s writing it down.

1796
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:32,120
He’s pretty attentive.

1797
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:37,240
Hello, the dessert is ready.

1798
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:38,080
Okay, thank you.

1799
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:41,680
Thanks.

1800
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:46,200
Thank you.

1801
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,040
Eat quickly.

1802
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:47,440
Alright.

1803
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:49,480
You must be really hungry.

1804
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:50,360
Super hungry.

1805
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,760
Could I have two small bowls?

1806
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:54,480
Yes.

1807
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:55,160
I want one.

1808
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:55,800
Here you go.

1809
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:58,880
We only have small plates here.

1810
01:09:58,880 --> 01:09:59,720
That's fine, no problem.

1811
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:00,360
Thank you.

1812
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:04,720
I'll mix it.

1813
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:05,480
Okay.

1814
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:06,880
Great.

1815
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:12,560
Thank you.

1816
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:14,640
Thanks.

1817
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,400
He seems like the type who likes to take care of others.

1818
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:23,560
So which city in the country do you like more?

1819
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:24,560
Which one is your favorite?

1820
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:25,400
Beijing.

1821
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,000
Actually, I stayed in Beijing for a while.

1822
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:29,520
Really?

1823
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:29,880
Yeah.

1824
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:33,080
I was over in Wangjing.

1825
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:35,640
Where were you?

1826
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:36,360
Which district were you in?

1827
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,760
I lived on Dawang Road.

1828
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:41,800
That's actually not far.

1829
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:43,120
At least it's in the same direction.

1830
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:45,680
Autumn in Beijing

1831
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:46,200
is so beautiful.

1832
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:46,640
So beautiful.

1833
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:47,360
Ginkgo trees.

1834
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:47,920
Yeah.

1835
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:52,320
Those golden leaves against the red walls

1836
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:53,320
look amazing.

1837
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:54,440
Yeah.

1838
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:55,760
Yeah.

1839
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,080
And at that time,

1840
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:58,800
it was basically sunny every day.

1841
01:10:58,800 --> 01:10:59,280
Yes.

1842
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:00,880
And the weather wasn't too cold.

1843
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:01,680
Yeah.

1844
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:02,920
Photos turn out really well.

1845
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:03,520
Right.

1846
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:09,800
Jiao Zhiheng probably has feelings of attraction.

1847
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:10,920
He feels attracted.

1848
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:11,640
Yes.

1849
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:14,160
So,

1850
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,240
Your birthday is at the end of June.

1851
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:17,640
Yes.

1852
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:20,800
Cancer.

1853
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:23,760
I have many

1854
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,440
family members who are Cancer.

1855
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:28,160
Really?

1856
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,520
I grew up surrounded by Cancers.

1857
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:30,040
Yes.

1858
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:33,400
So you must feel pretty comfortable meeting me.

1859
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:36,760
So, where are you from?

1860
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:37,200
Where are you from?

1861
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:39,480
Guess.

1862
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:40,120
Let me guess.

1863
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:44,280
Chengdu?

1864
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:44,680
Chongqing?

1865
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:46,360
Chengdu?

1866
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:46,760
Chongqing?

1867
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:50,600
Yes.

1868
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:51,160
Sichuanese.

1869
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:51,840
Sichuanese.

1870
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:52,240
Yes.

1871
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:54,760
So

1872
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:55,720
impressive.

1873
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:00,120
Sichuan guys

1874
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:00,680
are great.

1875
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:01,480
Very tolerant.

1876
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:03,200
"Henpecked husband."

1877
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:04,720
Yes.

1878
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:05,400
That word,

1879
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:06,480
I was too shy to say it.

1880
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:07,320
But I know it.

1881
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:08,920
Of course.

1882
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:14,480
Let me guess your weight.

1883
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:19,840
138 jin.

1884
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:21,360
Pretty close.

1885
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:23,360
Almost.

1886
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:24,480
136 jin.

1887
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,000
136 jin, 138 jin.

1888
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,600
She's amazing.

1889
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:30,760
And your body fat percentage?

1890
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:32,040
Your body fat must be pretty low too, right?

1891
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:34,080
Ten percent.

1892
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:36,040
Twelve percent.

1893
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:37,440
Around fourteen percent.

1894
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:41,280
You got it right again.

1895
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:41,800
Right?

1896
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:43,160
She's so good at this.

1897
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,160
You're amazing.

1898
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:48,400
You really know how to calculate.

1899
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:53,640
This is my first time...

1900
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:55,360
It's really my first time...

1901
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:56,160
First time in my life...

1902
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:57,760
...someone guessed me...

1903
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:58,600
...so accurately.

1904
01:12:58,600 --> 01:12:59,280
Really?

1905
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:00,920
That accurate?

1906
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:03,720
I'm still learning too.

1907
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:06,600
It's fate.

1908
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:08,560
I'm falling for it.

1909
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,640
I think Jiao Zhiheng is...

1910
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:11,440
...completely captivated.

1911
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:12,800
It's gotten to his heart.

1912
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:13,720
Yes.

1913
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:15,080
Take a note on your phone.

1914
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:16,200
What's the movie title?

1915
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:17,480
Let me write it down.

1916
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:19,200
He takes this very seriously.

1917
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:19,720
This kind of behavior...

1918
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:21,760
...shows he really cares.

1919
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:23,000
About what the other person says.

1920
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:27,280
Back at the dorm.

1921
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:33,480
Hello.

1922
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:34,120
Hello.

1923
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:41,320
Please have a seat.

1924
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:44,200
I wanted to ask what you went to do.

1925
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:46,160
Was it nice?

1926
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:48,280
It was beautiful. I took some photos.

1927
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:49,880
There are photos.

1928
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:53,440
Let me see.

1929
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:55,320
I took them.

1930
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:58,560
Yes, like this.

1931
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:04,160
It looks really nice.

1932
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:06,640
I didn't expect to see a sunset on a cloudy day.

1933
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:07,840
He said it looked like an egg.

1934
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:14,600
So romantic.

1935
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:21,400
Where should we go?

1936
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:22,720
How about coming to my room?

1937
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,840
So relaxing.

1938
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:26,800
I really want to have a good sleep.

1939
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,560
Alright, let's sleep now.

1940
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,520
Three people lying on the sofa.

1941
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,240
Isn't this also something interesting?

1942
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:33,400
How about we...

1943
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:35,240
...turn off the light above us?

1944
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:36,440
I think we can turn it off.

1945
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:38,000
Then give it a try.

1946
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:42,760
Okay.

1947
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:05,120
Check tomorrow's sunrise time.

1948
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,280
You want to watch the sunrise?

1949
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:08,280
Let's check the time first.

1950
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:10,480
4:50.

1951
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:11,160
Sorry to bother you.

1952
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:12,720
We can't watch it at one o'clock.

1953
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:13,800
It's too early.

1954
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:14,520
Yeah.

1955
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:16,760
Curious.

1956
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:18,560
We were just guessing earlier.

1957
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:19,920
We wondered if there would be more.

1958
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:22,400
More people.

1959
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:23,760
I feel like there aren't any more people.

1960
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:27,280
Feels like next we'll go to

1961
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:28,280
the cabin.

1962
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:29,080
Maybe.

1963
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:30,080
Yeah.

1964
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:32,320
Looking forward to what we'll do tomorrow.

1965
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:36,480
It's unknown but exciting.

1966
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:38,560
Yes.

1967
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:39,600
And curious too.

1968
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:48,000
On another island.

1969
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:49,040
Exchange.

1970
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:52,920
Exchange invitations.

1971
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:54,080
I really like watching this kind of thing.

1972
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:58,920
Pick the person of the opposite sex you're most curious about.

1973
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:00,200
Send one man and one woman over.

1974
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:01,280
And bring one man and one woman here.

1975
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:05,720
Boys and girls exchange places.

1976
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:06,040
Yes.

1977
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:08,800
So nervous.

1978
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:09,840
It's kind of fun.

1979
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:11,640
I think this is really interesting.

1980
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:12,880
It's starting.

1981
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:15,600
Hey, man.

1982
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:16,160
Let's go.

1983
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:16,800
Let's go.

1984
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:18,040
Curious.

1985
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,600
There's a letter here.

1986
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,600
I suddenly feel so nervous.

1987
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,200
I thought it would be just one.

1988
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:30,360
But it turned out to be three.

1989
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:32,520
This is basically her

1990
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:33,600
profile.

1991
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:35,560
You two,

1992
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:36,880
there are photos included.

1993
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:38,160
Let's look at the ones we have first.

1994
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:39,520
Could there be a problem with this?

1995
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:40,120
That is,

1996
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:41,000
if any one of the three of us

1997
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,760
gets chosen,

1998
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:44,000
we'll have to move out tomorrow.

1999
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:45,600
This is so exciting.

2000
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:49,160
Here it comes.

2001
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:50,280
Now this is interesting.

2002
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:55,200
This one looks like

2003
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:57,280
a mixed-race person or a foreigner.

2004
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:57,760
Ruilong.

2005
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:59,400
Market philosopher.

2006
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:03,040
Feels like they're all good at cooking.

2007
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:03,920
That's awesome.

2008
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:08,520
Photo Agent

2009
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:12,040
This guy over here is so cute.

2010
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:13,600
He has a tag above him called

2011
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:14,960
Senior Outdoorsman

2012
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:17,560
Feels like he’s the type who likes outdoor activities.

2013
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:19,640
This one is a possessive lover.

2014
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:21,080
I haven’t seen this one before.

2015
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:23,200
It’s just

2016
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:23,920
Wang Yifan and Lanlan (Xu Rulan)

2017
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:25,160
Are they both friendship types?

2018
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:26,600
Only Lanlan (Xu Rulan) is the friendship type.

2019
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:28,840
You are just as worthy of love.

2020
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:30,320
Actually, many of his

2021
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:31,920
really hit my soft spots.

2022
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:33,280
So it seems like he

2023
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:34,080
this type

2024
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:35,040
is very sunny.

2025
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:40,280
You’re suited to planning out every day of your trip in advance.

2026
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:41,480
Every day’s activities.

2027
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:43,200
Has this one not shown up before?

2028
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:43,640
Responsible type.

2029
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:44,440
Responsible lover.

2030
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:45,120
Really?

2031
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:46,320
Yes.

2032
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,280
A good relationship needs not only friendship

2033
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:49,440
but also passion

2034
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:51,120
and a bit of romance.

2035
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,120
He's just like you.

2036
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:53,760
Yes.

2037
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,200
Her answer

2038
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:57,960
is exactly the same as mine.

2039
01:17:58,120 --> 01:17:59,200
This friendship-type lover

2040
01:17:59,200 --> 01:17:59,960
seems like

2041
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:00,840
me too.

2042
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:01,960
I'm a friendship-type lover.

2043
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:02,600
Both of us are.

2044
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:03,040
Yes.

2045
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:06,520
So the three of us need to choose one person.

2046
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:07,360
Here we go.

2047
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:08,480
Who?

2048
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:10,400
Choose.

2049
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:11,040
Which one?

2050
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:14,240
Which one are you more curious about?

2051
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:15,760
This is exciting.

2052
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:17,160
You can only pick one.

2053
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:18,520
So nerve-wracking.

2054
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:21,960
Then let's pick him.

2055
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:22,800
Who did they choose?

2056
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:23,960
This one.

2057
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:24,480
Her?

2058
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:25,360
Okay.

2059
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:26,760
Who is it?

2060
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:27,920
This one.

2061
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:28,520
Alright.

2062
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:29,680
Then let's choose her.

2063
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:30,880
Who is it?

2064
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:37,560
I think

2065
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:39,440
Wang Jue will go to the other island.

2066
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:41,240
Then, they'll switch.

2067
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:42,840
Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong) will come to this island.

2068
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:44,760
If it's a boy, Wang Lechen will go over.

2069
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:46,040
If it's a girl, Wang Yifan.

2070
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:48,560
Why Wang Yifan?

2071
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:51,360
Definitely.

2072
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:52,560
No reason, that's just how it is.

2073
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,000
It's definitely like this.

2074
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,360
I think

2075
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:56,360
Xu Rulan will make it through.

2076
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:57,840
Count me in.

2077
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:58,640
I think so too.

2078
01:18:58,640 --> 01:18:59,800
Xu Rulan will make it through.

2079
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:01,720
I think Lanlan (Xu Rulan)

2080
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:03,200
will catch people's attention

2081
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:04,160
right from the start.

2082
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:05,680
So I vote for Lanlan (Xu Rulan).

2083
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:07,200
Lanlan (Xu Rulan) will make it through.

2084
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:09,680
I think Ruilong will go over.

2085
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:10,560
Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong) won't go.

2086
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:12,400
I think Ruilong will go.

2087
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:13,200
Why is that?

2088
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:14,600
Because he's a bit silly.

2089
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:14,960
He's very cute.

2090
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:16,440
A mixed-race boy.

2091
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:18,000
Visually, he might

2092
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,320
make people a bit more curious.

2093
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:20,560
So maybe switch to Ruilong.

2094
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:21,600
Actually, I think

2095
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:22,480
it still depends on looks.

2096
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,480
Yeah, you're right.

2097
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:25,800
I think for the most part,

2098
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:26,400
because this is just

2099
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:27,480
a first impression.

2100
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:28,760
Whether it's your type or not.

2101
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:30,120
Yes, having your preferred type is important too.

2102
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:31,080
Whether it hits your preferences.

2103
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:32,080
Right.

2104
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:33,960
So then,

2105
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:34,960
so far,

2106
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:35,960
it's just a first impression.

2107
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:38,760
So what will our final choice be?

2108
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:39,440
Everyone can see

2109
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,320
the pace of our island trip

2110
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:42,600
is still quite fast.

2111
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:43,800
And the invitation to switch

2112
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,280
is also very exciting.

2113
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:48,240
Who will be switched in the end?

2114
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:49,480
Who?

2115
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:50,480
After the switch,

2116
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:51,760
what will happen to them?

2117
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:53,480
Let's keep watching

2118
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:55,280
the next part of the story.
