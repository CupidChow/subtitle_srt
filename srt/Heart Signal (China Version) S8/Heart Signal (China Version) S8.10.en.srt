1
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,780
Okay, let's keep watching.

2
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,260
What does that mean?

3
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,260
This is...

4
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,660
Are they sending some kind of message?

5
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,220
Is this the messaging part?

6
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,620
It's about inviting the other person to watch...

7
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,740
...the sunset.

8
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,340
Sunset time.

9
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,140
On their very first day, they...

10
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,300
...are moving so fast.

11
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,860
And it's a public invitation.

12
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,020
So everyone else will know.

13
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,180
That fast?

14
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:08,460
Wait a second.

15
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,220
She...

16
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,540
At the beginning, they...

17
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,940
...were getting along pretty well.

18
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,100
It was Lu Yuan...

19
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,500
...who got the sunset time slot.

20
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,220
Then she invited...

21
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:16,980
...Jin Yuxing.

22
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,220
This lighthouse...

23
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,380
We've been here before.

24
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,820
It's this road.

25
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,060
A landmark spot.

26
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,380
But I don't think we saw the sunset.

27
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,340
No, we didn't.

28
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,260
This is that lighthouse.

29
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,500
So that's why the lighthouse appeared.

30
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,140
So it was here.

31
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,060
This lighthouse...

32
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,180
How did they get up there?

33
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,420
He seized this opportunity.

34
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,220
So romantic.

35
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,380
Watching the sunset on the very first day.

36
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,580
So beautiful.

37
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,860
So philosophical.

38
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,460
So beautiful.

39
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,140
I want to go too.

40
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,900
You can go with Qiqi (Wang Qi).

41
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,860
I will.

42
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,740
He took photos of her.

43
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,820
I feel like under the sunset,

44
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,180
everything,

45
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,140
all the chemistry,

46
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,340
basically, whatever you want to do,

47
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,580
if you do it under the sunset,

48
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,860
it will pretty much succeed.

49
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:36,780
Really?

50
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,980
This is a wish-making sunset.

51
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,300
Anything can succeed.

52
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,300
I don't know.

53
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,420
That's just my personal feeling.

54
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,380
It just has that kind of vibe.

55
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:44,620
Yeah.

56
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,700
The vibe is really important.

57
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,460
Yeah.

58
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,660
I really think

59
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,100
the first day, with this kind of scene,

60
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,260
was already

61
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,020
a mini date.

62
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,220
Xiaoyuan (Lu Yuan), she just

63
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,580
grabbed that invitation card.

64
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,060
And then she invited

65
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:55,620
Jin Yuxing directly.

66
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,380
So,

67
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,060
I think the invitation card

68
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,620
is actually quite important.

69
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:58,940
Yeah.

70
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,220
Because you guys also

71
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,740
had a memorable moment, right?

72
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,860
At that time, Yang Ruqing

73
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,540
this memorable moment,

74
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,740
handed out two invitation cards.

75
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,180
It's just that

76
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,900
nothing more needed to be said.

77
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,260
I almost cried.

78
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,940
So how did you feel at that moment?

79
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,780
It just suddenly felt like

80
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,540
something stood up.

81
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,340
Right?

82
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,420
He really needs to be knocked into shape.

83
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,500
That was how I felt at the time.

84
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,180
Now I can't even use

85
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,540
words to describe it.

86
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,780
All I can say is, at that moment,

87
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,500
I was incredibly shocked.

88
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,980
And also deeply moved.

89
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:34,860
Tears welled up

90
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,500
in my eyes.

91
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,140
All for you.

92
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,380
So I think it's

93
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,460
that kind of sincerity

94
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:56,780
Yeah.

95
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,100
that touches people the most.

96
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:58,300
Yeah.

97
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:58,940
Actually, at that moment,

98
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,820
you completely forget

99
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:00,740
that you're in the cabin.

100
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,020
Yeah.

101
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,260
By then, you already

102
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,340
only know about the person

103
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,700
right in front of you

104
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,660
and the story happening with her.

105
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,340
Because for me,

106
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,700
rules are rules,

107
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,700
and feelings are feelings.

108
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,580
Even though I have two invitation cards,

109
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,100
and I could give them to two people,

110
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,580
maybe I only want to give one to one person.

111
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,260
Then I think that's what I should do.

112
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,260
Just crazily pursuing me.

113
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,420
I can't listen to it anymore.

114
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,420
It's about stepping outside the rules

115
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,780
to express your true feelings.

116
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,460
I think that's also a part of being brave.

117
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,340
But for things like this sunset date and

118
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:40,900
the one in your season,

119
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,380
the only weekday date,

120
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,460
actually requires

121
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,380
the guys or girls to compete for it.

122
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,620
Then Oscar managed to get it.

123
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,220
He got the first weekday exclusive date.

124
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,540
He wanted to get to know me better.

125
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,180
I think it's because

126
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,620
during the weekday exclusive date,

127
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,020
everyone had already been

128
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,140
in the house

129
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,340
spending some time together.

130
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,140
And then

131
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,300
at that point, the weekday exclusive date

132
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,140
was just the right time

133
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,940
to get to know each other more deeply.

134
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,140
So at that time, I decided

135
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,620
to go for that weekday exclusive date

136
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,820
to get to know Sun Leyan.

137
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,780
I really didn't expect

138
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:17,940
to become the first

139
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,740
person to receive this weekday exclusive date.

140
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,220
Yeah.

141
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,380
But I also felt

142
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,460
that since fate

143
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,500
gave you this opportunity,

144
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,460
you should seize it.

145
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,820
So, make the most of it and get to know each other.

146
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,300
I think

147
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,060
I made the right move.

148
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,340
Alright, let's continue

149
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,660
watching the show.

150
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,540
Exchange invitations

151
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,100
Check their information

152
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,140
Then choose the person of the opposite sex you're most curious about

153
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,060
Invite him or her to

154
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,220
their own island

155
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,340
This is a bit like

156
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,860
the room swap in Heart Signal House

157
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,580
It means we might

158
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,900
swap to the room across

159
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,660
And the person you like

160
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,820
might also swap back

161
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,740
So you might meet

162
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,460
or you might miss each other

163
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:06,940
Tomo and Qiqi

164
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,620
actually swapped into each other's rooms

165
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,380
Right

166
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,460
They both wanted to see each other

167
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:11,820
But it's just that

168
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,060
It's okay

169
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:12,820
It doesn't affect the ending

170
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,900
Mutual effort

171
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,340
Yes

172
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,780
And you might end up missing each other

173
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,780
When I found out at the time

174
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,860
I thought I

175
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,580
misread the rules

176
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,420
and maybe I was on the wrong side

177
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,180
But in the end I realized

178
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,380
it was actually mutual

179
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,060
We both went too far trying to meet each other

180
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,100
But it doesn't matter

181
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,340
There was a happy ending

182
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,460
Right, isn't it?

183
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:31,900
Yes

184
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,340
So now we

185
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,140
have another little challenge.

186
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,820
We need to make a guess first

187
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,660
about the two islands

188
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,580
and who will be swapped between them.

189
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,220
This is way too hard.

190
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:43,900
I think so too.

191
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,900
It's a bit confusing.

192
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,820
Here is some information about the guests.

193
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,300
Everyone can take a look.

194
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,540
We can check it out.

195
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,700
The information in our hands.

196
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,740
But we still don't know

197
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,740
what they're thinking.

198
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,100
So it's really just a blind guess.

199
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:56,900
Yeah.

200
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,140
I don't even know what type he likes.

201
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,300
Because on Huaniao Island right now,

202
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,460
there's Wang Jue,

203
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,460
Ke Ailin, and Lu Yuan—three girls.

204
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,380
And now they

205
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,540
have information on three guys.

206
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,460
Ruilong,

207
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,700
Fang Yijiong, and Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng).

208
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,300
Among these three,

209
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:12,940
who do you all think

210
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,260
these three girls will

211
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,500
choose?

212
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,940
So only one person is being swapped, right?

213
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:20,860
One man and one woman.

214
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,100
Each island has two people.

215
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,340
To exchange.

216
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,740
Let's choose someone from the other side.

217
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,860
Choose the other side.

218
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,980
So they're being picked to go over.

219
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,020
Yeah, so actually it's completely...

220
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,860
So it's a total guess.

221
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,940
Yeah, just a wild guess.

222
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,700
They're choosing a guy, right?

223
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:30,980
Right.

224
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,580
Not choosing a girl.

225
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,100
Those three girls.

226
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,780
Which of these three guys will they pick?

227
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:34,780
Yeah.

228
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,660
I think they'll pick...

229
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,820
I think they'll pick Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng).

230
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,420
Why would they pick Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng)?

231
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,940
Based on what just happened...

232
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,020
But they haven't met...

233
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,780
These three.

234
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,460
Yeah, they haven't met those two.

235
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,300
Haven't met.

236
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:48,820
Right.

237
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,620
Yeah, that's right.

238
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,380
They're from the other island.

239
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:50,860
Sorry.

240
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,660
I made a mistake.

241
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,380
I think all three of them are pretty extroverted.

242
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,460
They want to meet someone

243
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:57,940
who is different.

244
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,900
Because extroverts are more eager to interact

245
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:00,940
with people who are different.

246
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,220
Yes.

247
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,780
So I think it might be Ruilong.

248
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,420
Okay, let's try.

249
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,300
Let's try Ruilong.

250
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:08,980
I choose Ruilong.

251
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,300
Because his name is very unique.

252
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,140
If we only look at it

253
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,780
from the travel personality test,

254
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,780
this is the only clue we have.

255
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,700
Then we might lean towards

256
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,860
choosing the friendship-type lover.

257
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,140
Yes.

258
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,020
That would be Xiao Jiao.

259
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:21,140
Right.

260
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,380
But you might not necessarily choose

261
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,300
someone with the same personality as yourself.

262
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,140
Of course.

263
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:24,860
This is just

264
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,140
our personal

265
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:26,980
opinion.

266
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,100
Then I don't think it's Xiao Jiao.

267
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,060
Okay, then who do you think it is?

268
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:31,820
I think it's Ruilong.

269
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,620
Why?

270
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,420
Because his name is also very unique.

271
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,540
That's possible too.

272
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:35,980
Right?

273
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,740
The conclusion we've reached here

274
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,180
is that we will choose Ruilong.

275
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,380
Okay.

276
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,060
Ke Ailin, I think.

277
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,460
Ke Ailin, I think.

278
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:46,940
They say

279
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,820
three girls choose one guy

280
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,380
and basically trade themselves away.

281
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,300
Hit

282
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,620
I'll send you over there.

283
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,420
You go fight.

284
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,700
Today I'm "hiring a substitute to fight" for me.

285
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,620
Let me apply.

286
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,020
Help!

287
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,300
I'm just here for laughs.

288
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,100
Now I get it.

289
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,540
I should've come to you earlier.

290
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,100
Aren't three girls supposed to go over?

291
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,060
No.

292
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:10,660
What she asked was

293
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,100
which of the three girls

294
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,380
would invite which guy over.

295
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,300
And then you said

296
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,340
we'll just pick Xu Rulan and

297
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,460
they pick one guy.

298
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:20,820
You choose.

299
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,180
I know.

300
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,820
So, who did Xu Rulan and the others choose?

301
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,980
Just abstain.

302
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,780
You can't understand this with your IQ.

303
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,060
They chose Wang Lechen.

304
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,780
With your IQ,

305
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,580
you can basically say goodbye

306
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,220
to "Signal of the Heart."

307
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,220
I said Xu Rulan chose Wang Lechen.

308
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,500
I just finished saying Xu Rulan,

309
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,420
and you said your IQ isn't enough.

310
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,260
You said your IQ isn't enough.

311
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:39,660
It's okay.

312
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,780
Let's just watch first.

313
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,060
Who is it?

314
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,580
Look.

315
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,940
Two boats have met.

316
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,380
Meeting like this.

317
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:53,660
This scene

318
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,740
seems to be him

319
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,540
is very distant

320
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,340
I saw it

321
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,660
Wang Yifan and

322
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,540
Fang Yijiong

323
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,820
We guessed completely wrong

324
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,340
No

325
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,740
Not a single one was right

326
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,140
They totally just based it on

327
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,460
the travel personality test to choose

328
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,180
Yeah

329
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,740
So what you said was right

330
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,500
It's pretty obvious now, right?

331
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,460
But the guy doesn't seem to have

332
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,220
shown any clear signals

333
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,100
It's meaningless

334
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,580
Because if he liked her

335
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,860
I think he would take a photo of her

336
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,660
Yeah

337
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:25,820
Yeah

338
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,660
Watching the sunset

339
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,100
So beautiful

340
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,380
It's really romantic

341
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,300
You too

342
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,700
This sentence

343
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,300
What's wrong?

344
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:39,700
So sweet

345
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,460
So beautiful

346
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,220
So sweet

347
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,100
The light shines on my face

348
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,420
I can't see myself

349
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,460
What's the hidden meaning?

350
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,140
Do you know?

351
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,420
You're the only one in my eyes

352
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:47,940
Yeah

353
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,500
So beautiful.

354
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:55,300
Duoduo (Ke Ailin)

355
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,380
This outfit is really beautiful.

356
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,380
I really like it.

357
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,420
This kind of road walk is really

358
00:10:59,420 --> 00:10:59,620
Yeah.

359
00:10:59,620 --> 00:10:59,940
very comfortable.

360
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,500
Indeed.

361
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:00,780
Yeah.

362
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,700
It started off as this kind of group trip.

363
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,340
It's really great.

364
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,100
Look, he's going to take a photo of her.

365
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,020
Wang Lechen and Duoduo (Ke Ailin)

366
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,540
Wang Lechen took the initiative twice

367
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,340
to take photos of Duoduo (Ke Ailin).

368
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,780
He took them really well.

369
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,940
They look great.

370
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,620
This is really beautiful.

371
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,580
Let's go there.

372
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,780
It has a group photo vibe.

373
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,460
Just like you all

374
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,460
in season seven of "Signal of the Heart,"

375
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,220
you also went to the seaside.

376
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,700
That feeling of going on a trip.

377
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,620
Actually, at the beginning,

378
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,780
if it's all this kind of trip,

379
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,380
it's easy to enhance

380
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,340
everyone's feelings for each other.

381
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,660
Yeah, because there's a good atmosphere.

382
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,060
Make good use of this atmosphere.

383
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,660
It brings people closer together.

384
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,740
If you're a bit braver,

385
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,060
the success rate will be very high.

386
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,700
If I were here,

387
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,700
I would make good use of this scenery.

388
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,380
Because we just finished watching

389
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,020
this "First Meeting Travel Episode,"

390
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,380
we all really want to go.

391
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,540
Yeah, it's really beautiful.

392
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,340
Actually, that grand prize is

393
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,380
"Signal of the Heart" Season 8

394
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,500
The same island sunset trip

395
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,180
voucher

396
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,340
Right?

397
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,140
So I just said

398
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,820
I'm really looking forward to this prize

399
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:16,940
We have to win

400
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,980
We really have to win

401
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:18,900
Right now, the production team

402
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,380
should give us

403
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,500
a

404
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,300
group trip

405
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:21,740
and arrange it right away

406
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,620
Wait, seven people

407
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,460
plus Qiqi (Wang Qi)

408
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,580
Is this for real?

409
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,540
How many days?

410
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,060
A spot for seven people

411
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,060
Does it include food and accommodation?

412
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,740
Let's start the game

413
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,540
Love Hug

414
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,580
Each team has five sets of words

415
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,620
One person stands behind

416
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,140
and hugs the other person

417
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,060
and holds their hands

418
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,820
to describe the word they see

419
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,140
This is

420
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,060
these two legs

421
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,420
and lets the hugged person guess the answer

422
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,940
The team with the most correct guesses

423
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,380
will get a sweetness sticker

424
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,220
Who will hug whom?

425
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,820
It's okay, we'll just go for it.

426
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,060
Alright.

427
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,300
Then we'll decide the order ourselves.

428
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:01,940
You go first.

429
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,460
No problem.

430
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:02,980
Come on, let's give it a try.

431
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,380
Let's do it.

432
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,580
So, who will guess?

433
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,860
Who will act it out?

434
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:07,860
You guess.

435
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,220
I'm terrible at guessing.

436
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:11,820
Okay.

437
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,660
Let's go.

438
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,460
First one.

439
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,220
How many words?

440
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:14,940
Three words.

441
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,340
This one's too easy.

442
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,580
Golf.

443
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,340
Got it.

444
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,100
Okay, next one.

445
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:19,700
Next.

446
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,220
Close your eyes.

447
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,100
Close your eyes.

448
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:25,700
Can I say it now?

449
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,500
Three words.

450
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,340
It's over.

451
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,420
Play the piano

452
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,580
Don't look at me

453
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,020
I don't know

454
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:45,860
Try again

455
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,100
Go ahead

456
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:47,660
Okay

457
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,460
Play and sing

458
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,020
What she's doing is actually quite hard

459
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:52,900
Sing and play the piano

460
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,540
Three words

461
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,780
Sing, play

462
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,100
Piano

463
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:56,820
Try again

464
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,180
It's made up of two actions

465
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,860
What kind of singing

466
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,300
Sing

467
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:06,860
It's "sing," right?

468
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,540
One of the words is "sing"

469
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:07,900
Right

470
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,380
After you have this

471
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,140
Something that can happen

472
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,500
There's "sing" and there's "play"

473
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,020
Right

474
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:11,940
Then where

475
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,540
It's "play"

476
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,220
It's "sing"

477
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,780
In what situation would you have both of these

478
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,660
Okay, pass

479
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,420
This one

480
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,380
Two words

481
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,020
Sing

482
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:29,980
Noun

483
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,580
Here, take this.

484
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,940
Listen.

485
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,460
I can't help.

486
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,900
I did my best.

487
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:43,620
Tomo (Zhang Hao)

488
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,340
Is it this thing?

489
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,820
It's this thing.

490
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:47,580
What?

491
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,580
Is it a "microphone"?

492
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,460
Yes.

493
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,220
That's right.

494
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,380
"Microphone" it is.

495
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,380
Okay, next.

496
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,060
It's hard.

497
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:54,900
I really don't get this one.

498
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,620
Three characters.

499
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,380
Three characters, got it.

500
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,460
Squat down.

501
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,300
Okay.

502
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,100
Write.

503
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,820
Imagine this action.

504
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:02,860
Okay, draw.

505
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,980
Draw.

506
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,660
Release fish.

507
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,660
We've done this before.

508
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,060
But it was at...

509
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,180
Lotus lantern.

510
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,220
Yes.

511
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:16,660
Lotus lantern?

512
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:16,980
That's right.

513
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,460
Lotus lantern.

514
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,500
Next.

515
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,300
Okay, this one's easy.

516
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,540
Three characters.

517
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,220
Action.

518
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:23,820
Okay.

519
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,500
Play.

520
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,340
Play the piano.

521
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:25,940
That's right.

522
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,140
Great.

523
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,820
Guess the second one.

524
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,980
Let me guess again.

525
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,380
Let me guess that question again.

526
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,740
Two characters.

527
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,820
Play what? Sing.

528
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,940
Three characters.

529
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,420
Play.

530
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,820
Like this.

531
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,020
Concert.

532
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,420
Another way to say it.

533
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,620
Continue.

534
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,340
Go ahead.

535
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,740
The third character is correct.

536
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:54,820
Perform.

537
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,740
Perform.

538
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,140
What kind of event?

539
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,020
Music concert.

540
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,140
Music concert.

541
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,660
Oh, music concert.

542
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,420
This could also mean playing the piano.

543
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,540
Almost.

544
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,140
It's okay.

545
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,220
Thank you all for your help.

546
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:14,980
Thank you.

547
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,140
Alright.

548
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,620
Okay, who's up next?

549
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,860
Let us go.

550
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,180
Who will guess?

551
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,020
You're smarter, you guess.

552
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:23,820
Alright.

553
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,540
Let's do it.

554
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,540
This is...

555
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,620
Stick out your finger.

556
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,820
I know this is peeling shrimp.

557
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,540
Okay.

558
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,060
So fast.

559
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:47,780
Great teamwork.

560
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,500
Second one.

561
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,940
This is it.

562
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,460
These are two legs.

563
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,740
These are two legs.

564
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,060
Kicking a ball.

565
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,340
Three words, what is it?

566
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,620
Playing soccer.

567
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,300
Right.

568
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,660
They're so fast.

569
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:06,740
This one's a bit hard.

570
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,620
How do we act this out?

571
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,860
This must be the hardest one.

572
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:10,660
Done.

573
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,380
Skipped.

574
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:11,900
Let's skip it.

575
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,500
I...

576
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,980
A heart.

577
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:21,980
I love you.

578
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,660
Yes.

579
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:24,620
Alright.

580
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,180
Three, two, one.

581
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:36,860
Bubble machine

582
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,340
No

583
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,500
This is an action

584
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,340
Making good use of props on site

585
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,020
What are you doing?

586
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:44,780
Blowing bubbles

587
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,260
Right

588
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,420
Feels like we don't stand a chance

589
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,060
You two are so in sync

590
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,820
It's our turn, let's go

591
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,740
Which of you will guess?

592
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,820
Who will do it?

593
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,380
Act it out

594
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,380
Okay

595
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,460
Let's start, first question

596
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,740
It's related to Tomo (Zhang Hao)

597
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,820
Just like this

598
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,140
This hand goes like this

599
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,140
This hand goes like this

600
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,340
These are two legs

601
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,660
Surfing

602
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,340
Yes

603
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,260
Next question

604
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,100
Okay

605
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,780
It's just

606
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,380
Like this

607
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,500
Like this

608
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,620
I want to ask

609
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,500
Hugging the waist

610
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,820
Where is this element?

611
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,660
What about them holding hands tightly?

612
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,380
Three characters

613
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,260
Hug

614
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,140
Hug

615
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,660
Hug

616
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,980
Imagine him as Qiqi (Wang Qi)

617
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,780
Yes, imagine me as Qiqi (Wang Qi)

618
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,020
Something like this

619
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,740
Like this

620
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,220
And then

621
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,020
You need to do it like this

622
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,460
An object

623
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,220
To add

624
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:56,500
Yes

625
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,140
Look at that

626
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:57,780
That lamp

627
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,980
Because there's that

628
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,820
You need to do it like this

629
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,060
Block

630
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,300
Sun hat

631
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,420
That's right

632
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:05,820
Okay

633
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,380
The third one

634
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:06,980
Close your eyes

635
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,500
I got it

636
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,260
Qiqi (Wang Qi)

637
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,420
Full name

638
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,020
Wang Qi

639
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:15,620
Yes

640
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:20,780
Come.

641
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,500
Come, like this.

642
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:26,540
Gun.

643
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,180
What is that thing?

644
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:28,900
Which thing?

645
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,980
What are you referring to?

646
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:30,700
Car.

647
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,420
Cabin.

648
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,540
Flower.

649
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,220
There are too many things.

650
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,020
Take it down.

651
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,340
It has two characters.

652
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:46,900
You should know.

653
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,740
He can't express it.

654
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,100
Draw.

655
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:55,580
Draw what?

656
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,220
Right, draw what?

657
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,100
Draw.

658
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,140
Can't describe it.

659
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:58,940
Draw.

660
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,540
Drawing board.

661
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,540
Right.

662
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,260
Li Dinghao, show us something.

663
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:08,980
Is that okay?

664
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,660
Yes.

665
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,980
He's like this.

666
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,260
What is this?

667
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,020
Is it like this?

668
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,660
Let Wang Qi come over and walk.

669
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:26,660
Three characters.

670
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,100
Catwalk.

671
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:28,860
No.

672
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,580
Model.

673
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,340
Right, and then?

674
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,540
Three characters.

675
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,660
Model.

676
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,780
Catwalk

677
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,180
Yes

678
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,180
The winner is already obvious

679
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,380
Congratulations to our "Tohao" team

680
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,020
Thank you

681
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,460
Thank you, teacher

682
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,540
Thank you, teacher

683
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,220
Who will win the grand prize in the end?

684
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,180
We've finished watching all of "First Encounter: Travel Edition"

685
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,500
It was quite exciting

686
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:58,860
That's right

687
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,140
It was both exciting and enviable

688
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,660
Very different

689
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,100
We also played a lot of mini-games today

690
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,100
And we also received

691
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,220
this voucher

692
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,380
So, in the end, this prize

693
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,020
who will it go to?

694
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,580
Please continue to follow our

695
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,820
daily lives

696
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,860
This is for going to see the sunset, right?

697
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,420
You guys take it

698
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:17,700
It's okay.

699
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,580
Qiqi (Wang Qi) and I will come with you.

700
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,140
Alright.

701
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,300
What about Li Dinghao?

702
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,300
Don't worry about me.

703
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:25,900
Sorry.

704
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,780
I have something to do.

705
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,060
I have something to do, I'll leave first.

706
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:28,740
I see.

707
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,380
Let's invite the "Zhuo Qing" duo

708
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,460
to be our travel consultants.

709
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,540
Because they've been there before.

710
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,900
Then the five of us

711
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,140
can go to that

712
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,340
"Zhuo Qing" check-in spot.

713
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,180
Let's check in there.

714
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,060
Right.

715
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,060
Let's claim it together.

716
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:38,900
Okay.

717
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,340
Island sunset travel voucher.

718
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,700
Voucher.

719
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,220
Let's take a photo together to remember this.

720
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,980
One, two, three.

721
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,860
Watching the heart-fluttering moment with you.

722
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,060
The heart-fluttering feeling never ends.
