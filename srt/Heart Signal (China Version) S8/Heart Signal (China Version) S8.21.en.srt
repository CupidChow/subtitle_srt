1
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,080
Bye.

2
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:39,720
Bye.

3
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,880
I'll take you out to pee in a bit.

4
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,200
Nicole

5
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,400
I'll come back for you later.

6
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,600
How about this.

7
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,320
Come on, both of you.

8
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,760
Come here.

9
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,480
Nicole, come here.

10
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,680
Let's go.

11
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,160
Let's go, come on.

12
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,520
The sun is so nice today.

13
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,480
You really are...

14
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,640
You eat a lot and poop a lot.

15
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,080
Let's go.

16
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,400
What's wrong? Let's go.

17
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,320
We'll walk around and then head back.

18
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,440
Let's circle back from over there.

19
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,320
Let's go.

20
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:35,840
Come.

21
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,000
You want to go home.

22
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,360
Then let's go.

23
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,960
There's no time.

24
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,920
Be good at home, okay?

25
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,600
I need to clean this spot.

26
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Can you get up for a second?

27
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,440
Good boy, okay.

28
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,160
Where did Nicole go?

29
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,520
Did she go for a walk?

30
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:48,880
She's here.

31
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,800
Hi, Nicole.

32
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,000
Nicole.

33
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,360
Her name is...

34
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,640
The small one is Vinnie.

35
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,800
The big one is Nicole.

36
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,880
What did you guys do today?

37
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,040
Work, yeah.

38
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,720
Work.

39
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,080
I was the first one to come back.

40
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,160
Then I took a walk in the park.

41
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,040
How was the park?

42
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,520
I've never walked in the park during the day.

43
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,000
It's huge.

44
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I've never even been inside.

45
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,880
It was already dark when I got there.

46
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,160
And I even saw two little deer.

47
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,400
And I even saw two little deer.

48
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,640
You saw deer?

49
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,800
Hi, Nicole.

50
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,520
Sweetie.

51
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,920
She's ignoring you and trying to run away.

52
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,520
"Weird uncle."

53
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,120
Vinnie.

54
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,920
Why does she always follow you?

55
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,800
She always follows me.

56
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,000
Did you walk the dogs today?

57
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,720
Yeah, we did.

58
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,560
Yuxing walked them, I think.

59
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,920
Hurry and write your names on it.

60
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,880
He already did, just one person.

61
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,800
I saw it.

62
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,480
You guys look like a painting sitting there.

63
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,920
There's gunk in her eyes.

64
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,280
A man who cares about eye health.

65
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,320
And also cares about his dog's eye health.

66
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,840
Let's go.

67
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,520
Let's go.

68
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,520
Go ahead.

69
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,400
Let's go.

70
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,040
Bye.

71
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,520
Hello.

72
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,760
Hi.

73
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,680
Hey.

74
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,160
I brought you some bananas.

75
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,720
Thanks.

76
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,040
They're upstairs starting the introductions.

77
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,600
Really?

78
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,120
Is everyone here?

79
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,720
Okay.

80
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,080
You can practice a bit more.

81
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,720
Alright, last set.

82
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,200
Last move.

83
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,280
I'll go hang out for a bit.

84
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,040
So, have you eaten?

85
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,000
Yeah, I have.

86
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,880
Guess what we ate today.

87
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,440
Western food?

88
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,000
Hotpot?

89
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:55,800
Japanese food?

90
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,920
Something we've had before.

91
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,800
Cantonese food.

92
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,480
Was it the same place?

93
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,280
No, it was nearby.

94
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,400
Yeah, close by.

95
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,200
I finished my last move.

96
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,160
Let's go up.

97
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,040
Aren't you going to stretch?

98
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,600
I can go back to my room.

99
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,160
Stretch.

100
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,680
You can take your time stretching.

101
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,880
Because they're still eating.

102
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,560
Really?

103
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:49,760
Alright.

104
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,520
I'm ready.

105
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,560
Which way?

106
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:56,960
This way.

107
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,520
My hands feel a bit shaky after working out.

108
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,400
What other water sports have you tried?

109
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,120
They have paddleboards over there.

110
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,760
You stand on them.

111
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,000
Yeah.

112
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You can stand or sit on them.

113
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,800
That must be fun.

114
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,760
It really is.

115
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,480
I tried it before in Beijing.

116
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,760
I did it on the Liangma River too.

117
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,440
And I've tried it in other places before.

118
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,520
It's pretty fun.

119
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,520
That river is probably only half as wide as this.

120
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,520
It was packed with people.

121
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,320
Wasn't it super crowded?

122
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,720
It was as crowded as dumplings boiling in a pot.

123
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,760
Did you have a lot of friends in Beijing?

124
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,640
Did you have many friends in Beijing?

125
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,360
Do you feel a bit...

126
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,120
...out of place in Shanghai?

127
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,120
Yeah, definitely.

128
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,040
Just my friends.

129
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,400
I came here pretty suddenly.

130
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,360
My friends in Beijing said,

131
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,480
"You left without saying goodbye."

132
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,480
And my friends in Shanghai said,

133
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,640
"You showed up without telling us."

134
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,200
Switching cities so suddenly is pretty...

135
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,320
...brave of you.

136
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,120
It's mainly about the opportunities.

137
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,520
Have you always been in Shanghai?

138
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,920
I was here for grad school.

139
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,800
What's up?

140
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,680
Why did you stop paddling?

141
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,080
Are you paddling?

142
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,600
Yeah, I am.

143
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,560
Excuse me, are you paddling?

144
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,040
Are you there?

145
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,040
Yeah, I'm here.

146
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,920
Do you prefer going

147
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,960
to the beach or the mountains?

148
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,640
I think

149
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,480
it depends on my mood.

150
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,600
If I've been really tired lately,

151
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,160
I'd rather just relax by the beach.

152
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,320
Yeah.

153
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,800
But if

154
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,280
I'm not that tired,

155
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,440
I prefer going to the mountains.

156
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,800
Places like this are nice.

157
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,200
Or maybe somewhere even higher up.

158
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,960
You mentioned Haba Snow Mountain yesterday.

159
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,800
It's over 5,000 meters high.

160
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,640
I'd definitely get altitude sickness.

161
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,280
I would just

162
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,320
Don't be ridiculous.

163
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,200
Let's switch seats first.

164
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,640
Earlier, I saw people jumping off that mountain

165
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,320
with paragliders.

166
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,160
I just saw it.

167
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,080
Have you ever tried it?

168
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,120
Aren't you afraid of heights?

169
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,880
That one's not too bad.

170
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,560
Because you have support with that.

171
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,280
But something like bungee jumping,

172
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,000
I really wouldn't dare.

173
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,920
Paragliding is okay.

174
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,760
Have you tried paragliding?

175
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,280
No.

176
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:27,720
I want to try.

177
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,200
Do you want to go?

178
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,640
Yeah.

179
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,920
Do you want to try

180
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,160
skydiving?

181
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,640
Yes.

182
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,120
But that's probably

183
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,800
something for the distant future.

184
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,160
I need to mentally prepare for that.

185
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,080
Yeah.

186
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,360
Are there any places

187
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,280
around Shanghai

188
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,120
where you can go for a weekend,

189
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,000
just one or two days,

190
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,600
and come back easily?

191
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,600
There are probably a lot around Hangzhou.

192
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,400
Yeah, this area.

193
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:48,840
Right.

194
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,400
But hiking here doesn't feel very challenging.

195
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,560
Yeah.

196
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,520
Yeah, you like challenging stuff.

197
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,240
Yeah, I do.

198
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,280
The kind that gives you a real sense of achievement.

199
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,000
Right.

200
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,480
I want to go somewhere farther away.

201
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,040
Actually,

202
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,920
have you been to western Sichuan?

203
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,400
Or Yunnan?

204
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,440
Those two places

205
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,800
are probably better for hiking.

206
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,720
Isn't western Sichuan

207
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,360
more for road trips?

208
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,320
Yeah, road trips.

209
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,640
But I haven't

210
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,240
been to Xizang yet.

211
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,720
I really want to go.

212
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,640
My plan was

213
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,480
to go to Golmud first,

214
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,760
then take the Qinghai-Tibet Railway straight to Lhasa,

215
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,920
and then drive to Nyingchi.

216
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,280
So do you prefer road trips?

217
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,760
Yeah, road trips.

218
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,800
If I have friends with me,

219
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,160
it's more convenient to drive.

220
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:34,960
You can go wherever you want.

221
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,840
I think so too.

222
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,560
Let's just float here for now.

223
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,520
Yeah, let's just float.

224
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,200
Let's go.

225
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,560
Are we having barbecue today?

226
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:55,760
Yeah.

227
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:56,760
Come on.

228
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,680
Do you eat anything else?

229
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,960
I want some cauliflower.

230
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,000
Cauliflower, got it.

231
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,160
You eat pretty healthy.

232
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,640
I'm super healthy.

233
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:09,800
Thanks.

234
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,240
I go to bed really early every day.

235
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,760
I used to get in bed by eleven too.

236
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,160
Really?

237
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,360
Eleven?

238
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,040
Yeah.

239
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:18,800
I do nine.

240
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,880
You get in bed at nine?

241
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,480
I try to fall asleep by nine thirty.

242
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,120
Really?

243
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,600
Yeah.

244
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,160
That way I fall asleep right at ten.

245
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,440
What time do you get up in the morning?

246
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,360
Six.

247
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,560
Up at six.

248
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,720
What do you do after getting up at six?

249
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,360
Early mornings are for

250
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,600
working out.

251
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,720
Yeah, exercise and then breakfast.

252
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,720
I thought I was already pretty healthy.

253
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,160
Didn't expect you to be even healthier.

254
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,480
What time do you get up?

255
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,120
Eight.

256
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,440
I get up at eight.

257
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,000
Eight isn't that late, right?

258
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,680
Your sleep quality must be pretty good.

259
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,720
I sleep nine hours every day.

260
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,200
Yeah, I think life needs

261
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,240
Sleeping is my favorite thing.

262
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,080
I envy you guys.

263
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,440
But gradually I feel

264
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,520
I sleep less.

265
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,760
Mainly, I have trouble falling asleep sometimes.

266
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,840
Like,

267
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,680
maybe you

268
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,480
get in bed at eleven,

269
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,160
but you might actually

270
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,120
fall asleep at one.

271
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,120
I think maybe

272
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,440
it's because of using my phone before bed.

273
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,160
Do you get insomnia?

274
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,120
I do.

275
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:16,920
Do you get insomnia?

276
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,840
I overthink.

277
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,400
Yeah, my mind is full of stuff.

278
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,920
That's why I like hiking.

279
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,880
To clear my head.

280
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,280
Yeah.

281
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,360
Me too.

282
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,560
They say

283
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,560
I saw a Chinese medicine doctor recently.

284
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,520
He said my thoughts are too heavy.

285
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,640
Think less.

286
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,040
Insomnia is a mental issue.

287
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,560
Yeah.

288
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,560
I used to wonder

289
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,880
how to fix this problem.

290
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,600
Then I saw an interview.

291
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,480
He said when your mind

292
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,240
is really messy,

293
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,040
you should

294
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,120
go for a walk, like you said.

295
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,240
Then your thoughts might

296
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,600
suddenly clear up.

297
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,400
Gradually, you turn something chaotic

298
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,440
into something more organized.

299
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,520
Step by step.

300
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,520
And solve it bit by bit.

301
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,480
It might help.

302
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,400
I haven't tried it.

303
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,680
Planning to try it soon.

304
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,840
Who has fewer thoughts?

305
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,840
Sensing (S) type people.

306
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,320
And Perceiving (P) types.

307
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,080
They think less.

308
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,120
Perceiving (P) type.

309
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,480
I think they're really happy.

310
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,280
Yeah.

311
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,240
Judging (J) types are

312
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,200
always

313
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,120
planning ahead, right?

314
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,040
Yeah, I feel like

315
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,200
if someone messes up my plans,

316
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,360
I get upset.

317
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,400
But I also look forward to

318
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,160
someone messing up my plans.

319
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,360
Why?

320
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,240
Because I think it brings

321
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,240
more excitement.

322
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,720
And freshness.

323
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,680
Just like today.

324
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,440
Let's go.

325
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,160
Come on.

326
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,920
Your cilantro beef is all gone.

327
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,080
No, it's not.

328
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,240
It didn't look very good.

329
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,120
You're a perfectionist.

330
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,240
I think

331
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm not that much of a perfectionist.

332
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,440
It was my first time cooking it today.

333
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,560
It wasn't cooked through at first.

334
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,920
It looked a bit ugly.

335
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,360
Then I went back and fixed it up.

336
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,120
I used those beef slices.

337
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,400
It turned out okay in the end.

338
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,320
It tasted pretty good after that.

339
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,800
I'll wait for you to make it again.

340
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,200
Next time, for sure.

341
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,080
Cook it all the way through in one go.

342
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,520
Eat the fully cooked version.

343
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,080
I ate a ton for dinner tonight.

344
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,680
You should try this.

345
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,160
Tomatoes with sugar.

346
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,520
Do you know who made it?

347
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,280
Let me guess.

348
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,880
You.

349
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,560
That's right.

350
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,320
I've been wearing

351
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,480
the sleep mask you gave me these past two nights.

352
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,240
I really slept well.

353
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,040
I really slept well.

354
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,040
Glad you slept well.

355
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,680
Thank you.

356
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,760
You're welcome.

357
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,600
Did you scrape yourself?

358
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,080
It's fine.

359
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:41,680
Just a minor issue.

360
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:42,720
I don't know why.

361
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,000
I always slide so fast.

362
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,040
It's scraped.

363
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,160
Just a little.

364
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,760
No big deal.

365
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,760
That's a pretty bad scrape.

366
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,920
That's the iodine I sprayed.

367
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,160
It's okay.

368
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:58,680
Not a big problem.

369
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,960
It's nothing.

370
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,040
I have that.

371
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,760
Do you want to use some dressing?

372
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,280
It's fine, I'll just leave it open for now.

373
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:06,880
Because maybe

374
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,240
if you cover it, it won't breathe.

375
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,200
It's okay.

376
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,120
Thanks.

377
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,760
I'll go down with you then.

378
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:13,880
Sure.

379
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:14,880
Let's go.

380
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,720
How did you fall?

381
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,920
Are you okay?

382
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,200
I just scraped myself.

383
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,720
Do you want to put on a bandage?

384
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,920
I won't use one.

385
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,960
I feel like if I put one on,

386
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,560
it won't heal properly.

387
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,640
I think you should cover it for a bit.

388
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,600
I'll cover it for a while first.

389
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,200
Keep it dry.

390
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,000
And when you shower,

391
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
try not to get it wet.

392
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,640
I scraped myself a couple of days ago too.

393
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,920
I brought tape and plastic wrap.

394
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,040
You can wrap it with plastic wrap.

395
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:40,960
It's waterproof.

396
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,600
Then secure it with tape.

397
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,440
Makes sense.

398
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,600
Are there any band-aids in the first aid kit?

399
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,080
No need.

400
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,760
Teacher Fang.

401
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,640
I'll use that later.

402
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,280
Wang Jue has some dressing.

403
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,080
I'll use that one.

404
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,120
That one should be more breathable.

405
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,640
My dressing is the kind

406
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,800
that's kind of like a bandage.

407
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,640
But there's no medicine inside.

408
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,720
It's just the dressing.

409
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,480
No problem.

410
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,080
You'd better disinfect it again before covering.

411
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,280
It's here.

412
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:01,920
Okay.

413
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,680
I'll disinfect it again.

414
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,120
Darn it.

415
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,000
I'll go get it.

416
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,600
I'll put it on before bed tonight.

417
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:09,880
Alright.

418
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,280
Yeah, let it air out for a bit first.

419
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,400
I'm not showering now anyway.

420
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,480
Thanks.

421
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,200
What's up?

422
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,880
They went to walk the dogs.

423
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:29,760
Who?

424
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,800
Every time someone walks over there,

425
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,720
I get curious.

426
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,760
I wonder if anyone will spin the turntable.

427
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,520
Who's walking the dogs?

428
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,480
Hello.

429
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,440
Are you two done practicing?

430
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,160
Almost.

431
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,760
One more set.

432
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,280
Almost.

433
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,680
What are you practicing?

434
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,520
We just practiced boxing for a bit.

435
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,440
Do you know how?

436
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,000
A little, right?

437
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,760
Me too.

438
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,520
I do.

439
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,080
You do?

440
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,160
You can tell by her boxing braids.

441
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,320
How about a quick round?

442
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,000
Spar with me for a bit.

443
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,240
Sure.

444
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,120
Should Vinnie try too?

445
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,440
Vinnie says,

446
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,400
Push-ups are out of the question.

447
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,280
For me,

448
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,680
With my natural condition,

449
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,960
She's born for push-ups.

450
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,920
A natural push-up master.

451
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:18,880
That's true.

452
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,160
Less movement needed.

453
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,200
Alright.

454
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:24,600
Come on.

455
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,520
Is it like this?

456
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,760
Yes, push it out.

457
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,640
Push your shoulder out.

458
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,320
Left fist first.

459
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,800
Right, then the right fist—

460
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,720
Turn your back foot.

461
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,400
Turn.

462
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,040
Twist together.

463
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,640
You're still the expert.

464
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,960
Just a little.

465
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,280
Nice.

466
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:42,840
Right?

467
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,360
Very good.

468
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,640
You're about to knock down the stand.

469
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,080
Sis.

470
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,360
I ate a lot today.

471
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,960
I ate a lot today.

472
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:57,920
Come on.

473
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,080
I'll pass.

474
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,120
You give it a try.

475
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:00,800
I'm exhausted.

476
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:01,800
Hurry up.

477
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,480
Teacher Yuxing.

478
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,160
Come on.

479
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,200
Don't be so modest.

480
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:04,800
I already—

481
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,480
Come on.

482
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,600
Why is everything with you?

483
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,360
You do it.

484
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,960
I think next time,

485
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,200
we could go cycling or something.

486
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:13,880
Sounds good.

487
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,520
I can ride, but I've never tried.

488
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,360
Mountain bike.

489
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,280
It's the same.

490
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,240
Just a mountain bike.

491
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,280
It's actually more stable.

492
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,040
Your jawline is so defined.

493
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:24,800
Me?

494
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,920
Jawline.

495
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,360
Okay.

496
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,000
From now on, I'll show only my jawline.

497
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,600
Like this from now on.

498
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,400
You won't see my full face anymore.

499
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,240
When I come in—

500
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,920
And when you're chopping veggies,

501
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,760
If you need me, I can help.

502
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,160
Vinnie can sleep anywhere.

503
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,600
So adorable.

504
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,200
I think

505
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,160
this corgi is just too cute.

506
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,120
I want to hear about yesterday,

507
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,520
what you talked about at dinner.

508
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:01,960
Let me think.

509
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,480
First, meeting up was a big surprise.

510
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,200
Ran into a good buddy.

511
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,840
And then

512
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,880
I totally relaxed.

513
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,520
You know?

514
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,080
I was leaning on the table the whole time.

515
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:13,800
And then

516
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,160
Just listening to others talk,

517
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,400
he (Liu Zihan) suddenly got awkward.

518
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,360
Did you guys wear formal clothes?

519
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,000
Yeah.

520
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,520
I didn’t wear formal clothes.

521
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,720
If I’d known, I wouldn’t have dressed up.

522
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,280
If it’s just friends, why dress up?

523
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,640
I can’t believe it.

524
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,520
Where did you get to?

525
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,400
Chapter seven.

526
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,200
They’ve almost finished writing their letters.

527
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,600
Writing letters.

528
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,320
Stop looking up there.

529
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,320
I wasn’t looking up.

530
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,320
Were you looking at the fish?

531
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,400
Then what were you looking at?

532
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,520
Who knows what you were looking at?

533
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,480
I’m going to sleep.

534
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:11,920
I’m going to sleep.

535
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,440
Go ahead and sleep.

536
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,960
Suddenly sat up straight.

537
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,600
What’s going on?

538
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,320
Why are you laughing again, Dr. Fang?

539
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,000
I’m doing sit-ups.

540
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:39,800
He’s pretending.

541
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,320
I’m pretending.

542
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,360
Pretending what?

543
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,520
Pretending what?

544
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,880
Pretending to have some male pride.

545
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,120
Some male pride.

546
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,440
What are you doing?

547
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,320
What do you think?

548
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:55,880
You’re really studying?

549
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,760
I really am studying.

550
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,040
What did you think?

551
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,560
You came up looking all serious.

552
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,760
You really are studying.

553
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,440
I’m actually studying.

554
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,560
Our museum just

555
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,280
opened a new exhibition.

556
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,920
So,

557
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,040
if you’re explaining this part,

558
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,680
how would you say it?

559
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,040
This is the basic information.

560
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,760
Then I’ll put it in my own words.

561
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,480
I’ll make it easier

562
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,480
for everyone to understand.

563
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,280
So, for us,

564
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:16,880
it’s just

565
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,160
supporting material.

566
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,520
So now you’re just

567
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,480
memorizing all this.

568
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,000
Yeah, still studying.

569
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,560
This is the basic knowledge.

570
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,520
So you have to

571
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,040
memorize all of this today.

572
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,560
Tomorrow you’ll have to present it.

573
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,680
Tomorrow’s mainly because it just opened.

574
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,720
So tomorrow there’ll be

575
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,040
something like a test.

576
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,800
You can’t read from anything.

577
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,960
You have to memorize it all today.

578
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,400
And then explain it tomorrow.

579
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,920
And make sure everyone understands.

580
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,800
How late will you be studying tonight?

581
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,120
I was thinking of picking you up.

582
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,280
I’ll try

583
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,720
to finish when the number turns to “one”.

584
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,080
Then I’ll be done.

585
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,800
I won’t bother you then.

586
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,960
I’ll check in later.

587
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,560
Maybe I’ll come pick you up later.

588
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:55,880
Okay.

589
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,400
Focus on your studying.

590
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:56,720
Okay.

591
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,840
Is this my room card?

592
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,760
This one’s mine.

593
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,160
Then where’s mine?

594
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,480
Really?

595
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,480
This is yours.

596
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,960
Bye.

597
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,600
Bye.

598
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,640
See you later.

599
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,280
Alright.

600
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,520
Are you someone who

601
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,040
is especially hard on yourself?

602
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,560
I don't push myself too hard.

603
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,200
But within my abilities,

604
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,360
I want to do my best.

605
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,880
Do you expect the same from others?

606
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,240
No.

607
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,880
I hope the other person can have their own

608
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,960
ability to think independently.

609
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,840
They should have their own goals and pursuits.

610
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,800
Instead of

611
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,520
me telling them what to do.

612
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,760
So, in life and relationships,

613
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,360
you have a balance, right?

614
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,040
You need your own space.

615
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,480
Yeah.

616
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,400
Like, in your work

617
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,080
or other things you do,

618
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,960
you can handle them on your own.

619
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,320
I don't want either side to

620
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,880
change themselves too much for the other.

621
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,880
Of course, some change is needed,

622
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,720
but you can't

623
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,400
lose yourself completely.

624
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,280
You still need your own personality.

625
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,680
You really have an open mind.

626
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,400
Because

627
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,920
a few years ago,

628
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,560
like four or five years ago,

629
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,400
when you were my age,

630
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,760
Are you saying you were really immature?

631
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,720
Go on.

632
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:22,880
No.

633
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,360
I really did have that mindset before.

634
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,400
It felt like

635
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,760
I had to

636
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,160
give one hundred percent,

637
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,680
even one hundred and twenty, two hundred percent of myself,

638
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,120
just so the other person would like me.

639
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,120
I kept

640
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,920
lowering my own standards.

641
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,560
I used to be like that too.

642
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:38,960
That's why I asked you,

643
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,400
when did you start to change?

644
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,800
It was about two years ago.

645
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,120
I started changing the year before last.

646
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:46,440
I realized it wasn't right.

647
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,200
I realized it wasn't right.

648
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,720
I wasn't myself at all.

649
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,760
I really hated that.

650
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,280
Yeah, I hated it too.

651
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,040
I keep reminding myself

652
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,120
not to

653
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,600
drain myself for someone else.

654
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,040
Because back then,

655
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:00,800
I basically

656
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,720
couldn't do anything.

657
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,800
I was completely stuck

658
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,800
in those emotions.

659
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,640
Your

660
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,280
emotions were totally controlled by them.

661
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,160
Completely taken over.

662
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:08,920
It's scary.

663
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:09,920
So

664
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,640
I still hope

665
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,040
to have my own independent space.

666
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:19,920
This one?

667
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,320
Why do you want to know about this?

668
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,400
I just think it's pretty interesting.

669
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,040
Actually, some people

670
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,920
Most people will

671
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,560
hide their emotions, right?

672
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,520
I'm the type who hides them.

673
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,000
Yeah.

674
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,160
But you definitely

675
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:32,640
your emotions

676
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,720
will always need an outlet.

677
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,800
There will always be a breaking point.

678
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,320
It's just about what that point is for you.

679
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,320
For me, usually

680
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,800
under normal circumstances,

681
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,600
the really sad things

682
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,240
I do keep them inside.

683
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:48,800
Because I don't want

684
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,520
to bring my sadness

685
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,160
to others.

686
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,920
When I'm really upset,

687
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,120
I might look for

688
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,920
someone who's had similar experiences to talk to.

689
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,520
You still need an outlet for your feelings.

690
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,640
Or sometimes you do something about it.

691
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,920
I might write in my diary.

692
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,960
You still keep a diary?

693
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,040
Do you write every day?

694
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,640
Yes.

695
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,480
Just jot down a little each day.

696
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,480
And if I'm really sad,

697
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,960
I write more.

698
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,560
Writing it out helps a lot.

699
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,840
I put my anger

700
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,480
into words.

701
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,720
That's a good method.

702
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,320
It works for me.

703
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,720
Because if I really

704
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,080
find someone to confide in,

705
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,440
I honestly feel

706
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,120
it puts a lot of pressure on them.

707
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,960
You feel like it causes

708
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,360
some stress for them.

709
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,080
Yeah.

710
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,560
It puts a lot of pressure on them.

711
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:38,760
I'm the same way.

712
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,840
With friends I've known for over ten years,

713
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,960
I basically

714
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,840
hold it in until I can't anymore,

715
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,840
then I tell them.

716
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,080
I think that's pretty good.

717
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,480
Yeah.

718
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,440
When you're really sad,

719
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,000
it's best to just forget about it.

720
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,280
Or if I really can't hold it in,

721
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,360
when I can't anymore, I'll find

722
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,880
maybe my best friend to talk to.

723
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,520
Talking it out helps.

724
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,960
My best friend is really good at comforting people.

725
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,880
She always knows how to comfort me.

726
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,760
But often,

727
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,640
I just talk to myself.

728
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,800
And before,

729
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,480
I used to debate with myself.

730
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,840
Yeah, just me arguing with myself.

731
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,240
Like,

732
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,120
one side is optimistic,

733
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,120
the other is pessimistic.

734
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,920
Right.

735
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,800
When I go for a walk alone,

736
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,040
like by the river,

737
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,960
I talk to myself there.

738
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,480
Then the optimistic side says,

739
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,280
"It's just a small thing."

740
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,240
"Why be so sad about it?"

741
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,280
Yeah, that's how it is.

742
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,240
And then, gradually,

743
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,080
I talk myself through it.

744
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,520
Yeah, I work it out on my own.

745
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,040
Then I feel better.

746
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,800
So if I really need to

747
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,760
talk to someone else,

748
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,360
I sort out my feelings first.

749
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,040
I get my thoughts in order.

750
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,280
Honestly, I already have the answer.

751
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,320
Yeah, I have the answer.

752
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,760
Then I tell her about it.

753
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,440
That way, maybe

754
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,840
she can support me even more.

755
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,640
And I feel much better.
