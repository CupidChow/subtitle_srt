1
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,880
Did you add the spicy beef?

2
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:50,640
Thank you.

3
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,400
This is really fun.

4
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,000
Yeah.

5
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,200
You’re all eating with me.

6
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,400
I feel so happy.

7
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,880
Our Heartbeat Apartment has finally welcomed

8
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,920
its first big date.

9
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,840
It’s very packed.

10
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,200
Six girls each made a card by hand

11
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,080
related to their own interests and hobbies.

12
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,920
The guys choose whose card they like.

13
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,120
Then they’ll go on their first date with her.

14
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,000
Just take this one.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,200
Just take this one.

16
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,360
He took it right away.

17
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,360
You’re really possessive.

18
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,480
Dr. Fang’s special selection.

19
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:31,960
That’s so sweet.

20
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,280
I can’t lose.

21
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,000
You can’t lose.

22
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,480
I have to protect myself.

23
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,480
So cute.

24
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,640
I am

25
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,840
someone who overthinks a lot.

26
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,800
Because I think

27
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,200
starting a relationship

28
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,800
might be easy.

29
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,360
But if you want

30
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,520
to keep it going, it’s hard.

31
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,200
I feel

32
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,000
prioritizing

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,560
for me is

34
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,760
a very important thing.

35
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,560
I absolutely

36
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,240
can’t stand feeling wronged like this.

37
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,240
I’ve looked into their eyes.

38
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,880
They really are just friends.

39
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,960
But I think that’s fine too.

40
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,120
This way, Wang Jue can let go as well.

41
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,360
Wang Lechen

42
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,880
This should be pretty exciting.

43
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,880
Once the card is given, the meaning changes.

44
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,880
Right, because it makes things clear.

45
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,000
Who is this?

46
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,720
Duoduo

47
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,200
She's so pretty.

48
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,080
Like a little deer.

49
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,920
Her eyes.

50
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,600
Don't hide.

51
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,720
Hello.

52
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:46,720
Hello.

53
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,000
Hello.

54
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,120
Why?

55
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,680
This card.

56
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,880
It's you.

57
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,720
Didn't expect that, did you?

58
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,120
The follow card belongs to Duoduo.

59
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,640
It's Duoduo.

60
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,200
So this time, Duoduo

61
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,200
really went for it.

62
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,440
I just said

63
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,160
it couldn't be you.

64
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,840
Did you think of it just now?

65
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,520
Really?

66
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,600
Yeah, because

67
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,440
when we were analyzing there the day before yesterday,

68
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,080
Who were you analyzing with?

69
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,880
Just us guys.

70
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,280
When we guys were choosing,

71
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,760
it might rain today.

72
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,840
So we can only do indoor activities.

73
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,640
We'll listen to you.

74
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,160
Their outfits match pretty well today too.

75
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,600
Yeah.

76
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,240
Our colors match well today.

77
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,680
That was intentional.

78
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,440
What is this?

79
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,200
Skating, ice skating.

80
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,200
Roller skating.

81
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,800
Roller skating.

82
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,560
So retro.

83
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,600
We had this when we were kids.

84
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,320
Me too, when I was a kid.

85
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:58,760
Yeah.

86
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,600
It was so cool back then.

87
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,080
It is...

88
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,760
There would be that kind of...

89
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,720
Disco music playing.

90
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,400
Maybe.

91
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,800
Because the lights are like this now.

92
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,040
Come on.

93
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,880
Have you worn these before?

94
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,360
I have.

95
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,080
I haven't.

96
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,640
I'll do it myself.

97
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,960
Let me try it myself.

98
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,280
Okay.

99
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,760
I'll roughly explain it to you.

100
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,160
You go first.

101
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,720
Put on one.

102
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,240
Alright.

103
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:22,800
Then...

104
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,120
Press down hard.

105
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,320
Press all the way down.

106
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:36,880
Thank you.

107
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,800
Why do I feel like you're a pro?

108
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,680
Have you skated yourself?

109
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,040
Coach.

110
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,000
Okay.

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,560
That's fine.

112
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:49,960
Coach.

113
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,280
Is it tight?

114
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:51,880
It's tight.

115
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,680
It's okay.

116
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,280
I'm sweating all over.

117
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,040
Already tired, huh?

118
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,600
So happy.

119
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,680
We're out having fun.

120
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,360
It would be great if we had activities every day.

121
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,440
I think so too.

122
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,920
Yes.

123
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,440
Okay.

124
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,200
I can do it too.

125
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,040
See if you can walk.

126
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,640
You need to...

127
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,680
It's best to walk at an angle.

128
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,160
Don't walk like that.

129
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,880
Turn your feet outward.

130
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,680
Yes, outward.

131
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,040
Alright.

132
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,760
This is the sport most likely to have...

133
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,160
physical contact.

134
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,520
That's right.

135
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,720
Once you go out, you should...

136
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,400
hold hands.

137
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,360
As soon as you start sliding, you need to hold hands.

138
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,160
It will be very slippery here.

139
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,160
You go first.

140
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,800
Let's go first.

141
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,680
Let's try if we can walk.

142
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,400
I can walk.

143
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,400
It's not about whether I say you can walk.

144
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:35,640
Walk while sliding.

145
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,360
You can walk.

146
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,080
Oh no, I can't do it.

147
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,080
Let's learn together.

148
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,200
I got it.

149
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,720
What's going on?

150
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,760
It only took two seconds to learn.

151
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,000
Let's walk toward the center.

152
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,800
Go toward the center.

153
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,200
Reached out.

154
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,920
If you can't do it, just hold on.

155
00:06:59,400 --> 00:06:59,800
Okay.

156
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,560
What?

157
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,840
Tried to grab but missed.

158
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,960
A bit shy.

159
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,760
I'm following your lead.

160
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,760
Yes.

161
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,800
Yes.

162
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,360
Are you okay?

163
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,120
I'm fine.

164
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,720
Why did you brake?

165
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,640
It's nothing.

166
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,280
Do you feel dizzy?

167
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,120
No.

168
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,240
The guy isn't very good at skating either.

169
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,080
Two people.

170
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,000
The two of us wished each other a happy New Year together.

171
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,480
Let's go.

172
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,720
Is your leg okay?

173
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,920
It's fine.

174
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,520
Are you really okay?

175
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,520
I'm fine.

176
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,280
We were really funny just now.

177
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,480
We wished each other an early New Year together.

178
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,840
That scared me to death.

179
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,520
That scared me to death.

180
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,480
I almost leaned back just now.

181
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,640
So you need to

182
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,160
lean forward a little.

183
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,480
Okay.

184
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,120
Or you can squat down a little.

185
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,520
Okay.

186
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,600
Like this.

187
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,720
I'm already sweating.

188
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,160
Teacher.

189
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,040
Keep your balance.

190
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,720
Let me try again.

191
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,240
I'm copying you.

192
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,920
Why are you copying me?

193
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,280
You even put your hands behind your back.

194
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,880
I want to keep up with Wang's

195
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,440
speed and pace.

196
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,000
And then like this.

197
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,800
Do it in slow motion.

198
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:07,880
Okay.

199
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,960
I'm starting to get the hang of it.

200
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,400
I think I'm much faster now.

201
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,400
This scene is so beautiful.

202
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,320
The two of us are so talented.

203
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,800
The two of us.

204
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,600
Really.

205
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,200
We’re not embarrassing ourselves.

206
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,560
Those two are so happy.

207
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,480
It’s like students on campus.

208
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,680
That kind of youthful feeling.

209
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,280
Yeah.

210
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,120
This suits us.

211
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,200
Join us.

212
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,720
Let’s take it slow.

213
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,560
Come on, you.

214
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,440
You can pull her.

215
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,280
Is that okay?

216
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,000
This feels so familiar.

217
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,320
Come on.

218
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:54,960
Go hold onto her.

219
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,480
Hold onto her.

220
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,640
Because I’m afraid you’ll fall.

221
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,000
Wait a second.

222
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,520
Wait a second.

223
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,160
Wait a second.

224
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:03,720
Wait a second.

225
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,200
Wait a second.

226
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,480
He really can’t catch it.

227
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,120
That’s what you get for not grabbing earlier.

228
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,120
Now you want to grab it, but you can’t.

229
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,360
This is so much fun.

230
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,040
The student helped out.

231
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,200
It’s my first time skating.

232
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,200
I’m so nervous.

233
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,280
I feel like I’m going to squeeze your hand off.

234
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,640
I feel like we can’t get out of this.

235
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,240
This is really fun.

236
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,080
So happy.

237
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,960
I’m really shipping this.

238
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,200
That smile is so bright.

239
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:16,880
Are you okay?

240
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,560
I’m fine.

241
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,360
So happy.

242
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,440
Watching them makes me feel so happy.

243
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,240
Actually, it's possible.

244
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,120
They could hold hands.

245
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,360
Right?

246
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,840
But he's very gentlemanly.

247
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,640
He doesn't come across as offensive.

248
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,040
Girls really like him.

249
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,520
Yeah.

250
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,440
And today the girl got the follow card.

251
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,800
It's already so obvious.

252
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,360
Guess where the next location will be.

253
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,240
Which direction?

254
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,280
Let me guess.

255
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,440
Traditional Chinese medicine clinic.

256
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,880
Give him acupuncture.

257
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,080
Where to? To school.

258
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:09,720
Yeah.

259
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,320
Go to school.

260
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:13,760
Yeah.

261
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,760
Really going to school.

262
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,640
Yeah.

263
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,480
Can they get in?

264
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,680
Let's see then.

265
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,600
They're at the same university.

266
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,240
And they're both studying in Hangzhou.

267
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,440
Which university are you at?

268
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,560
Media.

269
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:26,800
Zhejiang Media.

270
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,600
Me too.

271
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,520
Really?

272
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,880
Go to school together.

273
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,520
So romantic.

274
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,280
Such a surprise.

275
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:37,880
Really?

276
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,960
Maybe it's fake.

277
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,960
Really went to school.

278
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,720
I'm so familiar with this road.

279
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,080
What's wrong?

280
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,480
The road of sadness.

281
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,080
No.

282
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,800
The road of sadness.

283
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,040
So cute.

284
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,600
So nervous, going back to school.

285
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,200
Actually, both are at the same school.

286
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,520
The odds are actually quite low.

287
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,480
Yes.

288
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,520
I really want to take you

289
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,400
for a walk all the way around.

290
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,320
Which "all the way around"?

291
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,080
Just a full circle around.

292
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,640
Inside or outside?

293
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,240
Inside.

294
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,360
Let's walk a full circle.

295
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,200
I'm a little nervous.

296
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,000
A bit nervous.

297
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,640
Nervous.

298
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,600
You're getting nervous too.

299
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,080
Oh no, now I'm getting nervous too.

300
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,680
Why are there so many people?

301
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,880
Actually, I walk this road often.

302
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,280
Because my first job in freshman year

303
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,120
was as a

304
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,880
children's speech teacher.

305
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,480
So I walked this road every day.

306
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,920
After class, I'd ride my bike there.

307
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,680
That's how it was.

308
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,000
This is the playground where we practiced vocal exercises in the morning.

309
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:53,640
I remember you guys

310
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,880
had two playgrounds, right?

311
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,600
There's another one over there for tennis.

312
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,720
And for running.

313
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,120
Yeah, that's the track and field.

314
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,200
Right.

315
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,640
It feels like this wind

316
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,920
is exactly the kind of wind a school should have.

317
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,240
Do you feel like now

318
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,280
Chen Chen is more relaxed?

319
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,120
Of course, more relaxed.

320
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,080
Hands in both pockets.

321
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,120
This is the right vibe.

322
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,720
Student atmosphere.

323
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,480
Yes.

324
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,000
The scent of hormones.

325
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,040
Back home.

326
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,920
Haven't been back in a long time.

327
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,360
Both of us are

328
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,640
eager to go in.

329
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,040
Let's take a photo.

330
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,320
Do you want to?

331
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:31,680
Sure.

332
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,440
Looks good.

333
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,000
Looks good.

334
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,920
This one looks good.

335
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,560
Let's go eat.

336
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,240
Let's go.

337
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,440
They're both in good spirits too.

338
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,640
Yeah.

339
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,960
It looks delicious.

340
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:05,960
Thank you.

341
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:12,960
Thank you.

342
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,400
Thanks for your hard work.

343
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,080
Here.

344
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:16,880
"Happy Birthday."

345
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,080
Here.

346
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,400
Eat.

347
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,400
Shouldn't you eat this first?

348
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,600
I want to eat.

349
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:28,960
This is

350
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,160
noodles.

351
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,240
This is

352
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,560
rice.

353
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,040
I want to see how good it tastes.

354
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,400
It's delicious.

355
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:37,680
You know,

356
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,640
after they graduated,

357
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,200
they still made this at home themselves.

358
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,440
Here.

359
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,080
Thank you.

360
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,160
Try it.

361
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,720
How is it?

362
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,720
Isn't it delicious?

363
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:54,920
Come and try it.

364
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,200
It tastes exactly the same as before.

365
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,280
No change.

366
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,560
It's okay.

367
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:05,840
It's really good.

368
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,360
It's so full of life, isn't it?

369
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,440
I'm happy now.

370
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,600
It's such a coincidence.

371
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,040
On my first day arriving on the island (for the trip),

372
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,480
I thought,

373
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,320
Whenever I said something,

374
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:24,920
Me too.

375
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,440
Whenever I said something,

376
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,240
I kept looking up.

377
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:26,680
I said,

378
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,200
What a coincidence.

379
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,040
I said I like to exercise in the morning.

380
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,880
Then the person next to me,

381
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,680
Jue'er said,

382
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,080
She said,

383
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,000
This person does too.

384
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,800
I said,

385
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,920
Then you said,

386
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,840
Me too.

387
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,200
Then I said,

388
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,000
Among sports, I like diving.

389
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,200
You said, me too.

390
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:42,800
Whenever I looked up,

391
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,600
Then I said I study media.

392
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,680
Me too.

393
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,480
Whenever I looked up,

394
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,120
The two of them,

395
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,040
What a coincidence.

396
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,560
Such fate.

397
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,120
I said, this is just too much of a coincidence.

398
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,840
I just feel it's quite a coincidence.

399
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,800
At that time

400
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,040
I felt that before I came (to the cabin)

401
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,720
I also felt

402
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,520
Am I really coming here?

403
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,560
But I think having this opportunity

404
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,040
is pretty nice

405
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,560
very good

406
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,120
at least I can

407
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:24,880
get to know you

408
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,480
get to know you all

409
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,200
I feel pretty good about it

410
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,560
Because both of our

411
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,280
romantic personalities

412
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,160
aren't they both friendship types?

413
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,440
I don't know how you

414
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,680
define this

415
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,440
friendship type

416
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,240
Actually,

417
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,720
it might still be more like

418
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,240
something above just being friends—

419
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,680
a kind of teamwork.

420
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,480
Yes, I think

421
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,200
the romantic part,

422
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,200
that is, the part about love,

423
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,280
but in reality,

424
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,080
in your daily life,

425
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,880
maybe eighty percent of it is

426
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,880
dealing with trivial matters.

427
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,760
It might all get buried

428
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,480
under those little things.

429
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,800
Right.

430
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,080
So actually, this part

431
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,200
is something many people might

432
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,040
overlook.

433
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,800
People tend to think

434
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,520
that with love, you can

435
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,400
overcome everything.

436
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,400
But we’re probably all just ordinary people,

437
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:19,840
meaning

438
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,320
we still have to live ordinary lives.

439
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,200
Yes.

440
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,320
I think this friendship type

441
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,240
refers to the way you resolve conflicts—

442
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,480
the mindset.

443
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,680
Like friends,

444
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,720
not just because

445
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,080
you’re my closest person,

446
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,560
so I can just dump

447
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,240
all my emotions on you.

448
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,880
Actually, I’d rather my partner

449
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,480
be like

450
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,440
a friend and a comrade to me,

451
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,440
so we can handle things objectively

452
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,360
and deal with them.

453
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,240
"Comrade-type personality."

454
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,720
The two of us are comrades.

455
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,400
Have you ever acted on impulse?

456
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,160
I want to be impulsive.

457
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,320
She's already acting on impulse.

458
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,240
She's already been impulsive.

459
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,240
So you've never acted on impulse.

460
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:22,680
That's right.

461
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:24,840
I think being together

462
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,760
definitely involves some impulse.

463
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:26,720
So,

464
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,920
that's why you two ended up together.

465
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,400
Is it hard? Do you think it's hard?

466
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,320
No, I don't think it's hard.

467
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,520
It depends on whether you want to or not.

468
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,760
But you'll be afraid of the outcome.

469
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,320
Or rather,

470
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,000
afraid.

471
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,480
Will you end up hurt all over?

472
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,160
I will.

473
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,120
Definitely.

474
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,480
But

475
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,440
when I'm impulsive,

476
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:51,800
maybe I also

477
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:52,720
just

478
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,840
I think I should be able to

479
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,400
handle it.

480
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,920
Yes, that outcome.

481
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,480
But

482
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,880
Wouldn't you feel regret this way?

483
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:01,800
Because you really are

484
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,720
if you have some ties with this person

485
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,840
after forming some bonds.

486
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,400
You two

487
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,040
basically can't go back

488
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,320
to being just friends.

489
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,840
Right.

490
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,160
I understand.

491
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,600
So your question is kind of like

492
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,120
it's

493
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:14,960
do you want to be lovers

494
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,520
or just stay friends?

495
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,080
And also,

496
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,600
is it

497
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,800
more regretful to have never been together,

498
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,320
or

499
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,880
to be together and have no outcome?

500
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,440
I think my choice

501
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,280
would definitely be the first one.

502
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,560
Never having been together

503
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,560
is a bit more regretful.

504
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,280
Definitely.

505
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:33,680
Because I think

506
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,640
there's a big difference between friends and lovers.

507
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,280
I think

508
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,760
feelings have to be built through experiences.

509
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,800
You two still need to

510
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,560
go through

511
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,600
some things together,

512
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,160
so you can be sure

513
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,720
of what's truly in your heart.

514
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,080
Certain.

515
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,200
Right.

516
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,840
You have to keep running into each other.

517
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,520
So you’re the type who

518
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,840
can hide your emotions.

519
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,400
I also don’t like

520
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,280
bringing my emotions to others.

521
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,000
I don’t think it’s necessary.

522
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,360
On the other hand,

523
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,200
since childhood, it’s been instilled in us

524
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,440
that boys shouldn’t cry.

525
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,680
So sometimes, often,

526
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,720
even when I feel like

527
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,120
I want to cry a little,

528
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,880
I’ll think about something else.

529
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,400
Maybe

530
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,520
I’ll tell myself a joke

531
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,640
and suppress it.

532
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,400
That’s impressive.

533
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,880
I can’t hold it in at all.

534
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,360
Right?

535
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,000
My emotions are completely outward.

536
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,000
This process,

537
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,400
every piece of me,

538
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,480
I pick them all up.

539
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,720
Every part of myself,

540
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,480
I really like.

541
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,440
Bad emotions are like the moon,

542
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,400
good emotions are like the sun.

543
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,960
There’s a saying that puts it well:

544
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,240
allow any emotion to pass through your body

545
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,000
and feel it.

546
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,280
I really like this saying.

547
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:47,960
Me too.

548
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,720
Her words

549
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,720
hit me right away.

550
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,240
For me,

551
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,000
I just look up and move forward,

552
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,960
marching ahead.

553
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,520
Make sure your heels hit the ground loudly.

554
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,280
She’s really amazing.

555
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,560
She has a great personality.

556
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,120
She’s also outstanding.

557
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,120
She’s smart.

558
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,800
I'm the complete opposite of you.

559
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,840
I've spent my whole life learning

560
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,960
how to open up.

561
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,960
Then we're very complementary.

562
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,960
So you two really complement each other.

563
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,840
At times like this, he must be deeply affected.

564
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,480
A self that's completely different from himself.

565
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,280
He needs the kind of energy she has.

566
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,600
Language has had an impact.

567
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,120
Yes.

568
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,360
Yes, and I hope in life

569
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,760
and in other aspects,

570
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,000
I hope to have

571
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:37,920
It's not exactly

572
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,080
a guiding light,

573
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:39,800
but basically,

574
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,640
at least the two of us

575
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,760
are moving in the same direction.

576
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,080
You can walk faster,

577
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,840
and I can follow you.

578
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,240
Or,

579
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,560
when we reach a certain stage,

580
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,720
we can walk together.

581
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,440
I've definitely struggled internally before.

582
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:52,960
Yes.

583
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,480
It feels like

584
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,440
during that period,

585
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,600
I was stagnant,

586
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,480
and even regressing.

587
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,160
I really couldn't accept that.

588
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,000
It was the same with work.

589
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,760
During that time,

590
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,280
I struggled internally for over a year.

591
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Next time, you can say

592
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,440
"I don't know how to solve this problem."

593
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,040
Please teach me.

594
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,480
Please teach me.

595
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,240
Please teach me.

596
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,480
Then she will write.

597
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,440
She will reply with an answer.

598
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,400
That's enough.

599
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,200
Maybe the other person is also willing.

600
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,480
Maybe she thinks you already know.

601
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:34,960
Then she wonders.

602
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,040
This guy knows but still doesn't do the problems.

603
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,600
What does that mean?

604
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,520
Next time, just take the initiative to say something.

605
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,640
Just saying this one sentence is enough.

606
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,440
I don't know how to solve this problem.

607
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,200
Please teach me.

608
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:45,960
Exactly.

609
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,920
Your problem-solving method should be steps one, two, and three.

610
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,000
Right.

611
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,240
What you should do.

612
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,640
What you shouldn't do.

613
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,240
What you should do next.

614
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,600
It feels like Chenchen.

615
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,040
Has become a bit like a child.

616
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,200
Then being led forward by her.

617
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,800
Being able to talk to you about this today

618
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,440
I think is already very good.

619
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,520
What's so good about it?

620
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,960
Why do I feel like there's still a long way to go?

621
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,640
A long way to go.

622
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,080
It can still get even better.

623
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,200
This looks promising.

624
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,040
This Duoduo is just too cute.

625
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,240
Extra points.

626
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,360
Allow any emotion to pass through your body.

627
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,000
Stride forward confidently.

628
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,960
Go feel it, march in step.

629
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,760
Her description

630
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,840
is very vivid.

631
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,160
And didn't she also solve

632
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:38,800
Le Chen's question?

633
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,120
He said he was struggling internally.

634
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,040
She said you could do this:

635
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,080
Just say you don't know how to solve this problem.

636
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:43,840
Please teach me.

637
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,280
I don't know why,

638
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,320
but I find her attitude toward life

639
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,240
especially moving.

640
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,240
I think she

641
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,480
is really healthy.

642
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,480
She doesn't think

643
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,600
she has to solve

644
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,680
all the problems in a relationship by herself.

645
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,520
You don't have to

646
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,360
solve everything alone, either.

647
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,640
We can help each other

648
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,920
with some of each other's problems.

649
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,920
So in her view of relationships, she calls it being "comrades."

650
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,840
They want

651
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,720
to advance and retreat together.

652
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,840
Yes, to support each other through everything.

653
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,280
I think

654
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,480
this is a very

655
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,920
vital and lively way.

656
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,400
Yes.

657
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,480
Le Chen's state feels

658
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,080
especially like

659
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,720
being

660
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,520
driving forward in a tunnel,

661
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,560
but there's a beam of light ahead.

662
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,560
There's always hope.

663
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,200
Duo Duo is a bit like

664
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,160
a lighthouse.

665
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,080
And that keeps him moving forward.

666
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,120
I think her

667
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,120
potential energy

668
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,800
will help Chen Chen

669
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,880
possibly also

670
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,080
grow and change in a positive direction.

671
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,400
They were just discussing a topic:

672
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,360
never having been together

673
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,840
versus having been together

674
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,560
but not

675
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,680
ending well.

676
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,880
Which one would be more regrettable?

677
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,320
I might choose having been together

678
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,920
but not having a good outcome.

679
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,720
It's like when you really like someone

680
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,760
but in the end,

681
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,240
the result is truly disappointing.

682
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,840
Sometimes you really tell yourself

683
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,880
I really wish

684
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,640
they could stay in my mind

685
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,400
forever as I imagine them.

686
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,760
Of course, never having been together is more regrettable.

687
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,800
Because I think being together

688
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,120
isn't about the outcome.

689
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,600
It's about the process of being together.

690
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,280
Never having been together

691
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,280
might be even more

692
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,840
regretful.

693
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,320
After being together,

694
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,400
there's a result, so there's no regret.

695
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,280
But I think you have to be brave enough for that.

696
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,360
Are you a brave person?

697
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,160
Right now, I'm not really.

698
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,640
At the moment, I'm kind of

699
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,160
not very daring.

700
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,160
I think life really is like this.

701
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,480
When you reach a certain age,

702
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,440
and suddenly you think,

703
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,440
I don't have the courage for anything.

704
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,520
But I did try.

705
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,120
No matter if it was

706
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,440
good or bad,

707
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,280
even if there was no outcome,

708
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,200
the process itself had many touching moments.

709
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,760
You might meet someone who is just right for you.

710
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,840
They did a lot for you.

711
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,240
Those things, you might

712
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,560
still feel happy when you think about them.

713
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,640
Because you both once

714
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,200
truly cared for each other.

715
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,120
I think that's something that now,

716
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,160
no matter how much money you make,

717
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,200
you can't trade for that happiness.

718
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,160
So I think having been together,

719
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,160
even if it didn't end well,

720
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,840
is still a good thing.

721
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,640
Yuan Yuan.

722
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,040
I'm curious who she'll go on a date with this time.

723
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:26,840
Who?

724
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,400
Xiao Jiao

725
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,880
Hello

726
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,440
Hello

727
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,520
Who is Xiao Jiao meeting?

728
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,720
We couldn't guess.

729
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,840
Xiao Jiao is with Xiao Yuan.

730
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,800
Over here.

731
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,360
Xiao Yuan

732
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,000
Is Xiao Yuan really that good at drawing?

733
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,760
Yes, he really draws very well.

734
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,720
Hello

735
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,320
Hello

736
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,640
Have you been waiting long?

737
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,520
Not really.

738
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:06,960
Not really.

739
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:08,800
Come in.

740
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,560
Sorry I'm late.

741
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,320
It's okay.

742
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,000
So beautiful.

743
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,600
We're making leather goods.

744
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,400
Have you done this before?

745
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:22,880
No.

746
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,400
Me neither, but I also...

747
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,280
Why don't you pick one?

748
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,240
I'm quite interested.

749
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,120
Why don't you pick one?

750
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,680
Then I'll choose this one.

751
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,360
This one is simpler.

752
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,080
This one, right?

753
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,360
Okay, I'll pick this one.

754
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:33,840
Okay.

755
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:34,880
Okay.

756
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,840
I'm at a loss.

757
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,560
So you picked mine?

758
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,680
Card.

759
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,840
That's the very first thing you said.

760
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,080
Yes.

761
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,000
I...

762
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,520
Yes, to be honest.

763
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,240
We...

764
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,080
Didn't know it was you.

765
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,680
We were like playing...

766
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,600
Like playing a deduction game.

767
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,240
We seriously tried to deduce it.

768
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,600
This drawing is really well done.

769
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,080
Then I'll choose this one.

770
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,480
Just took it directly.

771
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,640
We didn't figure it out.

772
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,760
Everyone else

773
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,600
was especially easy to guess.

774
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,240
The others were relatively obvious.

775
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,480
Really?

776
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,200
But that book

777
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,880
I actually think it's quite representative.

778
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,960
Because I'm still in school.

779
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,480
I usually read a lot of books.

780
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,880
I read "To Live" by Yu Hua before.

781
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,560
"To Live" is a great book.

782
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,800
There's a line in it

783
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,640
that says

784
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,600
The meaning of living is living itself.

785
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:34,880
I think actually

786
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,760
this is the same as many

787
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,880
other things.

788
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,800
It's the same.

789
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,680
For example, love.

790
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,120
Love is loving for the sake of love itself.

791
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,840
Not for anything other than love.

792
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,000
Not for any other reason.

793
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,080
That's right.

794
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,760
Yeah.

795
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,040
Have you ever

796
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,920
done something like this before?

797
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,640
No.

798
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,600
But this place was

799
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,240
chosen by me.

800
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:54,680
You chose it.

801
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,200
That's great.

802
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,840
It's because I wanted to make leather goods.

803
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,160
I just wanted

804
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,760
to make something memorable.

805
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,480
I see.

806
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:01,920
Because I feel

807
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,240
it will have

808
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,400
some traces of your handiwork.

809
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,840
You can really use it for a long time.

810
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,080
That's nice.

811
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:07,920
I agree.

812
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,800
Is there anything you especially like?

813
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,760
I quite like sports.

814
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,040
I was just talking to Le Chen the day before yesterday

815
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,480
about waiting

816
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,120
until later

817
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,000
to go skiing together this winter.

818
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,600
I smile when I hear that name.

819
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,280
Yeah.

820
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,520
I'm really curious about what they all do.

821
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,000
Today,

822
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,960
they must all be indoors.

823
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:39,920
Have you ever thought

824
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,080
about what kind of people you might meet at the cabin?

825
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,480
What kind of people are you hoping to meet?

826
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,800
What kind of people do you hope to meet in the cabin?

827
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,560
What type of people are you expecting to encounter?

828
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:53,960
I would

829
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,640
really like to meet

830
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,400
someone whose values and interests are similar to mine.

831
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,440
But maybe

832
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,840
someone whose personality complements mine.

833
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,400
How about you?

834
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,920
I want to meet

835
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,960
people who have things in common with me,

836
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,000
but I also want to meet

837
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
people who are very different from me.

838
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,360
People who are similar but not the same

839
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:18,640
I think so

840
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,840
Similar values and interests

841
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,760
Complementary personalities

842
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,280
It's like this

843
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,440
I think so

844
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,160
Her

845
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,240
You see, his mind is full of

846
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,520
nothing but Lanlan

847
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,000
Her

848
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,600
She must be someone who

849
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,640
In some ways, being similar is better

850
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,360
In some ways

851
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,000
Being complementary is a better answer

852
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,320
Got it

853
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,760
It feels like the state of these two people

854
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,600
is more like this

855
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,360
supporting

856
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,280
a supportive relationship

857
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,280
What Luyuan is actually curious about now is

858
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,200
Wang Lechen

859
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,840
Chenchen

860
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:47,960
Yeah

861
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,120
Yeah

862
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:48,880
And then Xiao Jiao

863
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,800
is actually curious about

864
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,240
Lanlan

865
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:50,600
Lanlan

866
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,640
I think it's obvious

867
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,480
It sounds really fun.

868
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,600
So why did you

869
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,480
choose to study in Beijing back then?

870
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,040
Because my family is the kind

871
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,120
that places a lot of importance on education.

872
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:08,600
They would

873
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,600
limit my leisure time.

874
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:12,640
So

875
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,120
if I wasn't in the library,

876
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,720
I was in my room at home doing homework,

877
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,720
or reading.

878
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,280
After I finished the college entrance exam,

879
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,120
I really wanted

880
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,640
to leave home

881
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,680
and experience

882
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,800
a life completely according to my own wishes,

883
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,920
to live that kind of lifestyle.

884
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,160
So I

885
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,200
chose Beijing at that time.

886
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,920
And I think this is

887
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,280
so far

888
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,440
one of the best decisions I've ever made.

889
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,000
A decision.

890
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,960
Yes, many turning points in my life

891
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,320
started in Beijing.

892
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,080
It just sounds like

893
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,680
you’re someone with your own ideas

894
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,480
and you feel

895
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,160
that you really need to make your own plans

896
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,720
and be able to follow your own plans

897
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,720
because I think everyone is

898
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,080
an independent individual

899
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,920
you can’t completely rely on others

900
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,320
I agree

901
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:58,880
to live

902
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,400
Yes

903
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,280
You mentioned before

904
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,400
that you’re interested in education

905
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,120
Did you later

906
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,440
study anything related to education

907
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,400
I took the exam for

908
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,720
a high school geography teaching certificate

909
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,840
I also took the exam for a high school English teaching certificate

910
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,200
That’s pretty interesting

911
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,240
What a coincidence

912
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,000
Everyone started from

913
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,880
“Three Loves, Two People, One Lifetime”

914
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,320
as the beginning

915
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,760
For me, it was because

916
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,600
when I was doing volunteer teaching

917
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,640
When you were volunteering to teach

918
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,560
you needed that

919
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,520
teaching certificate

920
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,320
Yes, because our

921
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,240
volunteer teaching program

922
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,040
had very high requirements for the teaching part

923
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,080
the standards were very high

924
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,400
So

925
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:29,760
or rather

926
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,840
it was a

927
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,120
volunteer teaching program with a heavy focus on teaching

928
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,000
We had seven days a week

929
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,920
and taught classes on six of them

930
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,360
Yes

931
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,800
Alright

932
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,840
Do you often do housework at home?

933
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,000
I feel like you always see things that need to be done.

934
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,160
He really is always the busiest one.

935
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,320
Always busy with something.

936
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,560
He just can't stop.

937
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,280
When we were little,

938
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:07,760
at home,

939
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,280
it was pretty strict.

940
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,160
No wonder.

941
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,920
You’re really getting more and more skilled.

942
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,480
You do it with ease.

943
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,720
That’s exactly what I was thinking.

944
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,560
Don’t praise him.

945
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,080
If you keep praising,

946
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,600
I might mess up.

947
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:26,680
Don’t praise.

948
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:27,960
Look.

949
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,640
It won’t fit.

950
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Why don’t you fan yourself?

951
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,920
Fan it.

952
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,880
No, I just want to see if there’s any wind.

953
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,720
You’re a really funny person.

954
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,480
Xiao Jiao is really hilarious.

955
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,400
Do girls like to be

956
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,000
praised?

957
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,480
It’s not about being a boy or a girl.

958
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,720
Everyone likes to be praised.

959
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,800
No one dislikes being praised.

960
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,400
Right, good kids are raised with praise.

961
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:54,680
Yes.

962
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,240
Then let’s listen to

963
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,040
Minghao give some praise.

964
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,520
If it’s not natural for me,

965
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,000
I get really shy.

966
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,000
Your feet

967
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,680
Are you not wearing socks?

968
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,080
That's right.

969
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,280
Is there wind by your feet right now?

970
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,040
Yes.

971
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:14,440
Okay.

972
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:14,960
I'll close it for you.

973
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,640
It's really comfortable.

974
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,520
Okay.

975
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,160
Let's go.

976
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,000
Let's go.

977
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,760
So we're going to West Lake to eat?

978
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:27,760
Yes.

979
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,680
Even though I'm from Hangzhou,

980
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,600
before I turned seventeen,

981
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,600
I had never been to West Lake.

982
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,280
That's pretty amazing.

983
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,480
I always thought

984
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,960
since my home is in Hangzhou,

985
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,320
I could go to West Lake whenever I wanted.

986
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,320
But for the first seventeen years,

987
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,200
I just never went.

988
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,360
Later, when I had a bit more free time,

989
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,000
I started coming to West Lake for walks often.

990
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,360
West Lake really is

991
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,640
very comfortable.

992
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,000
So are you the type

993
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,040
who is very

994
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,680
impulsive

995
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,120
or more of a slow-to-warm-up person?

996
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,320
Impulsive.

997
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:01,760
Impulsive.

998
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,040
Xiao Jiao is way too impulsive.

999
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,560
Too impulsive.

1000
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,400
Both of us are impulsive types.

1001
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,720
But I think sometimes I

1002
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,160
can change.

1003
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:09,640
Like, I

1004
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,480
Yeah, me too.

1005
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,320
I'm not always the same.

1006
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:11,760
Right.

1007
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,160
Right.

1008
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,480
I think I'm someone

1009
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,080
who can be slow or warm.

1010
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,320
But sometimes I can be really

1011
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,360
adventurous.

1012
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,520
In that state.

1013
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:21,800
Just

1014
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,400
Or maybe I can be a little

1015
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,280
less conventional.

1016
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,360
Actually, you really are a

1017
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,320
very easygoing person.

1018
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,200
Me?

1019
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:32,640
Yeah.

1020
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,600
How so?

1021
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,600
Because at first, at that banquet,

1022
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,760
when I saw you at the dinner,

1023
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,720
I thought you were

1024
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,240
especially strict.

1025
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,680
Like, very serious.

1026
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,280
You know?

1027
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,200
So,

1028
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,880
I didn't dare say anything casual to you.

1029
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,480
I thought you were a really proper person.

1030
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,600
But then,

1031
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,120
after spending these past few days together,

1032
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,320
I found you quite interesting.

1033
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,480
That day,

1034
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,880
I was really

1035
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,320
too reserved.

1036
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,280
Yeah, a little.

1037
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,600
And honestly, I was really nervous too.

1038
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,440
I could tell, you were really nervous.

1039
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,400
I was so nervous that day.

1040
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,240
He really

1041
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,000
gave off the impression

1042
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,720
of being very strict.

1043
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,520
"Strict" is a good word for it.

1044
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,560
It's actually quite accurate.

1045
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,600
The place you picked is so beautiful.

1046
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,400
Of course.

1047
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,000
We're sitting here,

1048
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,160
just following the plan.

1049
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,000
So beautiful.

1050
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,720
So beautiful.

1051
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,560
How about we go check out the rooftop?

1052
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,200
Sure, let's go.

1053
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:28,720
Okay.

1054
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,600
So beautiful.

1055
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,800
You can see West Lake.

1056
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,200
West Lake is really beautiful.

1057
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:36,800
Yes.

1058
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,560
I really love West Lake.

1059
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,880
Is there any song you especially like to listen to?

1060
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,520
It could be a singer,

1061
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,600
or a style.

1062
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,480
I prefer listening to songs that are either

1063
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,480
either

1064
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,680
quite calm

1065
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,200
or extremely loud.

1066
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:54,960
Loud.

1067
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,600
You're quite an extreme person too.

1068
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,080
Yes.

1069
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,040
Me too.

1070
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,000
Because I

1071
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,960
Didn't I tell you before?

1072
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,520
Le Chen also said

1073
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,600
that I'm a very extreme person.

1074
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,160
Le Chen told me

1075
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:05,800
Seriously.

1076
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,560
He didn't hold back.

1077
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,520
We had an open conversation.

1078
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,320
We really opened up.

1079
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,360
Now I don't even

1080
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,800
feel curious about where they are.

1081
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,520
Because I think there's no way

1082
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,160
their place looks better than ours.

1083
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:14,640
Right.

1084
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,440
Ours is more fun.

1085
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,320
There's nowhere as beautiful and fun as this place.

1086
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,040
Beautiful.

1087
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,800
I think this must be

1088
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,360
the most beautiful place today.

1089
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,240
Yes.

1090
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,520
I'll have to brag to them when I get back.

1091
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,120
Yours definitely isn't as nice as ours.

1092
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,080
That's right.

1093
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,600
It shows I put a lot of thought into preparing.

1094
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,560
Yes.

1095
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,240
Let's go inside.

1096
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:32,680
It's starting to rain a little.

1097
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,080
Okay.

1098
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,880
So beautiful.

1099
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,480
Is there any flower you especially like?

1100
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,760
Anything is fine, right?

1101
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,080
I was thinking,

1102
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,320
I actually prefer

1103
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,080
In the past,

1104
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,720
I used to like plum blossoms and similar flowers.

1105
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,520
Plum blossoms.

1106
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,080
Maybe because

1107
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,000
they're very resilient.

1108
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,040
Yeah.

1109
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,320
But the symbolism is a bit much.

1110
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:05,880
The meaning is nice.

1111
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,880
But it's a bit too symbolic.

1112
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,680
It's a bit too symbolic.

1113
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,040
Yeah, and then later on,

1114
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,480
I also quite like peonies.

1115
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,280
Does your dad ever give your mom flowers?

1116
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:20,920
He does.

1117
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,120
And before, maybe

1118
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,200
back then,

1119
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,120
when he was young,

1120
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,600
he didn't have much money.

1121
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,440
So he couldn't afford the really nice ones.

1122
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,400
But at that time,

1123
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,640
he wanted to give 999 flowers.

1124
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,080
I remember.

1125
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:36,960
It seems he had some

1126
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,800
maybe even some flowers that the flower shops didn't want.

1127
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,240
Then he said,

1128
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,400
Can you give me these?

1129
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,720
He asked for a few from each flower shop.

1130
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,200
A few from each flower shop.

1131
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:42,960
And then, in the end, he gathered

1132
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,480
them together.

1133
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,520
To make up 999 flowers.

1134
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:45,600
Yes.

1135
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,480
Then he arranged them himself.

1136
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,200
He arranged them himself.

1137
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,400
That's so romantic.

1138
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,360
His parents are just that romantic.

1139
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,760
I think this is even more

1140
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,400
romantic than just giving

1141
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,200
999 flowers directly.

1142
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,280
It's even more romantic.

1143
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,960
He collected 999 flowers.

1144
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,440
You can tell Xiao Jiao is also

1145
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,480
a romantic by nature.

1146
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,400
He inherited his father's romantic side.

1147
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,880
So romantic.

1148
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,720
That's so interesting.

1149
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,160
Yes.

1150
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,480
Talking about his parents' love

1151
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,040
still makes him

1152
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,120
very talkative.

1153
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:12,760
Very happy.

1154
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,280
Very talkative.

1155
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,080
Yes.

1156
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,520
Really envious.

1157
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,200
Here he comes.

1158
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,600
Hurry and eat these two.

1159
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,120
Then I'll cut this steak.

1160
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,080
Impressive.

1161
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,280
You cut it really well.

1162
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,240
You gave full emotional value.

1163
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,240
I'm touched.

1164
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,640
I should be the one touched.

1165
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,000
Because you chose this restaurant.

1166
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,640
We're both touched.

1167
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,560
Mutual compliments.

1168
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,120
Mutual compliments.

1169
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,480
This place is really delicious.

1170
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,920
Did you skip breakfast?

1171
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,920
Just had lunch.

1172
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,320
Same for both of us.

1173
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,400
We're really hungry.

1174
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,520
We might be

1175
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,280
the most serious eaters in this room.

1176
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,560
That's so funny.

1177
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,880
Such a happy day.

1178
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,920
Such a happy day.

1179
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,000
It's been so long since I went out and had this much fun.

1180
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,880
Who will invite me out next?

1181
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,720
My standards are really high.

1182
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,920
It has to be fun, beautiful, and delicious.

1183
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,480
Right.

1184
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,240
So in some ways, the two of them

1185
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,560
feel quite similar.

1186
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:36,920
Actually, both of them are

1187
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,560
people who want to express

1188
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,360
certain things.

1189
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:38,600
people who want to express something.

1190
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,480
Here,

1191
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,120
expressing it like this

1192
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,600
I think is necessary too.

1193
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,520
It feels like

1194
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,160
this date turned us into good friends.

1195
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,120
Like teammates.

1196
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,520
Supporting each other.

1197
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,000
That's right.

1198
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,960
The best support.

1199
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,120
That's great, so let's

1200
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,200
see how it goes this round.

1201
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,160
We missed.

1202
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:55,680
We missed.

1203
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,480
So far, none of us have

1204
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,920
Yeah, we lost badly.

1205
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,680
This is my favorite dance style.

1206
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,320
Swing dance.

1207
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,760
Yuxing

1208
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,280
Hello

1209
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,280
Have you been here long?

1210
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,520
Not really, I just arrived.

1211
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,400
Correct answer.

1212
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,920
A heart-fluttering raw stone.

1213
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,800
We got it right again.

1214
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,560
You even brought a film camera.

1215
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,320
Yes, I brought it.

1216
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,280
I brought mine too.

1217
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,400
I was just wondering who it would be.

1218
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:09,680
Really?

1219
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:13,600
But I

1220
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,720
It's just that

1221
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,520
I thought it would probably be you.

1222
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,320
Why?

1223
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:22,840
Because, didn't you

1224
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,000
draw a Bernese Mountain Dog?

1225
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,400
My little secret has been discovered.

1226
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,560
I brought you something.

1227
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:35,440
Flowers.

1228
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,120
Who gives flowers to whom?

1229
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,800
The girl gives them to the boy.

1230
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,000
The girl is really proactive.

1231
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,360
Thank you.

1232
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:45,480
This is...

1233
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,280
Thank you.

1234
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,920
Jasmine and white roses, right?

1235
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,040
They smell pretty nice.

1236
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,800
Have you ever danced before?

1237
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:57,840
Just a little.

1238
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,280
A little bit.

1239
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,040
What kind of dance do you know?

1240
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,680
I used to know a bit of classical dance.

1241
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,160
Classical dance.

1242
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:02,560
Folk dance.

1243
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,840
Have you learned it?

1244
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,000
Not really.

1245
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:06,280
No, I haven't.

1246
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,160
Just a little.

1247
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,320
Okay, so you have some dance skills.

1248
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,480
So, can you dance?

1249
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,440
I can't, not at all.

1250
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,600
I really can't.

1251
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,400
Not at all.

1252
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,200
It's just...

1253
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,240
I've danced before.

1254
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,840
I actually want to see him dance.

1255
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,520
You should give it a try.

1256
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:27,920
How should I say it?

1257
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:29,760
We're going to dance.

1258
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,240
Give it a try.

1259
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,360
Hello, everyone.

1260
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,520
Welcome to today's

1261
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,640
swing dance party.

1262
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,280
So today, the main thing we'll experience

1263
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,200
in swing dance

1264
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:40,840
is a branch

1265
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:41,600
which is

1266
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,400
Twist dance.

1267
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,680
Twist dance.

1268
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,240
We can

1269
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,320
change into different outfits in a bit.

1270
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,000
Then

1271
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,480
we'll get into this retro vibe.

1272
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,600
And then let's enjoy together

1273
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,640
the joy of dancing.

1274
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:49,920
Okay.

1275
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:50,320
Alright?

1276
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,120
Alright.

1277
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,120
Let's go change our clothes.

1278
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,960
You have to wear these kinds of clothes to set the mood.

1279
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,360
It suits her so well.

1280
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:16,960
Hello.

1281
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:18,000
Changed and ready.

1282
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:18,320
Changed and ready.

1283
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,000
Come, join us

1284
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,160
for our swing dance party.

1285
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,880
Let's get started.

1286
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,040
Let's all

1287
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:23,720
step out with our right foot first.

1288
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,640
Our right foot.

1289
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,840
Do you want to stand here?

1290
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:26,320
Yes.

1291
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,040
Very good.

1292
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,280
Step on the heel

1293
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,560
Then take a step

1294
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,360
Step on the heel

1295
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:33,760
Take a step

1296
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:34,120
Bring in

1297
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,400
To put it simply,

1298
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,720
Tap, step

1299
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,360
Okay, five, six, seven

1300

Step

1304
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,200
It's like his feet were just put together

1305
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:46,920
Not familiar

1306
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:47,800
Tap

1307
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:48,440

Okay

Very good

1310
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:49,840
Well done

1311
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:50,800
You learned it right away

1312
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,560
Alright, let's do it again

1313
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:52,480
Two eight-counts

1314
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,280
Step out with your right foot

1315
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:53,920

00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:57,480
Step

1321
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,040
Left side

1322
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:59,040
Right side

1323
00:45:59,040 --> 00:45:59,680
Left side

1324
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,320
Right side

1325
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,120
Go back again

1326
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:04,600
Tap

1327
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,080
Step

1328
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:05,520
Okay

1329
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:06,880
Heel down on the back foot

1330
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,480
One, two, three, four

1331
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,440
Yuxing, don't say anything

1332
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:10,960
These limbs

1333
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,600
Really look like they were just attached

1334
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,160
Then on five, bring in your left leg

1335
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,000
Very good

1336
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:16,800
Then

1337
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,520
Make me go crazy

1338
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,840
Alright, shake your head

1339
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,920
Make me go crazy

1340
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,000
Yes, very good

1341
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,400
Bro

1342
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:30,800
Is that me?

1343
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,600
Don't do that

1344
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,400
Heel

1345
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,520
Five, six, seven

1346
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,080
One, two

1347
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:36,560
Slow

1348
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:37,960
Five, six

1349
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:38,520
Switch sides

1350
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,920
Yu Xing seems really stiff

1351
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,000
Yeah

1352
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,520
Yu Xing as always

1353
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:45,920
Yeah

1354
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,360
That's so Yu Xing

1355
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:48,360
Yeah, very Yu Xing

1356
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,560
One, two, three, four

1357
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,000
Now look at me

1358
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:52,480
Okay

1359
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,560
Very good

1360
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:53,840
Alright

1361
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:54,320
Can we

1362
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,400
Try dancing face to face once

1363
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,520
Dance face to face once

1364
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:57,720
Can we give it a try?

1365
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,200
Dance face to face once

1366
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:00,640
Sure

1367
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:01,560
Alright

1368
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:02,200
Let's try it

1369
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,080
Holding hands

1370
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:09,640
Successfully holding hands

1371
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,080
We don't need to hold hands.

1372
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:14,680
Okay.

1373
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,120
Teacher.

1374
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,320
We don't need to hold hands.

1375
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:19,880
Okay.

1376
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,400
Come on, everyone steps out with the right foot.

1377
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:23,840
Alright?

1378
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:27,720
To the left.

1379
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,320
Very good.

1380
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:30,880
To the right.

1381
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,720
This is super fun.

1382
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:34,760
It really is fun.

1383
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:35,760
Get your hips ready.

1384
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,400
Right side.

1385
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:37,960
Look at your dance partner.

1386
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:39,960
Right side.

1387
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:43,960
Left side, right side, four times.

1388
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,000
Get ready to bring your feet in.

1389
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,080
This is so much fun.

1390
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:57,640
Is that okay?

1391
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,240
We always high-five after every dance.

1392
00:47:59,240 --> 00:47:59,760
Is that okay?

1393
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,640
It's fine, I'll just dance randomly.

1394
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:20,720
Five, six, seven.

1395
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:45,960
Crab

1396
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,640
I think it looks like a Maori dance.

1397
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,200
Like this?

1398
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,000
Is it like this?

1399
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:54,720
Yes.

1400
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,440
I don't know.

1401
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:57,840
Shake a little.

1402
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:58,640
Is it like this?

1403
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:59,120
Shake.

1404
00:48:59,120 --> 00:48:59,560
Like this (is it)?

1405
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:00,440
Tap the shoulder.

1406
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:04,640
Shake.

1407
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,240
Yours...

1408
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,080
Come on, high five.

1409
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:07,960
Okay.

1410
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,400
Alright, let's go take a break.

1411
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,160
We'll come back later.

1412
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,000
Okay.

1413
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:11,640
Alright.

1414
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,880
Look.

1415
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:15,520
It's very...

1416
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,760
Very natural.

1417
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,440
The intimate gestures just happen.

1418
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,320
We can take a break.

1419
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,120
Alright, sure.

1420
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:35,680
Sit here.

1421
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:38,840
I feel like dancing

1422
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,600
is really such a difficult activity.

1423
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,560
So you've never danced at all?

1424
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:44,960
No.

1425
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,360
They're sitting so close.

1426
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,320
Look at how she's squeezing him.

1427
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:48,880
They're sitting with no space between them.

1428
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:49,920
That squeezed feeling...

1429
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,320
Half his butt is hanging off the seat.

1430
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,920
Actually, you could move a little to the right.

1431
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,080
So you've never danced at all?

1432
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,280
No.

1433
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:01,480
Did you guess it?

1434
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:02,480
Before coming in,

1435
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,920
I had no idea we'd be dancing.

1436
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,680
Because I've never been involved with dancing.

1437
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:09,920
It's just not my field.

1438
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,080
When I left home this morning,

1439
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,040
I wondered about my film camera.

1440
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,520
Should I bring it or not?

1441
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,120
But

1442
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:21,920
I thought

1443
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,160
I could bring it anyway.

1444
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,080
Because

1445
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,960
Film cameras are really rare now.

1446
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,960
Before you arrived, I was guessing

1447
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:28,800
who it would be.

1448
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,040
That's true.

1449
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,520
It seems none of you knew

1450
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,240
who would get that card.

1451
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,480
When I was drawing, I thought about it for a moment.

1452
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,360
At first, I drew a dog.

1453
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:39,480
Then I thought again,

1454
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,360
and decided to draw another one.

1455
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,040
Then I wondered

1456
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,120
if I should draw a bigger one

1457
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,360
or a smaller one.

1458
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,840
Because everyone has different kinds of dogs.

1459
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,160
At first, I didn't add any color.

1460
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,000
But after thinking for a while,

1461
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,720
I added a little bit of color.

1462
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,480
But the color I added

1463
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,120
was the color of your dog.

1464
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,600
Yifan is quite efficient.

1465
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,440
Very brave.

1466
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:05,920
The drawing is excellent.

1467
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,960
Secretly hid a little thought in it.

1468
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,440
Let's see if anyone notices.

1469
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,520
She's really impressive.

1470
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,240
She's very proactive.

1471
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:14,840
Extremely (proactive).

1472
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,440
But today, I am truly myself.

1473
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:25,360
I've been guessing all along.

1474
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,080
But I feel like the answer in my heart

1475
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:27,920
should be you.

1476
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:28,560
Really?

1477
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:30,880
Because I brought flowers.

1478
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:33,360
Because back then, when you

1479
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,240
were picking a gift,

1480
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,040
you also brought flowers.

1481
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:35,520
That's right.

1482
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,680
I chose

1483
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,400
this bouquet as a gift because

1484
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,720
flowers have a very short blooming period.

1485
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,120
But

1486
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,160
I think

1487
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,120
this reminds me even more

1488
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,080
to seize the moment.

1489
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:49,920
Did you see what kind of flowers I chose?

1490
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:50,360
Yes, I did.

1491
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,080
Those are

1492
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,560
white roses and jasmine, right?

1493
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,440
The small ones should be jasmine.

1494
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,240
Jasmine is very fragrant.

1495
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,440
I also really like jasmine.

1496
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,200
But I still don't know

1497
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,840
what the flower language of jasmine is.

1498
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,000
It has a pun based on its pronunciation.

1499
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:05,200
Jasmine

1500
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:06,920
Jasmine

1501
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
"Mo" sounds like "in dreams"

1502
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:11,920
Jasmine

1503
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:12,760
Jasmine

1504
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:14,440
Mo

1505
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:15,560
Mo

1506
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:16,720
Li

1507
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:17,640
Mo (sounds like "never")

1508
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:18,400
Li (sounds like "leave")

1509
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:22,480
Mo Li

1510
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,400
Mo Li, don't leave.

1511
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:25,960
Mo

1512
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:26,880
Li

1513
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:27,640
Mo Li

1514
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,080
Mo Li

1515
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,400
It means to want to, it means to be able to.

1516
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,000
Mo Li

1517
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:32,720
For a long, long time.

1518
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:33,920
Always able to be together like this.

1519
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:34,440
Yes.

1520
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:35,040
Mo Li

1521
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:35,800
That's right.

1522
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:36,760
I think it fits very well.

1523
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,120
My views on relationships.

1524
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:41,200
And also, white roses

1525
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:41,960
They are also that kind of

1526
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,240
Very pure.

1527
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:43,800
Pure.

1528
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:44,440
Sincere.

1529
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:45,880
Sincerity is

1530
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,200
I think it's very important.

1531
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,240
I feel she's very passionate.

1532
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,640
Teacher, could you take a photo for us?

1533
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:58,280
Sure.

1534
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,120
Three, two, one.

1535
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,560
Jasmine, Mo Li

1536
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:12,800
Isn't it nice?

1537
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,280
This expression feels kind of clever.

1538
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,680
I thought of that sofa.

1539
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,160
The funny thing is because

1540
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,160
Yu Xing is actually

1541
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:22,720
Really big, you know?

1542
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,360
Squeezed into the corner.

1543
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,040
But I feel Yu Xing doesn't really dare

1544
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,520
To turn around to that

1545
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,360
He keeps saying, "Really?"

1546
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,480
It feels like

1547
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:34,920
you can tell right away

1548
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,920
both of them really long for that kind of pure

1549
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:38,880
and sincere love

1550
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,840
just like jasmine flowers

1551
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,240
Speaking of which

1552
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,040
they have jasmine

1553
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,000
and we have jasmine too

1554
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,960
what a coincidence, right?

1555
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,360
Let’s savor this for a moment

1556
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,240
the conversation we just had

1557
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:51,560
is just like

1558
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:52,800
opening this bottle of

1559
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,120
Master Kong Jasmine Honey Tea

1560
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,600
you can immediately smell

1561
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,240
the fresh fragrance of jasmine

1562
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,040
And also

1563
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,800
every sentence is worth savoring

1564
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:01,520
just like

1565
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,200
the lingering sweetness of jasmine honey tea

1566
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:03,960
Yes, friends

1567
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,360
let’s raise a glass of Master Kong Jasmine Honey Tea

1568
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,640
for a toast

1569
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:07,160
and wish

1570
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:07,960
that they can all

1571
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:10,280
find the beautiful love in their hearts

1572
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,920
Delicious, your mouth is filled with jasmine fragrance

1573
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:14,680
Yes

1574
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,840
With the jasmine aroma

1575
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:16,920
let’s keep watching

1576
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:19,480
Alright, we’re leaving now

1577
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,440
Bye-bye

1578
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:33,440
Good dog.

1579
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:34,680
Great dog.

1580
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:38,560
Good dog.

1581
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,040
If Nicole didn't pee in the kitchen,

1582
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,640
I wouldn't have gone to you for the broom.

1583
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,200
So that's how it was.

1584
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:51,600
I might

1585
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:52,760
If there really wasn't

1586
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:54,040
this kind of rare

1587
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:55,160
chance,

1588
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:55,960
I would

1589
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:57,920
create an opportunity.

1590
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:58,760
Create an opportunity.

1591
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:02,280
I deliberately did it without making it obvious.

1592
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,040
That's really brave.

1593
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,360
But I'm quite happy you came over.

1594
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,760
Just to keep me company.

1595
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:15,720
After all, I'm a responsible partner.

1596
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,040
Which side do you want to sit on?

1597
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:28,720
I'll sit on this side.

1598
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:29,160
Okay.

1599
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,320
There are real birds here.

1600
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,720
Are they parrots?

1601
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,120
Will they learn to talk like me?

1602
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,640
They're so close together.

1603
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:46,920
Are they a couple?

1604
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,520
They're probably married.

1605
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:50,480
Look.

1606
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:56,720
We're really far apart.

1607
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,480
There's a whole galaxy between us.

1608
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:02,760
Regarding that comparison,

1609
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:03,960
if you look at the scale,

1610
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,440
it really is a galaxy here.

1611
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:10,440
Maybe they want us to eat a lot.

1612
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:12,840
So about that card,

1613
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,040
do you usually carry it with you,

1614
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:14,680
or

1615
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:15,560
I brought it.

1616
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:16,440
You brought it? Where is it?

1617
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,080
Maybe it's in my bag.

1618
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:19,800
It's in the bag.

1619
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,720
Because my card isn't colored yet,

1620
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,040
so that boy doesn't have one.

1621
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:26,440
Right.

1622
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:27,640
That one is blank.

1623
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,280
Yeah.

1624
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:29,840
But

1625
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,400
look at the height difference.

1626
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,560
Actually, we know it.

1627
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:34,760
Look.

1628
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:39,600
He's shy.

1629
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,480
But the boys are about the same height.

1630
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,160
That's why I said I'm betting.

1631
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:49,560
That's why I said I'm betting.

1632
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,000
So bold.

1633
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:08,480
So you weren't studying in the country at that time?

1634
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,760
I attended elementary and middle school in the country.

1635
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:11,320
For the first year of high school,

1636
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,320
I also spent one semester studying here.

1637
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:14,880
After that, I wasn't here anymore.

1638
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,040
After that, I wasn't here anymore.

1639
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:18,800
I studied in the United States until my sophomore year of college.

1640
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,120
Then I returned to the country.

1641
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,320
But later, because of some family

1642
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,400
reasons,

1643
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,880
I decided to stay in the country.

1644
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,120
Maybe my focus should be

1645
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,560
on the family business.

1646
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,360
Helping my family with the business,

1647
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:34,400
well,

1648
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:35,760
because there were some

1649
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:36,600
crises before.

1650
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,000
So I wanted to

1651
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,960
stabilize things first.

1652
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:43,400
So basically,

1653
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,960
between you and your family,

1654
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:45,920
you chose your family.

1655
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:47,880
Yes.

1656
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:49,600
Because I think

1657
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,040
my parents are the ones who raised me.

1658
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,880
So I can't just think about myself.

1659
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,360
I have to consider them too.

1660
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:58,360
That's very responsible of you.

1661
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:00,960
So are you the only child in your family?

1662
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,760
No, I have an older sister.

1663
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,800
She already has three children.

1664
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:11,640
Three kids

1665
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:15,840
are very cute.

1666
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,320
All three kids are really cute.

1667
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:20,440
So, someone like you,

1668
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:21,920
you must be the type who

1669
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,640
really likes family.

1670
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:25,280
Why does it feel like

1671
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,160
Yeah, I also quite like kids.

1672
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,040
Not really.

1673
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:28,560
Not really.

1674
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:29,920
Getting married—

1675
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:33,480
I think you have to be responsible.

1676
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:34,640
So I would be very cautious.

1677
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:38,840
I would think a lot about it.

1678
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,080
Actually, I would consider many things.

1679
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,480
If you can't support yourself,

1680
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:43,000
then

1681
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,840
you can't take care of others.

1682
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,200
If you truly like someone,

1683
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:47,640
love someone,

1684
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:48,720
you wouldn't want

1685
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,760
them to have to

1686
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,080
suffer

1687
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,200
or go through hardships.

1688
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,160
But it shouldn't be like that.

1689
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:56,880
So I don't dare to.

1690
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:57,320
I...

1691
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:58,880
I don't dare to make

1692
00:58:58,880 --> 00:58:59,840
such decisions lightly.

1693
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:02,640
So I think now

1694
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,080
many young people

1695
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,080
aren't very willing to have children

1696
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,360
because they can't be sure

1697
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:11,680
if they can take good care of

1698
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:13,520
the new life that will be born

1699
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,480
into this new world.

1700
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,400
Right, but if you truly

1701
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,400
sincerely love someone,

1702
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,000
you actually won't care about these things.

1703
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,320
I think it's okay to endure hardships.

1704
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,040
You can go through it together

1705
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,880
and work hard for it.

1706
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,960
There's a bit of a difference in values here.

1707
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:31,080
It's about views on relationships.

1708
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,520
It's a very sharp topic.

1709
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,040
That's true, but I really think

1710
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,800
that love is actually

1711
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,760
built on the foundation of bread.

1712
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:46,320
I don't think so.

1713
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:48,400
I didn't think so before either.

1714
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,440
But now I do.

1715
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:51,440
I've become aware of it.

1716
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,600
I feel like I also

1717
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:56,840
wonder if the other person

1718
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,200
might have a better option.

1719
00:59:59,200 --> 00:59:59,760
Yeah.

1720
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,560
As long as you don't starve,

1721
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,440
things won't be that bad.

1722
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,080
It depends on where your desires lie.

1723
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:10,600
I think desire

1724
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:12,920
is something you decide for yourself.

1725
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:14,640
Right, but when you

1726
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:15,720
are living a plain life,

1727
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,000
you start wanting more.

1728
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:17,840
Sometimes you just

1729
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:19,920
then I will

1730
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:20,720
work harder

1731
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:21,960
to move in that direction.

1732
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:22,560
But I wouldn't say

1733
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,640
that I would deny something because of this.

1734
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,200
Thinking that bread is more important.

1735
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:29,160
Women are totally capable

1736
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,280
of enduring hardships together with men.

1737
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:32,480
You just think, anyway,

1738
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,040
when it comes to certain views,

1739
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,560
there will be some differences in values.

1740
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,040
It's not that bread is more important.

1741
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:41,160
What I mean is,

1742
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,440
when it comes to love, it's really

1743
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,560
something that exists on the foundation of bread.

1744
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:46,680
It only comes after that.

1745
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:49,160
It's like a flower—

1746
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:51,240
without soil, it can't bloom.

1747
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,320
It can bloom even among rocks.

1748
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:55,320
It can bloom among rocks too.

1749
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,760
Haven't you seen flowers growing in cracks in rocks?

1750
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:58,880
But honestly,

1751
01:00:58,880 --> 01:00:59,760
that's really rare.

1752
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:01,720
Actually, I think

1753
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:03,200
a lot of problems aren't really problems.

1754
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:07,360
Maybe these are things

1755
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:08,560
I can solve.

1756
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:14,920
So do you think

1757
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,000
that in the end, relationships

1758
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,760
between two people will turn into family-like affection?

1759
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:20,080
Yes.

1760
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:21,760
Absolutely, yes.

1761
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,080
I think relationships eventually become like family.

1762
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:26,320
That's where the two of us differ.

1763
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:33,800
I think a lover is someone you choose.

1764
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,040
A family member you can choose.

1765
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:36,720
Yes, a lover is someone I choose.

1766
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:37,720
A family member you can choose.

1767
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,960
But the prerequisite is that they're my lover.

1768
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:43,000
Yes, that's right.

1769
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,120
Love and family bonds

1770
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:46,080
both have love in them.

1771
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:47,880
The essence of that love is the same.

1772
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,800
Both of you are right.

1773
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,440
Don't you think that love is often

1774
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:53,680
described as

1775
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,600
a passionate spark?

1776
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:56,600
Words like that.

1777
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:58,280
But sparks are actually

1778
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,800
easy to extinguish.

1779
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:01,640
I think that's true.

1780
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:04,080
But some say love can be like a gentle, lasting stream.

1781
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:07,320
I think family bonds

1782
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,840
are more about companionship.

1783
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:13,960
In the language of jasmine flowers,

1784
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:15,280
there's the meaning of companionship.

1785
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:15,720
Companionship.

1786
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:17,960
Because its blooming period is long.

1787
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:23,520
It actually means

1788
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:25,840
being together for a long time.

1789
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:28,680
Girls are really pure when it comes to love.

1790
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,240
I feel that companionship is still very important.

1791
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,840
Are you someone who expresses your feelings?

1792
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:39,240
Yes.

1793
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:39,960
I didn't use to express them.

1794
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,240
But now I think I should.

1795
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,320
It's important to communicate effectively.

1796
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,320
Is what I say effective?

1797
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:52,440
Yes, it's effective.

1798
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:53,600
I think we talk a lot.

1799
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:55,160
Really.

1800
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:55,760
Is it effective?

1801
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:01,920
Yes, it is.

1802
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:03,120
Very effective.

1803
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:12,360
It's very interesting.

1804
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:13,320
It's quite nice to watch.

1805
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:15,760
He didn't understand what she said was effective.

1806
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,080
Those are two different things.

1807
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:20,320
The topic they just discussed about dating,

1808
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:22,440
is something that's often talked about.

1809
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:24,360
It's about whether you would be willing

1810
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:25,960
to start a relationship

1811
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:27,160
when every aspect of yourself

1812
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:28,280
is at its best,

1813
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,200
or

1814
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:32,440
accept love whenever it comes.

1815
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,640
I'm more emotional.

1816
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,560
I don't really set limits for myself.

1817
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:37,520
I think whatever comes, comes.

1818
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,240
My emotional side

1819
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:43,240
would say, just start when you feel it.

1820
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:43,920
But

1821
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,680
love is actually very complicated.

1822
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,360
It's not something you can rely on just feelings

1823
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,920
and expect it to last for a long time.

1824
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,560
It requires skill,

1825
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:51,560
it needs sincerity,

1826
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:52,400
and it needs the right attitude.

1827
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,040
It has many dimensions.

1828
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:54,800
So

1829
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:57,000
you have to consider all of them.

1830
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,520
I don't want to put love

1831
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:00,760
this thing

1832
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,640
into a fixed framework.

1833
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:06,800
Whether the feeling comes,

1834
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,240
Whether the feeling comes,

1835
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,880
Or when I'm ready,

1836
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,840
I think this kind of thing

1837
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:13,840
can't be forced.

1838
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:14,600
Even if you're ready,

1839
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,240
love might not necessarily arrive.

1840
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,120
And when you feel you've met

1841
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,080
the right person,

1842
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:20,200
even if you're not ready,

1843
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:22,440
maybe she'll still be willing to

1844
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,640
go through things with you.

1845
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:26,720
So I think

1846
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:29,080
when you want to love,

1847
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:30,200
just be brave and love.

1848
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,840
If you have concerns,

1849
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:34,000
then you should solve the current problems.

1850
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,440
And when you want to love again,

1851
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,200
then go for it.

1852
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,280
From a young age, we're instilled with an idea

1853
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,280
which is

1854
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:45,000
you need to be financially independent.

1855
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
And you should have the ability to take care of others.

1856
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,040
Gradually, you start to

1857
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:49,640
realize that life is actually just a

1858
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:50,360
process.

1859
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:51,600
Whether in a good relationship

1860
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:52,600
or a bad one,

1861
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:53,480
you're always

1862
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:54,400
learning and growing.

1863
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,040
Learning and growing.

1864
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:56,560
Don't be too fixated on

1865
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:57,360
having to

1866
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:58,400
make yourself capable,

1867
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:59,600
having both love and bread,

1868
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:00,960
and only then being willing to

1869
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,920
go through these experiences.

1870
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:04,320
The idea that you must have bread first

1871
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:05,400
and then love,

1872
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,000
I tell myself,

1873
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,920
I'll eat my bread

1874
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:10,680
while also tending to

1875
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,200
the rose I care about most in my heart.

1876
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,280
I think bread comes first.

1877
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:15,880
Then comes love.

1878
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:17,280
The crux of this issue is

1879
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:18,720
whether bread must

1880
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:19,760
come from love.

1881
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,200
Maybe in the past,

1882
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,120
men would feel

1883
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:24,000
that it's their responsibility

1884
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,160
to provide the bread.

1885
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:25,880
Women would feel

1886
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,440
they need to get bread

1887
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,280
from the relationship.

1888
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:28,760
But now,

1889
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:29,480
more and more

1890
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:30,680
young people think

1891
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:31,480
bread is

1892
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:32,480
independent of love,

1893
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:33,720
independent of relationships.

1894
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,040
If I need bread,

1895
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,160
I'll create it myself.

1896
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:37,640
For example, when love eventually

1897
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:38,400
turns into family affection,

1898
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,360
about this,

1899
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:41,440
before lovers become family,

1900
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:41,960
the premise is

1901
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:42,960
you are lovers first.

1902
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:44,480
It's actually

1903
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:45,000
a process.

1904
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:46,440
My brother and I

1905
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:47,000
often discuss this.

1906
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,360
Because my brother is married,

1907
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:49,920
he told me

1908
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:50,640
it's not quite

1909
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:51,720
what he imagined before.

1910
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:53,400
Later in marriage,

1911
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,240
you become more like

1912
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:57,080
partners for life.

1913
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,360
I interpret that as a kind of

1914
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:01,920
elevation.

1915
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:04,480
Because I have a group of friends myself

1916
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,840
I often see in them

1917
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:10,120
many beautiful aspects of marriage

1918
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,000
But you really start to feel

1919
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,080
that the way they interact is more like family

1920
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:17,560
After getting married

1921
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:20,520
I think it gives birth to a core of familial affection

1922
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:23,560
But

1923
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:24,720
love and family affection

1924
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,760
I think they are always two different

1925
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:27,960
types of emotional relationships

1926
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:29,440
or emotional patterns

1927
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,040
I think we should treat

1928
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:34,800
him like a lover

1929
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,960
just don't put too many

1930
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:38,680
labels like "he's my family"

1931
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:39,880
or "we've already become family"

1932
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:41,200
so anything goes

1933
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:42,320
often

1934
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:43,400
it can last longer

1935
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:44,640
it's better to keep him in the role of

1936
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:45,840
he is my lover

1937
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:47,880
the partner in my romantic relationship

1938
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:49,680
and interact with him in that role

1939
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:51,720
only if both people

1940
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:53,000
try their best to maintain

1941
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,880
the continuation of passion

1942
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:55,680
can they sustain

1943
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:57,200
the spark of passion

1944
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:58,200
otherwise

1945
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:59,360
the experience of this relationship

1946
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:00,800
won't be the best

1947
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,280
None of us are married yet

1948
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:04,360
how could we know how love eventually turns into family affection

1949
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,960
it's true, a bunch of

1950
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:06,480
right?

1951
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,720
just look at us

1952
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:09,760
a group of kids, what do you know

1953
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:10,560
isn't that right?

1954
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:12,200
these are just our own thoughts

1955
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,880
don't overthink or overinterpret

1956
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:20,400
So, the dates for our six groups

1957
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,680
have all come to an end.

1958
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:22,400
Next,

1959
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:23,320
let's share

1960
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:24,640
about the raw stones, shall we?

1961
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,320
Okay.

1962
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:26,640
You guys have two

1963
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:27,640
already in your hands.

1964
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:29,960
Congratulations!

1965
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:30,480
On our side,

1966
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:30,920
we have nothing.

1967
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,800
Yeah, but I still have more than Hanikezi.

1968
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:33,880
So it's fine.

1969
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:34,840
You don't need any more.

1970
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:38,160
Alright, next

1971
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:39,360
let's take a look

1972
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:41,800
at what happened after their date today

1973
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:42,880
with everyone's heart-fluttering messages

1974
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:43,480
and how they were sent

1975
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:46,440
Do you feel

1976
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,720
that Le Chen's relationship will

1977
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:51,680
send a message to Duo Duo

1978
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:52,680
I think Le Chen

1979
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:53,520
should be

1980
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:54,400
very clear this time

1981
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:54,920
about sending it to Duo Duo

1982
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:55,600
Yes

1983
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:56,880
Chi Chi and Rui Long

1984
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:57,920
I'm shipping them

1985
01:07:58,320 --> 01:07:59,280
I'm with you on this one

1986
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,760
I also really like those two

1987
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,160
Dr. Fang and Xiao Jiao are both

1988
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:04,600
Lan Lan

1989
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:04,880
Right?

1990
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,120
Yes, those two definitely

1991
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:07,920
Do you think Yu Xing will still send one to Yi Fan?

1992
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:09,720
It's just two

1993
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:12,320
different perspectives on love

1994
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:13,040
This conversation

1995
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:13,920
will it still be the same?

1996
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,280
I think it will

1997
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:16,640
because they're just

1998
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,800
discussing different viewpoints

1999
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,840
I think Yi Fan will send one to Yu Xing

2000
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:23,120
but I'm a bit worried about Yu Xing

2001
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:23,840
Me too

2002
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:25,840
This time, we don't have to guess

2003
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:27,280
we'll get the answers directly

2004
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:27,880
First,

2005
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:28,640
let's reveal

2006
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:31,040
all the girls' messages

2007
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:31,880
Please take a look

2008
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,000
Chichi gave hers to Ruilong.

2009
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,120
Wang Jue gave hers to Lechen.

2010
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,760
Duoduo gave hers to Wang Lechen.

2011
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:48,240
Xiaoyuan gave hers to Xiao Jiao.

2012
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:50,400
I think

2013
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,000
it's understandable.

2014
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:52,520
She can't

2015
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:54,480
give it to Lechen every day, right?

2016
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:55,640
Lechen hasn't interacted with her.

2017
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:56,840
Right, they haven't really crossed paths.

2018
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:58,640
We can slow down a bit.

2019
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:00,040
Let's take a look

2020
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:02,560
at all the boys' heart-fluttering messages.

2021
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:07,560
Jiao gave hers to Lu Yuan.

2022
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:09,160
See, they gave to each other.

2023
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:10,160
So you see,

2024
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:12,240
almost everyone gave theirs to the people they met today.

2025
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:13,440
They all gave them to each other.

2026
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:15,040
It's mutual.

2027
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:15,360
Okay.

2028
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:16,560
That makes sense.

2029
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:17,080
It's clear now.

2030
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:18,840
And now, actually,

2031
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:19,520
we can also see

2032
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,560
Lechen's thoughts.

2033
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,640
Because today he had

2034
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:23,440
dates with two girls.

2035
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:24,720
He had

2036
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:25,760
a little date with each.

2037
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:27,600
And his choice was to give it to

2038
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:28,040
Duoduo.

2039
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:28,600
Duoduo.

2040
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:30,520
Let's all look at the content of the messages.

2041
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:31,600
What did they write?

2042
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,000
Happy Children's Day

2043
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:40,440
Actually, I think this Wang Jue

2044
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:41,440
Happy Children's Day

2045
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:42,280
is actually quite

2046
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:43,960
Isn't it a kind of

2047
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:44,680
saying goodbye

2048
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:45,160
It kind of feels

2049
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:46,200
I guess so

2050
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,040
I think it's a bit like

2051
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:47,920
the feeling of saying goodbye

2052
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:49,640
Yeah, it's a very calm

2053
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:50,400
expression

2054
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:50,800
Yeah

2055
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:54,280
I had a great time today

2056
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:55,040
If there's a chance

2057
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,280
I'd like to hear the rest of the story

2058
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:00,880
Thank you for taking care of me all day

2059
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,120
The card holder you made is great

2060
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:03,600
I had a great time today

2061
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:04,800
That's what friends are for

2062
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,400
Thank you for the carefully chosen peony

2063
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:11,320
This is the biggest peony I've ever received

2064
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:12,000
It's really beautiful

2065
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:15,600
Companionship truly is the most lasting confession of love

2066
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:17,760
Chichi (Ke Ailin) for Ruilong

2067
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:18,840
Thank you for the gift and the cake

2068
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:19,560
Next time we can

2069
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:21,960
try cheese hotpot

2070
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:25,280
I'm afraid of spicy food now

2071
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:27,920
I'm not pretending anymore

2072
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:28,680
Yeah, not pretending anymore

2073
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:32,680
Thank you for today's date arrangements

2074
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:34,800
Super fun, super nice, super delicious

2075
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,280
Dr. Fang, you must be really hungry now

2076
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:39,520
Looking forward to the crayfish

2077
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:40,000
Okay

2078
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:43,440
Ruilong

2079
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,720
Thank you for helping me relax today.

2080
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:47,040
That's true.

2081
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:48,200
I sincerely thank you.

2082
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:48,920
I really did relax.

2083
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:50,000
I truly felt relaxed.

2084
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:50,840
Got it.

2085
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,600
I hope there will be more surprises.

2086
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:55,600
Okay.

2087
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,040
Let more happen.

2088
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:57,920
That's nice.

2089
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:58,920
There's something fresh about it.

2090
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:01,840
Alright.

2091
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:03,920
Brother Xing said that to Yifan.

2092
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,600
Today was a very pleasant day.

2093
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,280
I met someone as passionate and sincere as you.

2094
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:09,280
Okay.

2095
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:10,240
So, our first

2096
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:10,880
big date

2097
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:11,760
ends here

2098
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:12,680
and is coming to a close.

2099
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:13,840
So we can see

2100
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:15,120
during this date

2101
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,320
some people

2102
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,080
gradually

2103
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,080
Approaching someone you like

2104
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:19,880
So, some people

2105
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:20,840
are polite and well-mannered

2106
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:22,080
and gain friendship

2107
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:23,680
While some people's signals

2108
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:24,800
might

2109
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:25,920
start to change

2110
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,360
But there's no rush for anything

2111
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:29,000
Everything is just beginning

2112
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,800
Every fluttering signal

2113
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:31,640
is worth us

2114
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:32,920
truly experiencing

2115
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:33,600
In the future

2116
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:34,200
they will still

2117
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,400
have what kind of

2118
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:37,200
heartwarming stories?

2119
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,280
When jasmine blooms, it's a sign of attraction

2120
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:40,440

Goodbye, everyone

01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:08,040
Bye-bye

2135
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:49,280
What does that mean?

2136
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:49,720
What does that mean?

2137
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:50,720
They all received it.

2138
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:51,880
Is this a date?

2139
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:53,680
Here they come.

2140
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:54,560
Who is that?

2141
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:55,280
Is that a newcomer?

2142
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:55,800
Really?

2143
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:57,320
Those legs...

2144
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:00,120
That's so tall.

2145
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:01,960
Hello.

2146
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:02,680
Hello.

2147
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:03,480
Hello.

2148
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:04,640
So all the girls

2149
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:05,880
are having dinner with him alone?

2150
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,000
Five girls meeting one guy.

2151
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:11,600
All the best ingredients are used.

2152
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,120
This vinegar is already very strong.

2153
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:14,320
A new friend has arrived.

2154
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:15,120
So tall.

2155
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:17,080
Such a strong handshake.

2156
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:18,600
Our newcomer checked in late.

2157
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:20,680
He gets the privilege of a special date.

2158
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:21,640
Who will he ask out?

2159
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:24,120
Is there time for a date?

2160
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:24,600
Who?

2161
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:25,600
Who?

2162
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:27,880
Someone opened your mailbox.

2163
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:28,840
Did you know?

2164
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,040
So exciting.

2165
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:31,360
Secret messages of attraction.

2166
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:34,160
Each guest writes down five questions.

2167
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:35,680
If you're curious about him,

2168
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:37,360
you can open his mailbox.

2169
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:39,280
Let's ride our little train together.

2170
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:40,680
Who is that?

2171
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:41,280
Quick, tell me, who is this?

2172
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:42,360
Who is it, really?

2173
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:45,360
Let's go for a walk.

2174
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:46,160
Okay.

2175
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:47,960
You're already starting to boss me around.

2176
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,160
I'm actually being serious.

2177
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,760
The chocolate is so, so sweet.

2178
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:01,800
Here they come.

2179
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:02,960
Hello.

2180
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:03,720
Hello.

2181
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:04,160
Hi, everyone.

2182
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:04,960
I'm Haoyun (Zhang Jin).

2183
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:05,520
Zeng Zhaohao.

2184
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:06,200
Qiqi (Wang Qi).

2185
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:06,680
Tomo (Zhang Haoliang).

2186
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:07,240
Yang Kaiwen.

2187
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:07,920
Zhao Qijun.

2188
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:11,440
It's just like a TV drama.

2189
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:12,440
Chance, chance.

2190
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:13,360
I'm shipping it.

2191
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:14,400
Protected.

2192
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:14,840
Yeah.

2193
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:15,720
It's been six years, right?

2194
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:17,280
There are often so many moments

2195
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:18,200
when we can see in each other's eyes

2196
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:18,800
the stars.

2197
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:19,640
This is love.

2198
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:22,600
Every year when I watch with you, I end up crying.
