00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,600
Wang Lechen

2
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,440
Xu Rulan

3
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,480
Are you from the other island?

4
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,680
They haven't met before.

5
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,440
They haven't met before.

6
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,520
Yes, this is the first time.

7
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,200
There's a sound.

8
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,240
Hello.

9
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,800
There's a seat available here.

10
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,480
My name is Sun Hanqing.

11
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,120
The "Han" from "cultivation."

12
00:00:59,120 --> 00:00:59,840
The "Qing" from "clear water."

13
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,480
You can all call me Chichi.

14
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,840
He's so happy.

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,520
There's a card.

16
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,000
This is always the most exciting moment.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,120
The person who received your gift, please choose someone.

18
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,600
Of the same gender to switch seats with.

19
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:15,640
They laughed.

20
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,520
Then let's switch.

21
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,320
Tell us something you regret.

22
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,000
What is it?

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,040
I sent the message too slowly.

24
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,440
That's pretty obvious.

25
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,400
It's Lanlan (Xu Rulan).

26
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,160
Are you satisfied with your current seat?

27
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,120
Yes, I am.

28
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,960
Because there's someone I want to get to know.

29
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,960
Sitting next to me.

30
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,360
We can talk about our jobs.

31
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,320
Today we can finally ask.

32
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,480
I really want to know.

33
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,200
Here it comes.

34
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:38,560
I'm really looking forward to it.

35
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,360
We can find out about the jobs now.

36
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,040
We can talk about our professions.

37
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,920
Today we’re finally allowed to ask.

38
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,800
At last.

39
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,120
Now it’s time to talk about jobs.

40
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,840
I really want to know.

41
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,720
I think my job might be something everyone will

42
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,400
never guess.

43
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,880
Is it cosmetics?

44
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,000
Are you a designer?

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,960
Do you work in

46
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,640
fashion?

47
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,600
No.

48
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,600
Guess again.

49
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,080
I can’t figure it out.

50
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,440
What you mentioned before,

51
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,760
something related to medicine?

52
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,440
Yes.

53
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,560
I’m apprenticing at a traditional Chinese medicine hospital.

54
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,560
I’m studying acupuncture.

55
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,360
I never would have guessed.

56
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,640
I’m apprenticing at a traditional Chinese medicine hospital.

57
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,480
I’m studying acupuncture.

58
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:02,880
That’s impressive.

59
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,400
That’s a direction I never expected.

60
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,480
You really can’t tell.

61
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,480
This profession hasn’t come up before.

62
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,480
No, it hasn’t.

63
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,680
Right, it’s never appeared on “Signal of the Heart” before.

64
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,560
Traditional Chinese acupuncture.

65
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,120
That’s so unique.

66
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,080
That’s beautiful.

67
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,320
When you’re truly dedicated to your work,

68
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,120
you really shine.

69
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,640
Awesome

70
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,480
That's awesome

71
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,200
Bonus points

72
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,320
It really adds a lot of points

73
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,920
So why did you want to

74
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,000
work in the medical field

75
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,440
Because in the past couple of years, around me

76
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,360
many friends

77
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,480
and also some

78
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,560
older relatives have

79
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,600
had health issues

80
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,360
So I would

81
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,480
feel that getting into the health industry earlier

82
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,200
would be very helpful for myself and those around me

83
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,560
It would be a big help

84
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,160
Yeah

85
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,640
Impressive

86
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,040
Yeah

87
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,840
That's right

88
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,520
Really

89
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,600
I work at a watch company

90
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,760
and I do

91
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,720
audit and IT

92
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,880
audit and information technology

93
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,200
Audit department, what?

94
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,160
Audit department and IT

95
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,120
Information technology

96
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:12,880
Audit

97
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,880
That's very meticulous

98
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,760
This job hasn't come up before

99
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,200
This time the job is really unique

100
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,520
So cool

101
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,360
This is so cool.

102
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,680
It really is cool.

103
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,400
And I was born in 2000.

104
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,800
Born in 2000.

105
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,240
That's why I'm called Ruilong.

106
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,320
I was born in the Year of the Dragon.

107
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,360
It all makes sense now.

108
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,560
So he was born in the Year of the Dragon.

109
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,360
That's why he's called Ruilong.

110
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:54,880
The year 2000.

111
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,800
That's how my mom chose the name.

112
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,880
Born in Switzerland.

113
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,800
And in the Year of the Dragon.

114
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,440
A Chinese dragon in Switzerland.

115
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,480
That's really cool.

116
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,400
So cool.

117
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,720
Your name sounds really nice.

118
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:07,640
It's easy to remember.

119
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,360
It also has a great meaning.

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,640
Yes.

121
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,080
It's also very unique.

122
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,760
I work at an internet company.

123
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,520
We provide services for businesses.

124
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,000
Client manager.

125
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,120
It's similar to a client consultant.

126
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,120
Like client consulting and such.

127
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,120
Consultant.

128
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,440
That's pretty cool.

129
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,880
Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng) is actually very capable.

130
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,360
He probably does really well at work too.

131
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,000
Feels like whatever he wants to do,

132
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,120
he can do it really well.

133
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,200
Serious.

134
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,920
Over there

135
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,480
I am

136
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,440
currently doing

137
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,000
cross-border clothing export

138
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,480
cross-border clothing

139
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,520
starting a business like this

140
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,400
And I've always been working as a model

141
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,040
She's also a model

142
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,480
model

143
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,040
You can tell

144
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,520
So slim

145
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,440
You can see it

146
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,160
starting a cross-border clothing export business

147
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,200
It's just

148
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:20,800
going global

149
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,680
beautiful woman

150
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,960
so beautiful

151
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,800
radiating confidence

152
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,760
indeed

153
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,960
so thin

154
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,080
too thin

155
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,440
Lu Yuan

156
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,120
Xiao Yuan (Lu Yuan)

157
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,160
I haven't graduated yet

158
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,640
I majored in English for my undergraduate

159
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,480
I'm studying law for my master's

160
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,120
because

161
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,680
afterwards

162
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,000
I want to combine English and law

163
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,160
Maybe I'll become an international lawyer

164
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,200
Yes

165
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,640
So cool

166
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,480
twenty-two years old

167
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,080
She's only twenty-two

168
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,880
Yes

169
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,320
Xiao Yuan (Lu Yuan) is very young

170
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,320
but has a lot of ideas

171
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,360
Female lawyer

172
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,360
So impressive

173
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,120
Very smart

174
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,640
That's great

175
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,920
Excellent

176
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,240
Are you on vacation now?

177
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,320
No, I'm preparing for graduation

178
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,320
I might have my thesis defense in about a week

179
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,360
Graduation defense

180
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,080
Yes, there might be one night

181
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,360
when I'm not in the cabin

182
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,560
Xiaoyuan (Lu Yuan) is the youngest

183
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,000
Yes, I was born in December 2002

184
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,080
That's so young

185
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,360
You already talked about this just now, right?

186
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,680
I was born in 1998, you too?

187
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,280
I'm also from 1998.

188
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:07,840
Yeah.

189
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,360
And then,

190
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,920
I'm from 2001.

191
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,480
To be honest,

192
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,000
I feel like

193
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,560
there's still some

194
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,200
overlap between our industries.

195
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,720
You all work in foreign-related fields,

196
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,240
right?

197
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,480
That's true.

198
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,440
Yeah, aren't you doing

199
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,240
cross-border

200
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,080
e-commerce?

201
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,600
Yeah.

202
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,080
So what was your major in college?

203
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,520
My major was German.

204
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,920
German.

205
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,640
Our majors are quite similar.

206
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:31,680
So,

207
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,560
what does that make me?

208
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,560
I'm the odd one out here.

209
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,200
Yeah, your major is really different from ours.

210
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,000
So your future has nothing to do with me?

211
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,000
You don't need people like us

212
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
in the health industry?

213
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,400
That's so cute.

214
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,720
Because today, as I was sitting at the table,

215
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,760
I suddenly realized

216
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,040
it's really like two separate islands,

217
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,560
with the boys and girls completely swapped.

218
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,440
Right?

219
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,760
Because on your side,

220
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,880
all the girls went over.

221
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,400
And on our side, all the boys went over.

222
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,680
It's all fate.

223
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,600
Can we

224
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,000
reveal our ages and professions now?

225
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,440
Here we go.

226
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,080
Here we go.

227
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,800
I'm really looking forward to this.

228
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,280
Lanlan (Xu Rulan)

229
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,760
Then let's start with you.

230
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,320
Jin Yuxing

231
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:22,920
Yiwu

232
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,800
I guess you were born in 1997.

233
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,080
Yes, 1997.

234
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,600
Xu Rulan

235
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,560
Guess what?

236
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,280
She's usually very accurate.

237
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,360
I feel like Yiwu should be pretty easy to guess.

238
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,120
Foreign trade.

239
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,280
Factory.

240
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,040
Goods.

241
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,320
Do you sell

242
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,880
your own brand?

243
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,800
Yes, we have our own brand.

244
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,080
I guess shoes.

245
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,600
No.

246
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,000
Pets?

247
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,000
No.

248
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,800
It's something very common.

249
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,680
Something you would also find in this room.

250
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,480
Bowls and chopsticks?

251
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,560
Cups?

252
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,520
Tableware?

253
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,520
Teacups?

254
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,240
Sofa?

255
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,360
Furniture?

256
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,000
Furniture is possible too.

257
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,840
Furniture is usually from Foshan, right?

258
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,120
Appliances?

259
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,240
A bit of appliances.

260
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,680
A bit of appliances.

261
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,760
Hair dryer?

262
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,280
Yes, hair dryer.

263
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,840
How did you guess hair dryer?

264
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,680
How did you figure that out?

265
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,720
Is it because of his hairstyle?

266
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,880
No.

267
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,920
We are brand agents for small home appliances.

268
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,720
And we also deal in some general merchandise.

269
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,400
A trading company.

270
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,880
I never would have guessed that.

271
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,800
Impressive.

272
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,320
Businessman.

273
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,480
So you’re an OEM factory?

274
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,320
We’re not an OEM factory.

275
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,200
We are

276
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,160
distributors.

277
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,480
If I had known, I just moved.

278
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,440
I would have asked you for some things.

279
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,840
Okay.

280
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,560
That's really funny.

281
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,280
Next.

282
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:38,960
You.

283
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,840
What is Wang Yifan's profession?

284
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,440
It's hard to guess.

285
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,560
I guess you...

286
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,040
Born in 1999 or 2000.

287
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,600
You can guess again.

288
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,160
1998.

289
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,280
2002.

290
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,600
So she's very young.

291
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,200
Then how come you're so...

292
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,400
...mature in your thinking?

293
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,320
Wise beyond your years.

294
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,200
Maybe it's because you've worked at your company for a long time.

295
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,160
Company.

296
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,760
Your job.

297
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,440
You tell me.

298
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,520
The schedule is very strict.

299
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,120
Is it a TV station?

300
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,040
Host

301
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,280
Is there a hint?

302
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,840
Yes, give us a hint.

303
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,880
Speaking role

304
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,600
Speaking role

305
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,600
Radio

306
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,320
No

307
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:28,880
Podcast

308
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,680
Weather forecast

309
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,680
Commentary

310
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,000
A little bit

311
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,320
Close

312
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,800
Commentary

313
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,080
Soccer

314
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,400
Game

315
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,440
Commentary related to what?

316
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,120
Just guess something related to that

317
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,560
Science

318
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,440
History

319
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,480
Humanities

320
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,320
You can narrow down your guess

321
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,480
How do you guess this?

322
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,280
Historical artifacts

323
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,480
You’re from a museum

324
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,480
Commentary

325
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,560
Explanation

326
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,120
This profession hasn’t appeared before

327
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,080
So unique

328
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,760
So impressive

329
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,200
This profession is really unique

330
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,520
It really is impressive

331
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,440
So cool.

332
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,120
The light of art.

333
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,920
It leads to a reverence for nature.

334
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,280
Including aesthetic judgments in daily life.

335
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,840
This is a profession that hasn't existed before.

336
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,120
No.

337
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,360
This is new.

338
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,840
Excellent.

339
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,600
Bonus points.

340
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,320
Then you need to have a wealth of

341
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,520
knowledge

342
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,560
accumulated.

343
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:49,960
That's right.

344
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:50,920
Really.

345
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,880
What does that museum mainly display?

346
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,880
What types

347
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,760
of exhibits?

348
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,760
Right now, the Egyptian exhibition is very popular.

349
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:58,760
I've seen the Egyptian exhibition.

350
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,520
I've seen the Egyptian exhibition.

351
00:13:59,520 --> 00:13:59,560
I've seen the Egyptian exhibition.

352
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,480
That Egyptian exhibition

353
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,520
is amazing.

354
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,880
The whole

355
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,840
style

356
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,120
and design

357
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,000
are incredibly diverse.

358
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
So, accumulating knowledge

359
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,840
must be very thorough.

360
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,840
Right now, the Egyptian exhibition is very popular.

361
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:14,960
The Egyptian exhibition.

362
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,240
I've heard of it.

363
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,360
That's impressive.

364
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,280
It's time for Sun Hanqing to eat.

365
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,440
Eat, Sun Hanqing.

366
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,920
Let's guess your age first.

367
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,760
2000.

368
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,720
That accurate?

369
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,560
Yes.

370
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,440
Born in 2000.

371
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,840
I guess you work for a foreign company.

372
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:39,960
No.

373
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,200
Something cultural?

374
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,280
No.

375
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,320
I studied advertising in graduate school.

376
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,280
Advertising planning.

377
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,120
Simply put, I sell toilets.

378
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,360
I work in e-commerce for a bathroom brand.

379
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,480
Management trainee.

380
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,920
Let millions of users enjoy

381
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,120
convenient and healthy

382
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,680
and comfortable bathroom experiences.

383
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,280
Bathroom products.

384
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,800
And Yiwu hair dryers.

385
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,400
Your bathroom must be

386
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,240
top-notch.

387
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,080
That's great.

388
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,760
My family is also in the building materials business.

389
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:47,800
So,

390
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,120
the bathroom products you mentioned

391
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,680
I've been around them since I was a kid.

392
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,000
So you're "AAA Building Materials Brother Wang."

393
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,960
So you're "AAA Building Materials Brother Wang."

394
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,200
Yes, "AAA Building Materials Boss Wang."

395
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:14,640
You

396
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,320
Come

397
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,280
You guys guess the age first

398
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,800
I don't think it's very young

399
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:20,600
Right

400
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,160
1998, 1997

401
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,040
Age, 1998

402
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,960
1997

403
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,840
1998

404
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,480
Do you make your own

405
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,760
brands or

406
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,400
No

407
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,000
No

408
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,360
Where are you

409
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,040
Hangzhou

410
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,480
Hangzhou

411
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,960
Then can I ask first

412
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,720
What did you major in

413
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,880
Music

414
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,920
Music production

415
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,680
Music production

416
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,920
Music production

417
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,160
So you are

418
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,040
a producer

419
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,520
So you're a singer

420
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:54,960
Thank you

421
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,280
Completely unrelated

422
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,440
I feel a bit offended

423
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,400
Why

424
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,480
I sing terribly

425
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,480
Sing one

426
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,200
Has nothing to do with my major

427
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,880
Completely unrelated

428
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,520
So hard

429
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,720
Right now I

430
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,240
am at a

431
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,280
environmental technology company

432
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,240
doing branding

433
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,320
We mainly make wastewater purification equipment

434
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,760
and waste incineration equipment

435
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,720
Is the contrast always this big?

436
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,800
That's quite a leap.

437
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,280
A music major doing this?

438
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,640
I really didn't expect that.

439
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,040
That's so cool.

440
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,520
This is also a big contrast.

441
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,240
Impressive.

442
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,240
So you've been working for many years.

443
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,160
Yes.

444
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,960
I've been working.

445
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,160
I graduated in 2020.

446
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,200
When you graduated, I was just starting school.

447
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,640
Don't say that, it makes me feel old.

448
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,400
Age gap.

449
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,200
Lanlan (Xu Rulan)

450
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,680
Take a guess.

451
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,280
Everyone,

452
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:37,880
1997.

453
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,240
After 2000.

454
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,720
It can't be 2000.

455
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,680
1998.

456
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:42,760
1998.

457
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:43,880
No.

458
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,000
1999.

459
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,320
That's right.

460
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,280
1999.

461
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,760
Did any of you guess it?

462
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,440
Lanlan's (Xu Rulan's) profession.

463
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,560
Can't guess.

464
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,360
No way to guess.

465
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,480
But I think she does

466
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,160
something that involves people.

467
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,600
A job that deals with people.

468
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,600
Really?

469
00:18:59,600 --> 00:18:59,920
So I think

470
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,080
human resources is possible.

471
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,320
What's your major?

472
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,360
Did I mention it before?

473
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,840
I can't reveal my major right now.

474
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,000
Because the job I'm doing now

475
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,200
is related to my major.

476
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,480
Is it closely related?

477
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,160
Yes.

478
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,720
Human resources?

479
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,680
I think that's possible.

480
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,360
Finance?

481
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:19,800
No.

482
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,120
What is it then?

483
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,080
I really can't guess.

484
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,160
Design?

485
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,080
Design?

486
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,480
Is it design?

487
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,560
Which field?

488
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,840
Fashion?

489
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,800
Interior design?

490
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,600
No.

491
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,400
Architectural design?

492
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,400
Architectural design?

493
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,840
I do architectural landscape design.

494
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,720
I really didn't expect that.

495
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,960
And what I do is

496
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,160
project management and follow-up for civil engineering.

497
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,600
So you work at XCMG.

498
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,520
That's the same as Wang Lechen.

499
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,120
You both have to go to construction sites.

500
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,080
That's impressive.

501
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,200
This was really hard to guess.

502
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,760
I couldn't have imagined it.

503
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,920
That's quite a twist.

504
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,440
You look like such a gentle, soft girl.

505
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,280
Yeah.

506
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,800
Completely doesn't match.

507
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,840
Can't guess at all.

508
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,120
Really, yes.

509
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:28,880
I think so too.

510
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:33,920
I just mentioned construction.

511
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:34,600
Right.

512
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,800
"Boss Wang from Building Materials"

513
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,800
Building materials.

514
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,320
Building materials.

515
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,800
"Boss Wang from AAA Building Materials"

516
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,360
Teacher Fang (Fang Yijiong)

517
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,640
Teacher.

518
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,560
Eyesight isn't very good.

519
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,960
Eyesight isn't very good.

520
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,000
Can go.

521
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,680
Take a look.

522
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,240
Then I am considered...

523
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,320
When I went to the hospital...

524
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,360
Sorry.

525
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,200
He.

526
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,320
Ophthalmology.

527
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,200
Ophthalmologist.

528
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,040
We know.

529
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,440
Yes.

530
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,200
At that time, I could...

531
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,360
Feel something.

532
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,600
Feels like a doctor.

533
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,040
Dr. Fang.

534
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,320
He thought, so fast?

535
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,600
Fang Yijiong, you are a doctor.

536
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,240
You are a doctor.

537
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,840
Is a doctor.

538
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,360
Ophthalmologist.

539
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:36,600
Indeed.

540
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,160
Look.

541
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,480
Ophthalmologist.

542
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,320
Really?

543
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,480
Yes.

544
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,200
Really?

545
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,080
Really.

546
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,800
Twenty-nine years old

547
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,160
Okay

548
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,440
No wonder he's so meticulous

549
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,840
Yeah, meticulous

550
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,000
Feels like everyone could

551
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,520
star in their own show

552
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,720
Makes me want to go see it

553
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,120
So that's why he had you look at eyes

554
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,440
He even gave you that little night light

555
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:28,920
Yeah

556
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,520
It's all eyes

557
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,880
There are eyes everywhere

558
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,040
It's so obvious

559
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,840
Way too obvious

560
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,880
Now there's a place to look at eyes in the future

561
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,240
So my laser eye surgery

562
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,360
can I let you do it?

563
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,400
Me?

564
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,640
In a few years

565
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,800
In a few years

566
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,040
Let me practice on you first

567
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,280
So how many years have you been working?

568
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,360
Up to now, I have

569
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,560
(studied medicine) for almost eleven years.

570
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,320
Eleven years.

571
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,280
That long?

572
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,560
You're revealing your age.

573
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,280
Teacher Fang (Fang Yijiong)

574
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,880
Twenty-nine years old, eleven years.

575
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,920
Started at eighteen.

576
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,760
Eighteen years old.

577
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,040
What year was that?

578
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,000
Take a guess.

579
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,600
Nineteen ninety-six.

580
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,200
Nineteen ninety-five.

581
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,000
Nineteen ninety-five.

582
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:18,760
Nineteen ninety-five.

583
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,200
The oldest one here.

584
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,360
That's impressive.

585
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:21,760
Dr. Fang.

586
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,360
From now on, don't call him Teacher Fang or Xiao Fang.

587
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,280
Call him Dr. Fang.

588
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:24,800
Dr. Fang.

589
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,720
Xiao Fang.

590
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,760
Dr. Fang.

591
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,040
She has such a sweet smile.

592
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,240
After he said he was a doctor,

593
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,680
Look at his shirt.

594
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,040
It's so professional.

595
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,080
It's like there's a filter on him now.

596
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,120
That professional aura is definitely there.

597
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,120
Just now we shared

598
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,200
so many different professions.

599
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:41,760
What does everyone think,

600
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,440
whose contrast is the most surprising?

601
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,640
A lot of people have quite a big contrast.

602
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,000
No.

603
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,320
Basically, none of them are without contrast.

604
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:48,800
Right.

605
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,480
I think this year,

606
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,120
starting from

607
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,200
when someone mentioned

608
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,800
being an acupuncture apprentice,

609
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,000
I was already a bit surprised.

610
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,880
If you ask me about Lanlan (Xu Rulan)'s profession,

611
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,760
even if you gave me ten chances, I wouldn't guess it.

612
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,240
Yeah.

613
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,200
And she's so gentle, too.

614
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,640
You just can't imagine her going to a construction site

615
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,720
or working on projects like that

616
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,760
—it just doesn't fit.

617
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,600
Exactly.

618
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,200
And also that one you like to watch,

619
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:05,880
the tour guide.

620
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,280
Yes.

621
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,160
That tour guide

622
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,080
was also unexpected.

623
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,360
It's such a unique

624
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,600
profession.

625
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,080
And also,

626
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,280
wastewater treatment.

627
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,120
Right.

628
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,480
Wang Lechen's job,

629
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,200
wastewater treatment,

630
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,760
how could we ever guess that?

631
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,200
This time

632
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:17,880
still

633
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,680
are all closely related to our lives

634
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,760
professions that are closely connected

635
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,400
just like the one we mentioned earlier

636
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,120
Dr. Fang (Fang Yijiong)

637
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:22,480
is also

638
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:23,480
Dr. Fang (Fang Yijiong)

639
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:23,840
really is

640
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,840
as soon as he said he was a doctor

641
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,560
his shirt no longer looked like just a shirt

642
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,680
it became a symbol of professionalism

643
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,600
like in our trailer

644
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,280
when he said, "Why don't you get your eyes checked?"

645
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,320
that sentence

646
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,080
is just a very ordinary thing for him to say

647
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:35,960
in daily life

648
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,600
why are you being so intense

649
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,080
these comments

650
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,520
should quiet down now

651
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,640
We're done eating, let's clean up

652
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,840
Right, I also bought a cake

653
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,440
I just remembered

654
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,280
That's great

655
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,120
It's my favorite

656
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,320
Is it your birthday

657
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,160
today?

658
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,960
I think it's the first day of the house

659
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,960
so it's the house's birthday

660
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,840
The house is having a birthday

661
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,720
It feels so ceremonial

662
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,120
So cute.

663
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,400
Let's eat cake.

664
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,920
Duoduo (Ke Ailin)

665
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,680
Everyone, come eat together.

666
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,360
The cake Chichi (Sun Hanqing) brought.

667
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,960
Okay, we're tidying up over here.

668
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,400
We're done tidying up.

669
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,760
I'll ask them to come over and have cake together.

670
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,280
Okay.

671
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,320
Today is their

672
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,200
first time meeting (moving in).

673
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:27,800
So Chichi (Sun Hanqing)

674
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,720
prepared for everyone

675
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,680
a birthday for Xiaowu's

676
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,400
birthday cake.

677
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,800
I was just about to ask who Xiaowu is.

678
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,960
Xiaowu is

679
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,000
Xiao Jiao's (Jiao Zhiheng) friend.

680
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,480
Sorry, I'm really cold.

681
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,560
Xiao Fang's (Fang Yijiong) colleague.

682
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,800
It's okay.

683
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,920
So I'm really curious.

684
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,240
I know.

685
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,840
About Teacher Xiao Fang's (Fang Yijiong) job.

686
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,440
I'm curious about both of your jobs.

687
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,000
I guess Wang Lechen is probably

688
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,440
probably is

689
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,800
We're just chatting, do you want to join?

690
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,480
Sure

691
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,680
I'm guessing Wang Lechen's age

692
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:28,880
Thirty

693
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,200
Close

694
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,280
Thirty, born in 1995

695
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,280
Why?

696
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,360
Why can't it be thirty?

697
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,160
Let me guess

698
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,760
1998

699
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,000
What are you doing?

700
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,480
What are you doing?

701
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,000
Are you saying that's old?

702
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,080
Saying it's young

703
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,880
Saying it's young

704
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,600
Is Xiaoyuan (Lu Yuan) still in school?

705
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,040
How did you know?

706
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,000
I guessed

707
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Yes

708
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,960
What was your original major?

709
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,080
My original major was English

710
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,720
Then I studied law in graduate school

711
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,440
Graduate school was law

712
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:01,880
That's right

713
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,520
Law

714
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,720
I switched majors

715
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,480
Because in the future I want to

716
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,200
Then I won't mess with you

717
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:08,680
Sorry

718
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,600
Be careful

719
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,080
Should this trash be thrown outside?

720
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,280
Yes

721
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,200
Where did you throw your trash?

722
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,200
It's here.

723
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,120
I couldn't find a trash can outside.

724
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,960
It's hidden so well.

725
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,480
Give it to me.

726
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,280
Let's go together.

727
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,680
Just leave it here for now.

728
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,640
So why did you choose to study law?

729
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,760
It seems really hard.

730
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,760
Because I wanted to

731
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,840
find a major with a higher entry threshold.

732
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,720
A major.

733
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,480
Because I think

734
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,520
English might not

735
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,440
be that easy to find a job with in the future.

736
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,600
So I thought

737
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,560
about changing direction.

738
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,480
So you

739
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,520
I think it takes a lot of courage to choose this.

740
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,520
Of course.

741
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,960
That's impressive.

742
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,080
You're such a top student.

743
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,040
Of course.

744
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,680
Xiaoyuan (Lu Yuan)

745
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,240
Xiaoyuan (Lu Yuan)

746
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,040
Very thoughtful.

747
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,520
But actually, nowadays lawyers

748
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,280
don't seem to be especially

749
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,040
Yeah, it's not that easy to find a job either.

750
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,880
So I want to

751
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,840
combine my undergraduate and graduate studies.

752
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,720
That way you can work on international cases, right?

753
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,600
Working on international cases is a bit better.

754
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,080
That's pretty good.

755
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,880
Impressive.

756
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,040
I might also be in

757
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,560
Shanghai in the future.

758
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:44,960
Thank you.

759
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,480
In Shanghai or maybe in Beijing.

760
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,240
Definitely.

761
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,800
Puppy.

762
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,880
It's really so well-behaved.

763
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,800
Puppy.

764
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,560
Has it been walked today?

765
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,040
No.

766
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,400
Do you want to walk the dog?

767
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,720
I did.

768
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,360
Go ahead.

769
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,480
This is an invitation for a date.

770
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,960
Sure.

771
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:15,880
It's important.

772
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,120
Actually, it's needed right now.

773
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,200
At times like this, animals are just...

774
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,440
Little animals really help.

775
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,160
Right?

776
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,400
Right.

777
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,320
Okay.

778
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,480
Okay.

779
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:26,960
Let's go.

780
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,880
I'll get a leash.

781
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,800
Nicole.

782
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,280
Found something to do together.

783
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,960
Yeah, having a pet at times like this is great.

784
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,320
It's an excuse.

785
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,480
Let me put one on for you.

786
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,000
Let's go.

787
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,240
Alright.

788
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,360
Let's go.

789
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,720
Let's go.

790
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,000
Your butt is really cute.

791
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,760
Butt.

792
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,920
Isn't it a big contrast?

793
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,720
I want to ask.

794
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,000
Um...

795
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,560
Where's Xiaoyuan (Lu Yuan)?

796
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,800
Who?

797
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,160
Who?

798
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,320
Where's Xiaoyuan (Lu Yuan)?

799
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:11,840
Can't find them.

800
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,200
Who?

801
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,000
Who?

802
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,560
Xiaoyuan (Lu Yuan).

803
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,640
Xiaoyuan (Lu Yuan) went out on a date.

804
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,760
We can't find our team member.

805
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,120
I wonder if she might be...

806
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,120
...walking the dog.

807
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,600
I want to walk the dog too.

808
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,600
They're all gone.

809
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,840
Went to walk the dog.

810
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,160
Who went to walk the dog?

811
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:28,920
Jiao Zhiheng.

812
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,120
It should be Jiao Zhiheng.

813
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:30,800
Jiao Zhiheng.

814
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,440
No.

815
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,240
Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng) is right here.

816
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,800
It's Wang Lechen.

817
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,600
Who else besides Xiaoyuan (Lu Yuan)?

818
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:38,800
I forgot.

819
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,120
Can't match the names.

820
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:41,920
Then should we just go?

821
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,600
Or...

822
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,240
Should we ask if they want to go?

823
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,680
Let's go out for a bit.

824
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,040
Which way do you want to go?

825
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,720
That way or the other way?

826
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,960
Okay.

827
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,880
It needs to find a place

828
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,880
to poop.

829
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,120
I said it needs to find a place to poop.

830
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,200
This dog

831
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,280
is really strong.

832
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,240
The leash is almost broken.

833
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,560
I said you two should walk slower.

834
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,280
So it's Yuan Yuan (Lu Yuan).

835
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,360
Look at her now,

836
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,560
she doesn't have that

837
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,520
cold medicine incident anymore.

838
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:11,840
Yeah.

839
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,880
Now it's completely

840
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,600
Wang Lechen.

841
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:15,960
Very good.

842
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,360
When you chose rooms yesterday,

843
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:30,920
how did you choose?

844
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,800
Did you guys...

845
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,520
Yeah, I want to know too.

846
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,760
How did they choose rooms?

847
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,720
Actually, I was the third to choose.

848
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,520
I chose the 8-2 floor.

849
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,320
Because of my birthday.

850
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,480
They chose by themselves.

851
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,040
At the time, I thought you two were

852
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:52,520
on the first floor of (Huaniao Island)

853
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,880
scared off by us

854
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,800
No

855
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,320
When I made the third choice

856
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,360
actually

857
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,360
I just picked randomly

858
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,080
because I saw 8-2

859
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,160
isn't that my birthday number?

860
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,320
so I chose it

861
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,800
Your birthday is August 2nd?

862
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,600
Yes

863
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,760
Walking the dog like this will naturally

864
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,360
bring two people closer

865
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,680
After you finish studying law

866
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,160
don't you still have to take that exam?

867
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,480
Yes, the lawyer's (qualification certificate)

868
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,640
After you pass that exam

869
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,720
actually, you still have to start from

870
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,400
finding an internship first

871
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:23,920
Yes

872
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,960
That's also hard to find

873
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,400
Yes

874
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,960
You have to work your way up step by step as a lawyer

875
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,080
Can your temperament and personality handle that?

876
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,840
You really need that kind of patience

877
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,560
I'm a very impatient person

878
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,680
Yeah

879
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,280
Anyway, learning more is always good

880
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,200
It's still good for yourself

881
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,240
You're really bold, then

882
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,440
Right?

883
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,840
Completely self-taught.

884
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,400
Completely self-taught.

885
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,440
Because I switched majors.

886
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,480
So you have to

887
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,800
go to that school.

888
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,040
You definitely have to study on your own.

889
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,360
So after you graduated from college,

890
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,080
did you go straight to work?

891
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,360
Yes, I first went to

892
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,360
intern at China News Service.

893
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,080
I worked as an editorial intern.

894
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,040
So you didn't at all

895
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,880
work in your field of study?

896
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,400
Right, not at all.

897
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,320
I think this is all

898
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,000
the best arrangement.

899
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,720
Who knows?

900
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,080
You know,

901
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,040
if I hadn't met

902
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,760
some of the people

903
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,080
I know now, right?

904
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,960
I wouldn't be who I am today.

905
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,720
That's true.

906
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,040
The two of us are very relaxed and natural.

907
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,080
And the atmosphere here is great too.

908
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,080
You walk really slowly.

909
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,480
Its legs are naturally short.

910
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,600
And you still tease it.

911
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,000
Be careful, it might "sue" you.

912
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,960
Sue me?

913
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,120
I actually studied law.

914
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,160
You want to sue me?

915
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,720
Also, I feel like its

916
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,480
walking speed is now in sync with the dog.

917
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,040
It doesn't keep rushing forward anymore.

918
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,760
It's become more sensible.

919
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,600
So the two of them

920
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,960
have more chances to chat.

921
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,360
And whenever a pet shows up,

922
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,920
it really feels like daily life.

923
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,720
Right?

924
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,960
It instantly makes the atmosphere even more

925
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,200
like a little date.

926
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,040
There's a third party involved,

927
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,520
but it can't understand human language.

928
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,440
Perfect.

929
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,000
That's why a lot of people

930
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,080
create groups

931
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:05,720
to walk their dogs together.

932
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,880
Some end up as couples while walking.

933
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,200
Yeah, they met while walking their dogs.

934
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,160
And as they keep walking,

935
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,880
the two of them just

936
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,320
stroll around together, and it's really nice.

937
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,960
How about we take a walk around?

938
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,800
Let's go.

939
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,120
Hello.

940
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,840
Hello.

941
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,960
Finished walking?

942
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,920
Yeah, finished.

943
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,640
All done.

944
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,960
Did you miss me, baby?

945
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,160
You got walked, didn't you?

946
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,600
You got walked, right?

947
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,200
It's so happy.

948
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,600
It's always looking forward to going out.

949
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:50,680
I'm tired.

950
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,120
I'm tired.

951
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,560
Why did it walk off by itself?

952
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,720
I'm so anxious.

953
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,680
It said it didn't enjoy the walk.

954
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,240
I'm leaving.

955
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,960
Let's go out for another walk.

956
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,840
Let's go.

957
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,160
Go inside.

958
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,240
Is it hungry?

959
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,800
We walked for a while.

960
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,840
But it only peed.

961
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,000
Chichi (Sun Hanqing) left something for you two.

962
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,560
Left some cake.

963
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,000
Do you want to go eat?

964
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,520
I don't eat sweets.

965
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,720
I still have to write my diary.

966
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,680
Have to write the diary after the walk.

967
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,040
Yeah.

968
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,320
Then go write it.

969
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,520
There's even that?

970
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,640
You didn't even say anything about walking the dog.

971
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,120
Duoduo (Ke Ailin) is more proactive.

972
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,120
And very straightforward.

973
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,040
A bit possessive now.

974
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,600
Didn't even mention walking the dog.

975
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,880
Can we not write the diary?

976
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,080
We can write it.

977
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,120
We still have to write it.

978
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,880
For example, write that the dog peed today.

979
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,800
And how many steps it took, right?

980
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,640
How many steps it took.

981
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,320
Where do we have to write the diary?

982
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,040
Do we really have to write it?

983
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,240
What diary?

984
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,880
Look at that list.

985
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,160
Record outings and stick them on the record wall.

986
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,960
Did you two take one of these?

987
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,600
No.

988
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,480
Then each of you take one.

989
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,000
Write it down later.

990
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,720
Write what?

991
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,560
Write what?

992
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,880
Write how many steps it walked.

993
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,520
Write how many times it peed.

994
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,040
You write it down.

995
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,240
Nicole.

996
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,400
Come here, Nicole.

997
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,360
Feels like she's jealous.

998
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,920
She's jealous.

999
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,400
Very extroverted.

1000
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,120
Super extroverted.

1001
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,160
She's really a typical

1002
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,040
extrovert.

1003
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,600
She has to say everything out loud.

1004
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,320
You go write it.

1005
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,440
Aren't you the one walking the dog?

1006
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,880
Always chattering.

1007
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,240
Has to talk about everything.

1008
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,240
She just can't keep anything to herself, you know?

1009
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:27,720
Yeah.

1010
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,600
That's actually really good.

1011
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,640
She doesn't bottle things up.

1012
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,400
That's pretty good.

1013
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,640
Yeah, she can't hide anything.

1014
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,800
Her energy and blood must flow smoothly.

1015
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,200
She has plenty of energy.

1016
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,800
She studies traditional Chinese medicine.

1017
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,640
She gives herself acupuncture.

1018
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,680
Go ahead and write.

1019
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,040
Write what?

1020
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,360
I brought you some paper.

1021
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,440
Where's the paper?

1022
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:43,920
It's down there.

1023
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,040
The one underneath.

1024
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,600
This one?

1025
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,640
Nicole.

1026
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,160
Pee-pee.

1027
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,920
Only Nicole might have peed once.

1028
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,160
Come on, let's go out for a walk.

1029
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:03,640
Okay.

1030
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,160
Are you happy?

1031
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,240
The three of us are surrounding you.

1032
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,720
See, she'll really say anything.

1033
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,520
Yeah.

1034
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,840
"Slotted spoon."

1035
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:16,960
Are you happy?

1036
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,080
The three of us are surrounding you.

1037
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:19,800
So happy.

1038
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,680
Because all three of us ate

1039
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,000
your giant river prawns.

1040
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,600
And now we have to go running, right?

1041
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,240
Your giant river prawns.

1042
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,520
You put too much wasabi.

1043
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,320
No, not too much.

1044
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,400
It was too much.

1045
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,200
Dodo (Ke Ailin) is still always

1046
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,000
pretty straightforward, I feel.

1047
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,440
So it wasn't just me.

1048
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,200
No one brought their suitcase upstairs.

1049
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,480
So every morning I can

1050
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,760
slide down from upstairs.

1051
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,680
Yes.

1052
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,120
Okay, so this is the room tour.

1053
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,560
8103.

1054
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,360
Alright, everyone,

1055
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,080
Cupids,

1056
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,280
the first deduction of this season is about to begin.

1057
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,200
For this deduction,

1058
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,360
we'll be working as a team.

1059
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,520
If we answer correctly,

1060
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,400
for each correct match,

1061
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,440
we can earn

1062
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,160
one of our

1063
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,160
Heart Stones.

1064
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,680
So for this deduction,

1065
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,320
we can earn up to

1066
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,040
eleven

1067
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,120
Heart Stones.

1068
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,280
All the Heart Stones we earn

1069
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:56,840
we can

1070
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,880
distribute them

1071
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,160
among ourselves.

1072
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,240
So next,

1073
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,360
it's time for us

1074
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,880
to work together as a team.

1075
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:05,720
Let's start with

1076
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,680
the boys' section.

1077
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,080
Okay.

1078
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,160
Wang Lechen.

1079
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,280
Lanlan (Xu Rulan).

1080
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,040
I think he might choose Yuan (Lu Yuan).

1081
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,240
I also think he'll pick Xiao Yuan (Lu Yuan).

1082
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,200
Wang Jue.

1083
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,760
The things that happened in the kitchen...

1084
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,480
Based on past experience,

1085
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,480
actually, this message

1086
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,160
isn't really

1087
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,840
a decisive factor.

1088
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,680
It's related to what happened that day.

1089
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,080
Yes, it's connected to that.

1090
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,400
So I think

1091
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,040
Wang Lechen will probably still choose Yuan (Lu Yuan).

1092
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:31,720
Yes.

1093
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,280
The atmosphere when walking the dog is really nice.

1094
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,120
The atmosphere when walking the dog is really nice.

1095
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,320
It's very good.

1096
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,160
Like before, secretly—

1097
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,400
—as if we used to sneak out to walk the dog.

1098
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,840
Then let's be a bit braver.

1099
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,400
Be brave.

1100
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:39,760
Come on.

1101
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,520
So next, Rui Long

1102
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,080
he still chooses Chi Chi (Sun Hanqing)

1103
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,040
Yes, Chi Chi (Sun Hanqing)

1104
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,200
Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong)

1105
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:49,880
and Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng) both

1106
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,920
are both going towards Lan Lan (Xu Rulan)

1107
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,480
That's right

1108
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,240
It's steady

1109
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,520
The two of them are definitely going

1110
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,840
towards Lan Lan (Xu Rulan)

1111
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,280
Yes

1112
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,160
Both of them are

1113
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,720
As for Jin Yuxing

1114
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,040
he might also still choose Lan Lan (Xu Rulan)

1115
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,600
because today they were in the same kitchen

1116
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,880
one was making steak

1117
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,680
the other was washing dishes

1118
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,000
It's possible

1119
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,960
it's still Lan Lan (Xu Rulan), that's right

1120
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,200
Lan Lan (Xu Rulan)

1121
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,080
still has three choices

1122
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,240
So actually, the change this time

1123
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,000
is that

1124
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,240
Wang Lechen and

1125
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,160
Yuanyuan (Lu Yuan) this time

1126
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,400
had time walking the dog

1127
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,440
which gave them

1128
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,080
a chance to get to know each other better

1129
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,040
So next

1130
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,240
let's look at the girls' side

1131
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,080
Let's take a look

1132
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:23,880
at the girls'

1133
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,760
It feels easy to guess

1134
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,960
Duo Duo (Ke Ailin) is definitely choosing Wang Lechen

1135
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,440
Yes

1136
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,720
She's too easy to guess

1137
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,480
She teases him on the left

1138
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,720
and teases him on the right

1139
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,200
She even asked him to stay and cook

1140
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:31,640
Yes

1141
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,720
Yuan Yuan (Lu Yuan) is a mutual choice.

1142
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:36,800
I think Wang Yifan

1143
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,040
could also possibly be Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong).

1144
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,880
Because she had always voted for

1145
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,360
Dr. Fang (Fang Yijiong) before.

1146
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,680
And after the professions were revealed,

1147
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,200
it made him even more appealing.

1148
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,000
There was no reason to change her vote.

1149
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,560
So she stuck with choosing Dr. Fang (Fang Yijiong).

1150
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,840
Chichi (Sun Hanqing) didn't have any

1151
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,760
reason to change her vote either.

1152
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,560
Still,

1153
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,280
Xing Ge (Jin Yuxing).

1154
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,400
Wang Jue is probably still Wang Lechen.

1155
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,720
Because of what happened in the kitchen,

1156
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,400
it's still Wang Lechen.

1157
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,120
Because she was there too.

1158
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,040
So it's him.

1159
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,600
You're just like Sherlock Holmes.

1160
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,480
As for Xiao Lan (Xu Rulan),

1161
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,560
we need to choose.

1162
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,200
As for Lanlan (Xu Rulan),

1163
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:10,800
I think

1164
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,200
she could vote for

1165
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,160
our doctor

1166
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,400
Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong).

1167
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,560
I just feel

1168
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,520
that after revealing the professions,

1169
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,520
there should be some changes.

1170
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,800
I know Dr. Fang (Fang Yijiong),

1171
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,720
I think so too.

1172
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,440
Hani,

1173
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,120
I

1174
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,000
I might still think it's

1175
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,600
Wang Lechen.

1176
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,520
I still think it's Wang Lechen.

1177
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,960
Because both of them wear that hat.

1178
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,840
I think

1179
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,960
it really matches.

1180
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,840
She even calls him President Wang.

1181
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,320
When Lanlan (Xu Rulan) was cooking,

1182
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,080
who did she help out?

1183
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,480
She helped

1184
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,080
Brother Xing (Jin Yuxing).

1185
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,480
She helped both sides.

1186
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,880
But when her profession was revealed,

1187
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:42,360
towards whom

1188
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,560
did she look at with newfound respect?

1189
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,080
It was Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong).

1190
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,040
She did praise his (Wang Lechen's)

1191
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,240
cilantro beef for being delicious.

1192
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,000
Is it choosing Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong),

1193
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,040
or choosing

1194
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,160
the former Wang Lechen?

1195
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,200
Anyway, it's a fifty-fifty split.

1196
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,320
What do you all think?

1197
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,360
So next,

1198
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,640
the one to break this balance

1199
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,400
could be you,

1200
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:01,880
could be me,

1201
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,920
or could be Xu Rulan.

1202
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,240
Xu Rulan casts this vote for

1203
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,240
Wang Lechen.

1204
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:06,840
Alright.

1205
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,320
Okay.

1206
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:07,600
Come on.

1207
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,760
Everyone's here.

1208
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,920
Let's announce it.

1209
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,000
If we all answer correctly,

1210
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,880
we can get

1211
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,520
eleven raw stones.

1212
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,240
Okay.

1213
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:17,960
Jasmine blooms

1214
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,120
is the signal of a heartbeat.

1215
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,400
So next, we enter

1216
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,640
the Master Kong Jasmine Tea

1217
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,040
fragrant and heart-fluttering moment.

1218
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,040
First, we'll announce

1219
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,920
all the boys' heart connections.

1220
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,280
Ruilong chose

1221
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,040
Duoduo (Ke Ailin).

1222
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,200
That's wrong.

1223
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,200
And then Jin Yuxing,

1224
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,080
also

1225
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:41,880
switched.

1226
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,080
Jin Yuxing switched to

1227
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,480
Chichi (Sun Hanqing).

1228
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,160
Wait a moment.

1229
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:45,880
Hold on.

1230
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,680
Everyone,

1231
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,960
this is very important.

1232
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,560
You see, actually,

1233
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,240
when Chichi (Sun Hanqing) was

1234
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,160
cooking,

1235
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,160
she always wanted

1236
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,120
to help Jin Yuxing.

1237
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:52,880
But she couldn't help.

1238
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,000
She couldn't help.

1239
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,040
But Lanlan (Xu Rulan) managed to help.

1240
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:55,560
Lanlan (Xu Rulan)

1241
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,160
helped.

1242
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,520
But Jin Yuxing still

1243
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,520
noticed

1244
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,200
Chichi (Sun Hanqing).

1245
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,920
She’s been helping him all along.

1246
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,520
No, I just suddenly remembered.

1247
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,160
What’s wrong?

1248
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,600
She kept looking for him.

1249
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,720
Band-aids.

1250
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,000
Right.

1251
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,040
She searched everywhere.

1252
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:07,760
I lost my memory.

1253
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,480
I just remembered now.

1254
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,840
It was because she was looking for band-aids for him.

1255
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,400
He noticed.

1256
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,320
She kept saying.

1257
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,480
She told you to get some water.

1258
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,120
Don’t get one.

1259
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,360
You care about me.

1260
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,440
I noticed this.

1261
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,240
Yeah.

1262
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,120
If only I had remembered this earlier.

1263
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,600
I forgot everything.

1264
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:21,880
Right now, we

1265
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,000
have earned three.

1266
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:23,360
Guys,

1267
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,040
let’s see

1268
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,360
the girls’ choices.

1269
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,440
We have to get at least seven.

1270
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:30,880
Let’s go!

1271
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,600
Come on.

1272
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,040
I’ve seen it.

1273
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:39,760
Lanlan (Xu Rulan) chose

1274
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,720
Xiaofang (Fang Yijiong).

1275
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,960
Bro, I get you.

1276
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,000
Let me tell you, this—

1277
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,080
It must be

1278
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:48,960
Wang Yifan

1279
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,200
chose

1280
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,040
Jin Yuxing.

1281
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:51,440
That's wrong.

1282
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,560
Jin Yuxing

1283
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,040
Right.

1284
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,520
This is

1285
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,440
Then Chichi (Sun Hanqing)

1286
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,160
ended up choosing Wang Lechen.

1287
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,240
It changed.

1288
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,720
Then we got it wrong.

1289
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,400
Three.

1290
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,080
But there are

1291
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,880
already two pairs who chose each other.

1292
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,040
One is Xiaoyuan (Lu Yuan) and Wang Lechen.

1293
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,160
Another is Xiaofang (Fang Yijiong)

1294
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,280
and Lanlan (Xu Rulan).

1295
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:12,960
Right.

1296
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,320
I think Lanlan (Xu Rulan)

1297
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,720
sent this message to

1298
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,240
Xiaofang (Fang Yijiong).

1299
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,760
This is really valuable.

1300
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,440
See, I said after revealing the professions,

1301
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,040
after that,

1302
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:20,840
there's a profession filter.

1303
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,200
Yeah, because I think

1304
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,320
she would like

1305
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,200
this kind of thing.

1306
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:24,720
Everyone, take a look

1307
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,320
at the content of the message.

1308
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,240
See what it says.

1309
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:30,080
Thank you for bringing the cottage cake.

1310
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,280
It was delicious.

1311
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,680
And thank you for always being here

1312
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:33,640
to help out in the kitchen.

1313
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:34,520
Okay.

1314
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,760
I definitely noticed her.

1315
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,480
I really admire you.

1316
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,520
Your courage and determination

1317
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,280
and your abilities.

1318
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,760
I hope that from now on,

1319
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,720
you'll overcome every challenge that comes your way.

1320
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:44,480
Go for it!

1321
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,040
Ruilong.

1322
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,440
I'm so happy to have met you today.

1323
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,480
You're so lively.

1324
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,920
You energize everyone.

1325
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,240
I just love her personality.

1326
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,680
I saw a different side of you.

1327
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:54,760
Okay.

1328
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,960
It should also be a profession.

1329
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:57,840
Please accept this.

1330
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,240
A voucher for an all-night park experience.

1331
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,360
Expiration date:

1332
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,040
2099.

1333
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,640
Will any of us even live to see 2099?

1334
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,560
Who knows.

1335
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,800
You're being too calm again.

1336
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,040
Just us all

1337
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:12,800
may we live a long life.

1338
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,760
May we live a long life.

1339
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,680
I probably can't.

1340
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,440
I was born in 1997.

1341
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,360
I probably can't make it until

1342
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,600
The girls' part.

1343
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,120
Wang Jue.

1344
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,920
The area around the cabin.

1345
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,800
Because the whole cabin's

1346
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,520
surroundings are just

1347
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,120
a large park.

1348
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:26,800
A vast green space.

1349
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,360
There are many places

1350
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,360
to explore.

1351
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,000
Cilantro beef.

1352
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:31,760
The promotion was worth it.

1353
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,360
The beef is especially delicious.

1354
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,120
I'm very happy today.

1355
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,640
She actually didn't mention taking a walk.

1356
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,360
The braised pork ribs were pretty tasty.

1357
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,000
It has nothing to do with the profession.

1358
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,400
I just think the ribs were done well.

1359
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,680
On the contrary, I think

1360
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,680
not mentioning the profession is actually

1361
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,720
Lanlan (Xu Rulan)'s style.

1362
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:48,480
That's also possible.

1363
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,040
What about Wang Yifan?

1364
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,800
The dishes they made were delicious.

1365
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,560
This is too hard to guess.

1366
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:55,960
Chichi (Sun Hanqing).

1367
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:56,360
Why?

1368
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,160
Why did you start choosing Wang Lechen?

1369
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,760
I think this is the first time I've talked to you today.

1370
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,160
You seem like an interesting person.

1371
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,400
I hope we get more chances to interact in the future.

1372
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,880
After spending these past two days together,

1373
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:06,680
this Wang Lechen

1374
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,160
is still the most popular one.

1375
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:08,840
Yeah.

1376
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:09,360
How many votes?

1377
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,680
That’s one, two.

1378
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,680
Three, four votes.

1379
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,920
Very charming.

1380
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:13,840
Because he really does

1381
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:14,560
get along with everyone.

1382
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,400
He knows a bit of everything.

1383
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,400
And then Xu Rulan

1384
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,520
ended up with two votes.

1385
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:20,160
So next,

1386
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,240
let's begin

1387
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,560
handing out our Heart Stones.

1388
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,600
To our Xu-ge,

1389
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:24,080
one.

1390
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:24,600
Thank you.

1391
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,480
Awesome.

1392
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,040
To Xiao Ma-ge,

1393
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:26,680
Teacher Qianzhuang,

1394
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,080
Hani,

1395
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,000
Minghao gets one.

1396
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:29,160
Minghao gets one.

1397
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:29,840
Awesome.

1398
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:31,760
Chunye,

1399
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:32,360
Awesome.

1400
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:35,880
What about you?

1401
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,600
I'll go for it next time.

1402
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,400
No way, you didn't get one last time either.

1403
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,240
I want to give you one.

1404
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,000
I'll give you mine.

1405
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:41,800
No need.

1406
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,600
I'll give you one.

1407
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,200
Okay.

1408
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:43,440
No need.

1409
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,840
Got it.

1410
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:45,400
Okay.

1411
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,080
I've never had one.

1412
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:46,720
Now I suddenly have two.

1413
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:48,520
Alright.

1414
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,400
So our

1415
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,000
first team mission

1416
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:51,480
can be considered

1417
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,960
quite successful.

1418
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:53,640
That's true.

1419
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,280
We also

1420
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,040
got to know everyone's thoughts.

1421
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,600
So next, let's see

1422
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,640
what everyone will do in our

1423
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,800
Heartbeat Apartment

1424
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:00,520
and what will happen.

1425
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:01,880
What do you usually like to do during your free time?

1426
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:02,720
What do you enjoy doing?

1427
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,560
Do you prefer staying at home or going out with friends?

1428
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,200
I've been busy lately because I'm preparing for graduation.

1429
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,000
So I might be a bit busy.

1430
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,920
When I have some free time, I watch variety shows.

1431
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,720
I also go on Xiaohongshu.

1432
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,120
I read some notes about variety shows.

1433
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:12,880
It's so interesting.

1434
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,120
Once I start, I can't stop watching.

1435
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,160
Me too.

1436
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,840
Every time I read those notes, I feel amazed.

1437
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,320
Those girls really say exactly what I'm thinking.

1438
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,280
Sometimes I can't help but leave a comment or two.

1439
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,840
And the love personality test we did last time,

1440
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:22,880
the love personality test,

1441
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,320
is now available on Xiaohongshu too.

1442
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,160
I think it's pretty accurate.

1443
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,800
I can share it

1444
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,640
with our friends so they can try it too.

1445
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,440
Sure.

1446
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,440
Actually, now that you mention it,

1447
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,440
every year,

1448
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,160
when "Signal of the Heart" airs,

1449
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,120
a lot of viewers

1450
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,560
post notes on Xiaohongshu

1451
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,240
to analyze the guests'

1452
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,600
emotional developments.

1453
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,320
Everyone's analytical perspectives

1454
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,760
are especially unique.

1455
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,240
The shared

1456
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,640
various emotional viewpoints

1457
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:44,520
and topic discussions

1458
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:45,720
often really resonate with me.

1459
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,320
As the official discussion platform

1460
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,920
for this season of "Signal of the Heart" Season 8,

1461
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,640
Xiaohongshu

1462
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:51,760
not only allows everyone to

1463
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,520
discuss the show on Xiaohongshu,

1464
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,600
but also take the same

1465
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,480
travel-themed love personality test as the guests.

1466
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,280
Come to Xiaohongshu

1467
00:47:59,280 --> 00:47:59,680
and join

1468
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,120
the "Signal of the Heart" Season 8

1469
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,160
topic activities.

1470
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,680
Share your notes.

1471
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,720
You went to Hangzhou.

1472
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:21,480
Yes.

1473
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,280
Counting shoes

1474
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,480
Jin Yuxing is actually quite good-looking.

1475
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,920
He is pretty handsome.

1476
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:12,720
Hello.

1477
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,360
Hi, did you just get back?

1478
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,600
Yeah, I just got back.

1479
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,720
What a coincidence, me too.

1480
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,640
Are you the only one upstairs?

1481
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,880
Yeah.

1482
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,760
But I saw a lot of shoes at the door.

1483
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,720
But I noticed there’s no one on the first floor either.

1484
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:31,880
Seems like there’s no one.

1485
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,280
It’s just me right now.

1486
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,120
Just you?

1487
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:34,680
Yeah.

1488
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,160
Did you bring any (food)?

1489
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,640
We can go to the supermarket later.

1490
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:41,800
Taking the initiative to invite.

1491
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:42,280
Taking the initiative.

1492
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,080
Sure.

1493
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,200
Wang Yifan

1494
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:50,840
Chichi (Sun Hanqing)

1495
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:51,880
Coming.

1496
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,800
Let’s discuss what to have for dinner tomorrow.

1497
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:54,400
Okay.

1498
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,760
How about hot pot?

1499
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:56,320
Sounds good.

1500
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,120
Let me tidy up a bit first.

1501
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,880
Let’s go to the supermarket.

1502
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:01,320
Okay.

1503
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,080
The flowers are from Jin Yuxing.

1504
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,000
They even sprayed perfume on them.

1505
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,760
And even spun around once.

1506
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,600
This charming spin

1507
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,000
This scene is so funny

1508
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,400
I think it's even funnier than an air shot

1509
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,080
I think it's funny

1510
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,880
It feels a bit ceremonial

1511
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:39,680
Ma Boqian

1512
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,600
How do you put on perfume?

1513
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,640
Show us

1514
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:42,880
It's really simple

1515
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:43,320
Show off

1516
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,000
Showing off

1517
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:44,320
You just

1518
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:45,440
And

1519
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:46,680
I also

1520
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,040
Are you trying to follow up on this?

1521
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:52,560
Xu Minghao

1522
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,080
How do you spray it?

1523
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,240
Spray it for me

1524
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,000
I just

1525
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:57,840
This is how I spray it

1526
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,080
You just bring it with you.

1527
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:08,960
Because I

1528
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,240
don't like to use strong scents.

1529
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:10,400
And my perfumes are all

1530
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,000
And my perfumes are all

1531
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:12,800
just

1532
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,960
two or three kinds that I mix myself.

1533
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,040
So I carry a small bottle.

1534
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,000
Let's go.

1535
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:20,720
Okay.

1536
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,720
Do you like big dogs or small dogs?

1537
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,720
I like big dogs.

1538
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:25,600
I like big dogs too.

1539
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:29,560
That's why I got a Bernese Mountain Dog.

1540
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:31,000
Both of them like big dogs.

1541
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,600
I'm not sure if I should say this.

1542
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,760
I think you look like a Bernese Mountain Dog.

1543
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,800
I look like a Bernese Mountain Dog?

1544
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,160
Really.

1545
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:38,640
Really?

1546
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,000
Sorry, I hope I didn't offend you.

1547
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:41,840
No, not at all.

1548
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,840
Having a Bernese Mountain Dog is actually pretty cool.

1549
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:55,560
It's nice.

1550
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,280
Actually, pets start to resemble their owners over time.

1551
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:58,480
Actually, pets start to resemble their owners over time.

1552
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,120
But she means the owner looks like the dog.

1553
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:01,960
That happens too, it's possible.

1554
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,120
Owners can also look like their pets.

1555
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,800
You take things so seriously every day.

1556
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,440
I think you shouldn't go inside.

1557
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,280
I've already fastened my seatbelt.

1558
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:13,800
Are you cold?

1559
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,360
I'm not cold, I'm fine.

1560
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,640
Okay.

1561
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,960
You look a little cold to me.

1562
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,760
Let me turn up the air conditioning one level.

1563
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,160
Let's head out.

1564
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,200
Let's go.

1565
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,120
So sweet.

1566
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,240
Before we came out,

1567
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,200
I was thinking of leaving a message for everyone first,

1568
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,040
but I was in a hurry to find you,

1569
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:37,800
so I forgot.

1570
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,160
I was the one who called you.

1571
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:41,080
I interrupted your train of thought.

1572
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,120
Do you know what Yiwu's

1573
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:44,240
specialty restaurant is?

1574
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,040
What is it?

1575
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,240
Take a guess.

1576
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,240
I know.

1577
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,440
Jiangxi stir-fry.

1578
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:49,840
That's right.

1579
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:50,600
Isn't it?

1580
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:51,000
Yes.

1581
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:52,960
It is.

1582
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,240
I've actually never been to Yiwu.

1583
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,080
You should come visit.

1584
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,760
If you come to Yiwu, I'll take you to eat Jiangxi stir-fry.

1585
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:00,640
Thank you.

1586
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,440
You're so thoughtful.

1587
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,400
Let's see if Yiwu's Jiangxi stir-fry

1588
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:06,960
tastes better,

1589
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,520
or if Jiangxi's own Jiangxi stir-fry is better.

1590
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,680
Then I really have to try it.

1591
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:12,840
Your local specialty.

1592
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,040
Yeah, yesterday morning I

1593
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,240
found in our kitchen

1594
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,080
a sandwich.

1595
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:24,600
Did you eat it?

1596
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,000
I did. Did you make it?

1597
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:26,680
Yeah.

1598
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,160
It was made by Chichi (Sun Hanqing).

1599
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,960
I've been found out.

1600
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,640
Girls tend to be the type who give quietly.

1601
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:38,560
Did you make it?

1602
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:39,320
Yeah.

1603
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:39,680
Really?

1604
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:40,680
But it tasted bad.

1605
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:41,960
No, I thought it was pretty good.

1606
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:42,760
It was delicious.

1607
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:44,960
And I was thinking, if

1608
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,520
I left a sandwich there,

1609
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:47,640
but actually

1610
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:48,240
didn't write anything on it,

1611
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,720
others probably wouldn't dare eat it.

1612
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:51,640
So only I would.

1613
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,280
Is it possible that it was me

1614
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:56,920
who made it for myself?

1615
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,560
Then I went to the bathroom,

1616
00:53:58,560 --> 00:53:59,360
and when I came back,

1617
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,760
I found my breakfast had been eaten.

1618
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,760
Then I'll make you another one.

1619
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:05,880
Okay.

1620
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:07,160
This is sweet.

1621
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:07,880
This is sweet.

1622
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:08,720
This is quite sweet.

1623
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:10,480
But when I go to the supermarket,

1624
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,960
I easily want to buy

1625
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:12,920
a lot of things all at once.

1626
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,960
It's a bit scary.

1627
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:15,440
Yeah.

1628
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:16,120
Shopping at the supermarket is.

1629
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,120
I really do know what you like more.

1630
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,760
It really feels like two people living together.

1631
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,160
Yeah.

1632
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,160
And it really is,

1633
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,760
down to the tiniest details,

1634
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:23,880
like the tiniest traces—

1635
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:26,320
traces,

1636
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:26,680
clues,

1637
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,280
little clues.

1638
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,240
No, that's not it.

1639
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,960
The tiniest details.

1640
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:30,720
I'm really impressed.

1641
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:30,960
I'm really impressed.

1642
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:31,760
Two people shopping together

1643
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:32,360
can create some

1644
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,280
little clues.

1645
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:36,200
Knowledge.

1646
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,920
It's all mixed up now.

1647
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:42,680
Wang Yifan.

1648
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,160
Pretty cute.

1649
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:54,880
Hello

1650
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,040
You have so much stuff

1651
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,800
Do you need me to help you carry it?

1652
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,160
You can help me too

1653
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,200
Hold this for a moment

1654
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,040
Give it to me

1655
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,520
Because they said we're having hot pot today

1656
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,960
You can come join us

1657
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:05,680
Yeah

1658
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:06,920
I feel like you brought a lot

1659
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,840
I don't know what everyone wants to eat

1660
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,040
And I also brought a watermelon

1661
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:11,840
Lanlan (Xu Rulan) and I, when we were

1662
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:14,160
on the island, we said we could have hot pot together in the future

1663
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:14,640
Yeah

1664
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,200
And this time, it just worked out

1665
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,160
So I thought hot pot would be the most convenient

1666
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,000
Yeah, Lanlan (Xu Rulan) mentioned

1667
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:19,880
she likes hot pot

1668
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,240
Look, his mind is full of

1669
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,200
nothing but Lanlan (Xu Rulan)

1670
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:27,800
I just remembered something

1671
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,200
But I need to find the pot first

1672
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,600
We only have a few pots over there

1673
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,960
You mean the hot pot pot?

1674
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,360
Yes, it's here with us

1675
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:35,440
At this moment, Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng)

1676
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,600
is really cute

1677
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,360
This should be an induction cooker.

1678
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:44,760
I'm really curious, can I ask?

1679
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:45,320
It's just that...

1680
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:45,800
Go ahead and ask.

1681
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:46,920
Do I need to cook this first?

1682
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,880
When you ask her, she only gives this kind of information.

1683
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:52,640
Sure.

1684
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,040
You're licking me again.

1685
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,360
Take this over there.

1686
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,240
That thing from your first day.

1687
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:58,080
Nicole left.

1688
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,280
Had a deep conversation.

1689
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,480
What did you talk about?

1690
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,280
We...

1691
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,960
He's really smart.

1692
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,640
He started with the people around her.

1693
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:07,960
What are you curious about?

1694
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:08,840
You can say it.

1695
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:09,880
What are you curious about?

1696
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,440
Let me see if we talked about that.

1697
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,400
I'm curious too.

1698
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,840
That's a lot, just the two of us.

1699
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,440
We talk about everything, the two of us.

1700
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:26,360
Because Lanlan (Xu Rulan) and I are very...

1701
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,680
How should I put it, very compatible.

1702
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:28,640
Alright.

1703
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,400
So what do you talk about when you have deep conversations?

1704
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,080
Values, personalities, or...

1705
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,120
What?

1706
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,800
Yeah, share a bit.

1707
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:41,080
I'll help you with the work.

1708
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,480
That's pretty cute too.

1709
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:44,680
Pretty cute.

1710
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,800
Lanlan (Xu Rulan) even complimented you the other day.

1711
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:50,440
Really?

1712
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,120
Really.

1713
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:51,600
When?

1714
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:55,080
Because you guys went to watch the sunset, right?

1715
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:55,960
That day.

1716
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,960
Yeah, of course we gossiped a little.

1717
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:58,880
What did she say?

1718
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,840
She just said you're pretty attentive.

1719
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,480
A really good person.

1720
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:02,960
Yeah.

1721
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,280
Anything else?

1722
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:04,800
Did you talk about...

1723
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:05,960
Things you don't like about each other?

1724
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,680
He's a bit jumpy.

1725
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,200
What are you doing?

1726
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,080
The dog is sneaking food.

1727
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:20,520
Dog.

1728
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:24,600
So cute.

1729
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,080
Nicole.

1730
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:28,800
You startled me.

1731
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,080
You really are...

1732
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,840
You really are scared.

1733
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,440
You really are worried.

1734
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,720
He's always the busiest one.

1735
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,360
Okay, please continue.

1736
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:43,880
What else?

1737
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,240
After thinking for a long time,

1738
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,400
Let's not be polite, let's talk openly.

1739
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,920
The things you're washing now

1740
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,760
are all things she likes to eat.

1741
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:53,640
Okay.

1742
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:54,040
Yes.

1743
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:01,520
Anything else?

1744
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,800
What else?

1745
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:03,200
Maybe, in terms of getting along,

1746
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,760
Maybe, in terms of getting along,

1747
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:07,160
you might seem more reserved on the surface,

1748
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:09,360
or maybe

1749
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,960
a bit shy and introverted.

1750
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:11,720
But

1751
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:12,600
it just takes

1752
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:13,960
time to really see

1753
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:14,480
time to really see

1754
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,160
and then you realize you're actually

1755
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,800
a person with an interesting soul.

1756
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:22,920
That's all I can say.

1757
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,560
Okay.

1758
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:26,320
Thanks for your hard work.

1759
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,520
That's all I can say.

1760
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:27,920
Tomorrow, you...

1761
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:28,840
What else do you have to do tomorrow?

1762
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,920
If you ever need me in the future,

1763
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:33,400
I'll offer you thirty days of

1764
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,320
free kitchen help and dishwashing.

1765
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,560
For free.

1766
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,160
Any odd jobs.

1767
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,160
Yes, anything is fine.

1768
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:40,200
"Help!"

1769
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:41,880
The alliance is formed.

1770
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,640
We need some subtle support now.

1771
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:46,480
But it has to be someone with good judgment.

1772
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,400
Otherwise, it could ruin everything.

1773
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,680
But I think

1774
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:52,800
in my opinion,

1775
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,240
I don't think you need to worry about

1776
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,000
what people like about you.

1777
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,120
The affection between people

1778
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,520
is actually about your true self.

1779
00:58:58,520 --> 00:58:59,680
There's no need

1780
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,280
to change yourself for anything.

1781
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,400
To become someone else.

1782
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:03,320
Yes.

1783
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:04,440
Wang Yifan is pretty nice.

1784
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:06,520
So,

1785
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,280
is there anyone you want to know more about?

1786
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,400
Someone I want to know more about...

1787
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:10,880
He also wants to help.

1788
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,960
Information exchange.

1789
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,120
They're allies now.

1790
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:15,720
Exchanging information with each other.

1791
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:16,960
If it's about getting to know someone,

1792
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,880
actually, I want to know more about Jin Yuxing.

1793
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:23,560
Because actually, up until now, he is

1794
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,320
the only one

1795
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:24,680
I'm not familiar with

1796
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:25,520
and don't really know

1797
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:27,680
I want to get to know Jin Yuxing

1798
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:30,440
I'm very familiar with Jin Yuxing

1799
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,920
Last night, Jin Yuxing

1800
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:32,720
when I was in the living room

1801
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:33,360
he came over and told me

1802
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,240
He said

1803
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,400
the two of us

1804
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,840
might be related by blood through our ancestors

1805
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:38,440
What?

1806
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,720
Do you know what he was focusing on?

1807
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:41,840
He said

1808
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,040
He said it's because my leg hair

1809
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,200
looks a lot like his leg hair

1810
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,640
I feel like your leg hair

1811
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,120
looks a lot like mine.

1812
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,040
What do you mean, looks like?

1813
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,720
Your leg hair and my leg hair—

1814
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:55,800
Are we maybe

1815
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:56,440
biological brothers?

1816
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:57,320
Like,

1817
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:58,120
maybe our ancestors are related.

1818
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,520
Ancestors can make this happen?

1819
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:00,200
They really do look quite similar.

1820
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:00,920
Is that even possible?

1821
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:02,920
I honestly think they look really similar.

1822
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:03,520
They really do.

1823
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:04,560
Right?

1824
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,000
We must be connected somehow.

1825
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:06,960
Yeah, I think so too.

1826
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:08,680
Your focus on this

1827
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:10,440
is really unusual, seriously.

1828
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,120
Because when I just saw

1829
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:11,920
your thigh,

1830
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,400
I thought it was my own.

1831
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:15,800
But it wasn't.

1832
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,640
That's kind of abstract.

1833
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:18,520
Way too abstract.

1834
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:21,040
And also,

1835
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,560
the one about leg hair,

1836
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:24,600
this part was trending.

1837
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:25,800
I've already figured it out.

1838
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,200
Dating shows are getting more and more abstract.

1839
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,760
But they won't get as abstract as leg hair.

1840
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:32,120
True.

1841
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:33,360
No problem.

1842
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:34,080
Tonight, I'll bring along

1843
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:35,480
my "leg hair brothers,"

1844
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:36,240
and you bring Lanlan (Xu Rulan).

1845
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,320
Let's go explore the cabin.

1846
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:41,160
Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng) is totally obsessed.

1847
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:41,680
Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng) is

1848
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:42,480
the first one to get obsessed.

1849
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,480
And it's been going on.

1850
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,400
He's already

1851
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:45,920
fallen deep into it.

1852
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:47,600
He's way too into it.

1853
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,560
He might have even thought of names for their kids.

1854
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,000
He said it would last until '99.

1855
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:52,280
Yeah.

1856
01:00:58,880 --> 01:00:59,600
Very pretty.

1857
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:09,200
Hello.

1858
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:10,280
Lanlan (Xu Rulan).

1859
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:10,960
Hello.

1860
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:11,960
Hello.

1861
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,480
Finally back.

1862
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,120
I brought ingredients for hot pot.

1863
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:20,760
I've already set everything up.

1864
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:21,240
Great.

1865
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:25,320
Keep setting the table.

1866
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:27,320
Hello.

1867
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:31,320
You all are early today.

1868
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:32,360
I'm late again.

1869
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:33,680
I was the first one today.

1870
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:36,240
But...

1871
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:36,920
But the people in our room

1872
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,240
seem to have already eaten.

1873
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:38,720
Really?

1874
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:41,120
So I just followed

1875
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,240
I followed Wang Yifan here to help in the kitchen.

1876
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,880
He can't control himself anymore.

1877
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,040
Did you all plan this?

1878
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:46,800
Did everyone eat

1879
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:47,840
before coming back today?

1880
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:50,160
No one discussed it with us.

1881
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,240
Because I haven't eaten.

1882
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:54,920
Okay.

1883
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:57,960
But...

1884
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,400
I peeled some shrimp and brought them over.

1885
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:01,320
Thank you.

1886
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:02,480
I was planning to cook the shrimp over there.

1887
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:03,840
Are these crayfish?

1888
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:04,320
Yes.

1889
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,440
You put a lot of effort into this.

1890
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:10,240
He worked really hard.

1891
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,400
Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng)

1892
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:13,920
Keep it up!

1893
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:17,880
I peeled all of them.

1894
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:19,200
I removed all the shrimp veins.

1895
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:21,360
That's amazing.

1896
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:22,400
You're so meticulous, bro.

1897
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:25,960
I'm really happy to be praised.

1898
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,080
Then join us for the meal later.

1899
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:31,800
Okay.

1900
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,360
Add another chair.

1901
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:34,280
Okay, thank you.

1902
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:42,000
Xu Rulan, do you like eating watermelon?

1903
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:43,560
She's playing matchmaker now.

1904
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,040
I do.

1905
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:47,480
What other fruits do you like?

1906
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:49,520
I like mangosteen.

1907
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:50,200
Mangosteen?

1908
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,560
She's asking for him, you know?

1909
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:55,600
I brought over a few boxes of mangosteen the other day.

1910
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:56,400
Did you guys eat any?

1911
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,120
No.

1912
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:58,080
Go get some, quick.

1913
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,400
He's really proactive.

1914
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:06,200
He's really straightforward.

1915
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:06,840
Now Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng)

1916
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,000
will do anything you ask.

1917
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:11,240
This one.

1918
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:14,040
He responds to your needs with actions.

1919
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:15,480
That one.

1920
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:17,440
Try it.

1921
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:19,200
Okay.

1922
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,600
Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng) is too bold.

1923
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:24,760
Look at it from another perspective.

1924
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:27,360
Because he doesn't talk much, he does more.

1925
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:34,280
What happened to your arm?

1926
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:35,640
Are those all mosquito bites?

1927
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:36,800
Yeah, they're all mosquito bites.

1928
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,680
Don't scratch them.

1929
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:40,120
Okay.

1930
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,040
You've scratched them raw.

1931
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:42,840
Okay.

1932
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:44,200
My coworker said at work today

1933
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:44,720
I feel like

1934
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,320
he thought I got beaten up by mosquitoes.

1935
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:54,720
Thank you.

1936
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:57,400
Thanks.

1937
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:00,080
You're welcome.

1938
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:12,600
Is it okay?

1939
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:13,320
Is it a bit hard?

1940
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:23,000
Let me do it.

1941
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,160
Thank you.

1942
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,240
No problem.

1943
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:50,080
Thanks.

1944
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,160
He really is

1945
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:12,280
A boy like him

1946
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:13,320
is actually

1947
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:14,560
quite rare.

1948
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,040
Let's start.

1949
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,240
I'm so hungry.

1950
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:26,160
This spicy hotpot is really delicious.

1951
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:27,200
This spicy hotpot...

1952
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,000
Has Wang Lechen not come back yet?

1953
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:29,400
Not yet.

1954
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,600
Not yet.

1955
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:01,840
I've decided to walk the dog later today.

1956
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:03,000
Because I've never had a dog before,

1957
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,240
I've been observing for two days.

1958
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:05,240
You all have walked the dog already.

1959
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:06,040
It's my turn today.

1960
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:10,840
Is she waiting for Wang Lechen to walk the dog?

1961
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:11,480
Yes.

1962
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,120
You're finally back.

1963
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:19,440
Why do I feel like

1964
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:20,960
I'm "walking" Wang Lechen every day?

1965
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:24,000
Hello.

1966
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,160
Hi.

1967
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:40,720
You just lick it and don't eat it.

1968
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:51,560
She probably wants to ask him to walk the dog together.

1969
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:52,640
Yeah.

1970
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,000
She's still thinking about how to bring it up.

1971
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:03,720
Just be straightforward.

1972
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:05,200
Hurry.

1973
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:07,000
Can you eat it like this?

1974
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:10,640
Yes.

1975
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:11,440
But it won't eat.

1976
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:14,320
What should I do?

1977
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:17,280
She's nervous.

1978
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:21,160
You can do it!

1979
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:22,840
I want to wait for you to walk the dog.

1980
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:24,360
She took the initiative.

1981
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:25,480
I wanted to wait for you to walk the dog.

1982
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:31,280
He didn't hear clearly.

1983
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:33,440
It wasn't just now.

1984
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:34,920
Did you just walk it?

1985
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:35,640
Yes.

1986
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:37,000
But we thought

1987
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,440
maybe you wouldn't come back.

1988
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,760
He really didn't seem to hear clearly.

1989
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:45,440
He really didn't hear it clearly.

1990
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,880
It seems like something was missed.

1991
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:57,480
Her invitation failed.

1992
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:00,560
He didn't hear clearly, right?

1993
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:02,400
He thought she was just chatting with him.

1994
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:03,280
Yes.

1995
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,960
Because when a girl takes the initiative to express herself,

1996
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,200
this kind of thing is still a bit

1997
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:07,480
hard to put into words.

1998
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:08,840
But I still think

1999
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,080
even if you didn't hear clearly,

2000
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:10,960
you could ask back.

2001
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:11,520
Yes, I think Wang Lechen

2002
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,680
probably didn't think of it that way either.

2003
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:13,320
Maybe he was just thinking about walking the dog.

2004
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:14,280
They've all been walked.

2005
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:15,360
So is it all done now?

2006
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:17,640
But I think it's such a pity.

2007
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:20,080
Went to throw out the trash.

2008
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:21,320
Let's go throw out the trash.

2009
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:28,960
Faking an accident.

2010
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,160
Do you know how to use a computer?

2011
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:31,840
Yes.

2012
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,000
Can you help me with my computer?

2013
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:34,080
Wait a moment.

2014
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,480
Duoduo (Ke Ailin) is just very direct.

2015
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:35,920
Yes.

2016
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:41,640
Are you moving over there?

2017
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:42,840
I also brought my computer.

2018
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:44,640
I'm going upstairs to work on some documents.

2019
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:53,560
Three girls

2020
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,240
Wang Jue, go one last time.

2021
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:58,720
Yeah, I really think we should ask again.

2022
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:00,280
Invite them one last time.

2023
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:01,760
If it doesn't work, don't invite them anymore.

2024
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:09,840
I'll check if there are any trash bags.

2025
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:20,600
Are there any left? No, they're gone.

2026
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:21,720
I think it should be fine.

2027
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:22,280
It should be fine.

2028
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:23,480
The rest can be dumped over there.

2029
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:24,240
It won't leak.

2030
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:25,480
Okay.

2031
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:25,920
Okay.

2032
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:30,640
You can also throw it over there.

2033
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:50,680
Even Chenchen (Wang Lechen) doesn't have any.

2034
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:51,680
Noticed her like this.

2035
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:55,480
It's even harder to speak up when someone's around.

2036
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:13,680
I was just about to get something from the car.

2037
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:15,880
Did they all go back?

2038
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:16,760
No.

2039
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:17,600
No one went back.

2040
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:29,920
Do you have weekends off?

2041
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:30,480
Yes, weekends off.

2042
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:31,200
Weekends off.

2043
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:44,320
This isn't trash.

2044
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,400
This—

2045
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:46,360
This is my computer.

2046
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:47,760
Sorry.

2047
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,000
This is yours.

2048
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:50,920
My pillow.

2049
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:54,400
Hello.

2050
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:55,640
Hello, everyone.

2051
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:04,160
I really can't bring myself to say it.

2052
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:05,800
Because there's someone next to me.

2053
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:09,640
We did do some charity work before.

2054
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,240
We're still continuing it now.

2055
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:12,040
Participating in our

2056
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:13,600
teaching support foundation.

2057
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,760
For example, sanitary pads for female students.

2058
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:18,880
And also some orphans.

2059
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:19,960
We help with things like that.

2060
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:20,760
That's really great of you.

2061
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:23,800
It's also quite cute to be by the side.

2062
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:26,040
But it seems like Chenchen (Wang Lechen)

2063
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:28,280
hasn't noticed at all.

2064
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,400
These boots are way too long.

2065
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,000
She's already trying hard to be around him.

2066
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:36,840
Yeah.

2067
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:39,400
Did they all go back?

2068
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:40,920
Are Duoduo (Ke Ailin) and the others not here?

2069
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:41,680
They're over there.

2070
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:43,400
Then why did you come here alone?

2071
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:44,000
I...

2072
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:44,880
No, I just thought...

2073
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:45,680
You can't.

2074
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:46,360
I...

2075
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:47,200
What?

2076
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:47,880
I don't know.

2077
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:49,920
I want to...

2078
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,080
walk off the food.

2079
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:54,520
Okay, I'll go back and put my things away first.

2080
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:55,040
Okay.

2081
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,360
She really...

2082
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:01,720
I kind of feel sorry for her.

2083
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:02,160
It hurts to see.

2084
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:08,200
Take a break.

2085
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:08,920
Take a break.

2086
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:22,120
Why are you like this today?

2087
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:23,480
Not energetic.

2088
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:24,680
You can't always stay fired up.

2089
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,040
He's not in a great state.

2090
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:28,880
Is something on your mind?

2091
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,080
You can talk about it.

2092
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:31,840
No, it's just that sometimes

2093
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,280
I want to be alone for a while.

2094
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,320
I understand.

2095
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:36,960
So in your usual work,

2096
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:39,040
do you have to socialize a lot?

2097
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,000
Yes, we do.

2098
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:41,840
Can you imagine that I used to

2099
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,840
be someone who couldn't talk at all?

2100
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:48,280
Really?

2101
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:52,720
My first impression of you was

2102
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:55,480
that you were both reserved and outgoing.

2103
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:58,520
But I didn't expect you

2104
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:00,520
You really gave me

2105
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:01,000
that

2106
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
outward impression.

2107
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:05,320
It's hard to imagine, right?

2108
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:05,880
Yeah.

2109
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,400
How is your family relationship?

2110
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:13,960
I think my parents are pretty good.

2111
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,160
It makes me quite envious.

2112
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:15,560
I think

2113
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:17,720
because they got together as each other's first love

2114
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:19,480
and have been together ever since.

2115
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:21,440
My parents have influenced my views on love

2116
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,040
in a pretty healthy way.

2117
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:24,840
Actually, when it comes to love,

2118
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:25,880
I think I am

2119
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:27,840
extremely idealistic.

2120
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:30,840
What about your family?

2121
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:32,400
Compared to Ke Ailin's family,

2122
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,080
she

2123
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:35,120
also mentioned on the first day that her family

2124
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:36,440
her parents have a really great relationship.

2125
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,480
Just like your parents.

2126
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:40,280
That is,

2127
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:41,720
they've always been super loving.

2128
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:44,920
I

2129
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,680
Actually, I'm rather pessimistic.

2130
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:49,360
Is it an issue with your family of origin?

2131
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:50,320
For example, in my case,

2132
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:51,320
For example, in my case,

2133
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:51,920
when it comes to positive guidance from family,

2134
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:54,320
I actually had none at all.

2135
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:54,680
Because

2136
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:55,280
Because

2137
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:57,320
Yes, because of my family situation.

2138
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:00,880
This is definitely related to my family of origin.

2139
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,560
I'm actually a very insecure person.

2140
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:04,400
Extremely insecure.

2141
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:05,800
Insecure to my core.

2142
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:08,480
I don't really know either.

2143
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:09,720
What the exact reason is.

2144
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:11,240
Anyway, I'm still trying to figure it out.

2145
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:12,280
But I also don't know why

2146
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:13,080
this sense of inferiority

2147
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:14,960
or this feeling of unworthiness

2148
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:16,280
is so strong in me.

2149
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:21,040
I've just always

2150
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,800
been trying to talk myself through it.

2151
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,320
Always trying to talk myself through it.

2152
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:25,280
You talk yourself through it?

2153
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:26,120
Yes.

2154
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:28,440
Like, I

2155
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:29,600
learn about psychology.

2156
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,000
Actually, after learning about psychology,

2157
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,280
you can

2158
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:33,080
trace things back to their roots

2159
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:34,160
and find some reasons.

2160
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:36,400
So, do you think your past emotional experiences

2161
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:37,360
—not asking for details—

2162
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:39,080
do you think, overall,

2163
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:41,080
you're satisfied with how things were?

2164
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:44,200
Not at all satisfied.

2165
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:49,560
That was me a couple of years ago.

2166
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:51,040
I was really struggling internally.

2167
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:52,240
And I was super withdrawn.

2168
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:55,920
Do you think you still

2169
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:56,880
get caught up

2170
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,960
in things like this

2171
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:00,760
these days?

2172
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:03,640
It's hard to say.

2173
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,840
I feel like it might still happen.

2174
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:07,920
Because

2175
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,160
I've been through some issues before,

2176
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:09,760
so I know how to handle them.

2177
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:10,880
But there are still a lot

2178
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,160
of unknown problems.

2179
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:12,600
Right?

2180
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:13,360
I get what you mean.

2181
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:14,960
I think maybe I just

2182
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:16,280
chose the wrong direction.

2183
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:17,080
That's true.

2184
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:18,160
I think

2185
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:20,680
if you really look at it in a bigger way,

2186
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:22,120
it's actually not worth mentioning.

2187
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:32,040
I think this sharing

2188
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:32,760
is especially sincere and timely

2189
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:35,160
especially sincere and timely

2190
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:36,240
and also very necessary

2191
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:37,280
because actually, before this

2192
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:38,920
the Wang Lechen we saw was always

2193
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:39,920
maybe surrounded by many people

2194
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:41,200
questioning his choices

2195
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:42,160
and he was also trying hard

2196
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:43,160
to express himself

2197
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:45,320
but little did we know, in this process

2198
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:46,600
there could be this sense of unworthiness

2199
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:48,040
I don't know if everyone

2200
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:49,320
has ever felt this way

2201
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:51,680
or how to reconcile with it

2202
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:54,320
I think I used to be very

2203
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:55,600
insecure as well

2204
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:56,400
and then

2205
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:59,080
I remember when people used to compliment me

2206
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:00,280
I would really

2207
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:02,240
think they were just being polite

2208
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:03,560
I used to subconsciously

2209
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:04,600
magnify my own shortcomings

2210
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:05,480
and then you would

2211
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:06,880
find it hard to see your own strengths

2212
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:11,080
That's true, it's only over the years that I've slowly

2213
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:13,680
come to realize how important it is to love yourself.

2214
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:14,440
Actually, a person

2215
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:15,840
if they've never experienced being loved

2216
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,800
or being accepted,

2217
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:19,840
it's very hard for them to learn to love themselves.

2218
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:20,480
Yes.

2219
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,920
After hearing what they just said,

2220
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:24,840
I can really understand Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng).

2221
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:27,120
The way he pursues girls,

2222
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:29,120
because he grew up in

2223
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:31,640
a very happy family.

2224
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:33,360
So when it comes to love,

2225
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:34,400
he is

2226
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:35,800
extremely trusting.

2227
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:36,840
Or you could say

2228
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:37,920
he really believes in love.

2229
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:40,960
He longs for a relationship like his parents'.

2230
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:42,080
So he will

2231
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:43,960
give his all to love someone.

2232
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:44,840
He gives everything.

2233
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:45,920
Even if he gets hurt.

2234
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:47,200
But you can sense that Wang Lechen

2235
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:48,800
probably, in his childhood,

2236
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:51,800
his parents didn't give him enough attention.

2237
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:52,760
So this kind of

2238
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:54,280
feeling comes from his childhood.

2239
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:55,200
For example, his

2240
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,480
low sense of self-worth.

2241
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,000
He always feels

2242
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
like he doesn't deserve to have these things.

2243
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:03,080
I think maybe it's because he cares.

2244
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:03,760
Yes, I think

2245
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:04,920
caring is one of the reasons.

2246
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:05,720
Because he cares,

2247
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:06,720
he feels inferior.

2248
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:07,400
He wonders how he

2249
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:08,760
suddenly isn't good enough in any way.

2250
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:12,320
How does a person dispel

2251
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:13,840
their own sense of unworthiness?

2252
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:15,480
The most fundamental way is

2253
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:16,920
to build

2254
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:18,840
an objective understanding of oneself.

2255
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:20,480
You know where you fall short,

2256
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,040
and you also know your strengths.

2257
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:23,240
When you can believe

2258
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:24,240
that this is

2259
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:26,440
an objective evaluation of your own worth,

2260
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:27,960
that's when you can truly

2261
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:29,560
become confident.

2262
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:30,720
People who don't understand themselves

2263
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:32,880
cannot build genuine confidence.

2264
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:35,000
On the other hand, I also think

2265
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,400
there's no need to exaggerate

2266
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:37,800
this so-called sense of having problems.

2267
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:38,280
People nowadays

2268
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:39,080
tend to like thinking

2269
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:39,880
"I have this problem,"

2270
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:40,720
"I have that problem."

2271
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:42,360
This is just a feeling of youth.

2272
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:44,200
When you grow up, you won't feel this way anymore.

2273
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:45,360
Because during youth,

2274
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:46,400
when your heart is moved,

2275
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,560
you will have this kind of

2276
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:49,120
sense of inferiority.

2277
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:51,400
Actually, it's quite a beautiful thing.

2278
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,680
I actually really like

2279
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:55,840
what she said about being objective.

2280
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,240
I have my own insight about this.

2281
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:00,160
First of all,

2282
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:01,960
I think you shouldn't idealize others.

2283
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:05,120
Between people,

2284
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,240
it's less about gaps

2285
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:07,920
and more, I think, about

2286
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:08,840
differences.

2287
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:10,760
A gap is a fact,

2288
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:13,040
it implies a judgment of higher or lower, good or bad.

2289
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:15,000
But differences

2290
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,840
actually emphasize what's simply not the same.

2291
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:20,840
In a healthy, long-lasting relationship,

2292
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:23,160
the relationship will never make you

2293
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:25,760
constantly feel unworthy.

2294
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:27,920
If you're in a relationship

2295
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:28,640
and you feel

2296
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:30,920
worthless for a long time,

2297
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:32,360
then I think the problem

2298
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:33,000
lies in the relationship,

2299
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,280
not in yourself.

2300
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:36,800
So sometimes, don't

2301
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:37,600
over-reflect on yourself,

2302
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,000
and don't idealize others too much.

2303
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:42,040
Lastly, I want to say

2304
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:42,920
still,

2305
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,200
love yourself.

2306
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:47,880
Love yourself, recognize yourself,

2307
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:49,040
and accept yourself.

2308
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:50,680
Only after loving yourself

2309
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:51,680
can you have

2310
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:53,520
a healthy relationship.

2311
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:54,240
You must have yourself first,

2312
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:54,720
then love can follow.

2313
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:55,520
This is definitely

2314
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,000
Actually, I can share a method.

2315
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,200
It's not just about loving yourself,

2316
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:00,040
but also

2317
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:01,280
in relationships with others,

2318
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,480
something I've always practiced myself.

2319
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:05,280
Start from a place of love,

2320
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:07,240
not from a place of fear.

2321
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,080
When I do something,

2322
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:12,960
if I'm afraid I won't be accepted by others,

2323
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:13,880
and I work hard because of that fear,

2324
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:16,560
it's different from working to become a better version of myself

2325
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:18,400
because I genuinely want to and feel happy doing it.

2326
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:19,560
The result might be the same,

2327
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:20,840
but the mindset

2328
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,160
is completely different.

2329
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:23,600
Or,

2330
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:24,240
in a relationship,

2331
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:25,480
for example, sending a message.

2332
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:27,000
If I text her,

2333
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,120
it could be because I don't want her to worry about me,

2334
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:30,760
or because I want to share

2335
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:31,760
what's going on in my life with her.

2336
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:33,120
That's coming from a place of love.

2337
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:34,000
But if it's out of fear,

2338
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,200
like if I don't text her,

2339
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:36,720
she might get mad at me again.

2340
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:38,200
That's such a hassle.

2341
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:39,360
So I might as well just send the message.

2342
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:40,960
That's acting out of fear.

2343
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:42,200
I don't know if everyone

2344
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:43,200
can understand this point,

2345
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,400
but it applies to yourself

2346
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:46,680
and to others as well.

2347
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:47,720
As long as you start

2348
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:49,800
from your own starting point,

2349
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,000
you can always act out of love

2350
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,760
instead of out of fear.

2351
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,800
I think what we're really discussing is

2352
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:57,840
the troubles of growing up.

2353
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:58,840
This process of growing up

2354
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,040
is about us

2355
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:01,160
at every stage of life

2356
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:04,240
having challenges we need to overcome.

2357
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:06,160
It's like something I read before:

2358
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:08,240
Except for physical pain,

2359
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:09,560
all other pain

2360
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,160
is caused by ourselves.

2361
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:12,400
I have another saying

2362
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:13,200
that's especially important

2363
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:14,400
that I want to share with the audience.

2364
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:15,760
That is,

2365
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:17,680
you don't need to solve all your own problems

2366
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:19,000
before starting a relationship.

2367
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:22,520
Although many people say

2368
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:24,520
that you should fix yourself first,

2369
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:25,480
that you need to be whole

2370
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:27,320
to have a good relationship,

2371
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:29,520
I actually disagree with that.

2372
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:30,600
Because

2373
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:31,760
sometimes there are problems

2374
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:33,200
you can't solve on your own.

2375
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:34,240
You carry them with you,

2376
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:35,480
and maybe when you meet someone else,

2377
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:36,680
in your relationship,

2378
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:37,960
they can heal you,

2379
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:39,000
they can change you.

2380
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,000
So don't wait until

2381
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,240
you feel "ready" to start.

2382
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:43,560
You can start at any time.

2383
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:45,440
Everything happens for the best.

2384
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:01,720
Hurry!

2385
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:09,400
She found out.

2386
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:15,760
What's wrong?

2387
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:17,640
Do you know how to use a computer?

2388
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:18,120
Yes.

2389
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:18,960
Help me with the computer.

2390
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:19,920
Come here.

2391
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:20,800
I almost threw away his computer just now.

2392
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:21,640
I almost tossed it out as trash.

2393
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:23,520
You guys got a computer too, right?

2394
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:24,480
I got one too.

2395
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:27,400
I need to use it for work today.

2396
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:28,640
But I'm a total computer idiot.

2397
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:29,480
Here they come.

2398
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:32,000
Hello, everyone.

2399
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:42,520
She's still here.

2400
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:44,000
She's been waiting for a chance.

2401
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:46,040
Where are you going to do it?

2402
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:46,840
Over there.

2403
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:47,440
Over there.

2404
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:48,640
It's really pretty.

2405
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,440
You haven't been to this area before.

2406
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:01,040
Didn't we walk around here on the first day?

2407
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:01,720
Who?

2408
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:02,640
Who walked around?

2409
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:04,240
You came late that day.

2410
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:08,440
Got it.

2411
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:10,240
The seven of us walked around on the first day.

2412
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:13,680
He went for a walk with Xiaoyuan (Lu Yuan).

2413
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:17,320
So you see, Duoduo (Ke Ailin),

2414
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:18,320
is very straightforward.

2415
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:19,760
Yeah, direct.

2416
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:21,320
Like when walking the dog,

2417
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:22,640
she doesn't go in circles.

2418
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:25,160
She might only go in circles when spraying perfume.

2419
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:28,560
What do you need to do with your computer?

2420
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:29,240
What do you need?

2421
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:31,000
I need Xiaohongshu.

2422
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,440
That kind of app.

2423
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:33,560
Give me your phone.

2424
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:33,960
Give me your phone.

2425
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,440
Why did you change your wallpaper?

2426
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:41,440
Because I thought the old one was too ugly.

2427
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:42,600
Changing your wallpaper in secret.

2428
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:43,160
That one was too ugly.

2429
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:43,760
Is this outfit you're wearing

2430
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:44,480
the same as the one in that photo?

2431
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:45,160
Yes.

2432
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:45,760
Do you think it looks the same?

2433
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:46,640
I don't think it looks alike at all.

2434
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:48,720
Why is Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng)

2435
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:50,160
acting like such a third wheel?

2436
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:52,680
What else do you need?

2437
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:53,560
I downloaded both for you.

2438
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:54,400
I downloaded Xiaohongshu.

2439
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:58,440
But Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng) can

2440
01:22:58,440 --> 01:22:59,800
also leave for a while.

2441
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:02,880
He won't even notice, right?

2442
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:04,360
No, it's mainly because the two of them

2443
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:06,440
just finished talking about something so deep.

2444
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:07,640
At this moment, you know what I mean?

2445
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:09,120
When two people are connected,

2446
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:09,960
at this moment, the two of them

2447
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:11,960
the connection hasn't been broken yet.

2448
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:18,960
Or rather, a webpage.

2449
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:20,480
Okay.

2450
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:22,880
Why is he wiping the table?

2451
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:23,520
He notices things that need to be done.

2452
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:25,680
I really want to bring him into

2453
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:26,600
my own team.

2454
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:29,840
What were you two doing in the room just now?

2455
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:30,800
Two men.

2456
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:32,680
None of your business.

2457
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:34,360
Yeah.

2458
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:35,800
Don’t bring Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng)

2459
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:36,480
upstairs.

2460
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:37,920
Our first floor is already very

2461
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:38,480
lonely.

2462
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:39,440
It’s really quiet.

2463
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:41,000
So what?

2464
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:41,760
You come upstairs.

2465
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:42,840
If you really like it,

2466
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:43,520
you can come downstairs.

2467
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:44,760
It seems we guys still

2468
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:46,080
have some empty dorm rooms.

2469
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:48,160
Jiao is really funny.

2470
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:49,280
I know, but I can’t come downstairs.

2471
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:50,600
You’re living alone upstairs anyway.

2472
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:52,760
You’d be living alone downstairs too.

2473
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:53,720
Then I should...

2474
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:54,600
I shouldn’t be here.

2475
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:56,760
He noticed it too.

2476
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:00,920
He’s pretty observant.

2477
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:01,920
So he doesn’t just notice chores.

2478
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:04,200
Can you take a look?

2479
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:05,440
Sure.

2480
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:07,040
Then I’ll go downstairs to get a drink.

2481
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:07,480
Okay.

2482
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:20,160
Hello.

2483
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:20,680
Hi.

2484
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:21,240
Hello.

2485
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:34,280
She played it.

2486
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:35,040
Lanlan (Xu Rulan)

2487
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:35,880
She played it.

2488
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:37,520
So impressive.

2489
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:38,480
Really impressive.

2490
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:39,360
You call that not knowing how?

2491
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:44,000
This scene

2492
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,000
is really

2493
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,680
so romantic.

2494
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:47,560
This is the first time in my life

2495
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:48,240
I've ever touched a dog.

2496
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:49,440
Yesterday was my first time touching a dog.

2497
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:52,280
You've never touched a dog?

2498
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:53,400
I've never touched a dog before.

2499
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:54,760
Are you afraid of dogs or something?

2500
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:55,600
Yeah, I'm afraid of dogs.

2501
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:57,280
I was chased by a dog when I was little.

2502
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:58,200
Yeah, chased by a dog.

2503
01:24:58,200 --> 01:24:59,360
Luckily, I could run fast as a kid.

2504
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:04,160
My kitten can smile.

2505
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:06,040
It really can smile.

2506
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:07,720
I get it.

2507
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:09,120
Really.

2508
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:09,800
You don't believe me.

2509
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:10,560
I believe you.

2510
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:12,200
My kitten can smile too.

2511
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:13,720
No, my kitten really can smile.

2512
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:14,920
My kitten really can smile too.

2513
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:15,440
Really?

2514
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:16,080
Really.

2515
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:17,760
Wait, don't you have a dog?

2516
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:18,440
I have a cat too.

2517
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:19,320
I have a British Shorthair.

2518
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:22,360
So you have a cat and a dog at home?

2519
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:29,200
Do you not like going out much?

2520
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:30,040
Going out a lot.

2521
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:31,520
Yeah, that's what you like.

2522
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,760
I prefer staying in Hangzhou.

2523
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:35,640
No one

2524
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:36,720
takes me out anyway.

2525
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:44,880
So you like staying in?

2526
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:46,360
But I don't like staying at home.

2527
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:48,120
Then what do you usually do when you go out?

2528
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:49,400
Take a walk.

2529
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:50,640
I can go for a walk by myself.

2530
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:52,720
Just walk alone.

2531
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:55,640
I can stroll in the park for over an hour.

2532
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:57,480
Twenty minutes in the park.

2533
01:25:57,480 --> 01:25:58,160
I really like it.

2534
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:01,680
I like it too.

2535
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:02,760
Me too.

2536
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:12,600
He really can do anything.

2537
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:21,160
I'm back.

2538
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:25,680
Do you want to drink this?

2539
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:27,760
What is this?

2540
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:29,280
A special mix.

2541
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:32,040
So it's...

2542
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:32,720
Just have a sip.

2543
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:33,400
Try it.

2544
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:34,120
Just have a sip.

2545
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:34,520
Try it.

2546
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:35,120
Okay.

2547
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:37,640
Then I'll pour it into mine.

2548
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:41,400
Don't get tipsy.

2549
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:48,760
You seem to think I'm a total lightweight.

2550
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,840
You just came up to bring me a drink.

2551
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:51,720
And then you left.

2552
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:56,480
Okay.

2553
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:56,960
Alright.

2554
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:04,040
Isn't that so I don't bother you?

2555
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:05,960
Okay.

2556
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:06,600
It's fine.

2557
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:08,240
Let me see.

2558
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:09,120
What are you doing?

2559
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,520
Did you drink this all by yourself?

2560
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:24,120
I'll add a bit more for you.

2561
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:26,720
Make me another drink, please.

2562
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:28,920
You're still drinking?

2563
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:29,880
Can you handle it?

2564
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:32,440
Give me two, then.

2565
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:33,720
I think

2566
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:35,520
Jue'er (Wang Jue) might want one too.

2567
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:38,440
We don't have that many lychees.

2568
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:39,880
Then pick something else.

2569
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:41,000
We're out.

2570
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:42,400
Choose something else.

2571
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:43,240
Like what?

2572
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:45,000
Another homemade tea.

2573
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:48,280
Why don't you search for me on your phone?

2574
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:49,080
See what else there is.

2575
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:51,760
Here you go.

2576
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:58,120
The main thing is, there's no ice.

2577
01:27:58,120 --> 01:27:58,520
You know that, right?

2578
01:27:58,520 --> 01:27:59,360
Just have it tomorrow.

2579
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:02,240
Drink it tomorrow.

2580
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:04,120
Yeah.

2581
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:04,840
Aren't you still working?

2582
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:05,440
Bye.

2583
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:13,480
He really is...

2584
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:15,000
Is he leaving or not?

2585
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,400
Going or not?

2586
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:20,160
He tried to leave three times but didn't.

2587
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:32,880
Is Chenchen (Wang Lechen) interested in her?

2588
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,000
He is interested.

2589
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:34,800
Yeah, he is.

2590
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:38,760
Alright.

2591
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:40,440
I'll call it a day, then.

2592
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:45,600
You carry this.

2593
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:46,160
I'll carry this.

2594
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:46,840
Is that okay?

2595
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:50,880
Give me that one.

2596
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:54,680
No, give me your red cardboard.

2597
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:57,720
A shy smile.

2598
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:00,240
He even helped her with her bag.

2599
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:02,440
You really know how to make a move.

2600
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:06,280
There's chemistry.

2601
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:12,320
Let's go.

2602
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:18,440
The way those two interact,

2603
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:19,480
why do I like it so much?

2604
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:20,160
It feels like Duoduo (Ke Ailin)

2605
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:21,440
is holding a kite string in her hand.

2606
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:23,800
Yeah, I think they

2607
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:24,840
the way they communicate right now

2608
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:26,160
is really comfortable.

2609
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:27,880
I think, whether it's the guy or the girl,

2610
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:29,280
they can both feel

2611
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:31,800
the playful teasing between them.

2612
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:33,520
I think

2613
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:34,200
Duoduo (Ke Ailin)

2614
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:35,160
might have too much energy.

2615
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:35,880
What I'm really worried about

2616
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:36,280
is this:

2617
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:36,760
I really like

2618
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:37,160
Duoduo (Ke Ailin)'s

2619
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:37,640
personality.

2620
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:38,440
But I'm especially afraid

2621
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:40,320
that they'll end up just being buddies.

2622
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:44,040
Because this girl really relies on the guy,

2623
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:46,440
she's good at getting him to do things for her,

2624
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:47,800
and then she feels that love through it.

2625
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:48,600
But I don't really think

2626
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:49,640
Wang Lechen is someone

2627
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:52,280
who's always willing to give.

2628
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:53,240
He also needs someone to rely on.

2629
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:54,400
He also needs someone to rely on.

2630
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:55,440
You really are

2631
01:29:56,240 --> 01:29:57,040
an advanced

2632
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:58,600
dating show observer.

2633
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:12,760
Ruilong finally showed up.

2634
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:13,120
Hello.

2635
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:13,520
Hello.

2636
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:14,200
Hello.

2637
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:22,720
Ruilong, I get you, bro.

2638
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:31,280
Hello.

2639
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:32,720
I'm just here to take a look.

2640
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:35,840
Let me take a look.

2641
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:36,760
And then,

2642
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:38,320
Good night.

2643
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:39,520
Good night.

2644
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:54,680
Hello.

2645
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:55,560
Let's take a walk.

2646
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:58,320
So you're going to keep working out, right?

2647
01:30:58,320 --> 01:30:59,040
Yes.

2648
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:09,800
Why does it still feel like he

2649
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:11,400
doesn't have even a bit of that

2650
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:12,400
falling-in-love feeling?

2651
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:13,040
Ruilong.

2652
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:15,640
So, in the whole group,

2653
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:16,840
the most mysterious person

2654
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:17,760
is Ruilong.

2655
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:19,880
Let's take a selfie.

2656
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:20,440
I want to join too.

2657
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:22,840
Can I block myself in every photo?

2658
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:25,360
See if I’m in the shot.

2659
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:28,720
You’re not in the photo, so you don’t need to say "cheese."

2660
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:30,560
Then why should I be in the photo?

2661
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:32,960
Actually,

2662
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:33,640
Dr. Fang (Fang Yijiong), that

2663
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:34,760
spot should be

2664
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:35,720
for you.

2665
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:39,120
I’ll take the photo for you.

2666
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:42,400
Dr. Fang (Fang Yijiong) just doesn’t want to be in the photo.

2667
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:44,520
Sit.

2668
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:45,840
You sit here.

2669
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:47,320
Lie down in the middle.

2670
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:50,360
Come on, come on.

2671
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:51,080
One,

2672
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:52,080
two,

2673
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:53,520
three.

2674
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:57,320
Someone only opened one eye.

2675
01:31:57,320 --> 01:31:57,920
Just one.

2676
01:31:57,920 --> 01:31:59,320
They were blinking.

2677
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:01,120
They did it on purpose.

2678
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:02,320
Meticulous Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong).

2679
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:06,280
Sure.

2680
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:07,040
Beautiful.

2681
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:08,200
So pretty.

2682
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:08,800
It has to be

2683
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:10,280
the Huawei nova 14 Ultra's

2684
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:11,320
Red Maple True Color lens.

2685
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:12,320
The colors are so true to life.

2686
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:15,080
Seriously, every shot of people turns out great.

2687
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:16,440
Here, pass it around.

2688
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:18,920
Jin Yuxing, you really look

2689
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:20,320
exactly the same on camera as in real life.

2690
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:21,080
Me?

2691
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:22,680
You.

2692
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:37,080
What's wrong?

2693
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:40,760
Actually, tonight

2694
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:41,920
even though I spent most of my time

2695
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:43,880
with the group,

2696
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:44,880
I still

2697
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:46,520
didn't get to be with the person I wanted to know better.

2698
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:47,720
Why?

2699
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:50,560
Let's split up.

2700
01:32:58,840 --> 01:32:59,960
Hello, everyone.

2701
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:00,880
Hello.

2702
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:01,880
Hi.

2703
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:18,600
Yeah, it seems like

2704
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:19,320
Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng) and

2705
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:19,640
Lanlan (Xu Rulan)

2706
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:20,840
haven't really interacted since dinner.

2707
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:22,520
Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng) and

2708
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:26,800
Nicole don't want to go out.

2709
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:34,720
Are you sleepy?

2710
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:37,200
Why did you go so far in?

2711
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:40,920
Come here, let me help you out.

2712
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:44,760
You "kid"...

2713
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:02,480
Why are you out of breath?

2714
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:07,120
Are you okay?

2715
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,080
I'm fine.

2716
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:16,680
Who is that?

2717
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:20,600
This is...

2718
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:23,400
Jiao, what are you doing?

2719
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:26,280
Why did you go straight there?

2720
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:27,400
Into Nicole's nest?

2721
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:29,680
Why are you taking over someone else's nest?

2722
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:31,160
No, that's not it.

2723
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:32,320
It just rushed right in.

2724
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:34,200
So I had to follow it in.

2725
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:35,440
Then it just kept panting there.

2726
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:36,200
So I stayed here to keep it company.

2727
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:37,760
What's wrong?

2728
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:38,720
Little one.

2729
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:44,040
I think just now it was...

2730
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:44,840
It really was.

2731
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:47,040
Right?

2732
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:49,200
But it's nothing, really.

2733
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:50,920
Everyone will interact.

2734
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:52,960
After interacting...

2735
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:54,680
Yeah, so what I mean is...

2736
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:55,840
Let them interact for a bit.

2737
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:57,640
Give them some time to interact.

2738
01:34:57,640 --> 01:34:58,920
Yes.

2739
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:00,360
It's okay.

2740
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:01,000
Baby.

2741
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:05,120
Lick, lick.

2742
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:06,920
It's okay.

2743
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:13,720
So right now,

2744
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:15,960
how are you feeling?

2745
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:18,400
How am I feeling?

2746
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:19,200
Is it complicated?

2747
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:22,560
I'm about the same as it.

2748
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:25,880
But

2749
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:29,440
you still have plenty of time at the beginning anyway.

2750
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:29,920
Yeah.

2751
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:30,960
You can spend more time together.

2752
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:31,760
Yes.

2753
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:33,600
Yes.

2754
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:36,320
Rationally, I can totally accept it.

2755
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:37,640
There's really no problem at all.

2756
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:39,280
But it's just that

2757
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:41,680
the emotional side of me

2758
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:42,840
feels a little

2759
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:43,920
just a tiny bit

2760
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:44,520
Yeah, just a little.

2761
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:46,440
A little bit of disappointment.

2762
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:47,720
Yeah, there is.

2763
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:49,560
But actually, it's okay.

2764
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:50,080
It's fine.

2765
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:51,720
Yeah, when Nicole just came back

2766
01:35:51,720 --> 01:35:53,040
I already felt much better.

2767
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:54,080
Yeah.

2768
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:55,520
Because I really do like it.

2769
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:59,280
That's the charm of having a pet.

2770
01:35:59,280 --> 01:35:59,880
Yeah.

2771
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:02,320
I really like Nicole.

2772
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:06,360
That's great.

2773
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:07,120
That's really great.

2774
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:14,640
Everything is just beginning.

2775
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,000
Let's observe first.

2776
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:16,720
Let's just watch for now.

2777
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:17,880
No need to rush.

2778
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:19,200
Yes.

2779
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:22,960
Actually, sometimes we’re under a lot of pressure.

2780
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:24,840
And we go through a lot during the day.

2781
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:25,720
A lot of things.

2782
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:26,480
But when you get home,

2783
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:27,200
and see your pet,

2784
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:30,040
I really think it’s something that makes you feel

2785
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:31,320
very healed.

2786
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:32,560
Extremely healed.

2787
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:35,360
It also brings you emotional value.

2788
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:38,160
Every year,

2789
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:39,280
the first date

2790
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:40,440
is quite important.

2791
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:41,560
The first date is here.

2792
01:36:41,560 --> 01:36:42,160
Heading out.

2793
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:42,960
Let's go.

2794
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:45,160
Let's set off.

2795
01:36:45,160 --> 01:36:46,080
That day, I was slow to act.

2796
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:46,960
Today, I have to

2797
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:47,880
go for it.

2798
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:49,680
I slid down the slide.

2799
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:50,400
That was intense.

2800
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:53,680
Dr. Fang has already left.

2801
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:55,440
What? He left?

2802
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:57,280
But we don't know whose gift is whose.

2803
01:36:58,080 --> 01:36:58,880
There's also a gift exchange.

2804
01:36:59,360 --> 01:36:59,920
Pick one.

2805
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:02,400
Do you have any ideas now?

2806
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:04,080
Just take this one.

2807
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:05,680
You're not even looking at the others.

2808
01:37:05,880 --> 01:37:07,440
You really have a strong sense of possession.

2809
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:07,880
Dr. Fang.

2810
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:11,040
He's making a move.

2811
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:12,960
If you don't pick it, who would dare to?

2812
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:15,440
How about the two of us pick first?

2813
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:17,120
Be more decisive.

2814
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:17,840
Yesterday it was Duoduo.

2815
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:18,880
Today it's

2816
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:19,240
Chichi.

2817
