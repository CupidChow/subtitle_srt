1
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,480
Breakfast is in the flower house.

2
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,480
It must be Le Chen.

3
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:46,960
So much.

4
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,720
Le Chen cooked this.

5
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,080
Look at Le Chen.

6
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
He left little notes.

7
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,920
Big bite, smells so good.

8
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,040
Showing affection so early in the morning.

9
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,680
This morning is just too sweet.

10
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,400
So sweet.

11
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,520
It's really sweet.

12
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,680
Can't help but want a bite.

13
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,680
Naturally refreshing and sweet.

14
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,520
Master Kong Jasmine Pomelo Tea.

15
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,440
Nice.

16
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,840
Cheers.

17
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,680
It has not only jasmine fragrance,

18
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,440
but also the sweet and sour of pomelo.

19
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,800
Super tasty.

20
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,240
Yes.

21
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,800
The small bottle is really cute.

22
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,320
Hello.

23
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,240
Welcome.

24
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,760
Hello.

25
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,720
You had an appointment?

26
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:22,960
Yes.

27
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,600
This way, please.

28
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,120
Okay.

29
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,120
What are they here for?

30
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:30,600
Scalp treatment.

31
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,600
"Soul extractor."

32
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,440
So ticklish.

33
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,080
Try again.

34
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,280
Let me try again.

35
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,800
Can we skip this step?

36
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,400
Lan Lan, you're scared.

37
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,240
You're afraid of being tickled.

38
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,720
I'm really ticklish.

39
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,840
Let me help you relax your scalp.

40
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,600
Okay.

41
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,080
Have you tried that before?

42
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,720
No.

43
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,880
It's super comfortable.

44
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,720
You can tell them how strong or gentle you want it.

45
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,120
Stop laughing.

46
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,080
When you laugh, I can't stop either.

47
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,760
It looks so relaxing.

48
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,520
I really love head massages.

49
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,520
Feels like my soul is being extracted.

50
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,200
Yeah.

51
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,520
So,

52
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,840
You've ridden the little train?

53
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,520
Yes, I have.

54
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,320
How was it? Was it okay?

55
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,880
It was...

56
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,360
It felt like

57
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,680
a heavy stone

58
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,200
suddenly

59
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,720
was lifted off my body.

60
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,800
I felt so relaxed in that moment.

61
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,840
I was still pretending to be strong.

62
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,680
Suddenly I disliked who I was a few days ago.

63
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,480
But there's no need for that.

64
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,800
That's all part of me.

65
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,280
I truly felt it.

66
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,720
It's also unforgettable.

67
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,520
Honestly, I don't really regret it.

68
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,880
I think of it as

69
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,080
one time in my life

70
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,480
of impulse,

71
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,640
or maybe a courageous attempt.

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,120
Actually, sometimes

73
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,200
a little impulse can be quite beautiful.

74
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,440
So have you thought it through?

75
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,120
Yes.

76
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,920
It's just that,

77
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,000
The way I interact with Brother Jiao is

78
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,200
I'm very relaxed.

79
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,440
And I think he

80
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,960
creates a lot of

81
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,800
dreamy things, you know?

82
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,600
It's very idealistic.

83
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,400
And he's someone who values rituals.

84
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,360
But with Xiao Fang,

85
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,160
it's very everyday.

86
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,360
We don't really

87
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,400
often

88
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,040
specifically discuss

89
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,600
very idealistic topics.

90
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,760
Or

91
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,440
have deep conversations about opinions.

92
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,080
Our interactions are more like

93
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,760
focusing on what's happening now.

94
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,200
Like cooking together.

95
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,680
Making tea eggs together.

96
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,720
Dr. Fang is

97
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,320
someone who lives in the moment.

98
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,240
Yeah.

99
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,520
We're about to wash our hair now.

100
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,440
Okay.

101
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,400
You know,

102
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,560
when someone says something,

103
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,480
it's not actually that funny.

104
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,960
But when it comes from them,

105
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,760
I just find it hilarious for no reason.

106
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,560
Why is that?

107
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,800
She thinks everything Dr. Fang says is funny.

108
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,240
Yeah.

109
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,360
Sometimes it's not about the words

110
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,240
or the things themselves.

111
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,720
Maybe it's just

112
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,680
the person sitting across from you

113
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,320
or the one beside you.

114
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,560
Their presence just makes you happy.

115
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,200
Right.

116
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,040
So when you're with someone,

117
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,280
you might

118
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,960
feel genuinely happy without realizing it.

119
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,800
Does that mean

120
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,480
they're someone who can

121
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,960
make you feel happy,

122
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,640
and is right for you?

123
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,920
I don't think it necessarily means

124
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,280
they're definitely

125
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,320
the one who makes you happy

126
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,520
and is right for you.

127
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,000
But in that moment when you laugh,

128
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
they are definitely someone

129
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,960
who makes you happy.

130
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,160
Happy.

131
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,560
Because when you overthink it,

132
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,560
your happiness in that moment isn't as pure.

133
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,880
But I think sometimes

134
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,080
that moment is really important.

135
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,800
Even if it's just an experience,

136
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,360
it's still meaningful.

137
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,440
She said something like this.

138
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,160
She said,

139
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,400
When you're with this person,

140
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,320
you feel genuine happiness.

141
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,240
I think that's already quite rare.

142
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,720
I feel that

143
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,840
happiness is very important.

144
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:07,800
Because I think

145
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,840
happiness is in the moment.

146
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,240
It's the first thing you sense.

147
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,160
So happiness should be the starting point.

148
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,960
Then, whether you can, together,

149
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,600
gradually become

150
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,360
the right person for each other,

151
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,080
I think that's the best.

152
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,760
Of course.

153
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,400
Come on.

154
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,720
Let's keep watching.

155
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,080
Lan Lan, let me tell you,

156
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,560
the Pantene High-Active Peptide Bubble Series

157
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,720
is truly amazing.

158
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,760
The Peptide Bounce Shampoo

159
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,920
gives our hair a deep cleanse.

160
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,240
And paired with

161
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,480
the Bubble Hair Mask with skincare-grade peptides,

162
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,280
it can rebuild hair core protein from the roots.

163
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:43,960
Just one use

164
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,920
makes our hair

165
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,240
bouncy and shiny for days.

166
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,040
That's impressive.

167
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,400
My hair has just recently

168
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,280
become dry and frizzy from the sun.

169
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,680
Finally, I can give it

170
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,360
some proper care.

171
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,400
Yes.

172
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,560
Alright, let's go dry our hair.

173
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,800
Okay, thank you.

174
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,360
My hair is really smooth and silky now.

175
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,800
And it's so bouncy.

176
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,440
That's amazing.

177
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:06,920
Right?

178
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,840
I feel like my whole vibe has improved.

179
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,960
Let's go.

180
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:10,640
Let's go.

181
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,480
You know, each time

182
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,400
you just use one capsule.

183
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,640
It's super convenient to use.

184
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,040
It's perfect for people like me

185
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,320
who are really busy at work

186
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,400
and travel a lot.

187
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,440
You can stock up for hair care.

188
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,040
So while our new product

189
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,680
is still on promotion,

190
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,080
go search for it online.

191
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,840
Get Pantene for just one cent.

Stock up for yourself.

193
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,520
Has Rui Long come back?

194
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:32,960
Rui Long hasn't come back.

195
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,400
No.

196
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,440
No.

197
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,160
Okay.

198
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,200
I still have some. I do.

199
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,200
No one has come back.

200
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,040
No one's back.

201
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,280
It's so late.

202
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,680
Today is so strange.

203
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,440
But I know someone is out tonight.

204
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,880
At the park, right?

205
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,840
I think so.

206
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,720
Because I saw the park gate was closed.

207
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,960
Liu Zihan and Chi Chi.

208
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,960
That's nice.

209
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,720
They close the gate when someone's on a date.

210
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,560
Just for the two of them.

211
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:57,760
Well,

212
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,480
now we can guess

213
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,200
and rule out the four of us.

214
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,840
It's easy to guess now.

215
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,280
Yu Xing is probably guessing too.

216
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,080
Could it be Chi Chi and Zihan?

217
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,880
Yes.

218
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,920
Hello.

219
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,440
It's Chi Chi and Liu Zihan.

220
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,280
Hello.

221
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,120
How was your day?

222
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,280
It was a tough day, right?

223
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,800
Not bad.

224
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,000
This flower is for you.

225
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,120
Thank you.

226
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:52,800
It suits me well.

227
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,440
Yes, I picked it especially today.

228
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,840
We're on the same wavelength.

229
00:10:59,360 --> 00:10:59,760
Yeah.

230
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,560
So was the trip back tiring today?

231
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,520
It was okay.

232
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,080
Then tonight let's just

233
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,200
keep it light and fun.

234
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,160
What activity is it?

235
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,480
I've prepared a lot for this activity.

236
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,640
So tonight, the main thing is

237
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,560
just to have fun.

238
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,160
Okay?

239
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,160
The first part,

240
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,880
is actually inside this flower.

241
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,480
You can open it and take a look.

242
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,800
I'll hold this for you.

243
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,480
Adventure journey.

244
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,560
It's a Friday night park adventure.

245
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,560
The mystery person is...

246
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,480
The mystery person is me.

247
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,240
Me.

248
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,080
So mysterious.

249
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,720
I almost guessed it.

250
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,040
So what's the activity?

251
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,600
I think it's kind of fun.

252
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,600
Do you think it's fun?

253
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,520
Let's check it out later.

254
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,680
They agree with me too.

255
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,040
Paw Patrol.

256
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,680
Okay, we've arrived.

257
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,200
Alright, please get off.

258
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:14,800
Come on.

259
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,880
Archery.

260
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,520
Archery.

261
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,200
Archery.

262
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,680
Why is it called the Aim Challenge?

263
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,600
Did you see it?

264
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,400
Our goal today is

265
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,240
to hit that target.

266
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,680
You're overestimating me.

267
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,320
Honestly, I can't even see the target.

268
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,120
It's fine, I've tried before.

269
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,640
I've tried.

270
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,360
Should I go?

271
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,440
Do you know how?

272
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,480
Me...

273
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,000
Maybe.

274
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,200
Yeah, I must have before.

275
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,280
Hold it like this.

276
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,640
And pay attention to today's rules.

277
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,200
First, don't shoot at people.

278
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,720
Don't shoot at people.

279
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,400
Alright.

280
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,640
Just hit the target, okay?

281
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,640
Don't aim at people.

282
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,720
Honestly, it's a bit too far.

283
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,080
You aim first, let's aim.

284
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,080
Let's try it first.

285
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,600
Is it that easy to hit?

286
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,520
It's possible.

287
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,040
This...

288
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,240
Can you hit it?

289
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,080
You go first.

290
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,040
You can hit it.

291
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,320
Hit.

292
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,520
Did you hit it?

293
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,320
Hit.

294
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,400
Where?

295
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,040
Missed.

296
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,720
No, you try first.

297
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,200
I really don't believe you can hit it.

298
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,800
How could you possibly hit it?

299
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,440
It's really hard.

300
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,800
Did you hit it?

301
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:50,680
Maybe today

302
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,880
we'll be here all night.

303
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,640
Shooting until night.

304
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,600
Shooting until morning.

305
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,160
Who thought to put it so far away?

306
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,040
Just arrived.

307
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,400
Try again.

308
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:23,800
Hit.

309
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:29,960
The light's on.

310
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,360
So romantic.

311
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,400
Alright.

312
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,120
Is that okay?

313
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,640
It's not bad.

314
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,200
The first arrow was restrained, right?

315
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,120
On purpose.

316
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,280
Give it a try.

317
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,680
I really can't hit it.

318
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,960
It's really hard.

319
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,560
It's okay.

320
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,000
I'll move it closer for you.

321
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,440
He's very attentive.

322
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,920
How about this?

323
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,760
What do you think?

324
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,480
It could be a bit closer.

325
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,720
That's about right.

326
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,480
Pretty much.

327
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,440
Let's stick with this.

328
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,000
Give yourself a bit of a challenge.

329
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,400
It's so far, this is really challenging.

330
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,160
Seriously.

331
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,920
I'm so happy.

332
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,040
Clip this part right here.

333
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,160
Then keep your forearm straight.

334
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,880
Right.

335
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,480
What if I miss?

336
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,640
That would be awkward.

337
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,480
It's fine.

338
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,200
Just shoot, that's it.

339
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,080
Don't look.

340
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,880
Look.

341
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,440
He helped her put it on.

342
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,840
He got it set up.

343
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,280
I'm good again.

344
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,120
Not bad.

345
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,080
Alright, let's wrap this up.

346
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,960
Next.

347
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,640
It's really hard to find.

348
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,440
I've hidden it for a long time.

349
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,280
Feels like an amusement park vibe.

350
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,480
Mind and hand as one.

351
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,280
Mind and hand as one.

352
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,640
What's this now?

353
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,880
Let me set up this stand first.

354
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,720
Let me tell you, last time

355
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,600
I just didn't do well.

356
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,080
Alright.

357
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,880
How should I put this?

358
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,480
When I'm hitting the ball

359
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,200
I have to answer the other person's question.

360
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,400
If I don't catch it

361
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,400
I have to think of a word to compliment them.

362
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,920
What's in the zoo?

363
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,840
Tiger.

364
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,480
Snake.

365
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,840
Lion.

366
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,480
Come on, I'm listening.

367
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,200
I'm listening.

368
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,240
Handsome.

369
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,480
What quality do you most hope the other person has?

370
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,480
Sincerity.

371
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,560
Kindness.

372
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,160
What's in the zoo?

373
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,360
Your smile is beautiful.

374
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,880
Welcome to the third stage.

375
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,280
Speed and passion.

376
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,400
I like this one.

377
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:20,600
Go-kart.

378
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,360
Bye.

379
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,960
Speed up and overtake on the straight.

380
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,160
Overtake.

381
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,200
No.

382
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:32,640
Overtake.

383
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,160
Caught up.

384
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,280
Don't be nervous.

385
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,240
I get what he's thinking.

386
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,600
From the start, he always lets

387
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,680
the girl feel involved.

388
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,560
Seems like you have some talent in sports.

389
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,120
You really do have some talent.

390
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,000
Take a look.

391
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,160
Finish line unlocked.

392
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,040
Life is like a race.

393
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,000
But what's more important is crossing the finish line.

394
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,840
After taking off the helmet

395
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,720
we're both here.

396
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,520
He gives meaning to all of this.

397
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,040
I just hope we

398
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,240
can make it to the end together.

399
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,280
You wrote that really well.

400
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,520
So well written.

401
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,320
I think it's just

402
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,840
Life really is like that.

403
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:36,920
Yeah.

404
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,800
I'm touched.

405
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,120
Let's go then.

406
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,120
We're probably going to have a big meal now.

407
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:49,920
Really.

408
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,240
Let's go.

409
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,280
Go.

410
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,600
Did you come up with all of this yourself?

411
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,720
Really.

412
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,280
Seriously.

413
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,560
You're so interesting.

414
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,800
You're really talented.

415
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,480
How are you so smart?

416
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,240
You don't have to flatter me so much.

417
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,520
That's so sweet.

418
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,720
At this moment,

419
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,240
You just scored extra points.

420
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,360
Seriously, extra points.

421
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,720
What does this mean?

422
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,440
It just means please sit here.

423
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:35,920
I'll put this here for now.

424
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,040
Okay.

425
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,160
Wait a second.

426
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,000
What do you mean?

427
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,160
"Finishing move."

428
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,800
Chef's outfit.

429
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,120
So cool.

430
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,080
This is such a killer move.

431
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,880
He's really good at this.

432
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,080
I've got goosebumps.

433
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,920
From go-karting to this,

434
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,280
Honestly, every step he takes

435
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,080
is a "finishing move."

436
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,160
That's awesome.

437
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,840
So fierce, this move is ruthless.

438
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,680
I'm learning this.

439
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:29,840
Cool.

440
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,160
This is really

441
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,560
Welcome.

442
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,600
Today

443
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,360
is

444
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,840
the first day of the apartment's Japanese restaurant opening.

445
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,400
And I myself

446
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,160
Mr. Liu

447
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:47,600
Mr. Liu

448
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,640
will be the head chef for this event.

449
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,960
Mr. Liu practiced for about

450
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,040
half a day.

451
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,000
So please forgive me.

452
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,120
That's quite a while.

453
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,280
I think Zihan is really impressive.

454
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,560
He really puts his heart into it.

455
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,800
Turn on the lights.

456
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,680
Look at his execution.

457
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,400
He planned all of this.

458
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,880
He used to work in event planning.

459
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,840
He arranges the location,

460
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,760
he does everything.

461
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,080
That's definitely his strength.

462
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,840
He puts a lot of thought into it.

463
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,720
Menu.

464
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,600
We'll start with some appetizers.

465
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,320
Then we'll have some main dishes.

466
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:05,960
Of course.

467
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,040
Even if you don't eat, I'll still serve it.

468
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,120
Right, you don't really have another choice.

469
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,160
And today,

470
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,360
let's all just have a good time.

471
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,040
I'll go wash my hands first.

472
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,400
Looks very professional.

473
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,640
Pretty much looks the part.

474
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,960
Let me demonstrate first.

475
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,080
Don't joke around with the chef.

476
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,000
You'll get nervous later.

477
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,280
Isn't the chef supposed to chat?

478
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,000
Chatting.

479
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,120
Then let's just chat and not eat.

480
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,280
Just chatting is enough.

481
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,000
Let me think.

482
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,640
Let me check what's on my menu.

483
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,320
What did I write?

484
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,160
I forgot.

485
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,800
Okay, let me check.

486
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,280
I'll grab it first.

487
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,320
Let's start with this.

488
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,720
This scene is so romantic.

489
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,280
She's just sitting there watching him cook.

490
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,680
And when someone is focused on their work,

491
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,080
when they're really concentrating,

492
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,960
it's actually very attractive.

493
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,360
Yeah.

494
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,880
This is pretty nice.

495
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,080
He's cooking again, for sure.

496
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,120
But this time,

497
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,120
he looks even better cooking than before.

498
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:20,480
You...

499
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,880
He got the timing, place, and theme all right.

500
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,640
Yeah.

501
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,640
Is there anything you especially like to eat?

502
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:29,920
Japanese food.

503
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,680
I mean the type.

504
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,240
What are you slicing?

505
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,600
I like it a bit thicker.

506
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,240
Thicker.

507
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,160
Eat first.

508
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,400
But am I eating alone?

509
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,160
What about you?

510
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,760
I'll eat.

511
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,200
Go ahead.

512
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,280
How should I say it?

513
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,120
This is the only meal.

514
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,600
After seeing her take the first bite of salmon,

515
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,600
I got hungry for food.

516
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,640
Then maybe I'll fry one.

517
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,120
I want to fry one.

518
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,040
Tempura.

519
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,520
You do it.

520
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,320
Go ahead.

521
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:33,800
Go ahead.

522
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,320
That's good too.

523
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:35,920
Very good.

524
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,320
Because it feels involved.

525
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,560
There's something special about it.

526
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,480
I need to learn this.

527
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,120
I need to learn this.

528
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:40,440
Really.

529
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,760
I'm going to open a Japanese restaurant in the future.

530
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,160
But the oil temperature is a bit high now.

531
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,240
I'll get you an apron.

532
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,760
Otherwise, I'm afraid it'll splash on you.

533
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,800
Okay, I want one.

534
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,200
Later we'll try it raw.

535
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,360
It's fine.

536
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,760
My little shop just opened for the first time too.

537
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,840
It's okay, nobody knows.

538
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,120
Come on.

539
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,560
Liu Zihan ties it for her.

540
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,440
Tying the apron at this moment

541
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,960
feels different from tying it in the cabin.

542
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,520
The vibe is totally different.

543
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,320
Yeah.

544
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,480
No.

545
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,080
I will.

546
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,720
I'll tighten it a bit because of this.

547
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,160
Is that okay?

548
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:24,760
It's fine.

549
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,040
Feels about right.

550
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,600
But you can cook or fry it a bit longer.

551
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,080
We didn't keep track of the time.

552
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,440
You're at chef level.

553
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,800
Chefs always say "a little," "just right," "go by feel."

554
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,080
Doesn't feel ready yet.

555
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,520
I feel the same.

556
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,120
Emotional value.

557
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,840
So happy.

558
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,160
I think it's about done.

559
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,000
That's great.

560
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,760
I'll go outside then.

561
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,560
You're going outside?

562
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,240
Help me untie this.

563
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,600
Darn it, it's tied in a dead knot.

564
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,320
Give it to me.

565
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,840
Have some.

566
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,080
You can dip it in soy sauce.

567
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,120
Perfect.

568
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,440
Do you eat beef?

569
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:45,760
Here.

570
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,320
I can tell you really want to eat this.

571
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,000
We're here to have a proper meal.

572
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,520
You really surprised me.

573
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,880
I practiced a little.

574
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,600
But the way I look when I do archery

575
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,640
isn't too bad, right?

576
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,640
Like when I draw the bow.

577
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,200
Your form is very standard.

578
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,320
And you learn quickly.

579
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:05,800
Right?

580
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,560
Even with go-karting,

581
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,960
you picked up both archery and go-karting fast.

582
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,120
For archery,

583
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,240
first, you need to keep your forearm straight.

584
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,000
We're just pretending to look the part.

585
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,360
If we can look the part, that's already great.

586
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,000
He keeps affirming the other person.

587
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:24,960
Do you feel

588
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,560
like there's no sense of time in the cabin?

589
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,600
It's pretty nice.

590
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,600
No sense of time.

591
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,560
Today I felt especially

592
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,240
when I was playing ball just now,

593
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:31,840
I wanted to ask you something.

594
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,120
Like, what date is it today?

595
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,160
I don't know what day it is.

596
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,480
Right?

597
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,320
You probably can't answer either.

598
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,680
I already expected that.

599
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,200
But I forgot.

600
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,320
My memory, right?

601
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,000
It's really interesting not having a sense of time.

602
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,800
Because I think sometimes time

603
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,840
limits us.

604
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:45,760
For example,

605
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,120
like I have to sleep at a certain time.

606
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,680
Because I need to get up at a certain time the next morning.

607
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,120
I get anxious about time like that.

608
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,200
So, for example,

609
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,880
when I have weekends off,

610
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,440
Friday night is the happiest.

611
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,480
By Saturday night, I start feeling anxious.

612
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:57,960
Yeah.

613
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,280
Me too.

614
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,200
Yes.

615
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,640
On Saturday, maybe even before Saturday night,

616
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,200
I start feeling anxious.

617
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,240
I get anxious during the day on Saturday.

618
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:02,880
Yeah, same here.

619
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,240
Yeah, me too.

620
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,600
We're really on the same wavelength.

621
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,320
See?

622
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,200
The only time I have

623
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,600
is that moment after work on Friday night.

624
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,720
Leaving then is the happiest.

625
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,400
Yeah.

626
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,760
Yeah.

627
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,800
Until Friday night,

628
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,720
when I sleep and wake up the next morning,

629
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,520
the moment I open my eyes on Saturday morning,

630
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,560
I start feeling a bit uncomfortable.

631
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,640
That's how anxious personalities are.

632
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,560
Right after saying it,

633
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,720
it feels like the holiday isn't long enough.

634
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,200
And then you have to work again the next day.

635
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,120
Yeah.

636
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,720
He really understands her.

637
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,640
What she's thinking inside.

638
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,160
There's a kind of

639
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,080
feeling like your heart is opened up.

640
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,120
Yeah.

641
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,320
So on Friday nights,

642
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,320
how do you usually enjoy yourself?

643
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,040
There's still work to do.

644
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,440
There are still things to handle.

645
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,840
I tend to fill up my schedule.

646
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,080
I actually have very little time to rest.

647
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,600
So for you,

648
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,520
what counts as rest?

649
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,800
Just lying down and thinking about nothing.

650
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,520
Sleeping all day.

651
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,200
So you actually really hope

652
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,400
to have a day like that.

653
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,320
I don't want that.

654
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,800
I'm actually not looking forward to it.

655
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,720
A day like that.

656
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,280
ENTJ (Commander personality type)

657
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,520
So you need someone

658
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,480
to give you a reason

659
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,760
to let you rest for a whole day.

660
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,040
Yeah, I do need to relax more.

661
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,760
So for example,

662
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,760
you could give yourself a reason.

663
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,680
Like today is my...

664
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,720
One of my

665
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,360
more ceremonial days

666
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,640
So today, I want to give myself

667
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,400
a break

668
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,320
I never get time like this

669
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,480
You could try it, right?

670
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,880
Like today is my

671
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,960
100th day in Shanghai

672
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,000
I want to take a rest

673
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,960
Your 10,000th day idea is pretty interesting

674
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,320
Yeah

675
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,520
I think the 10,000th day

676
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,520
is really special when you still feel youthful

677
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,880
It's nice to celebrate it

678
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,200
Your 10,000th day since birth

679
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,400
Have you thought about how you'll spend your 10,000th day?

680
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,800
I think I can start planning now

681
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,560
You should really plan it well

682
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,640
Because it's even more important than a birthday

683
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,160
Right?

684
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:53,880
Yeah

685
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,600
What kind of scene did you imagine for today?

686
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,320
A scenario

687
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,600
I didn't really think about it

688
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,120
Because I kind of knew

689
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,320
Like, it would be something in the park

690
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,760
But I didn't expect it could be

691
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,720
this fun

692
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,080
I think today feels really ceremonial

693
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,840
I'll finish this bowl of rice

694
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,520
Done!

695
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,080
Found an excuse to finish it

696
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,320
He deserves it

697
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,440
He's always encouraging Chi Chi

698
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:43,800
No, not really

699
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,800
You're already great

700
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,200
You're really good

701
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,800
And he's very funny

702
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,480
Liu Zihan always

703
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,280
guides her

704
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,800
so she confidently chooses him

705
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,240
What I want is a firm response

706
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,520
and your firm choice

707
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,760
That's what I feel

708
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,840
Liu Zihan's social skills

709
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,880
are really high

710
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,720
Yeah

711
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,320
He took a

712
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,800
simple icebreaker

713
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,040
and quickly made it deep

714
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,400
The two of them

715
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,320
during the ball game part

716
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,440
He designed a segment

717
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,080
where they complimented each other

718
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,600
That's also a

719
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,400
social skill between people

720
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,240
It helps both people

721
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,160
increase their affection and get closer

722
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,120
Step by step, they moved into

723
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,320
deeper communication

724
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,680
Yes

725
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:24,720
It's when two people can start discussing

726
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,600
It's when two people can start discussing

727
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,600
stress and these kinds of issues

728
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,600
stress and these kinds of issues

729
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,960
You feel your relationship with this person

730
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,080
becomes much closer

731
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,760
What you said is really true

732
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,200
All us guys think that's a big plus

733
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:48,960
Gotta have dessert

734
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:51,520
Cake

735
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,440
Gotta have dessert

736
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,320
Are you serious?

737
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,040
So romantic

738
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,880
And this part here

739
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,880
Try pulling this little string

740
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,720
This is

741
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,640
Actually, there are some coupons on it

742
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,280
Amusement park coupon

743
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,040
Ride to work coupon

744
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,080
If you ever need it

745
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,600
just use this coupon to find me

746
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,760
This is impressive too

747
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,080
You've got some real skills

748
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,320
This is really impressive

749
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,760
If you ever need it

750
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,280
just use this coupon to find me

751
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,000
Really?

752
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,600
You prepared all this?

753
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,120
Hiking coupon

754
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,160
Of course I did

755
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,320
Though I might not be able to hike right now

756
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,240
So, about that

757
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,720
what about the amusement park coupon?

758
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,560
For the amusement park, you just have to

759
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,360
go with your heart racing

760
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,600
Thank you.

761
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,000
And about the cake,

762
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,160
Is it lychee?

763
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,000
Yes.

764
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:21,960
And then,

765
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,960
This was a bit last-minute.

766
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,520
I found one.

767
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:29,880
What?

768
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,000
Birthday cake.

769
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,920
Birthday cake.

770
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,160
A doll.

771
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,720
Whenever you want to make a wish,

772
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,880
you can make a wish.

773
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,080
I can make a wish anytime.

774
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,640
If you ever want me to sing for you,

775
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,680
the birthday cake song,

776
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,160
just ask me.

777
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,320
Hope you can put it

778
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,840
somewhere that suits you.

779
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,560
Thank you, this gift is amazing.

780
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,520
This is awesome too.

781
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,200
Let's light a candle.

782
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,920
You can choose to celebrate your birthday

783
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,520
or celebrate your 10,000th day in advance.

784
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,880
That's way too early.

785
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,600
So sweet.

786
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,680
Too sweet.

787
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,560
It's okay.

788
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,560
I'll just make a wish.

789
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,480
Make a wish.

790
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,000
We can wish together.

791
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,760
Make a wish, go!

792
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,280
Give it to me.

793
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,000
See, he's so thoughtful.

794
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,040
Really handsome.

795
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,640
Even the candle was a great choice.

796
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,520
So romantic.

797
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,080
This is just too great.

798
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,800
Is it done?

799
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,720
Done.

800
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,880
Should we eat now or take it back?

801
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,360
Take it back.

802
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:17,880
Take it back.

803
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,360
Honestly, I'm a bit full now.

804
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,400
Yeah, a bit stuffed.

805
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,080
And give this one.

806
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,240
This one first.

807
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:25,960
Or give it to me.

808
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,560
I can actually tie it to my hand.

809
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,080
Sure.

810
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,440
Tie it up.

811
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,680
Then I won't lose it.

812
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,760
I'll stand out in the crowd.

813
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,040
Mainly, don't let these coupons fly away.

814
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:39,840
Let's do it together.

815
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,000
We still have a lot

816
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,920
of things to do.

817
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,080
So romantic.

818
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,520
Done.

819
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,880
You're really thoughtful.

820
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,480
So sweet.

821
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,040
Bro, you really know how to make things special.

822
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,920
Looks rough and carefree, right?

823
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,960
Actually, rough on the outside but delicate inside.

824
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,120
Careful in the details.

825
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,200
And really funny.

826
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,080
Rough on the outside but delicate inside.

827
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,400
Even your eyes look different now.

828
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,000
So, shall we

829
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,080
take a photo?

830
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,080
Sure.

831
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,120
Make me look good in the photo.

832
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,280
Of course, don't worry.

833
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,120
Three, two, one.

834
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,640
Three, two, one.

835
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,200
Looks great.

836
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,400
He's really good at taking photos.

837
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,440
Zoom in, it looks even better.

838
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,240
Let me check.

839
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,280
Let me see again.

840
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,200
What do you think?

841
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,080
It looks really good.

842
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,320
Huawei nova 14 series.

843
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,600
Photos look amazing.

844
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,240
Right?

845
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,840
Super powerful rear camera.

846
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,080
Huawei nova 14 Ultra.

847
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,160
Every focal length captures real beauty.

848
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,600
Every focal length gives great shots.

849
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,320
Really looks great.

850
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,040
Right?

851
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,720
Let's head out.

852
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,080
Let's go.

853
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:09,640
Let's go.

854
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,160
This

855
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,160
deserves applause.

856
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:19,880
So impressive.

857
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,440
Really amazing.

858
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,960
Effective dating.

859
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,080
This really makes me want to

860
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,360
stand up.

861
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:24,760
Seriously.

862
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,600
So impressive.

863
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,840
Watching it, I really felt something.

864
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,600
Yes, after watching it,

865
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,280
I felt like they nailed it.

866
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:33,880
Right.

867
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,280
So sweet.

868
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,200
Because several things he did

869
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,880
were really touching.

870
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,360
It started with the go-karts.

871
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,440
The two raced, but were actually super slow.

872
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,120
But the two of them

873
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,000
still tried to overtake each other.

874
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,040
It was a bit childish.

875
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:45,960
But also very cute.

876
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,920
Yeah.

877
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,560
When they got there,

878
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,560
he suddenly changed into

879
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,640
a chef's outfit.

880
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,520
I think changing clothes

881
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,080
felt like a new person appeared.

882
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,000
It was refreshing.

883
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:54,800
And also that

884
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,600
never-ending

885
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,880
cake that never disappears.

886
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,960
That was really meaningful.

887
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,280
I think

888
00:38:59,280 --> 00:38:59,600
he just

889
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,440
kept everything

890
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,960
in his heart.

891
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,280
And did it all so well.

892
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,320
Including those little note tags.

893
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,000
And many of them

894
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,760
were things Chi Chi

895
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,920
really likes to do.

896
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,600
Yeah.

897
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,400
At that moment, I thought

898
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,160
“creativity soared”

899
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:10,800
It was just

900
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,120
out of this world.

901
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,240
First, the first point

902
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,760
He made use of a resource from his apartment

903
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,200
which is his planning and coordination skills

904
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,320
and his ability to execute and implement

905
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,120
The second point is what he said

906
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:20,960
Life is all about possibilities

907
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,000
Sometimes you move faster

908
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,640
and I move slower

909
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,920
Sometimes you’re slower and I’m faster

910
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,960
The most important thing is that in the end

911
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,920
when we take off our helmets, we find each other there

912
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:28,800
At that moment

913
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,400
it makes his whole park design

914
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,480
reach its highest level of meaning

915
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,440
The third point is about the chef

916
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,240
The girl could only watch him cook

917
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,520
Only this one thing

918
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,520
He didn’t need music

919
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,760
or anything else

920
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,160
Next is

921
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,240
my presentation time

922
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,920
He showed the qualities of a mature man

923
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,800
with remarkable confidence

924
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,680
And Chi Chi was there

925
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,640
gazing at him intently

926
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,160
Yes

927
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,160
The last point

928
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,000
I think it’s

929
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,080
Chi Chi said she wanted to relieve stress

930
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,200
Liu Zihan gave her

931
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:53,640
a specific suggestion

932
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,880
He said besides eating desserts

933
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,000
to heal yourself

934
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,880
you can also use other ways

935
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,680
to relax yourself

936
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,280
He said today is

937
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,400
a day with a sense of ceremony

938
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,040
He suggested you give yourself a break

939
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:04,920
At that moment, he understood

940
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,240
what Chi Chi truly needed

941
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,400
on a deeper emotional level

942
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,960
So he gave her this advice

943
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,000
He was the embodiment of a mature man

944
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,600
with a burst of charm

945
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,480
It was multidimensional and really impressed me

946
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,320
An excellent display

947
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,960
He sees both the big picture and the details

948
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,040
and pays attention to practical execution

949
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,080
and pays attention to practical execution

950
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:23,760
Yes

951
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,560
He can be flexible, that’s good

952
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,000
Also, Liu Zihan gave

953
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,160
Chi Chi a feeling she always wanted

954
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,040
Every girl hopes that

955
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,680
she can be the leading lady in front of the one she likes

956
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,800
Only in front of Liu Zihan

957
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,640
did Chi Chi feel that

958
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,800
grand and special attention

959
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,600
He makes girls truly feel

960
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,840
what it means to be supported and cared for.

961
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,360
It's not the so-called

962
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,280
idol drama kind of

963
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,800
simple dominance.

964
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,760
Yeah.

965
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,600
Even his topics of conversation

966
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:57,240
make you feel he's trying to get closer to you,

967
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,400
trying to understand you better.

968
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,400
Step by step.

969
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,480
I really like the word "support" he uses.

970
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,880
It's about uplifting her, highlighting her.

971
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,080
That kind of feeling.

972
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,320
I think that's a kind of dominance too.

973
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,200
But this kind of dominance feels really cool.

974
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:09,760
Yeah.

975
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,680
Not just outwardly cool.

976
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,120
Right.

977
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,600
Impressive.

978
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,120
If we calculate by everyone's

979
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,240
10,000th day in life,

980
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,240
it's about age twenty-seven,

981
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,520
four months,

982
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,760
and sixteen days.

983
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,080
Do you all remember

984
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,680
what you were doing at that age?

985
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,120
What were you doing?

986
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:28,360
What were you up to?

987
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,320
Working hard like a "workhorse".

988
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,720
Have you reached it?

989
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,120
I have.

990
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:32,960
Really?

991
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,040
Really.

992
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,640
But you look like you're twenty.

993
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,040
You're really good at uplifting.

994
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:38,600
Yeah.

995
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,680
Support.

996
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,000
Uplift.

997
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,160
I reached it on that day.

998
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:42,480
I was probably just

999
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,480
an ordinary

1000
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,800
regular "workhorse day".

1001
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,280
When he was talking just now,

1002
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,360
I was really thinking back

1003
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,320
to my 10,000th day.

1004
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,840
It was last year.

1005
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,120
Yeah, last year.

1006
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,040
Exactly this time last year.

1007
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,800
Because I had just finished filming then.

1008
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,360
I felt I'd just finished a period of work.

1009
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,840
So I wanted to relax a bit.

1010
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,000
This year, with the same group of people,

1011
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,040
at the same time,

1012
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,560
we'll go to the same place

1013
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,360
to commemorate last year's 10,000th day.

1014
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,480
That's really meaningful too.

1015
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:10,920
I suddenly realized

1016
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,480
ten years ago was when I

1017
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,760
first became

1018
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,000
a producer for a show.

1019
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,280
That was truly

1020
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,440
starting from scratch.

1021
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,280
Doing this thing.

1022
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,640
Looking at my social media, I thought

1023
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,440
back then I was

1024
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,880
pretty impressive.

1025
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,360
I thought it was pretty cool.

1026
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,280
Actually, around that time,

1027
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,480
I was on "Call Me By Fire".

1028
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,520
If I could plan things all over again,

1029
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,080
I’d still live the same way.

1030
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:39,760
Because living like this

1031
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,880
is always the best arrangement.

1032
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,640
If I had another chance,

1033
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,360
I hope on my 10,000th day,

1034
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,320
I could clearly see how happy I am.

1035
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,560
I feel this way because

1036
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,960
many people say it’s impossible

1037
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,160
to have youth and truly feel it at the same time.

1038
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,760
When I had my youth,

1039
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,000
was actually when I was losing it.

1040
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,280
Because at that moment, I couldn’t feel

1041
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,120
how happy I was.

1042
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,320
But if I could do it again,

1043
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,760
I’d really want to tell myself

1044
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,880
you should

1045
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,320
really make it clear to yourself

1046
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,840
that you were truly happy then.

1047
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,760
You had someone you liked and things to do.

1048
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:13,960
So I think

1049
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:14,680
if possible,

1050
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,840
if I could plan again,

1051
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,480
I’d still work hard on my 10,000th day.

1052
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,120
For the rest of

1053
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:18,640
my 20,000 days.

1054
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,520
So I can live comfortably

1055
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,560
in my later years.

1056
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,960
Shouldn’t you work even more?

1057
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,920
Yeah, work even better.

1058
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,600
Put in more effort.

1059
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,440
Right.

1060
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,360
Brother Xu, what were you doing on your 10,000th day?

1061
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,240
What were you up to?

1062
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,840
At that time, I think

1063
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,040
it was during the F4 group days.

1064
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,320
Then you definitely shouldn’t replan.

1065
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,160
We won’t let you replan.

1066
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,360
No way.

1067
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,880
If you let me go back to the F4 days,

1068
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,440
for example, now I feel

1069
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,360
after all I’ve been through,

1070
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,520
I just want to

1071
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,080
hold each of them tightly.

1072
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,880
If I still had that chance,

1073
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,200
Yes.

1074
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,200
Definitely.

1075
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,000
Do you know why this question is so good?

1076
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,720
It lets you look at your life before,

1077
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,880
so you start wanting to seize

1078
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,080
your life after.

1079
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,000
You’ll want to

1080
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:11,840
live each day better.

1081
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,960
Yes.

1082
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,600
I think that’s the most important thing.

1083
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,880
We should just live well

1084
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,520
in every moment.

1085
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,600
For us,

1086
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,120
this is

1087
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,280
the most meaningful thing.

1088
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,360
Let’s also discuss this topic

1089
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,080
with our friends on Weibo.

1090
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,120
Let’s talk about it.

1091
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:26,800
Yeah.

1092
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,440
Everyone can really

1093
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,080
share with us.

1094
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,960
On your 10,000th day,

1095
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,240
how did you spend it?

1096
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,640
Or if your

1097
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,320
10,000th day hasn’t come yet,

1098
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,640
how do you want to spend it?

1099
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,920
How would you plan it?

1100
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,040
Make a plan for your

1101
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,320
10,000th day in life.

1102
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,600
I think Liu Zihan’s

1103
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,320
park time this time

1104
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,920
really opened our minds.

1105
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,680
Yes.

1106
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,280
He’s really leveled up.

1107
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,920
So impressive.

1108
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,440
Let’s keep watching.

1109
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,600
Still not back yet?

1110
00:44:59,200 --> 00:44:59,720
Duo Duo

1111
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:21,920
You know, sometimes

1112
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,960
watching the fish swim around

1113
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,080
feels really relaxing

1114
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,400
because you’re focused on it

1115
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,600
Hello

1116
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:35,840
Le Chen

1117
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:36,480
Hello

1118
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,400
Why are you the only one back?

1119
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,200
No, they're upstairs

1120
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,200
Did you eat?

1121
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,520
I had a little

1122
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:45,800
Don’t feel like eating anymore

1123
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:46,600
Not hungry

1124
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,680
I’m fine, can’t eat more

1125
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,040
So

1126
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,880
Did you lose some weight from not eating these days?

1127
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:53,760
Wait a second

1128
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,480
Let me see

1129
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,680
What’s that in your hand?

1130
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,680
A film camera

1131
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,200
Another film camera?

1132
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,160
Yeah

1133
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:12,960
So many

1134
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,200
I’ll put it in my room first

1135
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:18,880
Keep it out of the way

1136
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,880
We should talk, right?

1137
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,240
I was actually hoping

1138
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,320
the two of them could talk things out

1139
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,120
Or something like that

1140
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,760
Did you buy this or get it as a gift?

1141
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,840
Guess

1142
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:04,560
You got it as a gift

1143
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,200
I think so too

1144
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,560
I’m not telling you

1145
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,280
Chi Chi gave it to me

1146
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,280
Like it’s hard to guess

1147
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,600
Mr. Yu Xing

1148
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:21,840
Do something

1149
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,960
That jackfruit is delicious too

1150
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:26,560
Where’s the jackfruit?

1151
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,360
Downstairs

1152
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,160
Downstairs

1153
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,480
There’s jackfruit and dates

1154
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,440
Did you bring them?

1155
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:30,880
Yeah

1156
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,360
That lychee is huge

1157
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:33,560
Did you bring it?

1158
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:34,960
It’s so big

1159
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,240
Absolutely massive

1160
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,760
I’ll give it to you

1161
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,600
I bought something really fun

1162
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,560
What is it?

1163
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,800
Want to go check it out?

1164
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,800
Where is it?

1165
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,680
Next door

1166
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,560
There should be a gift for him

1167
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,520
Hello, Nicole

1168
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,360
Both of them have eaten

1169
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,240
Are they upstairs?

1170
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,320
Upstairs

1171
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,640
Got something really fun

1172
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:10,640
What?

1173
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,360
So mysterious

1174
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,000
Bought you a fish tank

1175
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,560
Bought a fish tank to play with

1176
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,440
It really is a fish tank

1177
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:24,840
It really is a fish tank

1178
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,080
Because he likes fish, right?

1179
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,160
Hello

1180
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,400
Just put it on the third floor over there

1181
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,000
Okay

1182
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:32,840
Thank you

1183
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,880
You carried it back with your bare hands.

1184
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:20,360
That's impressive.

1185
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,080
Hard to believe, right?

1186
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:23,640
We're just strong.

1187
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,280
All we've got is strength.

1188
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:30,800
That's good.

1189
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,840
But you don't have a filtration system.

1190
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,080
I have one, but don't know how to install it.

1191
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,960
This should be the filter, right?

1192
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:38,760
Take a look.

1193
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,960
There are a few more pipes here.

1194
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,360
Why did you think of buying this?

1195
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:48,600
Because...

1196
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:49,960
Because I think...

1197
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:50,880
I feel like you're the type

1198
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,480
who could stare at a fish tank all day.

1199
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,000
Do I seem that much like an old man?

1200
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,360
I feel like you're the type

1201
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,000
who could watch a fish tank for half a day.

1202
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:01,880
Does this tank need to be cleaned?

1203
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,400
It needs cleaning.

1204
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:05,480
How do you clean it?

1205
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,560
You need to scrub along the sides.

1206
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:08,880
Scrub close to this.

1207
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,480
Scrub along the glass wall.

1208
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,400
Still remembering.

1209
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,640
Is it clean now?

1210
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,040
It's clean.

1211
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,520
Didn't you notice this fish tank

1212
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,600
is a bit different?

1213
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:26,520
How is it different?

1214
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,520
It's just a bit different.

1215
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,080
Is this for the cat?

1216
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:29,960
Yes.

1217
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,840
I was thinking,

1218
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,240
in the future,

1219
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,240
put it at home,

1220
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,440
having a cat inside would be fun.

1221
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,720
She knows he has a cat.

1222
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:39,320
Yes.

1223
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,000
Then the cat needs to fit.

1224
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,200
Is your cat fat?

1225
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,640
Does it have high cholesterol and high blood pressure?

1226
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,080
It suddenly got fat recently.

1227
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,320
It should be able to fit.

1228
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:02,720
It's installed.

1229
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:04,880
Should we plug it in and try?

1230
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:06,320
It should be set up.

1231
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,920
You can plug it in.

1232
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:16,880
Okay.

1233
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,280
Sure.

1234
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,080
Alright, you saved these fish.

1235
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,720
Saved seven little lives.

1236
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:28,760
How do you feel?

1237
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,520
How do you feel about staying in the cabin these days?

1238
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:31,960
Finally got to talk.

1239
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,120
It's good to be able to talk.

1240
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,080
I feel things have been a bit strange lately.

1241
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,920
I feel our interactions aren't like they were at the start.

1242
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,200
When we were on the island,

1243
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,560
it was so relaxed and happy.

1244
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,360
But...

1245
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,800
Maybe I'm just slow to realize things.

1246
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:11,960
I don't know if I'm overthinking.

1247
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,160
It's just that lately, it really feels

1248
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,560
like things are stuck.

1249
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,680
Like the connection's lost.

1250
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,360
And then, with yesterday added in,

1251
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:24,320
I feel like our vibe

1252
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,560
isn't quite right.

1253
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,040
It's not so relaxed anymore.

1254
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:29,720
I'll be honest.

1255
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,120
It's not even cheerful.

1256
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,080
So I think

1257
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,160
our days in the cabin are actually counting down.

1258
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:38,320
I'm not someone who likes to avoid problems.

1259
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,440
Because I think

1260
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,040
I have the ability to solve problems.

1261
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,080
I also have the ability

1262
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,000
and have

1263
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,040
enough confidence to handle

1264
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,480
the risks that come with the final answer.

1265
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,920
She wants a more definite answer.

1266
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:56,880
Today, I want

1267
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,880
to talk about whether

1268
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,800
I'm curious if you've figured it out.

1269
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:05,840
He's a bit overwhelmed.

1270
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:07,680
It's hard for him to answer.

1271
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,400
Le Chen is also restless.

1272
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,200
You can see he's a bit reserved.

1273
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,440
Because

1274
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,200
Didn't I ask you to walk the dog last time?

1275
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,480
Because I heard you talking by the fish tank

1276
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,680
that the dog hadn't been walked.

1277
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:49,760
that the dog hadn't been walked.

1278
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,960
So I thought maybe you wanted to walk the dog.

1279
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,080
I told Brother Jiao,

1280
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:52,240
I said, with so many people, I won't go upstairs.

1281
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,560
I said, with so many people, I won't go upstairs.

1282
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:54,400
I'm afraid he'd feel awkward.

1283
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,680
I asked him to tell Le Chen for me.

1284
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:56,680
To go downstairs and walk the dog.

1285
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,520
I said I'd wait for him in the living area.

1286
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,400
Help me ask Le Chen to come later.

1287
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,320
So we can walk the dog together.

1288
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,120
Duo Duo said

1289
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,600
she wants to walk the dog with you.

1290
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,120
Who?

1291
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:09,960
Duo Duo.

1292
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,240
It's up to you.

1293
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,760
Actually, I was thinking

1294
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,760
if you don't want to walk the dog,

1295
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,200
it's totally fine.

1296
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,480
But I was wondering

1297
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,480
if you knew

1298
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,080
that I was

1299
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,360
waiting for you to walk the dog.

1300
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:40,240
Waiting for you.

1301
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:43,560
I knew.

1302
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,520
Because I thought if you knew,

1303
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,000
you'd probably come down and say something,

1304
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:47,520
or maybe

1305
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,640
ask Brother Jiao to pass the message.

1306
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:49,840
I'm a bit tired.

1307
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,200
But since I didn't get any signal,

1308
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,960
I kept waiting downstairs.

1309
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:04,560
You didn't give any response or feedback.

1310
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:06,120
So it made me feel

1311
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,000
why is it like this?

1312
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,000
This feeling.

1313
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,320
So I felt

1314
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:21,120
pretty upset.

1315
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,920
It even made me feel like you were avoiding me.

1316
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,520
This is really upsetting.

1317
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:48,920
Brother Jiao.

1318
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,000
Did you tell him?

1319
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,280
I did, I really did.

1320
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,200
But he didn't come down.

1321
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:09,600
I think Wang Le Chen

1322
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,680
isn't that timid, right?

1323
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:11,920
It's just

1324
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,440
talking with a girl,

1325
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,960
is it that hard to have a simple chat?

1326
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:37,880
Because I've been thinking about this lately too.

1327
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,000
This issue, I...

1328
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:46,200
You know, when I face

1329
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,600
this kind of problem,

1330
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,280
I still tend to avoid it.

1331
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,840
So I really gave you

1332
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:54,000
some bad feelings.

1333
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:54,600
This...

1334
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:58,280
So,

1335
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:11,840
I want to gather my courage too.

1336
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,040
I think we should all

1337
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:15,440
just be open and talk about it.

1338
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:16,880
I think that's definitely the best.

1339
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:17,720
Because

1340
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:19,080
avoiding things won't help.

1341
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:20,120
You can't avoid them forever.

1342
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,120
Yeah.

1343
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,120
I don't want to act like

1344
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,240
I have to treat everyone equally.

1345
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,160
I think that's

1346
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:34,440
the least sincere way.

1347
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,440
First of all,

1348
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:41,680
the way we interacted and met at the beginning,

1349
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,240
including the feelings,

1350
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,560
was definitely sincere.

1351
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:45,840
And real.

1352
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,600
It's not that my previous actions

1353
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,320
and all my thoughts

1354
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:55,640
were fake,

1355
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,240
or just an illusion.

1356
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:57,960
They're not.

1357
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,240
I think it's just that, during this process,

1358
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,240
I've changed a bit,

1359
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:06,080
and after we spent time together,

1360
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,440
things changed too.

1361
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:30,280
You and I

1362
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,440
the way we interacted before

1363
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,520
actually, from the very beginning

1364
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,160
it was as really good friends

1365
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:34,920
that's how we got along

1366
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,240
I think in that situation

1367
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,480
there was no pressure at all

1368
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:41,920
but later on

1369
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,040
I started to feel some pressure for no reason

1370
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:49,840
like you were knocking at the door

1371
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:53,400
making you feel pressured

1372
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:54,480
Yeah

1373
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:57,040
I understand

1374
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,280
Because from my perspective

1375
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:13,280
I've always thought

1376
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,920
maybe the things you don't like

1377
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,600
like socializing or solving problems

1378
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:17,560
facing conflicts

1379
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:18,520
dealing with challenges

1380
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,360
might not be your strengths

1381
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,040
but what I've secretly enjoyed is

1382
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,200
I feel these are my areas of expertise

1383
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,520
so if I'm knocking at the door

1384
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,360
and you're hesitant about the world outside

1385
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:30,440
what I want to say is

1386
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,560
you really don't need to be afraid

1387
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,600
you can do what you want

1388
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:37,200
I can fill in the rest for you

1389
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,080
And from you

1390
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,400
I also need

1391
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,560
to learn that sense of stability

1392
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:43,840
the illusion it gives me

1393
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:44,960
maybe it's that I feel

1394
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:46,640
the two of us are

1395
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,040
moving forward toward a goal

1396
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,040
so maybe at that time

1397
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:52,120
my words were more direct

1398
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:09,320
that straightforwardness was to

1399
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:10,960
communicate better

1400
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,160
but in your eyes

1401
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,480
or in your feelings

1402
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:16,840
it might feel like pressure

1403
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:18,720
or like a declaration

1404
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:22,080
I didn't mean for my words

1405
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,200
to make you feel pressured

1406
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,120
I just wanted to say

1407
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,120
can I, in my own way

1408
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:28,680
just

1409
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:30,280
make you feel warmth

1410
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:31,760
but I didn't expect it to "burn" you

1411
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:34,880
I didn't expect it to "burn" you

1412
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:50,680
I feel a bit sorry

1413
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,240
it's actually not a good thing

1414
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:09,960
that's not what we want

1415
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:39,800
No

1416
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:40,600
I

1417
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,400
I don't think it's necessarily bad

1418
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,920
it's just that

1419
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:45,560
actually

1420
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:49,760
well

1421
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:52,200
because some people just

1422
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,920
really like your directness

1423
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,480
all kinds of outgoing expressions

1424
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,240
but some people

1425
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:59,800
they just

1426
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,640
maybe I'm not that

1427
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,120
person who needs to be

1428
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:06,920
pulled out by someone else

1429
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:21,160
it's not that you need to call me out

1430
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,760
for us to plan and do things together

1431
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,080
and it's not that

1432
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:42,480
I'm not that

1433
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:43,320
person who doesn't want to come out

1434
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:44,520
it's just

1435
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,240
I think if we're really

1436
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:56,440
walking the same path

1437
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:57,680
we'll definitely meet along the way

1438
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:06,800
maybe some relationships

1439
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,960
are really just suited for

1440
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,840
us to be the best companions

1441
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,000
I was thinking last night

1442
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,160
I think you're actually like a cat

1443
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,520
But you're also a lot like a hermit crab

1444
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:51,720
Hermit crabs are the kind

1445
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:53,720
If you suddenly get too close to it

1446
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:54,520
Reach out your hand

1447
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:55,520
It'll run away immediately

1448
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:56,640
Someone who withdraws

1449
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:57,520
An animal that hides away

1450
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,680
But if you put a pearl

1451
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:02,520
in front of the hermit crab

1452
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:04,200
and just wait

1453
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,920
it might reach out with its claw

1454
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,240
and grab the pearl

1455
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:08,800
That's how I feel

1456
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:09,600
Either way is fine

1457
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:21,840
The cabin is really just a beginning

1458
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:24,040
Because my mom was in Hangzhou a couple of days ago

1459
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:24,960
And I told my mom

1460
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:25,960
I said life in the cabin

1461
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,440
makes me feel like summer is almost over

1462
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,120
Because the cabin time is ending soon

1463
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:30,760
I said I feel like summer is ending

1464
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:33,160
But my mom said summer is just beginning

1465
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:34,160
So I think

1466
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:50,840
I feel

1467
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:09,920
Maybe my way of feeling the world is through experience

1468
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,120
So I think

1469
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:22,280
That's really thoughtful.

1470
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:24,080
After petting the dog, you wiped my tears.

1471
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:31,360
It's not that I can't let go of you.

1472
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:33,240
I'm just a bit reluctant to leave the cabin.

1473
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,120
Don't.

1474
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:42,000
Sorry.

1475
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Don't cry, I'm sorry.

1476
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:45,000
No.

1477
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:02,000
It's okay.

1478
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:03,400
But it's still pretty good.

1479
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:04,360
At least,

1480
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:06,280
Don't make me keep feeling this way.

1481
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:07,680
I can't really figure out my feelings either.

1482
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:27,280
I just think it's a bit of a shame.

1483
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,680
Because I met someone

1484
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,040
with very similar interests and hobbies.

1485
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:44,080
The feeling you give me

1486
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:46,400
is really like a big iceberg in autumn.

1487
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:49,880
It just doesn't melt at all.

1488
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:55,000
That's the impression you give me.

1489
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,560
You never really get a chance to open up.

1490
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:59,880
Just about to start,

1491
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:01,520
to adapt or accept,

1492
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:04,440
to embrace a fresh new state.

1493
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:07,600
Because I'm a very lively person.

1494
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:08,120
I just think

1495
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:09,760
you're way too lively.

1496
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:10,720
You're much more lively than me.

1497
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:11,960
You're the one who seems truly human.

1498
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:18,640
I feel like I'm not even human.

1499
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:20,480
I think

1500
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:27,120
it's good that you can say it out loud.

1501
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:27,840
That's nice.

1502
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:30,040
Because I'm also someone

1503
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:31,400
who can accept outcomes.

1504
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:38,360
But it doesn't stop us from being friends.

1505
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:42,960
It doesn't really get in the way of our friendship.

1506
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:46,000
Look, Duo Duo is still a very warm person.

1507
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:51,720
You won't

1508
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:52,680
hunt me down in real life, right?

1509
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:54,520
I won't.

1510
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:55,680
I'm pretty generous.

1511
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:56,680
It doesn't matter.

1512
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:58,040
To be honest, it matters a little.

1513
01:08:58,040 --> 01:08:58,240
Honestly, it does matter a bit.

1514
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:00,280
About twenty to forty percent matters.

1515
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:01,000
But fifty percent

1516
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,160
to sixty percent doesn't matter.

1517
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:03,800
The part that doesn't matter is

1518
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:04,240
me.

1519
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:06,240
I'm a pretty subjective person.

1520
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:07,720
No one can really affect

1521
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:09,560
the pace and rhythm of my life.

1522
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:11,840
So I think

1523
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:12,880
me knocking on the door

1524
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:13,680
might actually

1525
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:14,800
bring

1526
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,040
noise and trouble to others.

1527
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,160
But if

1528
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:18,240
I've been knocking for a long time

1529
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:19,760
and you still prefer what's inside,

1530
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:21,240
then let's just do our own thing.

1531
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:34,960
I think

1532
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,120
if it's really that person,

1533
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:37,760
they won't need you to knock.

1534
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,040
They'll come to you on their own.

1535
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,600
Yeah, that makes sense.

1536
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:46,320
So I think it's

1537
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:47,400
pretty good.

1538
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:49,440
As long as you

1539
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:52,120
feel comfortable yourself, that's enough.

1540
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:53,640
I also think as long as I'm comfortable, it's fine.

1541
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,760
Don't rush.

1542
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,320
There are still so many summers ahead.

1543
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,600
It's not like you only have this one summer.

1544
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:31,280
But summer really is

1545
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,520
just getting started.

1546
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:08,840
I remember at the very beginning,

1547
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:11,200
I said those two weren't a good match.

1548
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:14,640
Everything you've seen today,

1549
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:15,800
every issue at each step,

1550
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:17,600
there's a core logic behind it.

1551
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:19,080
The core logic is

1552
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:20,840
these two have different worldviews.

1553
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:22,960
From Duo Duo's perspective,

1554
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:23,480
the first time

1555
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:24,280
they met (on a date),

1556
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,480
she told Le Chen,

1557
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:27,560
we really praised her for what she said.

1558
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:29,000
She said, "If there's something you don't know,

1559
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,160
just tell me.

1560
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:31,440
You can ask me for help.

1561
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:33,400
I'll explain it step by step."

1562
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:34,080
At the time, we thought

1563
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:34,800
her view on love

1564
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:35,960
was especially healthy.

1565
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:36,800
Back then, Le Chen

1566
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:37,920
actually accepted it.

1567
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:39,800
So Duo Duo always thought

1568
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:40,960
her way of giving fully

1569
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,880
was the right pace.

1570
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:45,400
She probably always believed

1571
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:46,400
that by doing this, she wasn't

1572
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:47,360
making anyone uncomfortable.

1573
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:48,040
So I think

1574
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:49,440
from her perspective,

1575
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:50,320
her actions

1576
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:51,880
weren't wrong.

1577
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,080
It's just that their needs

1578
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:54,320
were different.

1579
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,000
I think after talking,

1580
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,120
she'll realize that she

1581
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:58,800
just isn't compatible with this person.

1582
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:01,360
From what I heard,

1583
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:02,880
the biggest irreconcilable issue between them

1584
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:03,880
is that

1585
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:05,000
Duo Duo thinks

1586
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:05,600
Le Chen is

1587
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,080
someone who needs her to take the initiative.

1588
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:08,000
So she feels she should knock on the door

1589
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,320
and get Le Chen to come out.

1590
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:10,520
But actually, Le Chen

1591
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:11,280
values his independence

1592
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,800
and being self-reliant.

1593
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,040
What he really wants is

1594
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:14,920
to figure things out himself,

1595
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:17,000
and come out when he's ready.

1596
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,280
He doesn't want to be rushed.

1597
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:20,480
He's also not suited for someone

1598
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:22,880
who tries to hold on to him.

1599
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,760
In Duo Duo and Le Chen's relationship,

1600
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:26,960
this is where the conflict lies.

1601
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:27,640
Yes.

1602
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:29,160
I think both of them

1603
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:30,240
have already said

1604
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:31,280
the best things they could.

1605
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,760
Le Chen said,

1606
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:33,480
"You're not wrong."

1607
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:33,960
"You knocking on the door

1608
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:34,960
is totally fine."

1609
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:36,840
Duo Duo also put it well.

1610
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:38,160
She said, "I won't

1611
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:39,640
change how I do things,

1612
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:40,200
because I'm

1613
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:41,440
a pretty subjective person."

1614
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:42,280
In real life,

1615
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:43,480
many people

1616
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:44,960
might think, "If only I hadn't

1617
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,640
knocked on the door back then,"

1618
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:47,400
or "If only I had

1619
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:48,000
done things differently,"

1620
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,120
would things between us

1621
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:50,320
be different now?"

1622
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:51,760
I really want to tell

1623
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:54,400
friends who think this way,

1624
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:54,840
we don't have

1625
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:55,920
another choice.

1626
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,800
We just have to be ourselves.

1627
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:58,760
We should show

1628
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:00,040
our truest selves

1629
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:01,680
and be liked and chosen for that.

1630
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:03,800
Just now,

1631
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:04,640
in that conversation,

1632
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:06,800
Duo Duo, in my eyes,

1633
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,080
really impressed me.

1634
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:09,520
You know, when we face

1635
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:10,560
a lot of things,

1636
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:13,280
can we be as brave as Duo Duo,

1637
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:14,800
having the courage

1638
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,960
to take the initiative to reach out,

1639
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,480
and then

1640
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:20,040
speak our minds?

1641
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:21,720
If there's a conflict,

1642
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:23,360
we should talk it out.

1643
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:23,680
Ask,

1644
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:24,720
"Why did this happen?"

1645
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:26,160
We might

1646
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:27,160
not be friends in the future,

1647
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:28,600
or maybe not lovers anymore,

1648
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:29,320
but I don't want

1649
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:31,040
things to end with an ellipsis.

1650
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:32,560
I hope

1651
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:33,640
we can talk it out,

1652
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:34,880
let it go,

1653
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:35,640
and move on.

1654
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:37,600
Duo Duo is truly brave.

1655
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:41,280
There's no right or wrong between Duo Duo and Le Chen.

1656
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:42,440
It's just that

1657
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:43,560
they're not a match.

1658
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:44,920
Sorry, it's like puzzle pieces

1659
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:45,560
that just don't fit.

1660
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:46,760
There's no right or wrong.

1661
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:47,560
It's just that everyone's

1662
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:48,800
perspective is different.

1663
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:49,560
Each of us

1664
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:50,160
needs

1665
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:51,680
a lot of experiences

1666
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:52,960
to really know

1667
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:53,960
who we are right now

1668
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:55,080
and what we're like.

1669
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:56,400
And what kind of life

1670
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:57,520
we truly want to embrace

1671
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:58,520
for ourselves.

1672
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:00,000
And you can also

1673
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:00,640
see that Duo Duo's

1674
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:01,600
initiative

1675
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:02,960
is part of her charm.

1676
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:04,120
I think

1677
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:05,120
for Duo Duo,

1678
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:06,640
her summer

1679
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:08,240
is just beginning.

1680
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:17,760
Wang Jue.

1681
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:29,560
Is anyone there?

1682
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:41,000
Hello

1683
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:42,680
Hello

1684
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:44,040
Why is no one here?

1685
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:45,840
Someone's upstairs.

1686
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,160
Who's upstairs?

1687
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:49,920
I think it's

1688
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:51,320
Le Chen and Duo Duo.

1689
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:16,960
Why did they suddenly show up?

1690
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:20,200
They suddenly came down.

1691
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:21,920
Hello

1692
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:23,200
They came down.

1693
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:24,960
Hello

1694
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,240
Hello

1695
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,360
I'll wash my hands and come over.

1696
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:33,720
Are you cooking?

1697
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:34,840
Yeah.

1698
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:48,600
Went to the other kitchen.

1699
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:05,520
Let's go for a walk.

1700
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:06,720
We should still

1701
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:11,760
Go, come on.

1702
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:12,880
Come on.

1703
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:15,480
Go, come on.

1704
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:17,360
Come on.

1705
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:50,840
At this moment,

1706
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:52,560
it's good to give each other some space.

1707
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,880
Secret Message Card

1708
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:26,360
She went to open the mailbox.

1709
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:27,200
Did she open Rui Long's mailbox?

1710
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:27,880
Yes.

1711
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:56,360
But do you think her enthusiasm

1712
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:57,960
can move Rui Long?

1713
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,000
Not necessarily.

1714
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,160
It tastes better when it's hot.

1715
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,000
I think it's spicier.

1716
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:44,960
Hello.

1717
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:46,080
What did you guys go do?

1718
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:47,440
Just went for a walk.

1719
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:52,080
Went to the second floor.

1720
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:55,440
What's going on tonight?

1721
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:56,400
No idea.

1722
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:57,720
Lan Lan and Yi Fan came back together.

1723
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:59,200
They're already back.

1724
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:00,720
What about Rui Long?

1725
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:01,920
That's strange.

1726
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,800
Come down quickly for photos.

1727
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:22,600
Coming.

1728
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:23,480
Hurry up.

1729
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:27,480
Why hasn't Rui Long come back yet?

1730
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:28,040
So weird.

1731
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:29,000
It's past eleven.

1732
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:30,400
Maybe he has something going on today.

1733
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,000
Does he have something today?

1734
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:36,000
Rui Long still isn't back.

1735
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Rui Long still isn't back.

1736
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:38,120
What's happening?

1737
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:40,680
Did you check over there?

1738
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:42,240
Let's check the living area.

1739
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:46,720
Let's go look in his room.

1740
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:55,160
Excuse us.

1741
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:05,160
No.

1742
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:08,440
No way, is he doing this?

1743
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:11,000
I don't even dare to go in.

1744
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:12,280
What's this letter?

1745
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:18,720
He left a letter for everyone.

1746
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:21,480
What?

1747
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:29,800
No way, I wouldn't do something like this.

1748
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:31,160
No way.

1749
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:33,880
I never expected this.

1750
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:40,520
Yu Xing, I'm leaving first.

1751
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:42,280
Really.

1752
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,360
He's left.

1753
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:45,880
Xiao Yuan.

1754
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:47,360
I'm gone.

1755
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,920
Even though we didn't talk much,

1756
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:51,360
I was always really happy every time.

1757
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:54,120
Le Chen.

1758
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:56,560
Thanks for making delicious dinners every day.

1759
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:58,800
Can't wait for the next time

1760
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,680
I get to taste your cooking again.

1761
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:12,520
Duo Duo.

1762
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:17,880
Duo Duo.

1763
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:22,360
I can't handle things like this.

1764
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,320
I'm not good at saying goodbye.

1765
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:28,160
What should I do?

1766
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:31,120
I feel like time went by too fast.

1767
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:33,600
I really hate everything

1768
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,120
about parting and saying goodbye.

1769
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:35,760
What should I do?

1770
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:36,800
They're still not back.

1771
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:37,960
I don't even know what to say.

1772
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,840
I think I should tell them.

1773
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:54,960
But it feels so sudden.

1774
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:07,080
We opened Rui Long's room.

1775
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:08,440
He left a letter for each of us.

1776
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:15,240
Wang Jue is the one.

1777
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:17,360
Life really plays tricks on people.

1778
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:19,040
She chose to open his suitcase today.

1779
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:21,160
He chose to say goodbye to everyone today.

1780
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:29,720
What did you open?

1781
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:31,080
They opened Rui Long's room.

1782
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,080
He left a letter for everyone.

1783
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:35,160
Should we go check over there?

1784
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,360
It's really about to blow up.

1785
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:18,280
He's always shared a room with Brother Jiao.

1786
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:20,600
Yeah, they're close brothers.

1787
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:54,120
Duo Duo

1788
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:55,120
How have you been lately?

1789
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:57,080
I hope you've been happy.

1790
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:00,480
Surprise!

1791
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,560
I'm playing hide and seek, you can't find me.

1792
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:07,480
I really admire your enthusiasm

1793
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:08,480
and cheerful personality.

1794
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,000
Hello.

1795
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,120
I also really enjoyed

1796
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:18,120
riding the little train with you

1797
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:19,480
and having deep conversations.

1798
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:21,600
I feel like I'm becoming more reserved.

1799
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:23,160
I think we can take it easy.

1800
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:25,720
Let's just be good friends first.

1801
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:29,480
Even before the train ride,

1802
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:32,080
I was thinking of just being friends.

1803
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:34,640
I did wonder if we might

1804
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:35,640
keep getting to know each other.

1805
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:36,880
What?

1806
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:38,240
Being boyfriend and girlfriend

1807
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:39,640
isn't the only goal.

1808
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:40,840
Yeah.

1809
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:42,320
Meeting great friends

1810
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:43,640
is also a wonderful thing.

1811
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:50,560
What did you order?

1812
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,240
I got some seafood.

1813
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:54,640
I'll make it with scallion oil.

1814
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:57,240
And some spicy ones.

1815
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:00,600
Okay.

1816
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:03,320
Honestly, I was a bit nervous yesterday.

1817
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:05,440
I thought you might turn me down.

1818
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:07,400
I think

1819
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:10,680
today was really happy.

1820
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:19,360
I feel like we're very alike.

1821
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:20,480
That's interesting.

1822
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:21,600
Really interesting.

1823
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:25,120
We look happy on the outside

1824
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:27,760
but playing a song on the first day was a bit tough.

1825
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:30,480
Inside, we still have ups and downs.

1826
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,000
I hope we can both

1827
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,560
find happiness within every day.

1828
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:42,880
Duo Duo, I hope you

1829
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:45,360
can enjoy these last few days.

1830
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:47,520
But I know it's not easy.

1831
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:50,600
Of course, if you can

1832
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:52,480
be with someone you like,

1833
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:53,680
that's the best.

1834
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:42,520
Wang Jue

1835
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:44,200
I hope everything goes well for you today

1836
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:46,680
and that you have a happy day

1837
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:48,600
I don't know if you've noticed

1838
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:50,560
I've decided to leave the house

1839
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:53,560
I really admire your courage

1840
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:55,720
and your views on love

1841
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:57,760
I'm just sorry

1842
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:59,240
that I let you down

1843
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:04,040
Sorry for making you so brave

1844
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:07,080
but not giving you

1845
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:09,040
the answer you wanted to hear

1846
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,960
Should I do a magic trick?

1847
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,600
I guess it's this one

1848
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:27,720
I still miss the tamagoyaki

1849
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:30,120
I really didn't get enough of it

1850
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:34,520
The highest score was Rui Long's 197

1851
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:36,040
and Wang Jue

1852
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:39,960
I think he really respects women

1853
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:42,360
Two cards

1854
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:43,040
Yeah

1855
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:45,840
If you miss catching it too many times

1856
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:47,680
then ride the little train with me once

1857
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:48,280
Sure

1858
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:50,120
I really want to try

1859
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:50,880
Okay

1860
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:53,520
I suddenly feel

1861
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:55,920
like I've gotten closer to you

1862
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:07,160
I'm still full of anticipation

1863
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:14,920
I believe you'll definitely find

1864
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:18,520
someone you like who also appreciates you

1865
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:22,800
I hope that in the house

1866
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:24,520
you can still be happy

1867
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:42,000
I think

1868
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,680
Ruilong's way of

1869
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:46,400
expressing feelings

1870
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:47,320
is different from others.

1871
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:48,320
What I really appreciate about him

1872
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:50,360
is that

1873
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:52,560
his love is very restrained.

1874
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:54,400
He keeps it to himself.

1875
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:57,440
It doesn't feel overwhelming

1876
01:28:57,440 --> 01:29:00,640
or uncomfortable.

1877
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:03,680
He's not good at expressing directly.

1878
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:04,640
This kind of restrained love

1879
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:08,040
is heartbreaking to watch.

1880
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:09,960
Ruilong is very kind.

1881
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:11,600
Even in his farewell letter,

1882
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:12,360
he comforted Duo Duo.

1883
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:14,000
He wrote,

1884
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,040
"I hope you'll be happy in the days ahead."

1885
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:18,000
Of course, I know it's hard.

1886
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,920
He knows everything Duo Duo went through.

1887
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:22,920
He really wanted to comfort her.

1888
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:25,080
But he didn't know how.

1889
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:27,080
Yet in his final message,

1890
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:29,160
he still wished her well.

1891
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:29,960
Hope you find happiness.

1892
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:31,320
Just by reading what he wrote,

1893
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:32,480
you can understand

1894
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:33,880
what he's really feeling inside.

1895
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:34,600
So I think

1896
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:35,160
if you

1897
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:36,520
if he could share

1898
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:37,560
his rich inner world

1899
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:38,880
more through words,

1900
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:40,360
show it more,

1901
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:41,760
or communicate more,

1902
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:44,520
maybe things would have turned out differently.

1903
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:46,480
He did try

1904
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:47,600
to get along with Duo Duo.

1905
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,120
He observed her carefully.

1906
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:52,600
He might have felt that Duo Duo

1907
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:53,960
wasn't really possible for him.

1908
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:54,720
Yeah.

1909
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:56,240
He was afraid that staying here

1910
01:29:56,240 --> 01:29:57,720
would make Wang Jue feel worse.

1911
01:29:57,720 --> 01:29:59,560
He thought it's better to end things quickly than drag it out.

1912
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:01,120
So he decided to leave.

1913
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:04,160
What I admire most about him

1914
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:05,960
is that from start to finish,

1915
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:07,640
he never pretended

1916
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:10,320
to be someone he's not.

1917
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:12,080
He stayed true to himself.

1918
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:13,480
No matter what,

1919
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:15,480
he didn't compromise himself in the end.

1920
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:17,280
Only by not compromising yourself

1921
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:18,920
can you realize that in a way,

1922
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:20,480
it's a form of self-love.

1923
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:22,560
You have to love yourself to love others.

1924
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:27,440
He's really adorable

1925
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:28,640
and pure-hearted,

1926
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:29,240
so genuine.

1927
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:30,000
That's the kind of person he is.

1928
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:33,440
I want to borrow what Duo Duo said earlier.

1929
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:34,320
Her words were,

1930
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:36,040
"Ruilong's summer is just beginning."

1931
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:37,600
We also hope

1932
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:40,080
that after Ruilong leaves us

1933
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:40,720
and the Heartbeat Cabin,

1934
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:41,680
he can

1935
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:43,560
quickly find

1936
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,880
someone who resonates with him,

1937
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:47,760
who makes him feel comfortable,

1938
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:49,000
that special person.

1939
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,640
We wish Ruilong all the best.

1940
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:51,480
Thank you.

1941
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:52,880
Thank you, Ruilong, for being here.

1942
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:07,680
I've picked up Ruilong's Heartbeat Message.

1943
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:12,160
Are you okay?

1944
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:24,600
Do you want to be alone?

1945
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:25,600
Or should I stay with you?

1946
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:30,280
I'm worried I might be

1947
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:31,240
putting pressure on him.

1948
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:33,040
See, as expected,

1949
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:37,080
it feels awful.

1950
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:39,160
I feel guilty.

1951
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:41,600
Maybe he'll think I'm pushing him too hard.

1952
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:43,960
She's the one who overthinks the most.

1953
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:44,800
Yeah.

1954
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:46,840
You didn't pressure him.

1955
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:47,840
He wrote so much to you.

1956
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,520
He definitely appreciates you.

1957
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:55,000
Today, I even

1958
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:57,360
took his key.

1959
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:58,760
But why am I so hesitant?

1960
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:01,160
It's also because I'm afraid of pressuring him.

1961
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:03,800
I think it's like this.

1962
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:04,400
It's just that

1963
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:06,000
taking the key

1964
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,520
doesn't mean I want anything from you.

1965
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:09,800
I just want to get to know you.

1966
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:11,400
Because I think you're a great person.

1967
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:12,560
Don't feel pressured.

1968
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:13,960
Ruilong will be happy when he finds out.

1969
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:16,400
He's sincere and passionate.

1970
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:17,120
So are you.

1971
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:28,680
Come on, have a seat.

1972
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:30,440
It's fine, sit down.

1973
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:32,160
It's not important.

1974
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,520
Whatever makes you comfortable.

1975
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:35,120
We don't mind, it's not a big deal.

1976
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:40,120
From my perspective,

1977
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:46,040
he wants to get to know someone else more.

1978
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:47,360
But I held him back.

1979
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:47,560
No.

1980
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:48,320
No.

1981
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:49,680
I'm telling you, no.

1982
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:54,040
Honestly, for Ruilong,

1983
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:55,120
leaving might be

1984
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:57,040
the real beginning for him.

1985
01:32:57,320 --> 01:32:59,200
He'll interact with us more outside.

1986
01:32:59,200 --> 01:32:59,720
Yeah.

1987
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:01,320
He'll feel more comfortable and free.

1988
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:03,640
People are meant to be free.

1989
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:14,720
And honestly, babe,

1990
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:16,160
we all are.

1991
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:17,800
It's only been a few days.

1992
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:19,760
We're just leaving at different times.

1993
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:20,240
Yeah.

1994
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:20,480
Yeah.

1995
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:22,440
It's really just a few days, babe.

1996
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:24,480
It's not like we'll never see each other again.

1997
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:25,160
After we leave the house,

1998
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:26,600
it'll be hard for us not to meet up.

1999
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:30,000
The first thing after leaving is to contact Ruilong.

2000
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:30,880
Invite him for a meal.

2001
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:31,800
Yeah.

2002
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:32,720
Then let's ask Yuan to join us.

2003
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:33,760
Go to Shanghai and have dinner with him.

2004
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:38,760
I think we're all saying goodbye.

2005
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:40,560
It's just a matter of timing.

2006
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:46,800
Get to know each other in a new setting.

2007
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:47,480
Yeah.

2008
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:48,200
Interact in a different environment.

2009
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:49,440
Meet a more genuine Ruilong.

2010
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:49,960
Honestly,

2011
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:50,880
having dinner in a Shanghai restaurant

2012
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:52,560
is much more relaxing for chatting.

2013
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:53,400
Yeah.

2014
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:00,160
I think it's great.

2015
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:01,360
Feels good.

2016
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:03,080
Please pat my hand.

2017
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:14,360
Friendship between girls.

2018
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:15,040
Yeah.

2019
01:34:15,320 --> 01:34:16,200
I think it's nice.

2020
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:29,440
Don't be too sad.

2021
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:51,920
Actually, Duo Duo is someone who

2022
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:53,960
really knows how to uplift those around her.

2023
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:56,400
You see, Duo Duo just finished crying, and right away

2024
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:58,160
she goes to comfort others.

2025
01:34:58,160 --> 01:34:59,320
In fact, she

2026
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:00,440
feels just as much sadness

2027
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:01,880
as anyone else.

2028
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:02,880
Yeah.

2029
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:04,560
You know, the bond between girls like this

2030
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:06,040
is really touching, I think.

2031
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:06,520
Yeah.

2032
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:07,760
Between close girlfriends,

2033
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:08,960
they encourage each other.

2034
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:09,640
It truly

2035
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:10,880
warms your heart.

2036
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:11,400
Especially when you're

2037
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:12,800
feeling vulnerable.

2038
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,720
That's when you need this the most.

2039
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:16,520
And the key point is,

2040
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:18,600
the three of them are together,

2041
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:19,680
comforting each other.

2042
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:21,400
I hope Wang Jue and Duo Duo

2043
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:23,240
won't be too affected by this.

2044
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:25,840
Because both of them might worry

2045
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:27,920
if their relationship with Rui Long

2046
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:31,040
led Rui Long to make this decision.

2047
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:33,760
I hope they don't

2048
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:35,640
put too much

2049
01:35:35,640 --> 01:35:36,760
guilt on themselves.

2050
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:38,960
Because this definitely isn't what Rui Long wants.

2051
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:40,720
Rui Long just figured things out.

2052
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:42,920
He hopes everyone can be happy.

2053
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:49,040
Let's keep watching and see what happens next.

2054
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:29,440
How about I get you

2055
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:31,880
some afternoon tea or something?

2056
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:32,760
I want to eat duck tongue.

2057
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:34,040
Can you make duck tongue first?

2058
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:35,320
No duck tongue tonight.

2059
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:37,800
Their playful banter is actually pretty sweet.

2060
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:38,400
Yeah.

2061
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:39,480
Let me take a photo with the chef.

2062
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:40,880
Look at the camera.

2063
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:41,840
Seriously,

2064
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:42,640
I can't do anything about you.

2065
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:44,000
Three, two, one.

2066
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:49,080
And it's done just like that.

2067
01:36:49,240 --> 01:36:49,760
Do you feel

2068
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:51,680
time passes quickly in the house?

2069
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:53,040
It does go by fast.

2070
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:54,960
But yesterday felt long.

2071
01:36:55,480 --> 01:36:56,440
Yesterday was boring.

2072
01:36:56,440 --> 01:36:57,680
It felt like everyone came back really late.

2073
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:01,280
Someone's jealous.

2074
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:03,680
I prepared some small gifts for everyone.

2075
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:04,840
Then I'll take this one.

2076
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:08,200
The bottom of this is transparent.

2077
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:09,080
Sagittarius.

2078
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:10,720
Talking about what you love

2079
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:11,560
the best way

2080
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:13,160
is to speak of it gently.

2081
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:15,720
May our lives not just follow the lines,

2082
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:18,080
but soar to free soil.

2083
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:19,120
This feeling is just like

2084
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:20,640
flipping through "The Answer to Heartbeats."

2085
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:21,480
It all matches up.

2086
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:25,120
Fireworks are going off.

2087
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:27,520
The windmill is spinning.

2088
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:29,240
The "lights are on."

2089
01:37:38,160 --> 01:37:38,560
It's just completely

2090
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:39,200
That's what love is like.

2091
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:39,680
Yeah.

2092
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:40,800
That's what youth is like.

2093
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:41,960
That's just how it is.
