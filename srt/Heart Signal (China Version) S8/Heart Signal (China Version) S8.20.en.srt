1
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,600
Is there a new guest?

2
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,480
Is it someone new?

3
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,360
Really?

4
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,200
Hello.

5
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,400
Hello.

6
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,480
Hello.

7
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,760
Long time no see.

8
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,920
Long time no see.

9
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,960
Are you two friends?

10
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,520
Yes.

11
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,120
Yes.

12
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,960
You really know each other.

13
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,600
What do you think my

14
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,080
MBTI type is?

15
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,680
What is it?

16
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,320
ENFJ.

17
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,320
Is it that easy to guess?

18
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,880
Because I'm smart.

19
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,040
I can tell.

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:08,760
You are

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,720
ENFJ.

22
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,120
Yes.

23
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,440
Me too.

24
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,200
ENFJ.

25
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,280
You too?

26
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,080
ENFJ.

27
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,440
In our little house,

28
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:14,880
there's one more

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,640
ENFJ.

30
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,080
If we put us together, it's like a matching game.

31
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:17,560
We'd disappear.

32
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,120
What is this?

33
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,000
"The Answer to Heartbeat"

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,400
Then everyone has to ask a question.

35
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:23,920
Right.

36
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,120
Let the new friend go first.

37
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,040
Or give you a special chance.

38
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,600
You can choose someone to set an example.

39
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,200
Come on.

40
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,160
Come on.

41
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:30,640
Come on, "Boss Lan".

42
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,080
"Boss Lan".

43
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,120
No.

44
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,440
Why did you choose me?

45
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,080
Isn't that just picking someone you know first?

46
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,600
"Favoring acquaintances".

47
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,840
When newcomers move in,

48
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,240
they have the privilege to go on a special date.

49
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,480
He can invite

50
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,920
any member of the opposite sex

51
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,440
for a one-on-one date.

52
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,440
Who?

53
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,080
Is Chichi here?

54
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,640
Then help me ask her

55
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,800
if she has time.

56
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,520
To go

57
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,120
on a date.

58
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,920
She is really happy.

59
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,960
Thank you so much.

60
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,120
You pulled me out of this

61
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,800
cubicle in Shanghai.

62
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,480
My favorite dog is the Alaskan Malamute.

63
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,920
But I haven't walked it yet.

64
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,080
It's okay.

65
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,440
There will be another chance next time.

66
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,840
Wang Jue

67
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,320
Hello

68
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,240
Hello, everyone

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You’re here

70
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,320
Hello

71
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,240
Are you cooking?

72
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,240
What’s this?

73
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,000
A slotted spoon

74
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,600
Is this for making fried eggs?

75
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,760
Yes

76
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,840
My small square pan

77
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,800
Its shape

78
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,480
is the shape for tamagoyaki

79
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,240
I want to make tamagoyaki

80
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,480
Really? I love eating it

81
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,640
Really? I love eating it

82
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,680
Do you have any mentaiko sauce?

83
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,560
What else?

84
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,480
I made one myself

85
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,680
It’s in the fridge

86
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,000
Let me beat it

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,920
I’m super fast at beating

88
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,720
Okay

89
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,440
I feel like Jue and Ruilong seem to

90
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,160
have a different kind of vibe too.

91
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,640
Wang Jue

92
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,960
finally shifted your attention

93
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,440
away from Lechen.

94
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,240
Seriously,

95
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,160
it's about time.

96
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,280
Do you agree?

97
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,240
I agree, but right now I think

98
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,200
Ruilong hasn't picked up on any signals.

99
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,120
He's still absorbed in

100
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,560
his own tamagoyaki.

101
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,680
And I think Wang Jue

102
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,160
has already sent out some signals.

103
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,840
And I think

104
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,600
there's still something subtle between the two of them.

105
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,840
I totally agree with you.

106
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,920
But there's one thing

107
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,440
I don't quite agree with.

108
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,200
It's not subtle.

109
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,200
It's purely "slight."

110
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,000
Two unexpected people.

111
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,080
I was confused at the time too.

112
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,800
I said,

113
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,120
Actually, I really like this word.

114
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,920
Because, didn't we say before,

115
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,640
Jue'er has a rather sensitive personality.

116
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:04,920
Yes.

117
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,080
So I think her reaction

118
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,880
also stays at this "slight" level.

119
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,400
But for her, it's already quite obvious.

120
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,000
Like when he was making tamagoyaki,

121
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,960
she leaned in.

122
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,280
And then Ruolong,

123
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:14,960
when he was doing magic tricks,

124
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,240
she laughed really happily.

125
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,320
She laughed really happily.

126
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,160
For her,

127
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,880
I think it's

128
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,880
quite obvious.

129
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,720
a sign of interest.

130
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:25,720
Duoduo.

131
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,480
Hello.

132
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,240
Hello.

133
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,040
Hello.

134
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,600
What are we eating tonight?

135
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,280
Tamagoyaki.

136
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,480
We're making it now.

137
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,760
Look forward to it.

138
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,000
Such delicate little egg rolls.

139
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,000
Of course.

140
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,280
I also ship him and Duoduo.

141
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,640
So I really want to know

142
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,440
who, in Ruolong's heart right now,

143
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,760
which girl he likes more.

144
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,520
Okay, let's connect with Ruolong.

145
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,480
Thank you.

146
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,920
Lu Yuan is back from his defense.

147
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,160
Hello.

148
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,360
You're back.

149
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,640
Hello.

150
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,360
You're back.

151
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,720
Hello, everyone.

152
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,040
I brought you Beijing roast duck.

153
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,520
Have you tried it before?

154
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,920
This is delicious.

155
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,200
I love eating it.

156
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,720
Really? Then I brought the right thing.

157
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,120
Let me tell you, I passed my defense.

158
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,120
I graduated (with my bachelor's degree).

159
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,480
That's great.

160
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,720
You're about to become a young adult.

161
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,040
Young adult.

162
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,720
Yuan.

163
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,560
A new guy just arrived.

164
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,280
We need to tell her.

165
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,920
He lives on our first floor.

166
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:11,680
That's right.

167
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,320
You'll meet him tonight.

168
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,160
And now,

169
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,520
He just came to Shanghai to start a business.

170
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,400
You should hear it from him.

171
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,600
Otherwise, I'll end up saying everything.

172
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:19,920
I...

173
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:20,880
Okay.

174
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,720
I'll go to my room and put my things away first.

175
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,360
Alright, we'll wait for you to come back.

176
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,520
I just want to know

177
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,840
when Zihan will show up.

178
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:31,480
Soon.

179
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,920
Very soon.

180
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,640
What?

181
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,880
Then I still have the Peking University emblem.

182
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,520
Right at the hundredth anniversary.

183
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,800
You still have the Peking University emblem.

184
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,480
Are there any more?

185
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,080
She heard it in their conversation.

186
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,560
Yes, she likes Le Chen.

187
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,320
Here you are.

188
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,040
Zihan.

189
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,640
Hello.

190
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,920
Love at the corner.

191
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,040
Found love at the corner.

192
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,000
Hello.

193
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,520
I haven't seen you before.

194
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,360
Hello.

195
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,520
Hello.

196
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,920
I just arrived yesterday.

197
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,720
Just moved in, yes.

198
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,240
I just went to Beijing yesterday.

199
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,680
Right, how should I address you?

200
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,600
My surname is Lu, like the "Lu" in Louvre.

201
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,320
I'm Lu Yuan, you can call me Xiaoyuan.

202
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,160
Lu Yuan, Xiaoyuan.

203
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,280
Liu Zihan.

204
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,080
Zihan.

205
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,480
Yes.

206
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,000
That's the one.

207
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,760
Close enough, that's easy to remember.

208
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,600
Just remember this, that's fine.

209
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,840
I'm from Hebei.

210
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,760
I used to work in Beijing.

211
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,480
Then I happened to come to Shanghai to start a business.

212
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,240
No wonder, right?

213
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,440
I could tell.

214
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,280
You went to college in Beijing.

215
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,040
Beijing University of Science and Technology.

216
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,480
My younger brother is also at Beijing University of Science and Technology.

217
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,680
He's doing his PhD.

218
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,200
I really think Zihan will like Yuan.

219
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,320
I like Yuan too.

220
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:00,760
Bright.

221
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,560
Yuan looks so beautiful at this moment.

222
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,040
At this moment, when the guy sees her like this

223
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,200
he will actually be attracted to her.

224
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,720
Yes.

225
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,640
Actually, Zihan and Luyuan

226
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,240
when they first met,

227
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,440
the atmosphere was really good.

228
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,200
I think it was excellent.

229
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,440
The feeling of communication between everyone

230
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,480
was quite comfortable.

231
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,200
It's not like

232
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,920
you just say hello and then

233
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,040
get interrupted right away.

234
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,720
It was genuine.

235
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,760
There was real interaction.

236
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,760
within it.

237
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,200
Luyuan has a trait

238
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,680
which is, when Duoduo told her

239
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,080
that we have a new guy here,

240
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,920
when a new guy arrived,

241
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,480
she was holding a gift for Lechen.

242
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,680
She barely asked

243
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,400
anything about the new male guest.

244
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:33,840
He arrived,

245
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,920
and then she went to give the gift.

246
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,600
This action

247
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,160
from a girl's

248
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,840
point of view

249
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,480
I think she is

250
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,160
not sure if she's interested in the new guy,

251
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,160
but towards Lechen,

252
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,320
she is very clear right now.

253
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,480
Hello, Xiaoyuan. Hello, Zihan.

254
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,680
Hello.

255
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,080
Did you just get back?

256
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,560
Have you eaten?

257
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,160
I had a little.

258
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,200
Really?

259
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,840
Did you eat?

260
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,800
You haven't eaten.

261
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,760
I brought roast duck.

262
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,280
You brought roast duck?

263
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,160
How about we go over there?

264
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,640
Okay.

265
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,640
I'm back.

266
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,640
I came back with two people.

267
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,040
Two people?

268
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,600
Who else?

269
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,040
Hello, everyone.

270
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,760
Hello, Brother Jiao.

271
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,040
So much food.

272
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,760
Hello.

273
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:14,760
Hello.

274
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,080
It's getting more and more plentiful.

275
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,080
Tonight's dinner.

276
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,200
This is our daily routine.

277
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,720
Routine.

278
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,480
I brought some snacks.

279
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,000
Great.

280
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,560
Let's start eating, then.

281
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,120
Let's eat.

282
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,440
Let's take our seats first.

283
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:28,840
Us.

284
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,120
I want to try this.

285
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,800
I'm really looking forward to it.

286
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,840
This is so delicious.

287
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,880
Thank you.

288
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,080
I ship him and Duoduo.

289
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,840
This is so delicious.

290
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,280
So tasty.

291
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,880
I'm so happy everyone likes it.

292
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,480
The first one to finish their plate.

293
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,800
Hello, Yuxing.

294
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,280
Hello.

295
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,720
Are you still eating?

296
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,360
There's braised pork.

297
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,520
Do you want me to heat it up for you?

298
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,280
I want some.

299
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,320
It sounds delicious just hearing about it.

300
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,800
I really like your rose.

301
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,640
It's so cool.

302
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,280
Is it called Midnight Rose?

303
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,640
Really, it's so beautiful.

304
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,800
Eat up.

305
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,160
Hello.

306
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:35,760
You're eating.

307
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,120
Have you eaten?

308
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,720
Have you eaten?

309
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,000
I have.

310
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:48,840
What is it?

311
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,200
It's just that...

312
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,160
There's no one here.

313
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:51,520
Over there.

314
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,040
They're eating over there, they're hungry.

315
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,520
Today's dish

316
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,960
has quite a complex composition.

317
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,560
Who made it?

318
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,400
Dr. Fang.

319
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,680
And Ruilong cooked too.

320
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,480
Ruilong, which dish did you make?

321
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,320
The tamagoyaki—it's already finished.

322
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,360
Impressive.

323
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,280
Yuxing is quietly approaching.

324
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,840
This Yuxing...

325
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,280
He looks really busy.

326
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,680
What do you mean?

327
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,320
I'll go get something.

328
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,960
Want to go for a walk together?

329
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,840
It doesn't want to go out.

330
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,400
Chichi is talking about its own thoughts, right?

331
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,240
It does go out.

332
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,240
It goes out to use the bathroom.

333
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,160
Let's go.

334
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,160
Let's go.

335
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,120
Should we bring Weini along?

336
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,320
She doesn't seem very enthusiastic right now.

337
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,720
I'll get her out.

338
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,800
Actually, deep down she is...

339
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,640
She's a bit embarrassed.

340
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,480
Do you know about this trash?

341
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,400
Do you know where they throw it?

342
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,640
Downstairs, over there.

343
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,360
I'll take it down.

344
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,400
Downstairs, first floor.

345
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:23,960
I'll go look for it.

346
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,960
Weini, are you going out to play?

347
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,840
You walk the dog every day, right?

348
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,280
Yes.

349
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,880
You can leave your trash at the door.

350
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,480
I can take it over when I walk the dog.

351
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,800
So I leave it at the door, right?

352
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,880
Yes, just leave it at the door.

353
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,760
I'll take it later.

354
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,720
Take it over.

355
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,760
Okay.

356
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,480
So I want to see

357
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,840
what the girl's reaction will be.

358
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,480
Weini can't come out.

359
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,480
Seems like she won't come out.

360
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,560
Let's go.

361
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,160
Do you know the method I mentioned

362
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:07,920
is?

363
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,160
What?

364
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,960
It's to carry it outside.

365
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,680
If you carry it out, it'll go.

366
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,440
Isn't that the same as before?

367
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,080
Yes.

368
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,080
But today

369
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,400
it will want to go out.

370
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,320
What are you doing? Why did you bump into me?

371
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,720
I'll just carry it out.

372
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,080
Go out to use the bathroom.

373
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,680
No, it'll come back.

374
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,040
It won't come back.

375
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,640
Let's go.

376
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,480
By the way,

377
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,640
I wanted to ask where that is.

378
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,520
Do you want to come along?

379
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,840
She doesn't have any other way.

380
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:25,880
What about the other one?

381
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,880
That one is staying in the kitchen.

382
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,600
It

383
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,680
will probably go out later.

384
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,520
I'll hold the leash.

385
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,280
Okay, you do it.

386
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,840
Follow.

387
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,520
It's fine.

388
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,920
He really followed us.

389
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,280
Okay.

390
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,240
Are we going to throw out the trash?

391
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,160
We can throw out the trash first.

392
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:08,840
Then go to...

393
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,480
We can go inside the park.

394
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,360
It probably needs to go to the bathroom.

395
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,360
Yeah, actually it...

396
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,080
If a dog doesn't go out for a day, it will...

397
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:25,960
It needs to pee.

398
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,880
We can walk it in the park for a bit.

399
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,600
She's checking if he's following.

400
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,520
Is it that area by the entrance?

401
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,320
Yeah, that one.

402
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,360
That's the park entrance.

403
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,720
And the trash can is over there.

404
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,440
This is how we usually walk.

405
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,040
Who's walking who? It's like we're the ones being walked.

406
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:46,960
Yeah.

407
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,240
See you later.

408
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:56,640
Alright.

409
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:57,840
Bye.

410
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:58,560
See you later.

411
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,600
See you later.

412
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,600
He's actually pretty generous like this.

413
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,280
That's right.

414
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:05,680
Yeah.

415
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,600
Handsome.

416
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,160
And by following, he also showed...

417
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,880
his own attitude.

418
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,200
Exactly.

419
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,040
Yes.

420
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,960
This is his best way of expressing himself.

421
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,680
A very appropriate way to express it.

422
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,960
It's very moderate and suitable.

423
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,040
This will be explained clearly.

424
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,200
There will definitely be a chance to make it clear.

425
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,480
He can't focus on anything right now.

426
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,640
He probably minds a little.

427
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,840
Because we just talked about it earlier today.

428
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,200
Yeah.

429
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,920
Nicole is the type of dog that's a bit tsundere.

430
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,800
I think so.

431
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,840
When she's at home,

432
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,040
she doesn't want to go out.

433
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,560
But once she's outside, her tail goes up really high.

434
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,920
She gets really happy.

435
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,120
You can clearly tell that Chichi

436
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,880
doesn't interact with him that much.

437
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,640
That's right.

438
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,760
So, were you tired from work today?

439
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,240
Not tired.

440
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,720
If you want to go slower,

441
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,680
just pull the leash a little.

442
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,000
She'll slow down.

443
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,480
That's the simplest response.

444
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,640
Don't you think

445
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,960
her tail looks a lot like

446
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,800
the thing on Zhao Zilong's head?

447
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,200
The tassel.

448
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,200
The white one.

449
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,640
Your description

450
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,480
is really accurate.

451
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,160
I just noticed your hair is

452
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,120
recently dyed pink?

453
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:26,480
Yeah.

454
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,440
Does it look good? I got it dyed this afternoon.

455
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,320
It looks pretty good.

456
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,880
You're the only one who believed it.

457
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,600
It's a hairpiece.

458
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,560
Are those boxer braids?

459
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,160
Yeah.

460
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,280
Really?

461
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,640
I've learned a bit too.

462
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,040
Really?

463
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,520
I sometimes watch boxing technique videos.

464
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,320
Your shoes look really nice.

465
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,920
You always know exactly what to compliment.

466
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,760
Right?

467
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,480
Because I always tell the truth.

468
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,880
That makes me happy.

469
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,520
Look at the dog running like that.

470
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,720
That's such a joyful thing.

471
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,360
I guess today it will

472
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,040
be so tired it'll collapse on the bed.

473
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,120
This morning, it...

474
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,400
Did you walk it?

475
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,360
Not this morning.

476
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,440
I walked it yesterday morning.

477
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,560
Yesterday morning.

478
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,680
Yesterday morning.

479
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,160
You just ate an egg.

480
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,760
The day you took a banana and left.

481
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,800
I ate sausage.

482
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,440
Sausage.

483
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,240
Yeah, yesterday morning.

484
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:38,760
They were still

485
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,000
chatting intensely.

486
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:40,960
Eggs again.

487
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,000
And sausages again.

488
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,000
You...

489
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,200
Do you want to eat some?

490
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,880
If you want, I can make it for you.

491
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:50,880
Really?

492
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,720
Make it.

493
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,800
I finally got to walk

494
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,840
the Nicole I wanted to walk.

495
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,240
She’s opened up a little.

496
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,160
She seems a bit more relaxed.

497
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,920
Is that an amusement park over there?

498
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,280
It looks like there are a lot of rides.

499
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,000
Do you like going to amusement parks?

500
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,680
I do.

501
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,640
Really?

502
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,160
Really.

503
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,800
The drop tower is actually pretty scary.

504
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:13,800
Have you tried it?

505
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:14,920
No.

506
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,320
Because sometimes when you work until

507
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,400
you really want to go and take a jump.

508
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:19,960
That’s me.

509
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,360
After you jump, it doesn’t feel like a big deal.

510
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,200
Yeah.

511
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,080
The moon is so bright tonight.

512
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,640
The weather’s nice.

513
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,440
Next time, let’s bring both of them

514
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,480
and come play together.

515
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,880
At the end,

516
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,720
it felt much better than at the beginning.

517
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,720
It was a lot better.

518
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,920
I think Yu Xing has been

519
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,240
really trying to praise her.

520
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,840
While they were walking,

521
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,480
I felt that the two of them

522
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,680
were obviously

523
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,320
much happier than before.

524
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,880
But I think for Liu Zihan,

525
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,400
when he followed to that place,

526
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,720
I think that was already

527
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,360
him giving it his all.

528
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,760
But he stopped abruptly there.

529
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,480
He had to go back.

530
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,520
I think his sense of boundaries

531
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,200
was also very

532
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:57,960
appropriate.

533
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,360
You know, even the dog was helping.

534
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,200
I mean,

535
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,520
even the dog showed that attitude—

536
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,200
subtle, mysterious, unpredictable.

537
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,200
This is what they call the right time, place, and people.

538
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,520
Nicole got tired from playing.

539
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,400
She came to eat.

540
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,120
Come.

541
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,560
Yu Xing is pretty good at taking care of dogs.

542
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,640
Congratulations on finally passing your thesis defense.

543
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,120
This is a graduation gift I prepared for you.

544
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,280
It's an Estée Lauder gift box.

545
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,560
You have great taste.

546
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,440
The design is very exquisite.

547
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,960
When it comes to beautiful things like this,

548
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,360
I just can't resist them at all.

549
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,600
I picked it out especially for you.

550
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,280
This is a holiday limited edition.

551
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,800
And the Advanced Night Repair serum inside

552
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,080
is specially designed for nighttime repair and anti-aging.

553
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,640
It can improve fatigue from staying up late in just three days.

554
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,760
You've been staying up late preparing for your thesis defense lately.

555
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,840
It's perfect for you to use.

556
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,160
You really know how to choose gifts.

557
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,280
It's practical and beautiful.

558
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,280
Girls really do

559
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,080
understand best what other girls like.

560
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,160
Speak of the devil

561
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,360
and he appears.

562
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,080
Someone opened your mailbox.

563
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,600
Did you know that?

564
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,160
That card—

565
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,920
Who was it?

566
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,640
Secret Crush Notes

567
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,040
Every guest

568
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,560
before entering our cabin

569
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,800
writes down the five questions

570
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,960
they care about most in a relationship.

571
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,640
If you're curious about what matters to them,

572
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,120
you can open their mailbox.

573
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,800
Then the two of you can

574
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,400
sit in this little train

575
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,840
and have a deep,

576
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,080
private conversation.

577
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,640
Le Chen's key is missing.

578
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,960
It was probably Duo Duo or

579
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,800
Wang Jue.

580
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,440
Wang Jue has already given up on Le Chen.

581
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:58,680
Not necessarily.

582
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,520
Not necessarily.

583
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,520
He doesn't even know himself.

584
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,360
He definitely doesn't know.

585
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,840
Could it be Lu Yuan?

586
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,720
It's possible.

587
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,280
Okay.

588
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:14,920
Little train.

589
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,240
Really?

590
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,120
How do you know?

591
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:21,520
We just went to see.

592
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,240
We just saw.

593
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,520
I suspect it's Duoduo.

594
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,400
But Duoduo is here.

595
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,040
Why not say Luyuan?

596
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,120
Yuan is possible.

597
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:27,840
Luyuan brought a gift for Lechen.

598
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,120
Luyuan brought a gift for Lechen.

599
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,880
Luyuan brought a gift for Lechen.

600
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,040
Brought a gift as soon as he came back.

601
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,280
It must be Luyuan.

602
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,360
Waiting to be invited.

603
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,640
Doesn't seem acted.

604
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,760
Who is it, after all?

605
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,320
Wait a moment.

606
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,080
I'll come down to find you later.

607
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,240
Luyuan.

608
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,440
Chen is back.

609
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,240
You're back.

610
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,840
Reading.

611
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,840
Have you eaten? I brought roast duck.

612
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,120
You really brought roast duck.

613
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,880
Really brought roast duck.

614
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,360
I won't wish you a halftime champagne yet.

615
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,640
Alright.

616
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,960
Let's talk when you get back.

617
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,560
Okay.

618
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,880
Then you can bring a roast duck back next time.

619
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,160
Sure.

620
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,440
Bring back a Peking duck.

621
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,640
Really brought roast duck.

622
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,280
So that's it.

623
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,760
I'm going to eat some roast duck.

624
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,200
Wait here.

625
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,000
I'll take you over.

626
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,760
She must have opened his mailbox.

627
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,600
The spicy hot pot was eaten yesterday.

628
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,320
Really?

629
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,280
Yeah, really.

630
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,920
You didn't wait for me at all.

631
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:49,880
Make it again.

632
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,560
Xiaoyuan.

633
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,880
Where did you guys just come back from?

634
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,760
Just got back.

635
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,480
You just got back?

636
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:02,840
Yeah.

637
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,920
I just got back too.

638
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:04,720
You just got here?

639
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,320
I just arrived.

640
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,360
How should I put it...

641
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,160
Where's the roast duck?

642
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,520
Right here.

643
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,400
It's sliced.

644
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,040
There's also sauce.

645
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,000
Is it good?

646
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,880
It's good.

647
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,600
Why did you come back so late today?

648
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,360
Because I had a dinner gathering tonight.

649
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,320
We thought you went to ride the little train.

650
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,760
We were going to wait there to pick you up.

651
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,720
Who took it?

652
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,080
You took it.

653
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,240
Yeah.

654
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,360
Is the little train about to leave?

655
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,680
She seems to be waiting for a chance to be alone.

656
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,680
Is that right?

657
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,120
Waiting for Chenchen to come out.

658
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,120
Come here.

659
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,760
Darn it, I'll go take a look.

660
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,600
Who opened my stuff?

661
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,560
I brought this for you.

662
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,360
I brought this for you.

663
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,440
She wants to give him that little gift.

664
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,480
I brought this for you.

665
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,760
What is this?

666
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,360
The one from Peking University (the school badge).

667
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,680
Because before, you weren't...

668
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,200
Wang Jue said there is one.

669
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,000
Finally, I'm a "Peking University person" too.

670
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,800
So cute.

671
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,200
Thank you.

672
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:07,200
You're welcome, I remember.

673
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,760
I quietly remember.

674
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,200
Lanlan is back.

675
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,040
It looks like those two are going to help again.

676
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,840
Do you need me to share something with you?

677
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,160
Share a bit about a certain female guest.

678
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,000
Yes, you can talk about it.

679
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,720
We're all friends here.

680
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,560
Do something.

681
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,200
I'm thinking about it too.

682
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,000
What should I do?

683
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,240
I've been thinking about it.

684
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,800
But I'm a little worried.

685
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,280
Like, will it be too...

686
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,120
Just...

687
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,120
Scare the other person.

688
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,240
I think

689
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,600
We need to consider her

690
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:19,880
feelings.

691
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,840
But

692
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,600
And don't let her feelings

693
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,520
completely hold you back.

694
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,080
Duoduo really is

695
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,160
so good at expressing herself.

696
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,160
So smart.

697
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:34,880
I think girls

698
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,680
are always kind to sincere people.

699
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,440
Okay, thank you, teacher.

700
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,040
Thank you, teacher.

701
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,400
So cute.

702
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,640
Didn't I just say

703
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,720
I really hope Duoduo and Ruilong end up together?

704
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,840
You want them to be together?

705
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,520
Yes, just look at that scene.

706
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,040
It's wonderful.

707
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:04,920
So cute.

708
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,720
Brother Jiao

709
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,000
I feel like I'm not very good at this.

710
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:23,960
It's just that

711
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,080
I talked to Ruilong about it.

712
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,440
I'm especially afraid

713
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:27,800
of that kind of situation

714
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,760
where it makes everyone's relationship awkward.

715
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,160
I understand what he means.

716
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,080
Afraid it puts pressure on both sides.

717
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,080
Yeah.

718
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,440
If it were me,

719
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,280
I would choose to be myself.

720
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,360
Okay.

721
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,680
I think the relationship he's talking about

722
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,760
the point where things get awkward

723
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,160
is not just about the two of them.

724
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,120
There are also the guys.

725
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,520
Right.

726
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,960
But actually,

727
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,120
you don't need to care about it.

728
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,600
When two guys are pursuing one girl,

729
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,600
at first, the two guys

730
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,680
will definitely see each other

731
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,040
as rivals.

732
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,760
So you

733
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,200
he doesn't need to worry about all this.

734
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,560
But in a situation like yours,

735
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,560
where you have to live together in an apartment,

736
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,680
just keep your distance.

737
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,240
I don't need to have a falling out with you,

738
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,920
but I can keep my distance.

739
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,800
He's thinking about too many people.

740
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,360
He wants to

741
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,960
Taking everyone into consideration

742
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:13,880
Have you noticed

743
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,240
that when Jiao is in front of someone he likes

744
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,680
and when he's with his friends

745
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,640
his demeanor is completely different

746
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,040
Some people

747
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,080
when they're around someone they have feelings for

748
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,320
or someone they care a lot about

749
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,120
just tend to be a bit

750
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,680
more self-conscious and pay attention to many things

751
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,960
afraid of this and that

752
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,360
Yes, because I think

753
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,720
the hardest thing right now

754
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,920
is figuring out how he should express himself

755
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,920
doing this

756
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,480
without putting pressure on the other person

757
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,520
Right, I think

758
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,480
as long as Xiao Jiao can do

759
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,720
what Duoduo just said

760
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,600
those two things

761
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,640
girls

762
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,360
will always be kind to sincere people

763
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,600
and you shouldn't let her feelings

764
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,520
completely hold you back

765
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,160
Those two things can both

766
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,880
help him a lot in the coming days

767
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,440
if he keeps them in mind

768
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,360
Everyone should pay more attention to Duoduo

769
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,960
She really is a great example

770
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,520
of a healthy attachment style

771
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,120
Yes, she's really adorable

772
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,200
and everything she says

773
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,320
can heal a lot of people

774
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:01,680
Yeah

775
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,240
Can I ask you about that again?

776
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,080
Don't call me "teacher."

777
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:11,800
Okay.

778
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,840
Just be sincere.

779
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,640
Is there anything more specific about this?

780
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,360
Spend more time together.

781
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,440
Let her experience it more.

782
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,400
Spend more time together.

783
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,040
It's during the time you spend together

784
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,760
that she can feel it.

785
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,880
Because with more time and communication,

786
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,360
she'll understand you better,

787
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,200
and you'll understand her better too.

788
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,920
It also helps you make decisions.

789
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,320
What you said makes sense.

790
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:33,720
Yes.

791
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,200
I understand.

792
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,680
When a man is in front of someone he likes,

793
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,760
his first reaction is

794
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,280
timidity.

795
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,280
When a woman is in front of someone she likes,

796
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,320
her first reaction is courage.

797
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,200
That's a golden quote.

798
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:50,800
Golden quote.

799
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,600
Really.

800
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,960
That's such a golden quote.

801
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,760
Go for it, Jiao.

802
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,640
You need to be more confident.

803
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,880
You're very charming.

804
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,040
It's because he cares too much

805
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,480
that he becomes especially timid.

806
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,200
Hurry up and go.

807
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,200
I'm leaving.

808
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,040
I don't think I can keep practicing.

809
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,800
I'm still practicing here.

810
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,320
It's kind of...

811
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,440
I can't keep practicing.

812
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,960
I can't keep going.

813
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,400
I feel like I'm sitting on pins and needles.

814
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,200
Feeling on edge.

815
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,200
I listen to the teacher.

816
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,640
I think you explained it really well.

817
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,480
Just be yourself.

818
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,040
Be yourself.

819
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,200
I feel like I'm a bit...

820
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,320
If you hadn't said it, I might have...

821
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,240
I would have lost myself.

822
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:43,880
Okay.

823
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,600
We—Ruolong and I are behind you.

824
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,320
Cheering for you.

825
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,120
Just go for it.

826
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:49,920
No matter what.

827
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,680
He became brave.

828
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,560
Youthful vibe.

829
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,280
The two of us.

830
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,360
Love Cupid.

831
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,680
Duoduo really...

832
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:20,480
Is a...

833
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,600
I think will also be a great friend.

834
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,320
Very positive.

835
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,720
I'm fired up, I got goosebumps.

836
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:39,880
Hello.

837
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:42,960
Hello.

838
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:43,800
Hello.

839
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,720
Got discouraged again.

840
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,200
He really doesn't look well.

841
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,480
What should we do?

842
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,200
If you were Xiao Jiao

843
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,360
and you saw this scene,

844
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,400
what would you do?

845
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,160
I think I would

846
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,640
back away or avoid it.

847
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,480
Really, you would still

848
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,920
choose to back away and avoid it?

849
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,120
Especially just now,

850
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,760
I had already gathered all my strength

851
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,520
and stored it up completely.

852
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,760
It was at its peak.

853
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,320
I was about to

854
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:31,880
explode.

855
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,640
It's just

856
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,320
that feeling.

857
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,320
Yes, it's exactly this scene.

858
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,800
Honestly, I can only

859
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,960
A bucket of cold water

860
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,640
I shouldn't be in the car

861
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,680
I should be under the car

862
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,920
But if it were me

863
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,960
I've always felt like I'm suppressing myself

864
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,160
But I have friends who encourage me

865
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,160
I should be myself

866
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,600
If I want to be brave, I feel like I just have to

867
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,880
Right now, I have that feeling

868
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:53,840
After I rushed in

869
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,600
I really would

870
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,720
Have a "do or die" attitude

871
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,720
I want to do it right now

872
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:58,960
Tell you

873
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,200
Whether it's good or not, it's fine

874
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,680
It took me a lot of courage

875
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,000
I don't want to go back again

876
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,200
That's not what I mean

877
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,160
It's just like earlier

878
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:05,600
What Duoduo said

879
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,120
That is

880
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,520
When a girl is in front of the boy she likes

881
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,440
She's very brave

882
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,960
But when a boy is in front of the girl he likes

883
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,680
He becomes much more cautious

884
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,560
He becomes timid

885
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,560
That's really true

886
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,520
But just now, it wasn't easy

887
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,720
At that moment when he was running

888
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,080
I was already fired up

889
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,640
I felt bad too

890
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,040
Come on, Ruilong, join you.

891
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,680
I can do sit-ups too.

892
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,640
But I can't do push-ups.

893
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,200
Those two.

894
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,800
I can do sit-ups.

895
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,360
As for push-ups,

896
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,320
I can only do them on my knees.

897
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,960
I can keep up with your pace.

898
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,480
Let's do it once.

899
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,960
Keep up with my pace.

900
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,520
Okay.

901
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,200
I don't know how many more I can do.

902
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:43,600
Come on.

903
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,120
Go ahead.

904
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,360
Duoduo is really easy to get along with.

905
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,040
Actually, I can do one.

906
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,400
Do one of what?

907
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,840
A one-handed one.

908
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,320
Start performing.

909
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,040
That's impressive.

910
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:54,800
You can do it one-handed.

911
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,520
It's your solo performance time.

912
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,400
I'm not really able to.

913
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,640
I can't do one-handed with you.

914
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,280
Not sure if now I still

915
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,320
can manage to do it.

916
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,040
You've already done a lot of sets.

917
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,400
Let me try.

918
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,680
Like this.

919
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,440
This is a bit too hard.

920
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,840
The more the girls say it's difficult at this moment,

921
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,360
the more motivated Ruilong gets.

922
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,360
That's right.

923
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,720
It's rare to get a chance to show off.

924
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,440
So impressive.

925
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,200
And also,

926
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:41,960
Amazing.

927
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,280
I can't do it anymore.

928
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,240
Is this how everyone trains?

929
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,040
Teacher Ruilong.

930
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,160
So much pressure.

931
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,280
So strong.

932
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,440
I really can't do it.

933
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,600
Stop using just one hand.

934
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,680
I'm not able to do it at all.

935
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,520
Alright, next.

936
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,440
Without using hands.

937
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,720
This is totally out of my league.

938
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,080
It's not within my ability.

939
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,280
Do another set.

940
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,200
He's showing another side of his charm.

941
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,680
So strong.

942
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,720
Great physical condition.

943
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,360
I can only say it's his physical fitness.

944
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,600
It must be really good.

945
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,680
Who?

946
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,280
Where are you going?

947
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,680
I'm going to check out that (station) roundabout.

948
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:38,640
Okay.

949
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,440
What about you?

950
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:41,920
I'm going to find them.

951
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,080
Lechen and Yuanyuan.

952
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,760
Actually, Lechen mostly talks with Luyuan and Duoduo.

953
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,600
Those two interact more.

954
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,160
Yes.

955
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,160
Who is it, really?

956
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:34,720
What are you doing?

957
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,360
Sleeping.

958
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,000
Sit-ups

959
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,240
You two

960
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,800
Family visit

961
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,040
Just came by to check in

962
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,680
You two go ahead and practice

963
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,400
I was just

964
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,000
I got startled at the door

965
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,280
Why were you startled?

966
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,760
Ruilong saw me standing at the door for a minute

967
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,000
Watching you do this

968
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:01,920
Getting some exercise

969
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,800
Ate too much today

970
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,000
Let me watch you do it again

971
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,440
Okay

972
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,960
It's subtle

973
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,920
Go ahead, I won't disturb you

974
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,040
I'm leaving, bye

975
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,640
You can disturb us, you're welcome to

976
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,320
Let's do a different exercise tomorrow

977
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:29,840
Alright

978
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,040
Yuanyuan knows exactly what's going on

979
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,440
So she gives them space

980
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,520
She leaves first

981
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,360
It's early

982
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,160
Early, really early

983
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:49,920
So early

984
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:54,880
Very happy

985
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,240
Had a great day today

986
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,080
What does "oh" mean?

987
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,320
Had a great day today

988
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:17,960
I realized

989
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,800
Ruilong is always present in these situations

990
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,120
He's witnessed it several times

991
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:31,680
Nods

992
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,240
He’s like an observer.

993
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,320
He’s pretty cute.

994
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:47,920
Did you see it?

995
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:48,880
See what?

996
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,680
Did you go and see?

997
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,800
I just went to take a look.

998
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,360
Your secret

999
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,040
is about to be revealed.

1000
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,480
Duoduo

1001
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,400
Duoduo started it.

1002
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,400
You’re not nervous, so I guess there’s no secret.

1003
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,440
Those questions of yours

1004
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,480
Did you answer them seriously?

1005
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:08,920
Of course.

1006
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:10,840
What’s wrong?

1007
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,040
Are you doubting me about something?

1008
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:13,840
Yes.

1009
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:15,560
Doubting what?

1010
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,360
Just curious.

1011
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,400
After all, we didn’t see it.

1012
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,680
I really want to ride a mountain bike.

1013
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,440
My Longlong.

1014
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,960
I don’t even know what secret.

1015
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,200
It’s Duoduo.

1016
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,320
What do you mean?

1017
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,000
Maybe Duoduo started it.

1018
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,200
His secret love message.

1019
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,000
Hurry and do yours.

1020
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,520
I’ll do a few.

1021
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:05,520
Bye.

1022
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,320
I’ll go up and wait for you.

1023
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,880
You’re pretending to be relaxed.

1024
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,000
Okay.

1025
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:33,560
Bye.

1026
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,080
Bye.

1027
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,040
It feels like he (Le Chen) came to confirm something.

1028
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,040
No wonder their looks were so full of meaning.

1029
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:53,960
So subtle.

1030
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,520
So she said that on purpose back then.

1031
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,840
Look at how much drama there is in this scene.

1032
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,880
How could I be so clueless?

1033
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,280
I only just realized it now.

1034
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,440
The only one kept in the dark

1035
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,840
was our Longlong.

1036
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,840
Longlong was showing off for nothing.

1037
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,440
He and Duoduo

1038
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,200
are probably together now.

1039
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,480
So it’s official.

1040
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,440
That’s how it looks to me.

1041
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,040
Hello.

1042
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,560
How have you been these past few days?

1043
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,120
I just don’t get it.

1044
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:30,920
I don’t get it.

1045
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,200
How come you’re just like me?

1046
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:34,160
Yeah.

1047
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,520
It’s not like I’ve ever understood it either.

1048
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,640
I feel like I’m just

1049
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:47,640
just really

1050
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,040
just

1051
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,480
Sometimes, after interacting, it feels like

1052
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,600
it’s actually okay.

1053
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,600
But sometimes it feels like

1054
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,600
Yifan was talking about Yuxing.

1055
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:58,360
It seems like

1056
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,520
there’s actually nothing there.

1057
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,400
Yesterday, I was with you.

1058
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,160
Weren't you sitting there?

1059
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,920
I often watch your mood.

1060
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,720
It's like I'm looking at myself.

1061
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,840
Really?

1062
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,360
Don't be like this.

1063
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,160
It's like we're mirrors to each other.

1064
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:15,840
We're here.

1065
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:16,880
I'm really good at it.

1066
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,720
I can sense your signals.

1067
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,000
Signals of heartbreak.

1068
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,240
That's hilarious.

1069
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:24,840
So cute.

1070
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:25,960
Right?

1071
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,040
It's so similar, isn't it?

1072
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:27,960
It's so similar.

1073
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,520
It's a bit too similar, what should we do?

1074
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:30,600
Help!

1075
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:38,640
Also,

1076
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,200
Mainly, I'm a very reciprocal person.

1077
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,200
I can be very enthusiastic.

1078
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:44,680
But

1079
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,640
If it's always

1080
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,920
in a cold state,

1081
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:49,880
I might become more

1082
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,080
withdrawn myself.

1083
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,360
I understand.

1084
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:54,880
I really understand.

1085
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,440
I totally get it.

1086
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,640
It feels like their moods are very similar.

1087
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,600
Their experiences at this stage are quite similar.

1088
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,080
Is Lanlan here?

1089
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:13,720
Xiao Jiao.

1090
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:14,480
What's wrong?

1091
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,000
I'm here to give you something.

1092
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,800
Thank you for the snacks you gave me.

1093
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,960
Jiao brings food to Lanlan every day.

1094
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,080
Here's something for you.

1095
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,320
This is that peanut.

1096
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,000
Yes, you can try it, there's another one.

1097
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:37,760
Thank you.

1098
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,800
Thank you for the snack you gave me.

1099
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,400
This is what I'm giving you.

1100
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,240
It's different.

1101
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,240
The ones for everyone are small.

1102
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:46,920
This one is big.

1103
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:47,960
It's the most classic one.

1104
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,680
Your snacks are really delicious.

1105
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:53,520
And every day,

1106
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,440
Yifan and Chichi also get to eat them.

1107
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,800
But honestly, I really like this moment.

1108
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,800
He's so happy.

1109
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,320
Does anyone care about the "cattle and horses" at all?

1110
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,560
But I still ate most of it.

1111
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,560
Thank you.

1112
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,080
Try it.

1113
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:14,800
Okay, no problem.

1114
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:15,600
You're so skinny anyway.

1115
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,120
Alright, okay.

1116
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,160
No problem, why don't you guys chat for a bit?

1117
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:19,520
Okay.

1118
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,080
I'm heading out.

1119
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,120
You've wrapped your (hand) up, right?

1120
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,960
I'm about to wrap it.

1121
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:23,640
Okay.

1122
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,280
Alright.

1123
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,080
Thank you.

1124
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,640
No need to thank me, thank you.

1125
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,040
Look at him now,

1126
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,120
doesn't he look like a little boy?

1127
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,040
So happy.

1128
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,320
His legs are moving so fast they're sparking.

1129
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,960
Just a little response

1130
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,520
can make him so happy he could take off.

1131
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:06,320
But I don't think Xiao Jiao has no chance at all.

1132
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,120
Honestly,

1133
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,040
I really don't think so.

1134
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,400
So happy, man.

1135
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,840
He's really so happy.

1136
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,960
I actually hope it can be like this.

1137
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:20,800
Because I think Xiao Jiao

1138
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:21,520
is really quite sincere.

1139
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,280
And from the very beginning,

1140
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:23,920
he was very

1141
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,680
passionate and clear in choosing her.

1142
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,120
It's been that way all along.

1143
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,600
So happy, man.

1144
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,440
Lanlan gave this to me.

1145
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,120
Lanlan gave this to me.

1146
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:39,560
Let's eat it together.

1147
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:40,400
Do you want to?

1148
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,320
This kind of happiness

1149
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,240
This happiest moment

1150
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,440
We have to share it together.

1151
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,880
I feel alive.

1152
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:48,480
Really.

1153
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,760
I'll just have a small piece.

1154
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,520
It's fine, have a big piece.

1155
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:53,320
Happiness.

1156
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,360
Come on, cheers!

1157
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,320
Happiness is simple.

1158
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,080
Eat together.

1159
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,120
It's about sharing with your best friend.

1160
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,120
Don't choke.

1161
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:21,880
So cute.

1162
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:26,800
That's why I say

1163
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,520
love is always so wonderful.

1164
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,720
It just hits you from time to time.

1165
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:31,360
But sometimes,

1166
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,240
it also seems to give you a glimmer of hope.

1167
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,600
You can never figure it out.

1168
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:00,840
It's all placed by the bedside.

1169
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,280
He's so excited that

1170
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,200
Ruilong understands everything.

1171
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,360
He even hid it.

1172
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,640
See, I told you about him.

1173
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:27,680
Xiao Jiao just needs a little encouragement.

1174
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,640
And he'll be fired up.

1175
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,640
There's a chance, there's hope.

1176
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,240
Bro, I'm back in the game.

1177
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,360
It's hard not to be happy.

1178
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,960
He really likes her.

1179
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:39,320
He really likes Lanlan.

1180
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,520
He likes her so much.

1181
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,000
But isn't this the best part of falling for someone?

1182
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,400
Yeah, honestly, if I were a girl,

1183
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,280
I would be moved.

1184
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,200
I think this is

1185
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,600
his pure sincerity.

1186
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,360
Yeah.

1187
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,400
Really, everyone's mood follows

1188
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,120
these people.

1189
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:54,920
It rises and falls.

1190
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,160
Up and down.

1191
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,120
Why?

1192
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:58,760
Master Kong Jasmine Tea "Signal of the Heart"

1193
00:50:58,760 --> 00:50:59,480
Season 8 is so good.

1194
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,120
Until the very last moment,

1195
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:02,720
we don't know

1196
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:03,760
what will happen.

1197
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,480
Of course, it's scary.

1198
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,120
It's Xiao Jiao

1199
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,120
in this process

1200
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:06,960
who might get hurt

1201
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,360
or feel uncertain

1202
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,720
or lose himself.

1203
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,200
But right now,

1204
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,120
what he's doing

1205
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:13,200
is getting a response.

1206
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:14,560
I think at this stage,

1207
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:15,400
he's gotten

1208
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,720
what he wanted—

1209
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,480
this feeling of excitement.

1210
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,480
I think this is it.

1211
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,240
It's very important.

1212
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,280
Yes.

1213
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:22,240
When men are

1214
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,560
in front of someone they like,

1215
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:25,040
their first reaction is to be timid.

1216
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,720
But when women are

1217
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,280
in front of someone they like,

1218
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,440
their first reaction is to be brave.

1219
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,880
This sentence can really

1220
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,640
open up and ease

1221
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,800
Xiao Jiao's whole state.

1222
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:38,680
Yes.

1223
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,480
I think this sentence is kind of like

1224
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,280
giving him

1225
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,680
a reassurance pill at that moment,

1226
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:44,000
or giving him

1227
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:44,960
a shot of confidence.

1228
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,320
It helped him better

1229
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,960
express his true self.

1230
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,080
Let's all share

1231
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,280
how we understand this sentence.

1232
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,440
I think the bravery and timidity here

1233
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,960
are more general terms.

1234
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:56,600
My understanding is

1235
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,760
when you meet someone you like,

1236
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,800
you encounter a side of yourself

1237
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,080
that you've never seen before.

1238
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:03,320
I feel like I

1239
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,080
am kind of like

1240
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:04,560
it feels like

1241
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,720
I become a bit different from my usual self.

1242
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,360
Yes, I think that's the key.

1243
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,560
Normally, I'm a passionate

1244
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,160
and very straightforward person.

1245
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,600
But when I meet someone I like,

1246
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,760
I become a bit timid, as they say.

1247
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,960
I don't know how to interact.

1248
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,040
I don't know what to do.

1249
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,240
And then my words

1250
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:21,920
become more reserved.

1251
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:22,200
Then

1252
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:22,840
I say everything

1253
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:23,360
without thinking

1254
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:24,720
Then I go home at night and think about it

1255
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:25,880
What I said today

1256
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:26,360
all these things

1257
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,160
So dramatic

1258
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:29,800
How did I even say that

1259
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,000
Trying to be perfect

1260
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,080
just makes it awkward

1261
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,360
But I’ve actually experienced this myself

1262
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,040
When I was a student

1263
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,160
I really did

1264
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,120
have a crush on a girl in my class

1265
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,600
I secretly liked her for three whole years until graduation

1266
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:43,800
I never said a word to her

1267
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,280
Did she know back then

1268
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:45,920
about this

1269
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,120
She probably had no idea

1270
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,480
because I hid it really well

1271
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,280
Even now, she doesn’t know

1272
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:49,880
who this mysterious

1273
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,000
girl is

1274
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:51,920
I bet there’s a whole bunch

1275
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,600
of mysterious girls saying

1276
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,360
Could it be me

1277
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,120
You know

1278
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:58,040
Jerry Yan liked me for three years

1279
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,600
It must be me

1280
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,280
Everyone’s matching themselves to the story

1281
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,600
Just now, in that situation

1282
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:08,320
Le Chen and

1283
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:09,680
Duo Duo's conversation

1284
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:10,840
Was it Duo Duo?

1285
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,440
I think it was Duo Duo

1286
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:13,200
I think

1287
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,280
What can be seen is

1288
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:17,040
Le Chen suspects it was Duo Duo

1289
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,040
Because last time

1290
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,880
Duo Duo used that (tracking) card

1291
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,960
But I think Duo Duo's reaction

1292
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,320
seemed to admit it too

1293
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,240
or at least gave him some feedback

1294
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:26,760
Why do I feel

1295
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:27,960
those two just had

1296
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,720
a very subtle vibe going on?

1297
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,120
Yeah.

1298
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,520
It's something Duoduo doesn't have with other guys.

1299
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,080
But I think Ruilong really

1300
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,680
admires Duoduo's values.

1301
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,960
That feeling—

1302
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,280
if it weren't for Chenchen,

1303
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,160
I would even think

1304
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:39,560
maybe

1305
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,440
Ruilong and

1306
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,960
Duoduo at the gym

1307
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:43,920
might have something going on.

1308
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,720
I really hope

1309
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:46,920
that at the beginning, when Duoduo

1310
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:47,840
was talking,

1311
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:48,520
Ruilong kept

1312
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:49,800
nodding in the back.

1313
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:50,800
Because everyone seems to think Ruilong

1314
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,920
is just a kid,

1315
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,920
but he actually speaks many languages,

1316
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,480
has a great education,

1317
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:56,640
and in the past,

1318
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,120
he's shown himself in these situations.

1319
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,720
He actually knows a lot.

1320
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:00,320
So I think

1321
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,280
when it comes to Duoduo's

1322
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,760
healthy

1323
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,560
and positive view on love,

1324
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,360
I think he really appreciates it, yeah.

1325
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:09,680
Let's take a look

1326
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,320
at who actually sent

1327
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,720
this secret love message.

1328
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,120
I really want to know.

1329
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,120
Is it about to be revealed?

1330
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,600
It's about to be revealed.

1331
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,360
Here we go.

1332
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,480
Here we go, everyone.

1333
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,840
Someone has opened your secret message box.

1334
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,520
Who is it?

1335
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,800
Who could it be?

1336
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:42,200
Think back.

1337
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,920
Which girl was missing at that time?

1338
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:44,520
Jue'er.

1339
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,800
It's like we're solving a case.

1340
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:47,960
It's getting mysterious.

1341
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:56,680
Who is it?

1342
00:54:59,160 --> 00:54:59,880
Who?

1343
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,440
We thought you went to ride the little train.

1344
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,240
If I ride the little train, you wouldn't see me.

1345
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,200
Your secret is about to be

1346
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:11,280
revealed.

1347
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,560
Waiting to be invited.

1348
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,560
That little key of yours.

1349
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,200
Who is it?

1350
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,120
I don't think it's Duoduo.

1351
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,360
You say it's not Duoduo.

1352
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,040
Is it possible that she

1353
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:22,760
is Yuanyuan?

1354
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,960
I can only say I hope it's Duoduo.

1355
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,480
Hurry and tell me who.

1356
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,320
It should be Yuanyuan.

1357
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,200
Hello, Chen.

1358
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,160
Finally, it's here.

1359
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,160
It's Yuanyuan.

1360
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,280
Hello, Chen.

1361
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,760
Look, she came straight back from Beijing.

1362
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,240
And the first thing she did was this.

1363
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:29,880
Now it depends on what Lechen

1364
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,040
really feels about her.

1365
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,040
Darn it, let me check.

1366
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,680
Who exactly opened my message box?

1367
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:51,400
Showed it to him.

1368
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:13,680
So sweet.

1369
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,320
Why are you laughing?

1370
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,440
It's just too sweet.

1371
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:43,280
It's so much fun.

1372
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:50,960
Did you guess it?

1373
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:51,760
That it might be me?

1374
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:53,440
No.

1375
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,080
Because I came back the latest.

1376
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,360
I didn't even know what happened.

1377
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,000
But you—

1378
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,360
When someone told you

1379
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:01,160
that your (mailbox) was opened,

1380
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:02,600
you really didn't suspect anything?

1381
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,200
I could probably guess.

1382
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,440
I could probably guess.

1383
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:11,920
Was it that obvious?

1384
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:12,640
I could probably guess.

1385
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:22,240
Here it comes.

1386
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,320
We're about to ride the little train.

1387
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:29,720
This is real.

1388
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,720
Honestly, this isn't a little train at all.

1389
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:38,200
It's so big.

1390
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,200
I like this.

1391
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,600
I like it too.

1392
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:43,440
Why do I feel like

1393
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,960
I've gone back to that place—

1394
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,840
the train station from Harry Potter.

1395
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:47,720
It became

1396
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:48,640
a moment of our own.

1397
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:49,800
A moment for the two of them.

1398
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:50,320
A special time.

1399
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,600
This is really quite romantic.

1400
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:53,440
That's right.

1401
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,440
This is amazing too.

1402
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:03,480
It has a great vibe.

1403
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:04,320
Which side do you want to sit on?

1404
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,160
I'll sit here.

1405
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,280
There's a cushion.

1406
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,400
I thought about this for a long time back then.

1407
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,440
What should I ask?

1408
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:25,040
I also spent a long time writing it.

1409
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:28,920
What's this?

1410
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,800
Are these the other person's five questions?

1411
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,040
Departure.

1412
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,000
I didn't expect that.

1413
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,400
It's really hard to have a conversation with you.

1414
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:43,120
What's wrong? Why is it so hard?

1415
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,000
There are too many people in the cabin.

1416
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:50,360
And I feel like

1417
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:51,840
if I don't go get this card,

1418
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:52,960
I might

1419
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,000
not even get to talk to you in the cabin.

1420
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:00,760
The brave get to enjoy the world first.

1421
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,000
Well said.

1422
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:04,960
Is that so?

1423
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:06,840
Actually, I originally

1424
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,440
wasn't that brave either.

1425
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:09,720
You're already very brave.

1426
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:11,680
I think you've been brave several times already.

1427
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:13,240
You're so bold.

1428
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:15,680
You're so bold.

1429
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:18,560
I really like brave people.

1430
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:23,880
Because in the past few times,

1431
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:25,280
I always felt

1432
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:27,760
you seem like a very impulsive person.

1433
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,360
A very impulsive person.

1434
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,080
I am indeed a very impulsive person.

1435
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,440
But actually,

1436
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:34,880
I think that's a good thing.

1437
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:45,880
The image of an ideal type.

1438
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,400
Actually, this thing

1439
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:50,800
I've thought about it before.

1440
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,320
I thought about it before entering the cabin.

1441
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,480
Maybe I could say some more

1442
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,960
before meeting my ideal type,

1443
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,360
I could mention some more specific points.

1444
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,320
I understand your point.

1445
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,800
But when you actually meet them,

1446
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,000
you'll realize that what you

1447
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:05,880
had imagined before

1448
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,600
might be completely different from

1449
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:08,800
what you thought before.

1450
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:16,720
I think setting a standard for the other person

1451
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,240
is actually an unreasonable demand.

1452
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:22,120
And I don't want to have any preset expectations.

1453
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:23,480
Because all along,

1454
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,280
one of my beliefs has been

1455
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,880
the greater the expectation, the greater the disappointment.

1456
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:28,120
I feel that if this person

1457
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:29,160
if one day she really

1458
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:29,880
suddenly appears,

1459
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:30,560
what she's actually like

1460
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,280
I wouldn't really care.

1461
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,400
And how the two of you get along,

1462
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,480
whether you're compatible, only you two would know.

1463
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:43,000
I definitely wouldn't settle

1464
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,360
just for the sake of being a good match.

1465
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,280
You really have to find someone

1466
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:52,000
who, deep down, you feel

1467
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,440
is the one you can keep loving.

1468
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,280
So you're not the impulsive type.

1469
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:07,240
Then, if others are impulsive,

1470
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:08,480
does that put pressure on you?

1471
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:11,600
That's a great question.

1472
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:12,240
Really good.

1473
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:12,800
Yes.

1474
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:14,120
So, if others are impulsive,

1475
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:15,360
does that put pressure on you?

1476
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:24,760
I don't think so.

1477
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:25,840
But it depends.

1478
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:27,200
It depends on the situation.

1479
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,480
It's like how I don't celebrate my birthday.

1480
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:30,440
It's the same with this.

1481
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:31,560
Because when I was a child,

1482
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,040
I couldn't get what I wanted.

1483
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:34,680
So later, I just stopped wanting them.

1484
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:37,640
So when I gave you that

1485
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:38,280
Peking University (badge),

1486
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:39,200
don't feel any pressure about it.

1487
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,840
I really just

1488
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,280
you know,

1489
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,040
brought it along by the way.

1490
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:46,880
Suddenly,

1491
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:47,680
when you gave it to me,

1492
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:48,440
I suddenly thought of

1493
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:49,560
that scene from that day.

1494
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:50,600
I just felt

1495
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,080
I just happened to hear it.

1496
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:52,880
I heard it.

1497
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,440
Yeah, I heard it.

1498
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:00,720
And then I happened to go back to Beijing.

1499
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,360
So I brought one for you.

1500
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,120
It could be a burden.

1501
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:14,080
You don't want it.

1502
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:15,160
Then give it back to me.

1503
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,440
No, let me give you something else instead.

1504
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:20,120
No, let me give you something else instead.

1505
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:21,920
Let me give you something else instead.

1506
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:23,840
We can talk about it.

1507
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,200
Time for a return gift.

1508
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:37,400
Everything she did when she came back

1509
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:38,720
was all for Le Chen.

1510
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:40,280
All of it.

1511
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:42,040
From roast duck to the school badge,

1512
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:44,840
and even this.

1513
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,920
The best and worst things you've experienced,

1514
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:50,640
or rather,

1515
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,720
it's actually the things that impacted you the most.

1516
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,480
I think

1517
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:00,800
it was probably during my coming-of-age ceremony.

1518
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:03,800
There was actually a part of the ceremony

1519
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,200
where

1520
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,760
parents were supposed to give their children

1521
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,400
some coming-of-age gifts.

1522
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,000
At that time, my dad and I

1523
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,320
had a big conflict.

1524
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:15,600
But he still came.

1525
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,080
He came,

1526
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:20,520
but he didn't come to see me.

1527
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:22,480
What do you mean?

1528
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,400
He was

1529
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:31,240
watching from the very back of the venue.

1530
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,200
And then,

1531
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,480
he didn't give me a gift that day.

1532
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,080
He waited until later, when

1533
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:37,760
our relationship

1534
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,320
had eased up a bit, to give it to me.

1535
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:40,360
And after that,

1536
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,960
I've always worn this necklace.

1537
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:44,440
This one.

1538
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:45,080
Yeah.

1539
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,360
Because my dad and I have very similar personalities.

1540
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:49,080
We're both

1541
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:53,280
very stubborn.

1542
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,280
Neither of us wants to back down.

1543
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:55,960
Yeah, the kind who never wants to give in.

1544
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:03,560
Yes.

1545
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:04,880
But you also need to understand

1546
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:07,000
that as a man, maybe

1547
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,080
he cares more about his pride.

1548
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:09,720
He’s good at comforting people.

1549
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:10,440
Alright.

1550
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:19,280
What about you?

1551
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,000
The best and worst things

1552
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,000
for me

1553
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,040
are just a few memorable impressions.

1554
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:27,400
That is to say,

1555
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,520
the first was when I got into college.

1556
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:32,640
How much did you want to get into college?

1557
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,760
Actually, after entering the school, I realized

1558
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:42,080
it felt like my life had changed a bit.

1559
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:44,880
And then,

1560
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:48,120
at that time, I joined the flag guard team.

1561
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:49,240
After joining that club,

1562
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:50,120
I felt

1563
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:50,920
that I could also

1564
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,720
become confident.

1565
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,840
I think this was

1566
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:56,960
a big change

1567
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,320
in my mindset.

1568
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,040
Why were you someone

1569
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:05,120
who was very insecure before?

1570
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:07,360
He probably has some trauma.

1571
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:12,360
Why do you think I'm not insecure?

1572
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:16,480
Because when you talk to others, you're very

1573
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:17,680
open and relaxed.

1574
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:20,120
And the topics you talk about

1575
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:22,200
you can come up with them yourself.

1576
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,240
You can talk a lot, too.

1577
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,040
Except for the first day, when you kept picking at your cup.

1578
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:27,320
You remember that so clearly.

1579
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,240
If you go by the Leo label,

1580
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:34,840
I should be someone very outgoing and generous,

1581
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:37,920
and also good at conversation.

1582
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:43,360
But in real life, I actually talk very little.

1583
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:46,320
Because of my family situation.

1584
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:47,040
It's my parents—

1585
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:48,680
they often don't talk at home.

1586
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:51,000
My home is the kind that's really lifeless.

1587
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:55,680
I get it. My family is cold like that too.

1588
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:58,560
It's my parents—

1589
01:06:58,560 --> 01:06:59,800
they got divorced.

1590
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:01,320
And then

1591
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,240
my dad is the kind who's really strict with me.

1592
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,680
So I'm really good at reading people's moods.

1593
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:14,480
Actually, both of them have some trauma.

1594
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:17,480
They both need a lot of love.

1595
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:29,240
You know, when I look at you now,

1596
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:30,080
it feels like something...

1597
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:33,680
Actually, you have countless impulses inside.

1598
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:35,480
But it seems like they're

1599
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:36,080
covered by something.

1600
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:37,000
Suppressed, yes.

1601
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,600
And now you've just left a few gaps

1602
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:40,440
to let them grow out.

1603
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:41,920
But they haven't fully come out yet.

1604
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,840
Right, my friends all say

1605
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:47,720
that if you talk to me, you'll find

1606
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:48,880
I'm actually a lot like a hedgehog.

1607
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:52,000
I protect myself

1608
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,960
especially the soft parts inside.

1609
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:54,680
I protect them very well.

1610
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:57,280
And I show a lot of spikes on the outside.

1611
01:07:58,560 --> 01:07:59,320
But actually,

1612
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,240
once you really get to know me,

1613
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:02,120
you'll see that I

1614
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,240
am still someone

1615
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,680
who really needs others deep down

1616
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:07,880
to see through me at a glance,

1617
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:10,440
come straight over,

1618
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:11,880
find the things that make me sad,

1619
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:13,080
and comfort me.

1620
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:16,960
But that's really hard.

1621
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:21,880
Don't worry, it'll happen.

1622
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:25,920
There will always be someone who sees through you,

1623
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:29,080
sees the vulnerability beneath your strong appearance.

1624
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:32,680
That's nice, healing each other.

1625
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:35,440
How did you make it sound so funny?

1626
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:36,400
Seriously.

1627
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:01,600
From what I see about them,

1628
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,320
based on their conversations,

1629
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:04,520
I feel that they actually

1630
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,000
are emotionally

1631
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,520
or perhaps have broken families,

1632
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,560
or perhaps have broken families,

1633
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:11,320
or have some minor traumas.

1634
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:13,320
They need deeper love

1635
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:14,240
to be given to them.

1636
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,200
So what you mean is

1637
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:18,640
sometimes when they meet someone else

1638
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:19,520
it's complementary

1639
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,280
it might be better

1640
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:20,520
I think being complementary is better

1641
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:22,080
I think being complementary is better

1642
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:23,280
because they're too similar

1643
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:24,760
because they're too similar

1644
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:25,800
Yes, but I actually think

1645
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:26,080
Yes, but I actually think

1646
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,160
their situation is

1647
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:28,840
very similar

1648
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:30,000
but also complementary

1649
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,520
there's that feeling in it

1650
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:32,320
Yes

1651
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:33,920
But when they spoke just now

1652
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:34,640
what moved me the most

1653
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:35,120
was actually at the end

1654
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:35,520
was actually at the end

1655
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:36,440
it was when

1656
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:37,800
Le Chen said

1657
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,120
how he sees Lu Yuan

1658
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,360
and then Lu Yuan expressed agreement

1659
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:43,520
I think at that moment, Lu Yuan was truly seen

1660
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:45,440
It's that feeling between people

1661
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:46,120
of truly seeing each other

1662
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:48,400
of truly seeing each other

1663
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:50,000
I think it's really precious

1664
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:51,520
You feel that with this person

1665
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:51,600
you've truly known each other

1666
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,000
truly known each other

1667
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:53,360
Because in everyone's heart

1668
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,080
Because in everyone's heart

1669
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,720
we all hope and long to be seen

1670
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:58,600
Yes, so tonight

1671
01:09:58,600 --> 01:09:59,320
between them

1672
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:02,040
a real connection happened

1673
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,120
Once a connection happens between two people

1674
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,440
they become special to each other

1675
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,360
Once a connection is made,

1676
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:12,120
they become special to each other.

1677
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:12,920
Yes.

1678
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:15,320
Just like the Little Prince and his fox.

1679
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:16,640
And they are

1680
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:17,720
each other's Little Prince

1681
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:19,040
and each other's fox.

1682
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:20,960
And this train

1683
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:21,640
is truly heading

1684
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:22,880
toward their hearts.

1685
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,760
I really like it when two people can have moments like this,

1686
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:28,320
you know, just the two of us, with no one else around.

1687
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:29,640
And having a space that's truly private.

1688
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:30,840
Sometimes, the topics we talk about

1689
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,440
can really

1690
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:34,840
reach into each other's inner worlds.

1691
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,520
We get to understand each other better.

1692
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:38,920
And I especially like

1693
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:40,120
the five core questions

1694
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:41,040
in this design.

1695
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:43,360
It gives two people

1696
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:44,800
a way to communicate.

1697
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,240
I think it's really efficient.

1698
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:47,880
At this stage,

1699
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:48,160
we can touch on

1700
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:48,240
these topics,

1701
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:49,520
and see if we

1702
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:51,320
agree or fit on the core issues.

1703
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:52,480
I think that's crucial.

1704
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:54,600
This really quickly brings

1705
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:55,440
us closer

1706
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:56,480
in terms of time and distance.

1707
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:57,160
Yeah.

1708
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:58,520
I think we can each share

1709
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:00,360
before entering a close relationship,

1710
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:01,360
the thing we care about most—

1711
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:01,840
what is the most important issue?

1712
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:02,440
What is the most important issue?

1713
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:04,600
The thing you care about most.

1714
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,000
This question is really hard, isn't it?

1715
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,400
Yeah, if you can only pick one,

1716
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:10,520
I think you have to think carefully.

1717
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:11,240
Because there are so many.

1718
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:12,240
No, I think you

1719
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:13,280
can just say whatever comes to mind now.

1720
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:14,240
Just look—

1721
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:15,040
I could list a hundred things.

1722
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:17,360
Hani has a hundred questions.

1723
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:17,920
Hani has a hundred questions.

1724
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:18,920
I would be very

1725
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:20,680
curious to know

1726
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:22,240
about his upbringing

1727
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:22,880
and the environment he grew up in,

1728
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,800
and his relationship with his family.

1729
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:26,040
And I also know

1730
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:27,960
what kind of approach to use when getting along with you.

1731
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:29,560
Second point,

1732
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:31,760
his sense of boundaries with female friends.

1733
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,880
Does he have any particularly close female friends?

1734
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:35,200
And how would he handle

1735
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,120
his relationship with them?

1736
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:37,960
I get jealous easily, I'm petty.

1737
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:40,080
Yeah, I understand, I'm petty too.

1738
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:43,800
So,

1739
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:44,000
I hope he can accept

1740
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:44,960
I hope he can accept

1741
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,360
everything about me as I am now.

1742
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:47,680
Don't make me change.

1743
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:49,080
Would you want to change him?

1744
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:51,080
I don't think I would.

1745
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:52,840
It's because of who he is now

1746
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:53,800
that I'm fascinated by him.

1747
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:54,600
That's why I like him.

1748
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,560
If he became like artificial intelligence,

1749
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:57,880
just like copy and paste,

1750
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:58,960
I would find it meaningless.

1751
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,080
I hope that he and I

1752
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,600
are both similar and very different.

1753
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:02,800
There should be a sense of exploration.

1754
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,840
I think it would be full of surprises.

1755
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:06,600
Let's see,

1756
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:07,800
I really want to see in the future

1757
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,400
who your boyfriend is.

1758
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:10,080
I really want to see.

1759
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:10,760
I want to see too.

1760
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:14,480
What I care about most is

1761
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:15,560
the sense of humor.

1762
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:16,840
About this sense of humor,

1763
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:19,280
it's not that the other person has to be very funny,

1764
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:21,680
but they need to understand what makes something funny.

1765
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:23,240
Your punchline has to land.

1766
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:23,920
My punchline has to land.

1767
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:24,320
If my punchline doesn't land,

1768
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:25,640
I feel worthless.

1769
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:28,440
What I care about most is

1770
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:29,320
being optimistic.

1771
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:30,800
Optimistic people

1772
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,600
have a certain energy.

1773
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:35,200
When you're optimistic,

1774
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:36,240
no matter what happens,

1775
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:38,200
you can always look at things

1776
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:39,240
from a different perspective.

1777
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:40,400
Without realizing it,

1778
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:41,920
you're influencing your environment.

1779
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:43,600
And everyone around you.

1780
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:45,600
Yes.

1781
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:46,560
I also like

1782
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:47,360
optimistic people because

1783
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,480
someone like Mengchen

1784
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:49,240
always has

1785
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:50,400
a way to solve problems.

1786
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:52,640
No matter how rough the road ahead is,

1787
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:54,360
no matter how hard it gets,

1788
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:55,800
I think we won't be afraid.

1789
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:57,200
Because any challenge,

1790
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,000
as long as the two of us

1791
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:58,400
are together,

1792
01:12:58,400 --> 01:12:59,080
it's not a big deal.

1793
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,160
So that's all for

1794
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:03,440
this week's

1795
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:05,400
heart-fluttering stories.

1796
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:06,760
Let's look forward together

1797
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:07,720
to next week

1798
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:08,480
of Kang Shifu Jasmine Tea "Signal of the Heart"

1799
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:09,080
Season 8

1800
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:10,240
to see what

1801
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:11,600
stories will unfold.

1802
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,560
When jasmine blooms, it's a signal of the heart.

1803
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:14,560
This program is sponsored by

1804
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:17,440
the floral and refreshing Kang Shifu Jasmine Tea.

1805
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:18,360
Title sponsorship provided.

1806
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:21,280
Every Thursday at noon, extra reality show content.

1807
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:22,840
Unlock more heart-fluttering clues.

1808
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:25,160
Every Friday and Saturday at noon,

1809
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:26,280
join us to watch the heart-fluttering moments.

1810
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:28,480
The Heart Family cross-season collaboration

1811
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:29,560
keeps you company for all the fun.

1812
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:31,280
Go to Tencent Video Caocangdi

1813
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,840
to get the same heart-themed merchandise as the guests with one click.

1814
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,960
Everyone, see you next week.

1815
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:23,040
Another little train started running today.

1816
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,200
Someone started a secret conversation.

1817
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,320
He started her little train.

1818
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:30,440
I hope it's him.

1819
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:32,520
These rules are really well designed.

1820
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:33,880
Everyone has a chance.

1821
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:36,240
What?

1822
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:37,440
Park time.

1823
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:41,880
Only once a week.

1824
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:43,760
Midweek park date.

1825
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,200
It has to be done in person.

1826
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:47,400
Planning and preparing the date.

1827
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:48,160
Here it comes.

1828
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:49,760
Who?

1829
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:55,360
I've been looking forward to it.

1830
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:57,840
Alright, the first one.

1831
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:03,200
Our Heartbeat Apartment will welcome

1832
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:04,720
brand new rules.

1833
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:06,240
Open day event.

1834
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:08,200
Our guys will invite their

1835
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:10,320
brother group to visit Heartbeat Apartment.

1836
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:17,360
I got goosebumps just watching.

1837
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:20,720
I've been wearing

1838
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:21,800
the sleep mask you gave me these past two nights.

1839
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:24,560
I often

1840
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,200
talk to myself.

1841
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:27,680
I even debate with myself.

1842
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:31,600
I look forward to someone disrupting my plans.

1843
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:34,960
Wei Ni, do you want to practice too?

1844
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:42,880
So who will we actually choose?

1845
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:43,440
Duoduo (Ke Ailin)

1846
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:44,200
Chichi (Sun Hanqing)

1847
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,080
Help, I'm sweating!

1848
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:47,120
Looks like they're pretty nervous.

1849
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:47,720
Really nervous.

1850
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:49,440
Bro, my muscles are already getting pumped.

1851
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,120
That look is starting to kill.

1852
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:54,040
This date isn't bad.

1853
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:55,400
You're really good at dating, man.

1854
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:56,400
So good at dating.

1855
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:57,880
You guys are really something (laughs).

1856
01:15:57,880 --> 01:15:59,120
Taking initiative leads to stories.

1857
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:00,360
That moment was when my heart skipped a beat.

1858
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,040
My ears are a bit red now.

1859
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:03,160
Now my ears are ringing.

1860
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:04,520
Get a grip.
