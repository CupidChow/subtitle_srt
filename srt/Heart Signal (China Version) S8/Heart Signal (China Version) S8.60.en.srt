1
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,560
We're in Xinjiang.

2
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,920
Why isn't it moving?

3
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,920
Be good, sweetheart.

4
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,480
Turns out it's following me.

5
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,760
Then you have to follow me.

6
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,760
Now I'm the one following you.

7
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,320
Guess I'll have to steal you away.

8
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,000
Let's ride off together.

9
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,880
Life is a vast wilderness.

10
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,600
I really like you.

11
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,320
My heart is fluttering.

12
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,240
Me too.

13
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:18,880
Heart Signal Apartment

14
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,760
The final long-distance date is coming.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,320
I'm definitely choosing this.

16
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,160
I've made up my mind.

17
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,160
I'll go with you.

18
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,880
What about these two?

19
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,360
Let's see what they say.

20
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,640
Tension's in the air.

21
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,480
It's time for a showdown.

22
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,880
Does the order of choosing matter?

23
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,000
I definitely won't team up with Yifan.

24
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,000
Then you should've just now...

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,080
...gone up first.

26
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,520
It's fine, you can still change now.

27
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,640
My suggestion is...

28
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,680
I hope we follow the girls' wishes.

29
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,200
Don't.

30
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,120
Here it comes.

31
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,560
Here it comes.

32
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,040
That thing floating in the water...

33
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,960
What is it?

34
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,720
Aquatic plant.

35
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,800
Grass in water is called aquatic plant.

36
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,200
Wipe the lens.

37
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:13,680
Wipe the lens.

38
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,520
You're good at finding things.

39
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,760
I think...

40
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,520
First, I want to state my position.

41
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,960
What position?

42
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,400
Accompany.

43
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,280
It feels different being together.

44
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,360
We're here.

45
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,680
When jasmine blooms, it's Heart Signal.

46

00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,040
Welcome, everyone.

86
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,200
It's another week.

87
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,080
Welcome back, Minghao.

88
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,960
Minghao.

89
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,080
Let's share

90
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,280
what happened last week.

91
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,680
Shall we?

92
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,560
Leyuan couple is sweet as can be.

93
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,280
That cliffside confession.

94
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,560
The one picking flowers.

95
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,200
Then shouting "I like you."

96
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,560
So sweet.

97
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,080
The whole world was just the two of them.

98
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,400
Yeah.

99
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,120
It's totally

100
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,080
a "couple's" daily life.

101
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,840
But when traveling,

102
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,720
they talk about everything.

103
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,200
Actually, you get more sparks.

104
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:34,920
Yes, that's possible.

105
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,840
It could happen.

106
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,240
Because it's not that

107
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:37,920
being together

108
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,200
is best done by

109
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,000
traveling.

110
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,280
Right.

111
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,440
Because in this process,

112
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,840
everyone's lifestyle

113
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,840
and way of expressing

114
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,960
Yifan and Yuxing.

115
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,560
Their

116
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,920
date scene looked great.

117
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,520
It was raining.

118
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,600
Watching a movie outdoors.

119
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,440
But what they talked about

120
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,400
was really a bit off.

121
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,640
They even said it was a "trial."

122
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,200
Yeah.

123
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,040
The date wasn't really

124
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,000
pleasant.

125
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,360
But Zihan and Chichi,

126
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,080
you can feel

127
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,600
every time Zihan is with Chichi,

128
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,760
their time together

129
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,040
is truly high quality.

130
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,200
Yes, definitely.

131
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,040
Absolutely.

132
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:05,920
Minghao, soon

133
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:05,960
the new week is coming.

134
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,080
The new week is coming.

135
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,520
Is there anyone

136
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,480
whose story you're looking forward to?

137
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,120
Or do you think

138
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,800
Xiaofang and Rulan should

139
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,000
will

140
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,400
develop even better.

141
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,440
It's the final

142
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,440
push time.

143
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,440
Final push.

144
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,120
Yeah.

145
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,520
So let's look forward to it together.

146
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,840
Let's watch together, shall we?

147
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,240
Okay.

148
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,040
Alright, next

149
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,120
I'm also curious

150
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,520
after everyone meets up,

151
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,440
what stories will unfold.

152
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,800
Everyone, our Heart Signal stories

153
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,760
begin now.

154
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,200
Let's go.

155
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,400
Where is this?

156
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,880
Qiandao Lake.

157
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:38,760
Near Hangzhou.

158
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,720
What did you do today?

159
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,280
Drove.

160
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,080
Drove.

161
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,840
Drove all day.

162
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,360
From there,

163
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:45,920
drove to here.

164
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,480
Drove to here.

165
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,560
What about you guys?

166
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,160
Where did you come from?

167
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,320
Where did you come from?

168
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,560
Take a guess.

169
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,960
I can't guess.

170
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,600
I went into a "movie."

171
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:57,800
In a movie?

172
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,480
What do you mean?

173
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,080
A movie in the rain.

174
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,640
Is that really how you'd describe it?

175
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,120
No, it's real.

176
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,640
Really.

177
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,840
It's not just a nice description,

178
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,320
the place was actually recreated.

179
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,400
It's that Miyazaki style.

180
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,040
Where is it?

181
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,000
A cherry blossom valley.

182
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,160
That sounds nice.

183
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,600
But there are no cherry blossoms now.

184
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,480
Can we start eating now?

185
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,600
Everyone, let's dig in.

186
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,920
We had a heavy rain last night.

187
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,720
We were watching a movie.

188
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,800
Which movie did you watch?

189
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,800
"Begin Again: Meeting You in New York"

190
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,360
Meeting You

191
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,040
Meeting You

192
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,320
We watched it during the rain.

193
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,520
Was it at a theater?

194
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,520
No, just a projector.

195
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,600
That's how it was.

196
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,960
There was a screen.

197
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,960
Just the two of you?

198
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,320
His long-distance date

199
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,120
A misunderstanding in choices

200
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,160
Still hasn't been cleared up

201
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,200
She (Sun Hanqing) still doesn't know

202
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,320
why Yuxing didn't come.

203
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,720
Let's each share one thing.

204
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,440
The happiest activity here

205
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,080
If I had to pick the happiest

206
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,920
Maybe watching a movie on a rainy day

207
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,880
It really was.

208
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,840
No matter when it happens,

209
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,120
it's a rare experience.

210
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,160
Teacher Jin taught me

211
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,520
many life lessons.

212
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,640
How did Yifan start calling Yuxing

213
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,040
Teacher Jin?

214
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,320
When did you start calling me Teacher Jin?

215
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,360
She just called you Teacher Jin.

216
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,600
I heard it and thought, "Who is that?"

217
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,760
I think it's because they talked it out.

218
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,080
So the way they address each other changed.

219
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,200
But from Chichi's perspective,

220
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,240
sometimes secret nicknames between two people

221
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,640
can make others feel a bit jealous.

222
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:38,920
It can.

223
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,760
Makes you wonder if there's something between you two.

224
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,480
Right, because she totally

225
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,320
doesn't know the backstory.

226
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,640
She doesn't know Yuxing and Yifan talked it out.

227
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,240
Yeah.

228
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,800
Today we went to

229
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,240
the top of the mountain, the view was nice.

230
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,720
What kind of view?

231
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,640
Rolling hills and peaks.

232
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,640
Well, not that dramatic.

233
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,720
Not that exaggerated.

234
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,280
Just

235
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,560
I think it's about right.

236
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,040
Small peaks lined up one after another.

237
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,440
Very peaceful.

238
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,640
Did you watch the sunrise?

239
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,360
No, just the blazing sun.

240
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,560
Just the blazing sun.

241
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,400
Got sunburned, you know?

242
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,160
Already

243
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,320
went for a "tan."

244
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,120
Yeah, went for a tan.

245
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,360
Did he (Zihan) notice

246
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,040
that Chichi's

247
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,920
mood was a bit down?

248
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,600
So he tried to lighten the mood.

249
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,120
Yes.

250
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,720
But I'm thinking about something.

251
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,680
If you were Yuxing,

252
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,840
would you want to use this chance

253
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,600
to just tell everyone

254
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,320
the order of the profile stickers last time?

255
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,920
Would Chichi then know

256
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,840
that you had

257
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,080
a reason for not coming?

258
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,640
Yeah.

259
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,200
But that's not possible.

260
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,120
I think he'll definitely

261
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,680
find a private moment.

262
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,960
So,

263
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,560
what fun things are there at the hotel?

264
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,120
Other stuff.

265
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,280
A place to sing.

266
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:40,880
A place to sing.

267
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,520
Yeah, and there's a barbecue grill.

268
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,520
Barbecue grill.

269
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,320
And a "Top of the World" spot.

270
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,560
Top of the World

271
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,480
The highest point.

272
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,960
Do you have to walk up there?

273
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,600
Yes, you do.

274
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,760
But at night,

275
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,960
you probably can't see much, right?

276
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,960
If you want to see, you'll always find something.

277
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,480
That line

278
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,880
What's up with that?

279
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,240
Now even the way I talk

280
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,320
I talk like that too.

281
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,120
Same style.

282
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,200
Yeah, I've been influenced.

283
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,720
Gotta think about what it really means.

284
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,880
No, that line

285
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,680
is only true in a different setting.

286
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,480
The important things can't be seen with your eyes.

287
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:17,920
Yeah.

288
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,680
You have to see with your heart.

289
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,920
You have to see with your heart.

290
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,400
That spot

291
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,960
is just for enjoying the atmosphere.

292
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,600
This kind of talk

293
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,720
is for those who get it.

294
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,440
What made you happiest?

295
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,680
Night tour of Nanxun Ancient Town.

296
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,880
Why?

297
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,400
First, I'd never been there before.

298
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,280
And also,

299
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,520
I had a great chat with Duoduo on the boat.

300
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,320
We really had a good time talking.

301
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,760
It's the people that matter.

302
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,040
Yeah.

303
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,880
What about Dr. Fang?

304
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,680
Had a late-night snack last night.

305
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,360
It was fun.

306
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,000
Was it the buying process that was fun?

307
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,920
Or the eating part?

308
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,000
The process was fun too.

309
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,280
Eating was also fun.

310
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,840
Last night's snack was great.

311
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,760
Taking photos was fun too.

312
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,000
What did you eat for the snack

313
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,960
to be so happy?

314
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,880
A whole lot.

315
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,520
A lot.

316
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,640
Ice cream, ribs,

317
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,160
local yuanxiao tangyuan,

318
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,280
and more.

319
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,680
I think this trip

320
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,920
made up for regrets.

321
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,360
We split into islands back then.

322
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,960
And many hadn't been to the islands.

323
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,840
I think it made up for

324
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,360
those travel regrets.

325
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,080
After this trip,

326
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,320
the experience in the cabin

327
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,320
was truly

328
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,440
very complete.

329
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,160
Let's go for a walk.

330
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:29,640
Let's go.

331
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,200
Let's go.

332
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,520
How was today?

333
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,640
It was pretty fun.

334
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,520
Tonight, we can really have a good talk.

335
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,640
We really can have a deep talk.

336
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,240
Slow down.

337
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:42,760
Okay.

338
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,480
So, next is...

339
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:44,720
Right.

340
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,680
It's what we just talked about.

341
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,720
That place for singing.

342
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,640
So beautiful.

343
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,320
Barbecue.

344
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,080
Is there a late-night snack too?

345
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,800
This is...

346
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,480
You sing, I'll grill.

347
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,760
Then we grill, and they sing.

348
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,280
Sure.

349
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:02,560
Sure.

350
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,360
I can grill too.

351
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:03,960
I can join you guys.

352
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,760
Then the three of us will grill.

353
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,640
Is it this one?

354
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,000
Yes.

355
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,440
It's this one.

356
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,240
When you brush it, move it to the side.

357
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:11,960
Right.

358
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,000
What should we sing?

359
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
"Encounter" works.

360
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,520
Feels like we all know "Encounter."

361
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,800
Let's listen.

362
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,640
Yifan, try this one.

363
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,280
Okay.

364
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,360
Let's order this then.

365
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,160
Fan it a bit farther from the fire.

366
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,960
Otherwise, the fire won't calm down.

367
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,600
This one's burnt again.

368
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,400
Let me do it.

369
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,040
You three are so "funny."

370
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,880
Grilling so seriously.

371
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,400
All for you to eat.

372
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,120
It's burnt.

373
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,880
I just put it on and it burned.

374
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,400
The fire's too strong.

375
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,640
Sing a song.

376
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,200
Sing.

377
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,440
Pick one we can all sing.

378
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:02,760
Let's do a Phoenix Legend song.

379
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,880
Let's do a Phoenix Legend song.

380
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,600
Come on.

381
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,520
Everyone knows this one.

382
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,760
I know it.

383
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,360
Come on.

384
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,160
I know it.

385
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,160
What's this?

386
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,600
"Above the Moon."

387
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,480
It really is Phoenix Legend.

388
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,320
I just said let's do one.

389
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,480
Phoenix Legend song.

390
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,320
Someone with the same taste as me.

391
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,960
So catchy.

392
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,480
This song is perfect for gatherings.

393
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,640
This song is perfect for gatherings.

394
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,840
Great for getting hyped.

395
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,800
I'm gazing far away.

396
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,280
Above the moon.

397
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,320
Too high.

398
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,000
Yesterday forgotten.

399
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,840
I only know these two lines.

400
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,840
So stylish.

401
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,400
Brother Herry (Liu Zihan)

402
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,960
Awesome.

403
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,280
Awesome.

404
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,200
You're really awesome.

405
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,880
Let's sit for a while.

406
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,320
Those two are so natural.

407
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,880
They just end up sitting close together.

408
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,760
How bad is your singing, really?

409
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,080
How bad is your singing, really?

410
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,600
I'll sing for you sometime.

411
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,040
Embarrassing in public.

412
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,880
In front of so many people.

413
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,200
It's fine to be embarrassed.

414
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,920
How was your day?

415
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,240
Not great.

416
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,720
Because I didn't know what you guys did.

417
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:35,880
I didn't see you today.

418
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,240
I didn't see you today.

419
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,000
I wondered what you did today.

420
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,440
"Help!"

421
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,960
Actually, that word is important.

422
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,640
Very important.

423
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,920
That word unlocked

424
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,520
all of Dr. Fang's worries.

425
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,280
Right.

426
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,120
I didn't see you today.

427
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,480
I didn't see you today.

428
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,640
I wondered what you did today.

429
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,320
I was thinking as soon as I left

430
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:53,960
what you all were doing.

431
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,480
Because weren't we

432
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,640
three people coming together?

433
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,640
But when we left, it was just two.

434
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,680
Who told you to text on day one?

435
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,960
Sorry.

436
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,040
It's fine now.

437
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,960
Next time.

438
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,240
I'll be the fastest at everything next time.

439
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,880
And those two can't help

440
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,560
but smile when they look at each other.

441
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,240
Right.

442
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,920
See?

443
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,400
They have this

444
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,280
really good thing.

445
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,720
They always talk things out.

446
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,400
Right.

447
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,320
What did you do today?

448
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,280
How was your day today?

449
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,000
No overnight grudges.

450
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,760
She's good at showing her feelings

451
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,800
and affection.

452
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,840
Right.

453
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,000
So Dr. Fang doesn't have

454
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,160
any anxiety left.

455
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,360
It's all resolved.

456
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,360
Some are happy, some are sad.

457
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,520
It's complicated.

458
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,520
Brother Jiao.

459
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,760
Don't look back.

460
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,000
Don't look back.

461
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,320
Look forward.

462
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,720
I think the result doesn't matter.

463
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,960
The process is what matters.

464
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,160
We think the same way.

465
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,120
Yifan comforted Xiao Jiao.

466
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,920
Because they actually feel the same.

467
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,160
What's this?

468
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,360
Come on.

469
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,520
What's this?

470
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,560
Come on.

471
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,720
Come on.

472
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,480
I really...

473
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,520
You've definitely heard this. Go.

474
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,160
Jiao, your turn.

475
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,520
Go ahead, first line. Go.

476
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,920
You go first.

477
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,240
The vast horizon is where my love lies.

478
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,440
Flowers bloom at the foot of endless green hills.

479
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,160
What kind of rhythm

480
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,200
is the most swinging of all?

481
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,120
What kind of singing brings the most joy?

482
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,720
Curving rivers flow down from the sky.

483
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,440
They run to a sea of countless colors.

484
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,160
Fiery songs are what we look forward to.

485
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,160
Singing as we walk is the freest way.

486
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,360
If we sing, we sing with all our heart.

487
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,920
Come on.

488
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,760
The most beautiful clouds

489
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,600
Let me keep you here with all my heart.

490
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,560
Stay here.

491
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,080
Sing gently with the brightest ethnic style.

492
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:26,200
It's the sky's most beautiful look.

493
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,520
Getting hyped up!

494
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,120
Zihan's presence is actually pretty important.

495
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,600
Let's pick "King of Love Songs."

496
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,400
Let's do a relay.

497
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,000
Sure.

498
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,240
"King of Love Songs"

499
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,520
You're so hard to forget.

500
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,400
You're so hard to forget.

501
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,600
Drifting in and out of my heart.

502
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,080
Your turn.

503
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,880
How do you sing this part?

504
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,920
How much courage does it take to change?

505
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,760
That sounds right.

506
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,720
That sounds right.

507
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,760
Churning feelings

508
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,520
How do I calm them down?

509
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,200
Let's do "Heart Too Soft."

510
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,120
Heart too soft.

511
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,360
Heart too soft.

512
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,280
How do you sing it?

513
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,640
Carry all the problems alone.

514
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,160
Falling in love is always easy.

515
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,520
Getting along is too hard.

516
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,240
If it's not yours,

517
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,040
don't force it anymore.

518
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,840
Your turn.

519
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,440
When you get to this line,

520
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,320
Don't.

521
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:23,560
Take it away.

522
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,240
This is just too much of a coincidence.

523
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,000
It's a classic.

524
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,560
Why is it those two, just by chance?

525
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,120
That's hilarious.

526
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,080
If it's not yours,

527
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,880
don't force it anymore.

528
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,680
Your turn.

529
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,160
Done.

530
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,400
Do you guys want to pick a song?

531
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,440
Pick a song.

532
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,240
See if there's a song

533
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,600
everyone can sing together.

534
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,240
Let's take a look.

535
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:40,840
It's right here.

536
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,840
Next, let me see.

537
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,520
What can we sing?

538
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,360
Next.

539
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,440
Is it a Jay Chou song?

540
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,160
Everyone knows those.

541
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,000
Probably.

542
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,600
Right?

543
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,360
But Jay Chou's songs

544
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,920
I think Jay Chou's songs are tough.

545
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,440
It's fine.

546
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:00,840
Feels too high.

547
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,760
Or maybe JJ Lin.

548
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,280
Jay Chou.

549
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,320
Or maybe someone like Zhang Jie.

550
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:04,760
Sure.

551
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,560
This is...

552
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,280
This one's nice too.

553
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,280
Is this one too sad?

554
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,160
Way too sad.

555
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,800
That's it.

556
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,480
What kind of man is that?

557
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,400
This line also feels...

558
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:26,720
"When You"

559
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,800
We can sing this together.

560
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,400
Go ahead.

561
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,760
When your eyes squint with a smile,

562
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,320
When you say it's late and you can't sleep,

563
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,240
I want to tell you

564
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,880
but I'm afraid I'll say it wrong.

565
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:44,960
I really like you, do you know?

566
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,040
Thinking too much.

567
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,480
Back to bed.

568
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,320
We'll meet in dreams.

569
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,240
Without any hesitation.

570
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,320
Say it out loud.

571
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,600
I want to say

572
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,200
When your eyes squint with a smile,

573
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,600
When you say it's late and you can't sleep,

574
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,640
I want to tell you

575
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,280
but I'm afraid I'll say it wrong.

576
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:15,520
I really like you, do you know?

577
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,080
Come on, sing.

578
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,760
Are you charged up, Zihan?

579
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,280
Go ahead.

580
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,280
A little bit charged.

581
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,920
Let's switch songs then.

582
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,120
Today is just a...

583
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,000
Sing.

584
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,080
A bit sad.

585
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,520
Don't want to sing.

586
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:33,640
I'll do it then.

587
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:35,400
Can I turn my volume up a bit more?

588
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:36,840
Can I turn my volume up a bit more?

589
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,120
Can I turn my volume up a bit more?

590
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,480
Really, Yuxing has to find a chance to say it.

591
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:01,800
Really, Yuxing has to find a chance to say it.

592
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,080
But I'm also wondering

593
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,400
if she's waiting for Yuxing

594
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,400
to explain something to her.

595
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,320
Looks like you really enjoy singing too.

596
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,880
Yeah, I go wild singing in the karaoke room.

597
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,640
I'm a "mic hog."

598
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,200
Yeah.

599
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I know every song.

600
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,800
But I sing every one badly.

601
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:21,600
No.

602
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,000
I think you sing pretty well.

603
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,720
What's the next song?

604
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,360
It's "Soy Milk and Fried Dough Sticks."

605
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,000
No.

606
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,360
"Soy Milk and Fried Dough Sticks"

607
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,920
Why did Zihan leave?

608
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,000
Look at his angle.

609
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,000
How is he up there?

610
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,920
I'll go up and check.

611
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,200
Okay.

612
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:28,640
Go take a look.

613
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,160
Alright.

614
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,560
It's so hard, not easy at all.

615
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,600
Really.

616
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,120
Rarely see Zihan like this.

617
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,680
Zihan bro

618
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,080
Really all alone

619
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,680
at the Top of the World

620
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,760
Top of the World

621
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,640
Do you want to sit for a bit?

622
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,440
Let me

623
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,040
Okay

624
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,400
Thanks

625
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,840
Your spot here

626
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,200
is amazing

627
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:12,920
A bit risky

628
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,440
The riskier the place,

629
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,560
the safer it feels

630
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,680
True

631
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,960
This is a good place to think

632
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,160
When I really

633
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,880
enjoy a moment

634
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,120
I get scared it will

635
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,800
disappear in a flash

636
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,360
and slip away

637
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,280
Yeah, so I tend to

638
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,200
go up and down

639
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,000
Right, like now

640
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,760
I'm at a low again

641
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,160
Because I just felt so happy

642
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,360
But it doesn't feel real

643
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,240
Me too

644
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,800
I think the happier the time,

645
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,120
the more it hides

646
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,960
a cliff-like, sudden goodbye

647
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,040
Yeah

648
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,720
So now I want to

649
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,760
record it from a third-person view

650
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,400
Lanlan probably sensed

651
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,320
Zihan's

652
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,280
mood today

653
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,440
They're friends

654
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,120
It's so quiet here

655
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,080
Right?

656
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,400
Nice view too

657
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,600
Why are you suddenly here?

658
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,440
I just told Zihan bro

659
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,120
We feel

660
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,640
a lot of things

661
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,680
at first, maybe

662
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,320
you're immersed in a happy place

663
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,960
but you need a moment

664
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,560
to step back

665
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,600
Have you figured out

666
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,480
your feelings these days?

667
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,040
Have you decided?

668
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,320
I asked you first

669
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,000
I don't know

670
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,280
That answer

671
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,680
Not many days left

672
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,000
Not many days left

673
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,680
Final sprint

674
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,080
Yeah

675
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,720
Let's go, let's head down

676
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,760
Because there really aren't many days left

677
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,640
I hope everyone can

678
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,920
in this final sprint

679
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,480
find the right moment

680
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,880
to say what you want

681
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,120
and do what you want

682
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,000
get it all done

683
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,120
That's more important than anything

684
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,240
Honestly, I want to hold it in

685
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,240
Yuxing should find a chance

686
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,000
to talk to Chichi

687
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,920
and express himself

688
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,480
They need some alone time

689
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,840
He wants to give her space too

690
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,120
He doesn't want her

691
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:03,920
to feel too pressured

692
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,480
Right

693
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,160
Come on

694
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,360
Let's keep watching

695
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,600
Xinjiang

696
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,960
What time did you sleep yesterday?

697
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,880
Slept from three to five, couldn't sleep after

698
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,920
You really didn't sleep

699
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,760
I did, three to five is still sleep

700
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,880
You know last night

701
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,800
I dreamed all night

702
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,320
Me too, all night

703
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:26,760
Really?

704
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,200
Really

705
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,440
My dream last night was so complex

706
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,800
I can't even explain it

707
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,040
Did you dream of each other?

708
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,720
I had so many dreams in a row

709
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,680
I kept dreaming, one after another, all night

710
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,680
If you're tired, I'll get that

711
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:41,880
capsule for you

712
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,600
No big deal

713
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,480
Don't be like that

714
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,840
Even being tired now feels happy

715
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,840
Not tired anymore

716
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:48,840
I feel for you

717
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,600
I feel for you

718
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,040
What's the use of feeling for me?

719
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,560
I don't want your sympathy

720
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,640
Today I feel reborn

721
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,280
It was too late last night, so I didn't look for you

722
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,240
I could only look at your light

723
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,840
Let's review

724
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,440
Otherwise, it's still unresolved

725
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,320
Come on

726
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,760
So after you thought about it yesterday,

727
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,520
what was your conclusion?

728
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,960
What did they do yesterday?

729
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,560
So your previous long-distance was three years?

730
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,040
How did you handle it?

731
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,400
I went to visit every week.

732
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,280
Darn it, I spent

733
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,320
more of my time so we could

734
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,000
be together as much as possible.

735
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,560
Long-distance really comes with more

736
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,240
challenges and difficulties.

737
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,400
That's true.

738
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,360
It's the issue of long-distance.

739
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,760
It's actually a pretty big problem.

740
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,560
It's just...

741
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,560
Are you willing

742
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,320
to spend time and energy

743
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,480
to try, or

744
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,400
to work things out with the other person?

745
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:04,920
Right?

746
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,640
Would you accept the other person's efforts?

747
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,480
I would.

748
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,880
It depends on

749
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,000
your mindset and the other person's attitude.

750
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,040
Some people

751
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,080
might not be able to accept your way of working things out.

752
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,760
Some people just

753
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,920
can't figure it out.

754
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,200
That happens sometimes.

755
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,800
You probably haven't faced this before.

756
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,800
I've never done long-distance.

757
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,880
Are you studying for two years or three?

758
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,520
Three years.

759
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,520
So, three years.

760
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,520
You still have three years left.

761
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,200
So right now,

762
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,760
you're still open to long-distance?

763
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,520
She wants an answer.

764
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:53,840
How should I put it...

765
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,880
Because it's been a long time

766
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,960
since I did long-distance.

767
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,320
But

768
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,360
I know what long-distance feels like.

769
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,840
Because you

770
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,560
aren't really part of the other person's life.

771
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,600
A lot of things, you still

772
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,480
project your own ideas

773
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,080
onto the relationship.

774
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,400
But how things really are for each person,

775
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,760
only you truly know.

776
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,880
It depends on how well you work things out.

777
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,280
So you still can't accept it?

778
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,520
Is that what you mean?

779
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,720
She still cares about this answer.

780
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,280
I'm not saying whether I can accept it

781
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,160
the long-distance thing.

782
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,360
Because if you just look at this one thing,

783
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,520
it's too vague.

784
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,480
Even if I say I can accept it now,

785
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,360
what happens in the future

786
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,160
none of us can predict.

787
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,200
What I mean is,

788
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,320
after this phase ends,

789
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,480
can you accept it then?

790
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,120
It depends on how things work out.

791
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,880
She didn't get the answer she wanted.

792
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,480
I don't want you to struggle internally.

793
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,880
And I don't want you to

794
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,760
deny certain things because of this.

795
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,680
All I can say is,

796
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,120
I'll do my best, but

797
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,360
how it actually turns out,

798
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,200
I can only

799
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,280
follow my conscience.

800
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,680
Yeah.

801
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,800
So it's still possible, right?

802
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,400
She still wants to be sure.

803
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,320
Yes.

804
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,160
What should I do?

805
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,240
Lu Yuan wants

806
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,240
to confirm if Le Chen

807
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,520
can accept a long-distance relationship.

808
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,400
And Le Chen's attitude

809
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:01,880
is just

810
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,000
to work things out.

811
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,160
But you know, maybe I

812
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,920
I know you can't promise.

813
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,400
It's not that I can't promise, I mean

814
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,640
I don't want you, in this role,

815
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,120
to feel the same pain again.

816
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,440
But when you're thinking about it,

817
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,360
you can just think about your own feelings.

818
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,560
You don't have to think about me.

819
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,160
It's hard for me.

820
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,520
Hard for you to what?

821
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,400
It's hard for me to do that.

822
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,520
So do you still need

823
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,800
more time to think?

824
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,440
Or do you already have an answer?

825
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,440
The two "little selves" are fighting.

826
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,160
Let me have a moment later.

827
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,000
When I get off, I need to be alone

828
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,720
for a bit longer.

829
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,320
How's your "little self" battle going?

830
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,000
Thanks for your effort.

831
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,360
It's not hard.

832
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,360
Life is tough.

833
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:22,880
Wang Le Chen.

834
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,640
Is it really that hard to be brave?

835
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,440
For you?

836
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,960
It's not hard. What's hard is

837
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,520
how to accept it.

838
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,440
Do you not trust me, or yourself?

839
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,880
That's actually our biggest difference.

840
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,560
I still don't get it.

841
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,560
Get some rest.

842
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,080
It's tough for both of us.

843
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,440
Honestly, what I'm thinking now is

844
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,880
if what you're worried about

845
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,320
if what you're worried about

846
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,000
like long-distance,

847
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,800
in my view, maybe

848
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,840
it's not that

849
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,200
three years will definitely change things.

850
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,560
I mean, the way you act

851
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,800
I just don't care

852
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,360
how this relationship goes,

853
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,680
what the outcome is,

854
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,200
or what the process is.

855
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,840
I hope you always

856
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,680
take responsibility for yourself.

857
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,160
Whatever you do should

858
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,040
follow your own heart.

859
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,560
I won't do things I'll regret.

860
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,960
And don't do anything just because

861
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,360
you feel you have to compromise.

862
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,800
I hope you never do that.

863
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,040
I won't. This is my choice.

864
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,560
These are all things my choice brings

865
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,760
and what I have to bear.

866
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,320
So when you're thinking about it,

867
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,160
You don't have to think about it.

868
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,680
How I'm feeling.

869
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,880
Of course I have to consider it.

870
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,920
How could I not think about it?

871
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,680
Then you should

872
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,400
just think about it a little.

873
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,360
Don't overthink it.

874
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,720
I can't just think about it a little.

875
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,720
Because for me,

876
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,800
this is a really important thing.

877
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,400
It's important to me too.

878
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,040
I kept thinking about today all last night.

879
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,400
Let's calm down first, and then

880
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,080
I think what's more important is

881
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,040
when we're offline,

882
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,680
or after this is over,

883
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,960
we can really get to know each other.

884
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,320
Actually, for you,

885
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,080
your understanding of me

886
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,680
I can only say it's maybe

887
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,400
twenty percent.

888
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,080
Twenty or thirty, yeah.

889
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:23,920
Twenty or thirty.

890
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,720
I'm also someone who

891
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,640
doesn't want any relationship

892
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,680
to be completely

893
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,880
without knowing the other person

894
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,600
and just start it so easily.

895
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,200
And I think that

896
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,920
And I think that

897
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,640
if you start without knowing each other,

898
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,840
it's careless to begin a relationship.

899
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,640
It's really irresponsible to both people.

900
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,440
That's why I haven't started anything.

901
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,840
Because I prefer the kind

902
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,440
where both people get to know each other

903
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,040
and then focus and commit

904
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,120
to building a relationship.

905
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,920
I don't want to rush into it.

906
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,760
So I think the main thing is

907
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,480
really,

908
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,400
if we're serious about this,

909
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,520
I truly think the experiences

910
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,880
we've had in the cabin

911
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,920
set the bar pretty high.

912
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,880
Can't start high and end low, right?

913
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,320
Right.

914
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,240
Because that would be a big letdown.

915
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,640
But what I worried about before was

916
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,080
you might not want to keep going

917
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,080
after the cabin is over.

918
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:24,640
That's not true.

919
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,960
I never meant that at all.

920
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,440
Yesterday, I thought that's what you meant.

921
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,640
No.

922
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,760
Maybe I didn't express myself well.

923
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,240
You really did

924
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,920
Maybe yesterday you were asking

925
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,480
with that question in mind,

926
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,800
so my answers came out that way.

927
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:39,880
So you didn't get

928
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,040
So you didn't get

929
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,120
what I meant.

930
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:42,320
what I meant.

931
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,320
Apologies.

932
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,160
Sorry.

933
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,440
I'll bow to you later.

934
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,560
Alright, I'm happy now.

935
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,840
I thought you understood.

936
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,760
No.

937
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,360
It's good we talked it out.

938
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,960
The weather's better today than yesterday.

939
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,440
Thanks to your good mood.

940
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,240
We had to talk it through.

941
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,560
Otherwise, I'd have held it in all night.

942
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,840
Could stir up a storm anytime.

943
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,720
Scared me to death.

944
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,400
This was a sudden moment

945
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,160
of drama on our trip.

946
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:13,920
It's a long-distance thing.

947
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,680
This question

948
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,720
I think it's good to talk about it

949
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,640
This is something that must come up

950
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,640
in a relationship between two people

951
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,880
that you have to face and deal with

952
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,000
I think it's because

953
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,320
this "trial romance trip"

954
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,240
gave the two of them a chance

955
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,560
to spend time together privately

956
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,920
and put this issue

957
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,560
on the table to solve

958
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,680
in a space like this

959
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,160
From what I heard

960
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,760
in that conversation just now

961
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,480
maybe at first, Luyuan asked

962
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,040
if you could accept a long-distance relationship

963
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:39,840
and when

964
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,760
Lechen couldn't give

965
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,000
a definite answer

966
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,480
Luyuan might take it as

967
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,240
this is something that's doomed to fail

968
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,600
But just like in that talk

969
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,040
Luyuan actually understood Lechen meant

970
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,840
to wait until after the cabin experience

971
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,120
and see how they get along

972
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,200
before making a decision

973
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,240
And I think because of their age gap

974
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,280
they're truly at different life stages

975
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,240
One has to work

976
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,880
and the other is going to Beijing for grad school

977
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,640
So the questions she asks

978
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,640
and what she cares about are different

979
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,520
Yuan just wants to be sure

980
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,400
But Lechen

981
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,320
maybe based on

982
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,920
some practical concerns

983
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,920
says they need to adjust

984
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,040
and see how things go in reality

985
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:14,600
That's true

986
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,440
Long-distance relationships really are

987
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,400
Long-distance relationships really are

988
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,880
something you need to plan for

989
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,400
It's not like this time

990
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,120
with the "trial romance trip"

991
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,080
where you just go on a whim

992
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,680
For example, you need a plan

993
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,920
to meet once a month

994
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,760
for how long

995
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,120
and where, and so on

996
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,320
This really needs

997
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,280
planning and communication

998
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,280
Yes, I agree with you

999
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,680
In this "trial romance trip"

1000
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,680
we saw the distance from attraction

1001
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,680
to commitment

1002
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,120
In real life

1003
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,960
it also starts with a spark

1004
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,480
but you have to go through a process

1005
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,720
before you can make a commitment

1006
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,080
and be sure the other is the one

1007
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:46,920
Before, this process

1008
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,200
was invisible to us

1009
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,480
But this time, because of the "trial romance trip"

1010
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,480
we got to see it

1011
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,360
and discuss it ahead of time

1012
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,600
Because in the cabin's pure romance setting

1013
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,480
usually

1014
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,720
this doesn't really come up

1015
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,480
It's usually about

1016
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,480
values

1017
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,760
or what kind of relationship you like

1018
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,480
still stuck in the dating context

1019
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,520
But this is actually about real life

1020
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,560
focusing on reality

1021
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,760
and the problems you might face

1022
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,400
That's the meaning of the trip

1023
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,040
Are we riding?

1024
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,480
Give me a ride

1025
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,400
Let's go

1026
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,360
I'll take you

1027
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,120
for a spin

1028
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,160
We should be able to drive a big loop

1029
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:23,840
Sure

1030
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,280
For you

1031
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,680
You should pull it tight

1032
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,520
It might get a bit fast

1033
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,440
Wang "Takumi"

1034
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,640
What you said

1035
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,880
Wait, I'll tighten it a bit

1036
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,520
Tie it tight, in case it flips

1037
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,560
Then I couldn't escape

1038
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,400
Then I couldn't escape

1039
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,240
You just can't escape

1040
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,680
Can't escape his grasp

1041
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,680
Wang Lechen, I hate you

1042
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,600
You hate me?

1043
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,920
Let's see, where to drive

1044
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,760
Circle around over there

1045
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,280
Awesome

1046
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,680
We can try this too

1047
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,480
Feels like my face is shaking

1048
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,480
Awesome

1049
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,400
Give us a direction, "Captain"

1050
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:30,960
Straight ahead

1051
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,040
Go

1052
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,240
Go

1053
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,440
Lechen turns right on purpose

1054
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,360
Turn right

1055
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,600
A deliberate right turn

1056
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,240
Turning right, the force comes here

1057
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,800
They're so happy

1058
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,880
Careful

1059
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,480
See, another right turn

1060
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,120
Refreshing.

1061
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,080
Covered in grass.

1062
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,920
Feels like I have grass in my mouth.

1063
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,160
Will you look at me?

1064
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,200
Look in the mirror.

1065
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,120
Just keep it on.

1066
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,160
Here, this part of yours—

1067
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,600
Your crown is really flat, see?

1068
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,920
The crown is flat.

1069
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,360
How did it get like this?

1070
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,480
But it's fine, really.

1071
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,200
Don't move.

1072
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,080
Lower your head.

1073
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,400
You really treat me like a mirror.

1074
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,520
Of course.

1075
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,280
Why are you pursing your lips?

1076
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,560
It's Heart Signal.

1077
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,320
Like this?

1078
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,040
Okay.

1079
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,200
Sit.

1080
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,920
Actually, I really like

1081
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,080
the way they get along.

1082
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,440
I think it's comfortable.

1083
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,480
They've really opened up.

1084
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,080
When you're on the grassland,

1085
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,200
it feels so vast.

1086
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,600
Everything else seems so small.

1087
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:20,840
Yeah.

1088
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,520
Come on, let's see

1089
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,760
what's happening at Qiandao Lake.

1090
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,440
Everyone is

1091
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,560
doing something over there.

1092
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,000
Should we head out?

1093
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:29,440
Let's go.

1094
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,080
Let's take a walk first.

1095
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:34,640
Sure.

1096
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,480
If you want—

1097
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,880
I'll go with you.

1098
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,360
Okay.

1099
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:39,720
Alone now, hurry up.

1100
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,560
Alone now, hurry up.

1101
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,280
Singing really made me

1102
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,360
a bit tired.

1103
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,040
Zihan is here too.

1104
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,480
Zihan is so supportive.

1105
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,760
We can sit over there.

1106
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,760
There are four chairs there.

1107
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:46,680
Are you sad?

1108
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:47,840
Me?

1109
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,840
I'm not sad now.

1110
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:49,760
Not sad.

1111
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,800
Singing makes me happy.

1112
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,520
Should I say it?

1113
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,960
Say it, it's time.

1114
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,600
Where do I start?

1115
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,040
You don't know where to begin?

1116
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,480
Just start from there.

1117
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,280
The guy should speak first now.

1118
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,400
Right.

1119
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,640
Because he needs to explain.

1120
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,880
Nights like this have a gentle breeze.

1121
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,200
Watching a movie outdoors feels nice.

1122
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,080
Didn't you watch it?

1123
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,920
Didn't you watch it?

1124
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,960
Didn't you watch it?

1125
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,280
I did, but—

1126
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,400
It's not the same as watching with you.

1127
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:55,640
Very good.

1128
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,120
How have you been these past two days?

1129
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:06,960
See, she has to ask.

1130
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,240
These past two days,

1131
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:12,920
pretty good.

1132
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:17,560
How about you?

1133
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:19,640
Yesterday I went to see—

1134
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,960
Did you go to the zoo yesterday?

1135
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,520
I really like the zoo.

1136
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,160
I also made pizza.

1137
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,280
I think these two days were fun.

1138
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,520
Really?

1139
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,200
Say it.

1140
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:41,920
Just—

1141
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,080
The topic's already here.

1142
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,200
Can I ask?

1143
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:02,160
What?

1144
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:03,560
What?

1145
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,160
When you picked that group—

1146
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,320
How did you choose?

1147
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,000
See, she has to ask.

1148
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:11,680
Explain it well.

1149
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,600
This is important.

1150
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:13,960
How did you choose?

1151
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,000
Actually, at first I

1152
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,720
chose you.

1153
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:22,480
Finally.

1154
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,640
Finally.

1155
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,160
That night,

1156
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,760
I just looked at your order.

1157
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,520
And then—

1158
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,240
I took my card and put it

1159
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:31,600
on that—

1160
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,680
in the middle column of yours.

1161
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,320
But later,

1162
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,640
I ran into a big problem.

1163
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:44,560
We discussed until

1164
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,280
after four o'clock.

1165
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,960
No one would give in.

1166
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,760
Nobody wanted to compromise.

1167
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,680
Later, I thought

1168
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,160
if I didn't

1169
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,440
make a sacrifice,

1170
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,600
maybe it couldn't be solved.

1171
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:08,640
Yeah.

1172
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,560
It was already morning by then.

1173
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,920
Sad character.

1174
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:30,120
Now I'm one more.

1175
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,680
Are you someone who sticks to yourself?

1176
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,200
Depends on the situation.

1177
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,280
Depends on what it is.

1178
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,440
Depends on the situation.

1179
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:55,480
When you do

1180
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,840
what you want to do,

1181
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:57,680
do you

1182
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,840
stick to your own ideas?

1183
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,880
Not always, I can be

1184
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,560
pretty influenced by others.

1185
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,080
He didn't get what the girl wanted to hear.

1186
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:19,840
They're not on the same page.

1187
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:20,400
Yeah.

1188
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:44,720
I think

1189
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,320
maybe one-on-one is what I want most

1190
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,360
when I'm in a crowd

1191
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,080
I don't really like to talk

1192
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,680
Honestly, I've always thought you're like

1193
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,320
the Quiet Flower we put together

1194
00:49:59,320 --> 00:49:59,600
the Quiet Flower we put together

1195
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,040
What is that?

1196
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:01,760
What is it?

1197
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,000
Why?

1198
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:04,840
Because

1199
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,840
I think when the Quiet Flower is

1200
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:11,520
swaying in the wind, it's

1201
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:12,960
pretty quiet

1202
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,560
But its English name is

1203
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,320
bellflower

1204
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,120
But it also seems like you can hear

1205
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:19,880
some

1206
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,400
echoes of bells ringing

1207
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,360
But it still gives a very quiet

1208
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:30,280
and peaceful feeling

1209
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,200
You think I'm peaceful?

1210
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,400
Yeah, I think it's like

1211
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:39,880
swaying alone in the wind

1212
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,240
It's very

1213
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,960
So does that mean your view of me is pretty

1214
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:43,680
just

1215
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,160
My previous understanding was quite

1216
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,240
one-sided

1217
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,120
Actually, she feels she doesn't know him yet

1218
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,400
But what do you think you are like?

1219
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,920
I think I'm like a sunflower

1220
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:06,680
Sunflower

1221
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:09,320
Sunflower

1222
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,400
We've always been positive

1223
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:15,280
positive

1224
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:16,760
never give up

1225
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:18,520
growing toward the sun

1226
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,040
chatting

1227
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:23,520
chatting

1228
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,600
Doesn't a sunflower have

1229
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,360
seeds?

1230
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,680
He's as abstract as ever

1231
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,680
Doesn't a sunflower have

1232
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,440
seeds?

1233
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,800
easy to snack on

1234
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:42,360
Thanks

1235
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,000
Another lame joke

1236
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,400
You've cried yourself out

1237
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,160
You're hurt too deeply

1238
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,960
Why does it feel like every song chosen

1239
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,840
has something they want to say

1240
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,640
instead of just picking a song

1241
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,920
You've cried yourself out

1242
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,680
You're hurt too deeply

1243
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,600
You've loved too foolishly

1244
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,440
Feels like up to now

1245
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,320
we haven't talked much

1246
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,240
I think we've talked quite a lot

1247
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,440
But it feels like our conversations

1248
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,800
the depth of understanding

1249
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:23,680
is kind of

1250
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,320
pretty shallow

1251
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:26,360
That's true

1252
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,760
The pace is a bit slow

1253
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:30,600
Yeah

1254
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,360
A little

1255
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:34,240
feeling

1256
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:36,840
Before, you

1257
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,320
I think before, you were

1258
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,440
just

1259
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,280
a green train

1260
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,600
"clank"

1261
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,280
What does that mean?

1262
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,640
"clank"

1263
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:51,800
And sometimes you have to

1264
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:52,680
add some coal

1265
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,160
pull that lever

1266
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,000
I think you're describing yourself

1267
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,600
Really

1268
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,080
I'm not that bad

1269
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:05,680
I've already

1270
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,840
I've gotten so anxious I knocked on your door

1271
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:12,880
Yeah, so sometimes you

1272
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,040
go "beep"

1273
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,560
and then smoke comes out

1274
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:19,600
I've really

1275
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,960
gotten so anxious I knocked on your door

1276
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,760
And you still call me a green train

1277
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,360
Then you're the Brave Train Hero, okay?

1278
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:30,120
To be honest

1279
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,120
I really like Brave Train Hero

1280
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:33,920
But right now

1281
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:34,760
mentioning Brave Train Hero

1282
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:35,320
isn't great

1283
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,360
Then you're the Brave Train Hero, okay?

1284
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,520
The smile disappeared

1285
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,720
See, she doesn't even want to reply

1286
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,760
That sigh

1287
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,920
We really can't keep talking

1288
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:59,520
Do you think

1289
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:02,240
is feeling more important or is getting along more important?

1290
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,680
Good, that's a great question

1291
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,040
I think

1292
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,240
both feeling and getting along

1293
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,040
are pretty important

1294
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:10,720
But

1295
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,000
feeling is a bit more important

1296
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,800
Genius is ninety-nine percent sweat

1297
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:17,920
plus one percent inspiration

1298
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,680
I think that one percent inspiration

1299
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,040
is more important than ninety-nine percent sweat

1300
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:21,720
more important

1301
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:23,720
Do you think in relationships

1302
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,080
this saying applies too?

1303
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:25,880
Yes

1304
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,600
I think for two people to get along

1305
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,720
you need that one percent feeling

1306
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,880
plus ninety-nine percent getting along

1307
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,840
First comes the feeling, then getting along

1308
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,320
becomes smoother

1309
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,920
and you really click

1310
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:46,080
What do you think?

1311
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,120
Of course

1312
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,520
Of course, both are important

1313
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,120
But getting along is also important

1314
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,320
I think my sense of security is pretty low

1315
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:04,920
Actually, I think

1316
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,840
what you need is

1317
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,880
more encouragement and companionship

1318
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:09,360
Right?

1319
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,720
I really need encouragement

1320
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:14,480
and companionship

1321
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,360
Their vibe also makes me

1322
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,120
feel a bit uncomfortable watching

1323
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,080
It's uncomfortable for everyone

1324
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,400
They're not on the same wavelength.

1325
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,120
They're not in sync.

1326
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,040
Each is talking past the other.

1327
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,240
Maybe if she hears

1328
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,640
how hard he's trying

1329
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:42,400
to make this happen,

1330
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,360
she might feel a bit better.

1331
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:44,040
Yeah.

1332
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,520
Right now, it just feels like

1333
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,400
it's not that clear.

1334
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,320
It's too understated.

1335
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:48,680
Chichi has already shared

1336
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:49,920
her pain points with him.

1337
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:50,920
She basically handed it to him,

1338
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,120
asking him to explain.

1339
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,960
But Yuxing just skipped over it.

1340
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:56,320
His abstract way right now

1341
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,400
I think it's

1342
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:58,920
not the kind that makes people happy.

1343
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:02,280
Chichi keeps hoping for Yuxing.

1344
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,480
But time after time,

1345
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:06,400
he doesn't give her that satisfaction.

1346
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,320
This whole conversation

1347
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,400
is honestly just

1348
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,080
so worrying.

1349
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:11,160
It's concerning.

1350
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,480
So Chichi might slowly

1351
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,640
pull her feelings back.

1352
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,360
Don't we have any happy songs?

1353
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,640
What do you want to sing?

1354
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,440
Let's do a cheerful one.

1355
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,400
Sure.

1356
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,640
Let's sing something upbeat.

1357
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:27,360
You want to sing

1358
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,600
what kind of happy song?

1359
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:55,000
In this cold, unfeeling city,

1360
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,240
at these modern, decadent parties,

1361
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:01,320
whenever the guitar noise starts up again,

1362
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,280
That's impressive.

1363
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:06,440
This group

1364
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,600
is the "No Company Quartet."

1365
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:11,640
Where did you go?

1366
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,040
I went up to change clothes.

1367
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,200
Then I saw Lanlan and Dr. Fang off.

1368
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,200
Singing really is wonderful.

1369
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,960
Music truly is a great thing.

1370
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,640
I see you guys are still singing.

1371
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,320
Is it possible the three of us

1372
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:44,400
are more alike?

1373
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,240
Sad people see sadness in others.

1374
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,080
Sadness.

1375
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,600
But really, there aren't any sad people.

1376
00:57:58,600 --> 00:57:59,360
We're just

1377
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:00,160
just

1378
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,360
sharing the same mood.

1379
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,360
Yeah.

1380
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:21,920
Is there any food left?

1381
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:22,800
I'm actually a bit hungry.

1382
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:23,800
I'll go take a look.

1383
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:24,520
I'll just check quickly.

1384
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,080
We just grilled a lot of food.

1385
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:27,320
We can bring it all out.

1386
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:27,880
Ouch, that hurts.

1387
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,320
Don't leave just yet.

1388
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:30,880
Let me do it.

1389
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,800
It's "battered and bruised" every day.

1390
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,120
You.

1391
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:44,240
Me.

1392
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,000
Yeah.

1393
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:46,160
Each other, I guess.

1394
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,120
I don't.

1395
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,000
You don't.

1396
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:49,520
No.

1397
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,160
I think I'm sure of my feelings.

1398
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,160
And I feel like my challenge

1399
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,680
was completed really well.

1400
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:01,560
I think I did great.

1401
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,120
One hundred percent.

1402
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:04,160
That's a fact.

1403
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:14,960
Real barbecue.

1404
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,040
Did you see that fire?

1405
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:24,160
I think we still need a challenge.

1406
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,320
To separate it out.

1407
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:26,280
Just

1408
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,680
What are you doing now?

1409
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,680
Are you doing it with

1410
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:31,720
a clear purpose?

1411
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:33,240
Or do you have to get something?

1412
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:34,600
Those are two different things.

1413
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:39,160
I think, first of all, people are free, right?

1414
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:42,000
And if you truly like someone,

1415
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:43,800
the first thing is,

1416
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:44,880
I want you to be happy.

1417
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:45,800
If possible,

1418
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,080
I hope we can both be happy.

1419
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,360
Do you have any questions?

1420
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:49,120
No questions.

1421
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:58,280
But I'm not happy.

1422
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,080
But I'm not happy.

1423
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:16,400
I think the reason you're unhappy is

1424
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:18,280
You

1425
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,840
are focused on your

1426
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,000
sunk costs.

1427
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,160
Your effort and investment.

1428
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,280
You're not satisfied with yourself

1429
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:30,080
and what you've done in the past,

1430
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:32,080
or are you unhappy with that person

1431
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,360
for not giving you feedback?

1432
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:34,920
Those are two separate things.

1433
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,000
No problem.

1434
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:39,360
Really good.

1435
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:52,760
I need feedback.

1436
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,520
But if there's no feedback,

1437
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:58,560
I start to have doubts.

1438
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,520
I really agree with what you said.

1439
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:03,960
Everyone needs feedback.

1440
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:06,680
And also,

1441
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:07,840
If the other person gives a little feedback,

1442
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:09,280
you feel safe to invest a bit more.

1443
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:10,000
Yes.

1444
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:10,880
I think that's fine.

1445
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:12,480
Everyone has their own pace.

1446
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:13,680
Some people move at

1447
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:15,680
zero point two speed.

1448
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:17,600
Your pace might be two point zero speed.

1449
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:18,960
But the key is before,

1450
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,800
she said she's a fast-paced person.

1451
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:24,600
I think actions matter more than intentions.

1452
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:27,240
I feel everyone's self-perception

1453
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:28,400
isn't always accurate.

1454
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:30,240
So I think

1455
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:33,160
you can't use what someone says

1456
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:33,920
as a

1457
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:36,640
reference standard.

1458
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,280
You should go by what you feel

1459
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:39,200
as your reference.

1460
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:40,680
Right.

1461
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:44,120
So maybe this

1462
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:46,000
side glance

1463
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,360
is so cute.

1464
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:53,600
I really think having

1465
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:54,840
a friend like Duoduo

1466
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:55,760
is amazing.

1467
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:56,600
Really.

1468
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:57,600
So nice.

1469
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:59,360
Duoduo actually opened up

1470
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:00,880
from that moment before.

1471
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:02,760
If she hadn't opened up,

1472
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,120
she couldn't say these things.

1473
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:06,720
Maybe romance didn't happen,

1474
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,240
but at least there's friendship gained.

1475
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:08,880
Yes.

1476
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:11,480
Can we leave this place?

1477
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,160
Can we go back for a walk?

1478
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,120
Let's go.

1479
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:21,720
We're a bit cold.

1480
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:22,520
Let's go back and sit for a while.

1481
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:22,840
Okay.

1482
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:23,480
When you're done,

1483
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:25,080
we can take it back to eat.

1484
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:25,680
Yeah.

1485
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:26,320
All good.

1486
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:26,560
Sure.

1487
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:27,200
You go ahead, yes.

1488
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,000
You go.

1489
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:30,280
Thank you.

1490
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:31,440
I understand.

1491
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,120
Why do I just want to stay in the living room?

1492
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:36,280
It's hard for people to control

1493
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:37,800
their facial expressions.

1494
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:41,920
When you receive

1495
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,000
a lot of negative emotions from others,

1496
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,360
do you become negative yourself?

1497
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:45,120
No.

1498
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:46,520
Then your self-healing ability

1499
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:47,400
is pretty good.

1500
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,240
Yeah, my healing ability is strong.

1501
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:50,120
I'm good at healing myself.

1502
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:51,040
You know, I cut my hand.

1503
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:51,600
I just cut it yesterday.

1504
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:52,600
Today it's already healed.

1505
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:54,320
My body is like that too.

1506
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:55,560
My mind and body are the same.

1507
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:57,560
Yeah, my mental and physical strength are both strong.

1508
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:58,200
One person.

1509
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,720
Duoduo isn't just good at self-healing.

1510
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,800
She heals others well too.

1511
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,120
Alright.

1512
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:05,400
It's over.

1513
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,440
Food's ready.

1514
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:07,560
Let's go.

1515
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:11,480
I feel really happy.

1516
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:13,280
We did so much tonight.

1517
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,280
Sang songs, grilled meat, and chatted.

1518
