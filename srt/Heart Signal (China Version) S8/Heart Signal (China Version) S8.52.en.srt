1
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,560
Hello everyone!

2
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,640
We're back again.

3
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,800
I'm from Signal of the Heart.

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,080
Season 8, Duoduo Ke Ailin.

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,200
Hello everyone!

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,400
I'm from Signal of the Heart.

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,160
Season 8, Lu Yuan Xiaoyuan.

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,840
Hi everyone, it's still me.

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,600
Signal of the Heart.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,800
Season 8, Jin Yuxing.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,840
Today, we'll continue

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,640
to join you for "Watching Signal of the Heart Together".

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,440
Let's keep watching.

14
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,360
That's a pretty interesting way to express it.

15
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,600
You're still like a little sun.

16
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,720
It's so heavy.

17
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,920
We don't have just one summer.

18
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,240
Summer is still going on.

19
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,840
Are we making sentences with "summer"?

20
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,720
But do you ever feel

21
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,800
if you invite Le Chen

22
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,720
on the day to walk the dog,

23
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,280
he tells you it would be better.

24
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,360
I thought, I mean,

25
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,280
maybe the way I see it,

26
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,000
for example, if you

27
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,120
just normally invite someone

28
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,760
to do something with you,

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,280
the smooth process should be

30
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,640
if I want to walk the dog,

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,880
I can just say it or act on it,

32
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,360
and go walk the dog with you.

33
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,680
If you don't want to walk the dog,

34
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,800
that's simple too.

35
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,640
Yeah, just say it directly.

36
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,560
Or say it politely.

37
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,760
Like, "I'm a bit tired today."

38
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,880
Or you could

39
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,960
if you're shy to say it,

40
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,920
you can let

41
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,720
your good friend

42
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,760
or use another way you think is suitable

43
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,880
to pass the message.

44
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,360
I think if we

45
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,920
communicate well,

46
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,040
we could all just

47
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,520
talk it out, right?

48
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,840
Because between two people,

49
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,720
it's all about

50
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,600
whether it's about feeling a spark,

51
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,840
or fate,

52
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,640
or just getting along,

53
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,320
it all needs many factors

54
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,360
to come together.

55
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,680
That's how you end up together.

56
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,280
But I didn't expect

57
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,160
that walking the dog

58
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,280
this invitation for him

59
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,320
was already

60
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,400
such a big pressure.

61
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,040
But I think the way it is now

62
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,040
is pretty good too.

63
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,360
Yeah, because it's all

64
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,360
solving problems face to face.

65
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,560
Because my personality is also

66
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,120
to solve things face to face.

67
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,760
I think this way,

68
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,120
everyone about this matter

69
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,400
might all have

70
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,480
a more complete mindset

71
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,160
to accept the outcome.

72
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,200
I think all outcomes

73
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,280
are pretty good.

74
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,240
At this moment,

75
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,840
the talk is over.

76
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,400
Wang Jue is making her braised snacks.

77
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,760
Making braised chicken feet, yeah.

78
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,880
Your ability to adjust your mood

79
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,080
is really strong.

80
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,840
Because that night, I didn't notice at all

81
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,840
anything, right?

82
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,000
Then I got tired from walking the dog.

83
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,160
I went back and devoured Wang Jue's chicken feet.

84
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,840
Ate all of them.

85
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,720
Jin Yuxing and I devoured them happily.

86
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,080
Yeah, her braised snacks are really delicious.

87
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,800
And I know at that time,

88
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,240
Wang Jue made those chicken feet

89
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,200
because she knew

90
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,760
maybe for cultural reasons,

91
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,080
Ruilong might not be

92
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,560
very into eating chicken feet.

93
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,360
So she specially made lots of chicken wings.

94
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:52,640
Wing tips.

95
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,520
Yeah, wing tips.

96
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,400
But at that time,

97
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:54,800
I had no idea

98
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,040
she made them for Ruilong.

99
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,360
I just ate them happily.

100
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:56,800
Me too.

101
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,160
We both ate here, really.

102
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,120
Sorry.

103
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,200
She really made them so tasty.

104
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,920
Really, so delicious.

105
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,000
I thought we wouldn't have to work overtime on Friday.

106
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,480
Did he go play alone?

107
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,320
He went to his room.

108
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,680
Thank you.

109
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,080
I didn't expect that in just one night

110
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,520
you'd go through two emotional ups and downs.

111
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,440
Honestly, at that moment, for

112
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,760
those of us inside the house,

113
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,840
Ruilong leaving was really quite sad.

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,400
Even after we leave the house,

115
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,000
we can still meet up,

116
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,800
we can still stay in touch.

117
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,240
But in that moment, it felt like

118
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,200
from now on, there wouldn't be

119
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,400
the feeling of him being around.

120
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,200
It's still pretty heartbreaking.

121
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,320
I don't want to watch "Watching Signal of the Heart with You" anymore.

122
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,320
Just yesterday, I was still with Ruilong,

123
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,240
having dinner together.

124
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,720
Watching this again feels so hard.

125
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,600
Mainly because

126
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,720
we were in a state of

127
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,520
waiting for him to come home,

128
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,520
that kind of mindset.

129
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,480
But what we got instead was

130
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,640
the result of him leaving.

131
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,920
It's a really dramatic reversal,

132
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,200
such a sudden change.

133
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,840
It was honestly a huge shock.

134
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,520
Even though we all knew the house was ending soon,

135
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,240
right?

136
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,680
We didn't expect it would be

137
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,760
Ruilong leaving first

138
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,640
that told us

139
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,040
the house was almost over.

140
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,840
I'm thinking

141
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,800
why

142
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,880
those who are so brave

143
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,280
end up not getting

144
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,560
a good result

145
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,160
But actually, this is just

146
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,880
a short-term outcome

147
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,640
But I think life

148
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,520
is like having many summers ahead

149
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,560
We will gain

150
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,120
different kinds of

151
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,760
big and small results

152
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,920
I think being brave

153
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,160
is more important

154
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,320
I think when Ruilong

155
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,600
chose to leave the house near the end

156
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,960
it was his own decision

157
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,880
because he felt

158
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,520
it was the most comfortable choice for him at that moment

159
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,160
Xiaoyuan said

160
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,400
Why don't brave people get answers?

161
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,280
Actually, I think

162
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,640
brave people

163
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,640
do care about the answer

164
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,160
but they definitely enjoy the process too

165
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,320
The key is still in the process

166
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,640
You overcome your inner fears

167
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,840
overcome what you think

168
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,080
you can't do

169
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,400
and you'll find

170
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,640
that maybe you can do it after all

171
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,840
discover many different sides of yourself

172
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,160
In the end, you realize the result

173
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,080
might only be sixty points

174
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,920
or even just twenty

175
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,440
but it's really not that important

176
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,280
So I think it's not important

177
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,080
Brave people

178
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,400
will keep being brave

179
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,120
I also think

180
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,280
it's like a warrior

181
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,400
He doesn't

182
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,680
defeat the dragon the first time he picks up the sword

183
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,320
just by picking up the sword

184
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,360
He must have gone through many

185
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,720
big and small

186
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,720
battles

187
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,880
and struggles

188
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,360
before he can finally defeat the dragon

189
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,560
and achieve something like that

190
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,520
I think the process

191
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,920
is actually more important

192
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,440
Keep watching

193
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,400
I'll take you with me.

194
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,440
What are you looking at?

195
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,240
We're both doing well right now.

196
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,640
Good, that's great.

197
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,520
Take it easy.

198
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,080
What?

199
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,040
Changed your mind already, huh?

200
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,320
I just had a little bit.

201
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,360
Just watching.

202
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,040
But this outfit really suits the occasion.

203
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,800
For afternoon tea.

204
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,400
But I can't get any good photos.

205
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,600
You're way too funny.

206
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,360
"Speeding away at light speed"

207
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,320
What's that?

208
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,360
Seriously, stop.

209
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,920
Jin Yuxing

210
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,560
I really can't take it.

211
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,280
It's just so boring, and then...

212
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,680
So I started...

213
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,600
I'm laughing so hard I'm crying.

214
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,640
I thought no one would pay attention to me.

215
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,520
I'm just...

216
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,320
Ba Duan Jin, right?

217
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,960
Yeah, I'm practicing Ba Duan Jin.

218
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,880
So funny.

219
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,320
Really funny.

220
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,000
That's so abstract.

221
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
As expected, they said...

222
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,800
You're our "abstract representative" here.

223
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,040
What kind of building blocks are these?

224
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,680
It's that one...

225
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,360
The building block flower Chichi gave me.

226
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,960
Building block flower.

227
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,840
What was yesterday?

228
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,840
What did you do yesterday?

229
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,760
Yesterday was (the park).

230
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,600
I'm not really sure about yesterday.

231
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,080
Time.

232
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,520
I don't know.

233
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,280
Pretty fast.

234
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,160
Can it go even faster?

235
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,120
You want to fast-forward it, right?

236
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,840
How long did it take you to put this together?

237
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,320
It was pretty quick.

238
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,920
It was actually quite simple, yeah.

239
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,240
Our teamwork was spot on.

240
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,160
What I didn't expect was

241
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,440
in places we couldn't see,

242
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,600
someone was still pretty proactive.

243
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:33,840
Not bad.

244
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,320
Still pretty proactive, right?

245
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,560
I feel like coming here this time,

246
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,600
into this environment,

247
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,320
seeing how everyone interacts,

248
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,200
compared to ourselves

249
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,360
and our feelings in the house,

250
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,360
the difference is actually quite big.

251
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,240
I think, actually,

252
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,560
I want to ask what you all think—

253
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,040
like,

254
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,160
after seeing everything so far,

255
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,480
about yourself or your friends in the house,

256
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,120
do you have any new feelings

257
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,160
or maybe

258
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,560
any changes in your understanding?

259
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,680
I think

260
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,880
I feel like my understanding of you

261
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,880
has grown a bit

262
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,040
I feel that you

263
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,560
are really good at managing your emotions

264
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,520
You are naturally

265
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,600
a very empathetic person

266
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,480
But your ability to adjust your mood

267
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,400
is also very quick

268
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,280
So I think

269
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,360
that's really great

270
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,680
I'm a very adaptable person

271
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:16,960
I think my core

272
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,280
is quite strong

273
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,280
Maybe in the house

274
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,440
I only saw things from my own perspective

275
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,840
when it came to people's actions in the house

276
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,280
which was very one-sided

277
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,440
and influenced by my own bias

278
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,080
and assumptions

279
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,640
Now I can see more fully

280
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,280
why each person acted the way they did

281
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,080
what motivated them

282
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,280
and their different thoughts and feelings

283
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,080
So I can empathize with them more

284
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,800
about why they did that

285
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,160
at that moment

286
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:45,720
Actually, I think

287
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,480
Xiaoyuan is a really lovely person

288
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,800
And not

289
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,280
someone with an overly quirky personality

290
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,240
She’s more mature than her age

291
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,520
with a sense of steadiness

292
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
But often

293
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,720
in interactions

294
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,360
your instinctive reactions

295
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,360
and the way you speak

296
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,200
are all very cute

297
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,200
It just feels

298
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,920
like you’re still a little girl

299
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,680
If you really like

300
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,680
sunflowers

301
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,800
I think

302
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,480
right now you’re like

303
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,280
a sunflower facing the sun

304
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,440
but not yet

305
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,240
a fully grown sunflower

306
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,960
But I believe

307
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,720
you’ll definitely become

308
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,480
a beautiful, fully mature sunflower

309
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,160
Okay

310
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,200
Honestly, it’s still the same

311
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,120
I just think

312
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,280
you don’t have to be so strong

313
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,400
We cried a lot today

314
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,560
We weren’t that strong today

315
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,200
I cried a lot today too

316
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,440
Me too, I cried a lot

317
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,720
But I think that’s good

318
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,480
It’s very real

319
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,560
Everyone is pretty genuine

320
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,320
and sincere

321
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,720
I think that’s great

322
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,520
If we had the chance

323
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,680
to choose again

324
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,320
do you think

325
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,280
you’d still choose to come to the house?

326
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,120
Yes

327
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,200
Yes

328
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,320
Why?

329
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,560
Because I like you all

330
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,720
I like you too

331
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,720
You’re so annoying

332
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,280
That was a quick confession

333
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,480
What about Yuxing?

334
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,160
I’d also choose to come to the house again

335
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,360
I’ll remember

336
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,200
this summer in the house

337
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,760
and everything we went through together

338
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,760
This experience will impact my whole life

339
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,760
in some way

340
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,200
Yes

341
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,560
That’s nice

342
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,400
Honestly, I think it’s all good

343
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,920
It’s just that when we look back

344
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,960
on this story

345
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,600
we might still get drawn into

346
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,880
the emotions from the house

347
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,400
But I still want to emphasize

348
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,560
emphasize again

349
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,560
Yesterday, we happily

350
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,520
had dinner together

351
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,080
And we also happily

352
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,640
continued our friendship

353
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,880
outside the house

354
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,600
Yes, that’s right

355
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,840
It’ll be even more exciting

356
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,880
The stories outside

357
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,760
Keep watching

358
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,720
Were you surprised by this?

359
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,400
My smile reached all the way to my ears.

360
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,520
Actually, at this moment,

361
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,080
he can't focus on the book anymore.

362
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,320
He's just using the book as a prop.

363
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,840
I want to explain something.

364
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,560
Let me clarify.

365
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,640
Because earlier I mentioned

366
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,800
about my dad.

367
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Since I was little, he never really

368
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,640
paid much attention to what I said.

369
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,000
What I mean is

370
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,040
my father's love for me

371
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,360
doesn't show in these small details.

372
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,560
It's not reflected in little things.

373
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,840
His love for me

374
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,760
is more like

375
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,320
hoping to inspire and push me.

376
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,360
He wants me to be braver,

377
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,600
more

378
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,480
capable.

379
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,800
He wants me to face the world.

380
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,880
So his love for me

381
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,480
isn't shown

382
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,800
in tiny, detailed ways.

383
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,880
He expresses it in a passionate,

384
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,480
grand way.

385
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,680
That's how he shows it to me.

386
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,480
I get it. Father's love is as deep as a mountain.

387
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,280
It's the way Asian fathers

388
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,320
express their love.

389
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,960
Why am I always the one ordering food every day?

390
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,440
Actually, a lot of the details

391
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,520
are really quite sweet.

392
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,760
Whether it's "Ten Years"

393
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,520
or the steamed bass,

394
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:24,960
or even

395
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,480
the shredded chicken,

396
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,480
so that's how it happened.

397
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,800
We must be among the first to know.

398
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,360
Can't stand to see even a bit of it.

399
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:05,920
Alright.

400
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,200
It's not that bad.

401
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,080
Happy.

402
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,200
Well done.

403
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,040
Stick to your abstract ideas to the end.

404
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,760
At that time, I was with Dr. Fang

405
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,680
playing badminton upstairs.

406
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,600
We were taking photos downstairs.

407
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,360
But this kind of

408
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,440
activity is really

409
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,800
exciting.

410
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,880
We just went for it.

411
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,440
When you lit up the signal,

412
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,280
how did you feel?

413
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,240
I was really curious at that moment.

414
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,400
Like,

415
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,480
I didn't expect it.

416
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,480
I truly didn't expect it.

417
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,960
Because Le Chen said to me

418
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,280
"How about we go for a walk?"

419
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,800
While we were walking, he suddenly

420
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,520
pulled me over to light up the signal.

421
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,680
And at that moment,

422
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,560
my first thought was,

423
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,800
I'm wearing flat shoes.

424
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,280
It really didn't feel ceremonial.

425
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:52,800
But that dress

426
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,360
was actually quite ceremonial.

427
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,240
Yeah, that dress

428
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,160
needs to go with

429
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,280
a pair of beautiful shoes.

430
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,400
I think the fireworks in the sky

431
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,040
plus the dress already looked amazing.

432
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,800
But honestly, it was a huge surprise.

433
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,840
Because Le Chen really remembered

434
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,800
everything I said.

435
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,400
And I mentioned

436
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,040
that I wanted to go

437
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,840
somewhere without rain.

438
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,320
Because I'm someone

439
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,520
who really loves sunny days.

440
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,720
Sometimes there are worries,

441
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,560
but the response at that time

442
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,680
was super quick.

443
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,360
He just said, "Let's go."

444
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,520
And I was really surprised too.

445
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,680
You could tell that moment

446
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,080
was very important to you.

447
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,880
So important that I had to wear

448
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,640
beautiful high heels.

449
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,840
Yeah, but that dress

450
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,520
was already sparkling.

451
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,160
I cried so ugly.

452
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,920
Let me reserve some napkins first.

453
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:00,760
Thank you.

454
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,440
So cute, Jue.

455
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,480
I'll save it for you first.

456
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Busy again.

457
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:58,840
I'm holding back.

458
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,640
I'm holding back too.

459
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,800
I really got goosebumps.

460
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,120
I really love this line.

461
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,760
Why am I crying again?

462
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,600
I feel like

463
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,920
I'm completely immersed in

464
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,000
the world of pairing blind boxes.

465
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,520
biting my hand

466
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,280
I wish I could give my past self a wake-up call.

467
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,720
I thought about it for a long, long time.

468
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,560
So what were you thinking back then?

469
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,160
I don't know how to describe it.

470
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,640
How I felt at that moment.

471
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,680
I could understand Duoduo's sadness.

472
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,120
All the grievances she felt, or whatever it was.

473
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,800
She really did a lot for me.

474
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,120
Since the cabin, she's always been like

475
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,840
a caring older sister to me.

476
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,000
Taking care of me.

477
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,480
Even though she had a lot of

478
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,520
sad things going on herself.

479
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,600
It's just our positions.

480
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,720
She couldn't talk to me about it.

481
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,160
But she was still especially kind to me.

482
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,440
So I kept hesitating at that time.

483
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,200
I said,

484
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,040
With my current situation,

485
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,880
I

486
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,080
could I explain all these things

487
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,600
clearly to her?

488
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,880
That's what I was thinking about.

489
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,560
You started writing a diary back then.

490
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,480
It's my first time on "Watching Signal of the Heart with You".

491
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,280
It was pretty intense for me.

492
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,240
I laughed and cried.

493
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,040
My emotions kept going up and down.

494
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,200
Slowly.

495
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,160
After watching it,

496
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,280
I realized the house isn't just about

497
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,160
romantic feelings between couples.

498
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,880
There's even more in the house—

499
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,840
the twelve of us

500
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,200
all formed great friendships.

501
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,360
After this experience,

502
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,840
I feel, for myself,

503
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,560
I've grown a bit.

504
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,520
But if I went back to the house again,

505
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:18,640
I think I

506
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,160
would still make the same choices.

507
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,280
This is the same kind of

508
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,400
capsule toy machine as Dr. Fang's.

509
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,360
Now it's time for

510
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,200
our giveaway moment.

511
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,760
We can write some little wishes by hand

512
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,000
and put them inside.

513
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,800
Let's see which lucky friend

514
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,800
will draw what we've written.

515
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,800
I wrote,

516
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,520
Come to Hangzhou or Beijing,

517
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,960
and I'll treat you to whatever you want to eat.

518
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,080
I'll treat you to a meal.

519
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,840
Any restaurant in Hangzhou or Shanghai.

520
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,480
Come to Yiwu,

521
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,640
and I'll treat you to a local Yiwu restaurant.

522
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,040
I'll treat you to a local Yiwu restaurant.

523
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,480
So our capsule toy machine

524
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,520
is ready to go.

525
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,240
Let's take a photo together to end.

526
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,760
Watching "Signal of the Heart" with you.

527
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,160
The heart's signal never ends.

528
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,360
See you next time.
