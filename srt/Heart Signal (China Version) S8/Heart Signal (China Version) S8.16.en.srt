1
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,120
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:26,880
Ding dong.

3
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,600
Welcome to "Watching Heartbeats with You."

4
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,600
Today we have a

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,160
secret little mission.

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,640
"Love's Perspective."

7
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,040
During this episode of "Watching Heartbeats with You,"

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,240
the girls need to

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,040
without their partners noticing,

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,920
follow the task cards given by the production team

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,080
and complete the assigned actions.

12
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,000
The first girl to complete the assigned action

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,800
must make a "V" sign to the production team

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,200
for the task to be considered complete.

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:47,840
Okay.

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,360
Alright, thank you.

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,760
Call out Zeng Zhaohao's full name three times.

18
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,280
That's too easy for me.

19
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,160
I'm sure to win.

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,760
Pat Zhao Qijun's head three times.

21
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,960
I think it's fine.

22
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,960
Have Tomo (Zhang Hao) feed you fruit five times.

23
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,560
How difficult do you think this is?

24
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:03,720
Just a little.

25
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,200
It's only one or two levels of difficulty.

26
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,000
I want to be the first to finish the task.

27
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,520
Welcome to my home in Hunan.

28
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,640
Today,

29
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,520
just imagine,

30
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,920
which guests will be here today.

31
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,520
I'll call him and see if he shows up.

32
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,040
Alright.

33
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:29,440
Alright.

34
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,920
Tomo (Zhang Hao) and Qiqi (Wang Qi).

35
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,400
It's showtime.

36
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,760
Here they come.

37
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,040
Welcome.

38
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,560
Hello.

39
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,120
Hello.

40
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,960
Let's enjoy the wine and live in the moment.

41
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,760
Even Abi Maotai says "yes, yes, yes."

42
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,560
Yes, yes, yes.

43
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,800
Yes, yes, yes.

44
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,000
How have you been lately?

45
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,920
Pretty good, not bad.

46
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,160
So handsome, really handsome.

47
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,920
Hello.

48
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,440
You all are handsome and beautiful too.

49
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,560
You're beautiful.

50
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,680
Wishing you happiness.

51
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,800
Wishing you happiness too.

52
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,800
Let's hold hands as well.

53
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,400
Yes.

54
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,360
Alright, there are two more guests coming up.

55
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,160
Let's welcome the "Qiwen" duo.

56
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,480
Hello, everyone.

57
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,920
So handsome.

58
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,600
So beautiful, so handsome.

59
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,960
Long time no see.

60
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,320
Long time no see.

61
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,160
Hello, nice to meet you for the first time.

62
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,560
Hello, everyone.

63
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,560
Hello, everyone.

64
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:22,960
So handsome.

65
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,680
Tomo (Zhang Hao), Qiqi (Wang Qi)

66
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,160
Right?

67
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,640
Yes.

68
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,160
Finally meeting in person.

69
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,840
Welcome, everyone, to

70
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,440
"Good Luck Appointment"

71
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,280
Hello, everyone, we are

72
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,680
the "Jin Zhao" group.

73
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:38,880
Oops, I forgot to mention "Signal of the Heart" Season 6.

74
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,120
Oops, I forgot to mention "Signal of the Heart" Season 6.

75
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,320
Oops, I forgot to mention "Signal of the Heart" Season 6.

76
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,600
Okay, three, two, one.

77
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,360
Hello, everyone.

78
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,880
We are from "Signal of the Heart" Season 6.

79
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,320
the "Jin Zhao" group.

80
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,240
I'm Good Luck (Zhang Jin).

81
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,160
I'm Zeng Zhaohao.

82
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:51,720
Hello, everyone.

83
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,840
I'm from "Signal of the Heart"

84
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,880
Season 7, Tomo (Zhang Hao).

85
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,400
Hello, everyone.

86
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,200
I'm from "Signal of the Heart" Season 7,

87
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:55,960
Qiqi (Wang Qi).

88
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,120
That's great.

89
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,600
Today, I "climbed out" from Tomo (Zhang Hao)'s watch

90
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,600
"climbed out."

91
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,400
Why?

92
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,400
She wasn't here last episode.

93
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,280
So I put her

94
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,160
in my watch.

95
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,160
Right here.

96
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,480
Hello, everyone.

97
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,160
I am from "Signal of the Heart,"

98
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,720
Season 2 guest Zhao Qijun.

99
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,200
Hello, everyone.

100
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:12,760
I am from "Signal of the Heart,"

101
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,520
Season 2 guest Yang Kaiwen.

102
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:17,880
Alright.

103
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,400
I'm very happy to be here with everyone

104
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,800
and to meet together again.

105
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,240
We, with Qiqi (Wang Qi)

106
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,720
and Tomo (Zhang Hao),

107
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,600
are meeting for the first time.

108
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,240
With Zhao Qijun and Yang Kaiwen,

109
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:25,640
we have already

110
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,120
met for the second time.

111
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,680
Second time meeting.

112
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,480
Yes, second time.

113
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:27,720
Second time.

114
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,960
Is this your second time meeting?

115
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,280
It's our second meeting in these two days.

116
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,400
Before this, we still

117
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,040
hung out together once or twice.

118
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,080
Previously, we together

119
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,960
participated in your season of "Watching Heartbeat with You."

120
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,240
Yes.

121
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,120
We participated in your

122
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,040
season of "Watching Heartbeat with You."

123
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,200
Yes, still in the little house.

124
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,800
We found a lot of your clues.

125
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,040
Are you still in a long-distance relationship?

126
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,240
Yes.

127
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,320
Because I work in Hong Kong, China,

128
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,280
and she is in the mainland.

129
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,040
So how often do you two meet up?

130
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,080
What is it roughly like?

131
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,080
I go over there.

132
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,360
We meet up every few days.

133
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,280
We meet up every day.

134
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,160
Once a week.

135
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,360
Each time lasts four days.

136
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,760
Once a week.

137
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,320
Once a week.

138
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:06,880
That's right.

139
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,320
What about you guys? What do you do?

140
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,160
If you really miss each other,

141
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,120
They just turn over and see each other.

142
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,920
It's fine.

143
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,840
They're not that far apart.

144
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,080
That's right.

145
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,720
When she misses me,

146
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,320
She just walks out of the bedroom.

147
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,800
It seems like recently,

148
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,040
Something good happened, right?

149
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,640
That's right.

150
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,920
You had a drink in Paris—

151
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,360
Your first coffee ever.

152
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,320
I even raised my hand.

153
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:27,800
Let me see.

154
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:27,840
Let me see.

155
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,720
Show them.

156
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,000
What is that light?

157
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,280
What is this?

158
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,880
How did you feel at that moment?

159
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,280
When I turned around, I didn't know what he was going to do.

160
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,640
I didn't expect it to be a proposal.

161
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,440
Because I could tell she really wasn't prepared.

162
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,360
At that moment, after she turned around,

163
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,120
I was already down on one knee.

164
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,880
The first thing she said was,

165
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,640
"What are you doing?"

166
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,640
The second thing she said was,

167
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,480
"Get up."

168
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,040
I didn't know what to do either.

169
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,160
I was really flustered.

170
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,800
Anyway, I had prepared

171
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,960
for a really long time.

172
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,480
I prepared for three months.

173
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,520
I imagined it so many times.

174
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,920
The proposal scene.

175
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,480
But at the moment I had to kneel down,

176
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,480
my legs really did go weak.

177
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:00,560
My legs really did go weak.

178
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,640
Both knees were on the ground.

179
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,520
Not really.

180
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,800
Let me ask you something.

181
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,000
Go ahead.

182
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,120
Did your legs go weak when you knelt down?

183
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,600
No, they didn't. I was just really nervous, you know?

184
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,200
Because I thought

185
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,520
there was a one-in-a-thousand chance

186
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,040
that Yang Kaiwen might reject me.

187
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,840
That's what he said too.

188
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,160
Really?

189
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,360
I felt the same way at the time.

190
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,840
Actually, at that moment, guys

191
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,440
do feel nervous inside.

192
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,080
Listen up.

193
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,280
Listen for a second.

194
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,800
I'm listening.

195
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,240
Yes, because you care about her too much.

196
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,120
Yes, because you care about her too much.

197
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,720
You will

198
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,880
magnify your own shortcomings.

199
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,360
You'll start to wonder

200
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:28,960
if she will notice

201
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,680
this flaw of mine.

202
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,080
Right.

203
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,840
What he said to me at the time

204
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,720
the first thing he said was

205
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,280
"I'm sorry."

206
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,800
"I forgot everything I prepared to say."

207
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,520
Do you know why?

208
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,560
It's because in his heart,

209
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,360
you've filled him up completely.

210
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,360
His mind just couldn't function.

211
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:41,920
His mind just couldn't function.

212
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,920
That's so sweet.

213
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:45,920
Alright, enough talk.

214
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,880
Let's watch this season's

215
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,160
wonderful show.

216
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,400
What's the "insomnia zone"?

217
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:52,520
What's the "insomnia zone"?

218
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,720
"Good sleep zone."

219
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,480
"Good sleep zone."

220
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,480
"Insomnia zone."

221
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,080
What's this?

222
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:04,880
Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng)

223
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,040
Jiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng)

224
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,560
I'm shipping them.

225
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,680
That's very thoughtful.

226
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,360
It's raining.

227
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,840
What's a little rain?

228
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:30,720
Right?

229
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,480
So cute.

230
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,560
At that time, I also wanted a puppy.

231
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,040
Someone's back again.

232
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,040
Duoduo (Ke Ailin)

233
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:48,800
Left some food.

234
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,880
That's really considerate.

235
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,600
Just having a sandwich.

236
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,280
Don't tell me you have to make it again.

237
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,080
Here's your chance.

238
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,760
So Wang Lechen is helping.

239
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,120
Duoduo is heating up the food.

240
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,560
That's right.

241
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:12,880
Pretty good.

242
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,880
There's hope.

243
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,240
It feels like the kitchen really is

244
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,680
a place where feelings easily grow.

245
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,080
Yeah.

246
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,440
A lot always happens in the kitchen.

247
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,400
Do you usually at home

248
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,680
cook any dishes?

249
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,880
We usually order takeout.

250
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,160
Order takeout.

251
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,440
I cook often.

252
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,000
Look at my outfit, it's specially

253
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,120
designed for cooking.

254
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,200
This is our family's

255
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,600
very beautiful little chef.

256
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,880
Yes, Lu Yuan is here.

257
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,720
Helping Duoduo (Ke Ailin) cook.

258
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,560
Tomorrow will bring

259
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,160
the first date at Heartbeat Apartment.

260
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,680
First date.

261
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,160
This activity is so exciting.

262
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,520
Look at how Rui Long is smiling.

263
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,440
So actually, it needs to

264
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,680
analyze the date card.

265
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,520
This card might be

266
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,160
written by one of the girls.

267
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,680
It's possible.

268
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,400
That's kind of the idea.

269
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,880
Just look at her handwriting.

270
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,760
The emotions it reveals.

271
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So fast.

272
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,160
He didn't even finish reading it and

273
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,480
left before finishing.

274
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,240
So quick.

275
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,480
He's in a hurry.

276
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,440
That's intense.

277
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,480
So handsome.

278
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,320
Handsome.

279
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,160
So anxious.

280
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,120
He himself.

281
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,840
That's fine.

282
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,400
He's even smiling.

283
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,000
Applause.

284
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,480
Handsome.

285
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,120
It's raining, running in the rain.

286
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,240
Chasing love in the rain.

287
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,680
It's a bit like watching an idol drama.

288
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,200
So Dr. Fang (Fang Yijiong),

289
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,800
who is the person you like?

290
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,880
I know who it is.

291
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,880
Lanlan (Xu Rulan).

292
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,760
Not using an umbrella.

293
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,880
He definitely has someone

294
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,120
he really wants to date now.

295
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,360
His goal is very clear.

296
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,240
So there's no need to hesitate.

297
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,000
Just go for it.

298
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,040
And he might know

299
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,440
there will be competition, so he

300
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:51,880
Right.

301
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,360
Hurry up.

302
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:52,720
Right.

303
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,760
That means he knows exactly what's going on.

304
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,280
Right.

305
00:08:59,360 --> 00:08:59,960
Let Tomo (Zhang Hao)

306
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,680
feed himself fruit five times.

307
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,320
Dr. Fang (Fang Yijiong) has arrived.

308
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,160
Still haven't chosen.

309
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,880
Five guys, six gifts.

310
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,880
Does that mean one girl will be left out?

311
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,480
Or will one guy

312
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,640
go on two dates?

313
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,800
Table tennis kitten card.

314
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,320
Light yellow gift box.

315
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,120
What's the idea behind the table tennis thing?

316
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,360
Table tennis isn't that.

317
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,280
Chichi (Sun Hanqing).

318
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:31,760
Is it Lanlan (Xu Rulan)?

319
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,920
Bernese Mountain Dog puppy card

320
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,080
Which two girls

321
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,160
talked about the Bernese Mountain Dog?

322
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,240
Chichi (Sun Hanqing) asked about it.

323
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,480
She asked Jin Yuxing once while going down the stairs.

324
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,000
Who else?

325
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,560
The one who asked at the dining table should be

326
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,240
Wang Yifan, right?

327
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,040
Relax a bit.

328
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,720
Boxing.

329
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,840
Boxing.

330
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,160
I know who the boxing one is.

331
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:57,880
Who is the boxing one?

332
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,080
Chichi (Sun Hanqing).

333
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,520
Watching the sunset.

334
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,720
He can guess it.

335
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,320
You can tell who this is at a glance, right?

336
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,400
Right.

337
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,680
The sunset card is

338
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,520
The one who draws so well.

339
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,160
All drawn by them.

340
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,600
Reading by the sea.

341
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,880
Watching the sunrise.

342
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,680
There's a book below.

343
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,760
Wang Jue.

344
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:19,680
Wang Jue?

345
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,040
Why?

346
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,080
Watching the sunrise by the sea is Wang Jue.

347
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,120
There's no one else.

348
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,520
Can he choose correctly?

349
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,680
He's really anxious.

350
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,400
Dr. Fang (Fang Yijiong) is very determined.

351
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:30,920
That's a good thing.

352
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,760
I didn't even see him choose that drawing.

353
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,280
What does it look like?

354
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,200
There is already something between them.

355
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,160
Do they already have secret signals with each other?

356
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,120
It's about him and the girl he likes.

357
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,000
Why?

358
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,240
I don't know.

359
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,240
Dr. Fang is very determined.

360
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,280
Anyway, we just trust Dr. Fang.

361
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,200
Whatever Dr. Fang chooses,

362
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,040
we'll go with it.

363
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,080
Jiao Zhiheng's expression

364
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,560
is a bit too nervous.

365
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,640
It's a bit subtle.

366
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:02,880
He...

367
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,280
So are the two of them rivals?

368
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:04,880
He might also

369
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,880
just be simply curious.

370
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,960
She handed it directly to him.

371
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,840
I think this card

372
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,160
no matter which girl drew it,

373
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,400
her intention is actually

374
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:17,960
her intention is actually

375
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
to care more about this boy.

376
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,520
Because she drew

377
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,440
the boy's puppy

378
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,680
and not her own puppy.

379
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,400
This girl probably knows boxing.

380
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:35,840
Duo Duo (Ke Ailin)

381
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,760
She can box.

382
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,000
There might be several girls

383
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,640
who know boxing.

384
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,480
See, there really are two people

385
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,080
who can box.

386
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,440
There's fire in their hearts.

387
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,000
Hotpot, boxing.

388
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,160
It's all very passionate.

389
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,400
It's just like Duo Duo's personality.

390
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,080
She's very outgoing.

391
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,000
It's Lu Yuan.

392
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,400
Lu Yuan.

393
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,400
I also guess it's Lu Yuan.

394
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,240
But I think Jin Yuxing

395
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,240
didn't take that painting right away

396
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,840
which means he didn't choose Lu Yuan

397
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,240
Right

398
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,880
He might also be unsure

399
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,600
Did they really hesitate for that long?

400
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,040
Yeah, they really thought about it for a long time

401
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,440
And also very

402
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,160
Yeah

403
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,480
They thought about every detail

404
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,560
Because they were afraid of making the wrong choice

405
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,400
After all, it means

406
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,120
it's the first date

407
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,240
A date, yeah

408
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,080
He picked Lu Yuan's (card)

409
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,480
Right, because in the last episode

410
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,960
he had some

411
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,760
signals with Lu Yuan, right?

412
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,640
Could it have been a coincidence?

413
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,000
He took the follow card

414
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,480
They went on two dates

415
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,680
Yeah

416
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,600
Did the girl also have two dates?

417
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,080
It's the guys who have to go on two dates

418
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:55,760
Billiards

419
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,440
Billiards

420
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,360
Billiards kitten

421
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,600
He's smiling so happily

422
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,040
Love at first sight

423
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,880
Look, he wants to grab it back quickly

424
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,560
Tonight

425
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,080
he'll have to sleep with this card under his pillow

426
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,640
I think so too

427
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:28,800
Okay.

428
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,680
Now that we've reached this point,

429
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,240
let's play a

430
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,120
card drawing game.

431
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,640
This game

432
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,040
is called "Love Sticker Fun."

433
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,560
Each girl will put up a card

434
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,040
representing a special memory between you two.

435
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,200
You have three minutes.

436
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,360
The boys need to wait blindfolded on the side.

437
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,840
In the end, guess which card

438
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,720
is the one made by your pair.

439
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,720
Boys, this will test

440
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,960
how well you know each other.

441
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,720
Come on.

442
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,200
Start drawing.

443
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,920
Honey, can you go get it?

444
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,240
Go ahead.

445
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,160
Then I have to cover my eyes now.

446
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,880
Right, I'm covering mine too.

447
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,040
Okay, got it.

448
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,120
Pick a blindfold.

449
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,880
Blue one.

450
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,320
The blue one is for Tomo.

451
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,160
Then pure me will take the white one.

452
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,120
It's fine, I like this yellow one.

453
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:06,600
Alright.

454
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,840
Okay.

455
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,880
Move back a bit.

456
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:11,920
Yes.

457
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,640
Honey, I'm afraid of the dark.

458
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,160
Can you not let go of my hand?

459
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,800
Can you not let go of my hand?

460
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,760
This...

461
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,800
These stickers are really interesting.

462
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,440
So cute.

463
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,840
So what are the three of us supposed to do?

464
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,000
Jun Jun, are you still there?

465
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,720
Tomo, are you still there?

466
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm still here.

467
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,680
Jun Jun is gone.

468
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,760
Where is Jun Jun?

469
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,080
It's covering the eyes.

470
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,200
Not covering the ears.

471
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,600
I thought I wasn't allowed to answer you.

472
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Sorry.

473
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,360
Do I even need to look?

474
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,840
I can tell the drawing just by the sound.

475
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,960
This is so interesting.

476
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,200
The drawing is amazing.

477
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,280
Look at how the colors are used.

478
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,640
It's so classic.

479
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,320
Baby, your drawing is really beautiful.

480
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,880
From afar, it's "Picasso".

481
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,240
Up close, it's "Monet".

482
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,960
Xiaobo, your drawing is fantastic.

483
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,520
Yang Kaiwen really is a professional.

484
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,000
The drawing is really good.

485
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,560
Qiqi, you're really creative.

486
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,320
The use of color here is so professional.

487
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,440
So skillful.

488
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,400
Zhang Jin drew an Eiffel Tower.

489
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,280
Yang Kaiwen drew a little tiger.

490
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,200
He's so scary.

491
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,680
He said I drew a little tiger.

492
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,440
He guessed them all right.

493
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,320
That's really impressive.

494
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,960
I asked Tomo (Zhang Hao) to guess.

495
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,200
Tomo (Zhang Hao),

496
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,760
Don't fall asleep.

497
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,320
How should I guess?

498
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,680
Try to guess what I drew.

499
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,560
Camera.

500
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,080
Boat.

501
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,600
Surfboard.

502
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,480
Sushi.

503
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,560
Hamburger.

504
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,680
So Tomo (Zhang Hao) likes to

505
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,200
eat hamburgers while surfing

506
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,640
and take photos of others.

507
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,680
That works.

508
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,480
Impressive.

509
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,800
I can see what they drew.

510
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,280
Wait, I want to ask something.

511
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,600
If I guess all three right,

512
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,040
can I get a prize?

513
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,440
What prize do you want?

514
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,920
I want Xiao Hong (flower).

515
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,560
What's wrong?

516
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,760
Let me touch it.

517
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,920
Baby, you can definitely guess it.

518
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,680
My baby.

519
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,080
Fell asleep.

520
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,840
No rush, little one.

521
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,640
Take your time drawing.

522
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,000
Draw your best.

523
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,640
Zeng Zhaohao, can you stop rushing me?

524
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,400
I said don't rush.

525
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,280
I'm almost done.

526
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:28,920
Me too.

527
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,600
I can finish as well.

528
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,800
Put everything together.

529
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,160
That's a bit difficult.

530
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,920
This game is really hard.

531
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,120
Jun Jun, do you have confidence?

532
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,080
I don't.

533
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,000
How about you, Tomo?

534
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,560
I don't know.

535
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,440
Can we take off the blindfolds now?

536
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,600
Can we open them now?

537
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,480
Alright, you can.

538
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,240
Take off your blindfolds.

539
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,200
I'll help you, Jun Jun.

540
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,720
I'll help you.

541
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,120
Three, two, one.

542
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,880
You guys can start choosing.

543
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,760
Choose carefully.

544
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,440
Choose what?

545
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,840
Choose which one I drew.

546
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,000
The one I drew.

547
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,360
Wait a moment.

548
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,680
This one should be...

549
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,840
Yang Kaiwen probably drew this for me.

550
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,520
She wants...

551
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,240
No, choose properly.

552
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,760
You can tell at a glance.

553
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,320
How is this not it?

554
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,200
She also wants to be under the Eiffel Tower.

555
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,160
It feels romantic, right?

556
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,120
Exactly.

557
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,440
Look again.

558
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,560
Yes, I'll look again.

559
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,880
This one is still better.

560
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,400
I'll pick this one.

561
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,440
I choose this one as my "poison."

562
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,640
Then I'll choose this one.

563
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,720
As my "antidote."

564
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,240
Did you see which one I drew?

565
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,000
Which one did I draw?

566
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,200
The one you drew.

567
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,280
Is it this one?

568
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,840
No, I think it's...

569
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,800
Wait, I think it's these two.

570
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,760
I think it's these two.

571
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,920
There's only one.

572
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,400
Right.

573
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:08,800
Baby.

574
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,920
I'm hesitating.

575
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,040
Guess which one I drew.

576
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,560
That one, the one on the right.

577
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,160
Tomo (Zhang Hao), let me say something.

578
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,240
I think a choice without any mistakes

579
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,080
is meaningless.

580
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,360
Surprises are what make it fun, right?

581
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,280
Alright, let's show it.

582
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,680
No doubt about it.

583
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,280
That was the perfect choice.

584
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,440
So impressive.

585
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,600
We're amazing.

586
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,600
He was really scared.

587
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,680
That was a distraction.

588
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,680
Tomo almost picked the wrong one at first.

589
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,480
I know.

590
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,120
Let the boys explain.

591
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,240
Why did you choose this one?

592
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,640
How did you pick it right away?

593
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,200
I'll go first.

594
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,400
No, I really did.

595
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,160
These two were actually my choices.

596
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,040
I picked this one because

597
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,480
I knew we had to pick the drawing.

598
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,200
I know.

599
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,680
It's because we were at

600
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,840
a beach in Rizhao.

601
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,200
She set off fireworks for me.

602
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,800
And this, this is

603
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,960
probably related to the sea.

604
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,160
Because there are fish.

605
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,680
And also fireworks.

606
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,640
In the end, I thought

607
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,480
this one looked better.

608
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,520
So I chose this one.

609
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,640
Okay.

610
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,200
I'm looking forward to seeing

611
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,000
a romantic fireworks display in your video.

612
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,240
Thank you.

613
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:16,920
Zhao Qijun.

614
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,000
Then this is definitely

615
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,040
one of our distractions.

616
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,080
This is something we

617
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,000
experienced before.

618
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,680
But it doesn't have Yang Kaiwen's unique touch.

619
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,400
in it.

620
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,600
But this picture,

621
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,480
because of this little girl's

622
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,240
it's really obvious.

623
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,280
Choice, right?

624
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:27,800
It's a cute

625
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,000
including the little tiger she drew.

626
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,840
It's something we

627
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,720
I casually drew before.

628
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,040
She's using it now.

629
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,520
I think you can spot it at a glance.

630
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,520
Yes.

631
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,240
In my happy life,

632
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,320
there is Junjun (Zhao Qijun).

633
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,960
This is me with a little braid.

634
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,840
The two of us are happy together.

635
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,000
This one next to me is a dog.

636
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,000
This is a mouse.

637
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,280
Anyway, it's this.

638
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,440
A creature.

639
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,320
Creature.

640
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,760
Let's sit on the swing together.

641
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,960
What about this little tiger?

642
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,400
This little tiger is

643
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,240
a picture that Junjun (Zhao Qijun) drew before.

644
00:19:59,240 --> 00:19:59,880
I think it looks great.

645
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,840
I made it into my brand logo.

646
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,200
Brand logo.

647
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,400
Then introduce yours.

648
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,000
Mine is

649
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,200
a dance studio.

650
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,520
At first, it didn't have these three on top.

651
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,680
It was all just me.

652
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,040
The two of them reminded me to include a boy.

653
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,960
Is mine okay?

654
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,320
Yours is fine.

655
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,680
This one just happens to not have it.

656
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,920
It seems like he's not there.

657
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,280
No boy.

658
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,200
This one is for you.

659
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,360
There's one here.

660
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,360
I'm not in it.

661
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,240
I said,

662
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,360
I said, shouldn't we add him in?

663
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,120
Right.

664
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,120
Although we haven't worn

665
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,240
that kind of formal wedding dress yet,

666
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,600
I think this look

667
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,320
really resembles the two of us.

668
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,400
It's a pose we can do.

669
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,040
This one is him holding a watermelon.

670
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,640
This is something the two of us often

671
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,040
do, leaning together like this.

672
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,680
Can we recreate it?

673
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,120
Okay, three, two, one.

674
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,880
What was I hesitating about at that time?

675
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,000
It was these two photos.

676
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,160
Actually, one is

677
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,400
our highlight moment.

678
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,200
The other is our daily life.

679
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,080
The highlight moment might be

680
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,480
how others see us.

681
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:12,920
But we

682
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,560
how we see ourselves

683
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,160
is actually our daily life.

684
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,800
You put it so well.

685
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,200
Xiaobao is really impressive.

686
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:20,840
I see you in a new light.

687
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,680
Thank you.

688
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,720
It's really enviable,

689
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,800
your love life.

690
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,400
Not bad.

691
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,600
Go ahead and eat.

692
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,720
Feed me.

693
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,560
Okay, here.

694
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,640
Did you guys notice

695
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,760
anything different today?

696
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,280
Guys,

697
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,920
are the girls different?

698
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,480
That's right.

699
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,840
Is it something about their appearance?

700
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,400
No.

701
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,720
I know.

702
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,960
Yang Kaiwen is too obvious.

703
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:11,600
What?

704
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,320
Is it about doing some kind of action?

705
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,040
Yes.

706
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,920
I think Yang Kaiwen is too obvious.

707
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,840
Because she would never

708
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,680
hold my hand in front of the camera.

709
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,240
You held my hand.

710
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,040
That's wrong.

711
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,680
You touched my head.

712
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,680
More than once.

713
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,200
Is it this one?

714
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:38,440
Yes.

715
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,840
I was talking about these intimate gestures.

716
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,040
They don't really seem like something Yang Kaiwen would do on camera.

717
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,760
She touched my head.

718
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,240
Take a guess.

719
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:43,960
Today.

720
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,160
Yes, there was an action.

721
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,520
An action.

722
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,680
It just happened.

723
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,840
It just happened.

724
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,560
She fed me this (fruit).

725
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,200
Fed you.

726
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,160
Like this.

727
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,240
You fed me.

728
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,240
You fed me.

729
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,440
That's pretty hard.

730
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,720
She fed me five times.

731
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,240
No wonder you kept asking me.

732
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,640
I want to eat, you feed me.

733
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,440
You feed me, like this.

734
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:12,720
Feed me.

735
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,160
You don't know what her task is either, right?

736
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,440
We don't know between us.

737
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,960
So what's your task?

738
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,480
To make me shout three times.

739
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,440
Zeng Zhaohao's name.

740
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,440
I only shouted once.

741
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,880
I forgot the other two times.

742
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,320
If you shout again now, won't that count?

743
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,280
It's too late.

744
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,320
I'm still missing two times.

745
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,440
Congratulations to Yang Kaiwen

746
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,440
for winning.

747
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,320
You were faster than me, right?

748
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,200
You were faster than me, right?

749
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,520
Yes, I touched your head as soon as we met.

750
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,600
And I put the blindfold on you.

751
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,720
I kept touching you.

752
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,360
Time for the award, darling.

753
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,360
Come on.

754
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,760
Here is your prize.

755
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,400
Thank you.

756
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:00,840
Thank you.

757
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,480
This is a "Signal of the Heart"

758
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,640
merchandise water bottle.

759
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,200
Thank you.

760
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,640
I really want one too.

761
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,560
Here, you can have it.

762
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,280
I'll try harder next time.

763
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,640
If there's another mini-game later,

764
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,600
Yang Kaiwen, say a few words about winning.

765
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,880
You go first, say it for me.

766
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,480
Okay.

767
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,280
I think the difficulty

768
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,960
was way too easy for Yang Kaiwen.

769
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,600
Can we make it a bit harder?

770
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,120
Do you usually do things like this?

771
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:21,600
Yes.

772
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,520
Maybe touching heads.

773
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,080
But holding hands...

774
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,040
It's true, holding hands in front of the camera is harder.

775
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,320
Right.

776
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:26,960
Thank you.

777
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,800
Thank you to the production team.

778
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,240
Thank you.

779
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,640
Punishment, punishment props.

780
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,840
I did it!

781
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,320
You're not going to skip drinking, are you?

782
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,280
We're not drinking.

783
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,000
Let's all drink together.

784
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,520
Yeah.

785
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,640
Let's have one first.

786
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,880
Alright.

787
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,280
You're too honest.

788
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,000
Okay.

789
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,360
I'll drink with you.

790
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,160
Come on.

791
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:57,760
Okay.

792
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,200
Stop.

793
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,600
Happy birthday.

794
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,520
Happy New Year.

795
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,160
Happy New Year.

796
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:07,640
Happy New Year.

797
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,320
Happy New Year.

798
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:11,800
Not bad.

799
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,160
Is it sweet?

800
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,280
It's pretty good.

801
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:14,480
It's pretty good.

802
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:17,880
It's quite sweet.

803
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,200
Tastes good.

804
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,200
Is this really a punishment drink?

805
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,120
It's too bitter.

806
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,640
Even though we're drinking the punishment drink,

807
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,960
our hearts are sweet.

808
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,400
When Xiaobo (Zhang Jin) expresses some

809
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:34,960
Zhang Jin

810
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,600
When Zhang Jin expresses some

811
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,280
emotions,

812
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:37,720
Xiao Guo

813
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,360
That's the nickname he gave her.

814
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,240
Why is it Xiaobo (Zhang Jin)?

815
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,600
Explain it to everyone.

816
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,040
The "bo" in "using four ounces to move a thousand pounds"

817
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:45,680
Right.

818
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,000
That's exactly what he said.

819
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,240
Zhang Jin, I think you have

820
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,880
the ability to achieve a lot with little effort.

821
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,480
So I call you "Little Bo" (Zhang Jin).

822
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,320
Because among these five characters,

823
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,560
only this one can have "Little" added in front.

824
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,080
Little Four, Little Ounce

825
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,480
Little Bo

826
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,680
I want to ask

827
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,840
Zeng Zhaohao, how did you gain

828
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,880
the ability to understand Little Bo's (Zhang Jin's) emotions?

829
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,160
Actually, Zhang Jin's emotions

830
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,200
are quite easy to read.

831
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:09,800
Because I think

832
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,880
Zhang Jin is someone whose personality

833
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,120
is very emotionally stable.

834
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,080
So when she has

835
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,760
emotional fluctuations,

836
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,080
they're easy to notice.

837
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,440
But recently, I really

838
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,680
feel it's been more obvious.

839
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,400
Whether I'm happy or angry, I express it directly.

840
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,040
Even between the two of us,

841
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,920
if something happens,

842
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,520
we just talk about it directly.

843
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,640
Do you know why?

844
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,080
Especially after

845
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,400
Zeng Zhaohao proposed,

846
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,200
you gained a huge sense of security.

847
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,480
So it's easier for you to let out

848
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,760
your inner emotions.

849
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,360
Because you feel

850
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,440
Zeng Zhaohao is by your side

851
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,800
and gives you someone to rely on.

852
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,720
Or maybe I gained

853
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,920
a huge sense of security.

854
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:41,840
How should I put it?

855
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,680
Maybe I have

856
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,440
more energy to

857
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,080
observe

858
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:45,760
and understand.

859
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:46,960
I see.

860
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,000
What about you two?

861
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,320
Why are you both leaning on each other?

862
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,600
Go ahead and say it.

863
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,320
He's actually pretty obvious.

864
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,240
Even if he doesn't speak, I can tell.

865
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,800
Something seems off.

866
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,360
I think Tomo (Zhang Hao) actually looks

867
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,920
quite calm and steady.

868
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:02,840
Right?

869
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,280
I also think he's pretty steady.

870
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,160
Yeah.

871
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,760
So he has a bit of contrast.

872
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,800
So he has a bit of contrast.

873
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,280
Doesn't he?

874
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,680
He's livelier off the show.

875
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,840
Do you like that kind of contrast?

876
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,680
Of course.

877
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,440
There's something else today.

878
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,400
Has anyone noticed

879
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,560
the tag you put on yourselves?

880
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,120
I saw it.

881
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:15,760
Each pair has a number.

882
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,840
Each pair has a number.

883
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,720
Do you know what this number

884
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,440
is for?

885
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,400
They're from season six.

886
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,280
We're from season two.

887
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,160
They're from season one.

888
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,280
We're from season one.

889
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:23,560
Right.

890
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,480
The year.

891
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,000
It's one.

892
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,360
So smart, Tomo (Zhang Hao).

893
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,720
So clever.

894
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,960
We just had our one-year anniversary.

895
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,520
When was your confession night?

896
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,440
June 28th.

897
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,680
That was just recently.

898
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,200
Did you have any special

899
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:40,760
ways

900
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,800
to celebrate?

901
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,280
Didn't you already follow their account?

902
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,600
You're pretty good at setting me up, aren't you?

903
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,960
You really are one of us.

904
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,200
Then why don't you tell us

905
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,960
how we celebrated?

906
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,800
You guys went to take a set of

907
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:57,640
photos.

908
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,320
Isn't that it?

909
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,120
Yeah, that's the one.

910
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,680
Tomo leaned in close to Qiqi's ear.

911
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,560
Right, that's it.

912
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,280
Is there a video like that?

913
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,480
I saw that video.

914
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,360
And there was also a livestream.

915
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,560
He surprised me during it.

916
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,120
He sang in a restaurant.

917
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,400
He confessed his feelings while singing.

918
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,480
How did he surprise you during the livestream?

919
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,640
I was supposed to go back to Guangzhou with her.

920
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,600
But I delayed by a day.

921
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,200
I told her I had something to do.

922
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,040
But actually, that day

923
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:19,960
I was preparing

924
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,800
the surprise for that day.

925
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,120
I prepared what I wanted to say.

926
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,080
I was going to sing.

927
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,000
I wrote a script.

928
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,400
I gave it to her during the livestream.

929
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,120
That's wonderful.

930
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,680
Do you have any

931
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:32,880
ideas on how to keep love

932
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,560
feeling fresh all the time?

933
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,640
I think only people who need to keep things fresh

934
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,640
actually need to do that.

935
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:37,880
Right?

936
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,920
The two of us don't need to keep things fresh.

937
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,920
Freshness doesn't need to be maintained.

938
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,600
It's always new every time we see each other.

939
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,360
Yes.

940
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:43,840
Even after six years, it's still new every time.

941
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,120
All of our couples

942
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,280
must feel the same way.

943
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,560
Yes, we all feel the same, right.

944
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,000
So for you two,

945
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,560
Yes, we're the second pair.

946
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,120
The second pair.

947
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,360
We've been together for two years.

948
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:54,800
We've been together for two years.

949
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:55,840
Which day is your anniversary?

950
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:56,800
Ours is June 1st.

951
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,400
June 1st.

952
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,240
Children's Day.

953
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,600
I hope you all

954
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,680
stay as happy as children.

955
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,160
Right?

956
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:02,360
Yes.

957
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,600
Otherwise, how could we always

958
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,840
keep this childlike innocence?

959
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:07,920
Every summer,

960
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,040
in May or June,

961
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,400
when "Signal of the Heart" airs,

962
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,000
everyone connects because of love.

963
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,840
We witness love together in the summer.

964
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,200
It feels especially wonderful.

965
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,920
Let's look forward together

966
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,440
to the eighth season of "Signal of the Heart"

967
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,360
and see what kind of

968
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,640
love stories will unfold.

969
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,400
Alright, the first half is over.

970
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,840
I really want to watch more.

971
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,360
There's more.

972
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,200
There will be more in a bit.

973
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,560
Who did they end up choosing?
