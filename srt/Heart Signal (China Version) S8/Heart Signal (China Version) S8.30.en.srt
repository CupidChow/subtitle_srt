1
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,120
Hello

2
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,640
Let's go

3
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,680
Such beautiful photos

4
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,160
Over there

5
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,720
That's Wang Lechen and Liu Zihan

6
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,160
I see Wang Lechen

7
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,400
This person is in the back

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,520
Looks like Wang Lechen

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,920
We're looking so closely

10
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,200
There are words in here

11
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,640
Should we open it and take a look?

12
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,560
What's this?

13
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,240
Five slips

14
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,560
Maybe they gave these to us

15
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,480
Let's sit

16
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,320
Let's sit down

17
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,840
Here, this is for you

18
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:02,840
Okay

19
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,960
Let me see what's going on

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,080
Hello, everyone

21
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,040
Long time no see

22
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:13,840
Long time no see

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,760
Long time no see

24
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,840
It's really been a long time

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,000
Take a seat

26
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,440
A familiar setting

27
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,520
We watched an episode here last time

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,360
It was fun, really fun

29
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,120
We've already seen

30
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,040
your photos

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:29,880
Yes

32
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,120
Last time we were with

33
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,640
Yang Kaiwen

34
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,040
Zhao Qijun

35
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,000
and Tomo (Zhang Haoliang) and Qiqi (Wang Qi)

36
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,760
So this is your first time

37
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,880
recording "Watching Heart Signal with You"

38
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,560
Is this your first time on "Watching Heart Signal with You"?

39
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,720
Yes, it's the first time

40
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,080
Yes

41
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,880
Are you nervous?

42
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,680
A little bit

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,680
I'm a bit nervous

44
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,240
We're about to start

45
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:45,880
I'm sweating

46
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,400
I'm cringing hard

47
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,040
Watching yourself from a third-person view feels awkward

48
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,080
No need to be too nervous

49
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:52,680
I think

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,120
The first time you watch yourself

51
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,040
It's really strange

52
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,720
So strange

53
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,840
It's like seeing yourself from another angle

54
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,520
Everything that happened before

55
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,400
Makes you feel

56
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,240
different from how you felt then

57
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,360
It's very different

58
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,320
So it's pretty interesting

59
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,280
Anyway, later

60
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,520
Let's pay attention to their expressions

61
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,680
Last time, someone from their group came to "Watching Heart Signal with You"

62
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,920
Did they share any thoughts with you afterward?

63
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,880
Thoughts

64
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,760
I didn't hear anything

65
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,680
Did you?

66
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,520
Not really thoughts

67
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,120
I'm not sure if I can say this

68
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,240
Sorry to Wang Lechen

69
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:21,920
He said

70
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,040
He said last time

71
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,040
All the guys were really tall

72
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,560
So he ordered height-increasing shoes that night

73
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,800
They were all so tall

74
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,960
You're tall too

75
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,160
You're tall as well

76
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,920
They hung out together before

77
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,480
That's how Zeng Zhaohui is

78
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,400
Alright, let's officially begin

79
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,480
Today's

80
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,480
"Watching Heart Signal with You"

81
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,440
We are

82
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,160
the "Jinzhao" team

83
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,080
I'm Haoyun (Zhang Jin)

84
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,520
I'm Zengzeng (Zeng Zhaohui) from the "Jinzhao" team

85
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,440
Hello, everyone

86
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,800
I'm from Heart Signal Season 8

87
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,640
Jin Yuxing

88
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,120
I'm Jiao Zhiheng

89
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,840
Today with the "Leg Hair team"

90
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,480
"Leg Hair brothers"

91
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,800
Yes, "Leg Hair brothers"

92
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,320
I have a question

93
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,000
How did you notice the leg hair

94
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,480
as a feature?

95
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,760
I think it's because I wore shorts that day

96
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,280
Yeah, at that time

97
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,720
Jiao Zhiheng was wearing shorts

98
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,000
So I noticed

99
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,200
his leg hair looks a lot like mine

100
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,560
At that time, I felt

101
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,120
it was just like my own legs.

102
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,880
That day really felt surreal for us.

103
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,280
After the show, leaving the house

104
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,320
made us realize if life had changed.

105
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,720
There were some changes.

106
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,360
After filming, I felt a bit

107
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,640
of a sense of separation.

108
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,360
Because at that time,

109
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,720
everyone was living together.

110
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,400
It really felt like home.

111
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,520
Suddenly splitting up

112
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,280
was like running away from home.

113
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,160
I felt pretty much the same as Jiao Zhiheng.

114
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,760
When I first parted ways with everyone

115
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,440
from the house,

116
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,360
I felt reluctant to leave.

117
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,080
I really missed life in the house.

118
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,160
After filming ended,

119
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,560
it felt just like graduating.

120
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,160
That feeling, right?

121
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,960
Yeah.

122
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,680
Everyone went their separate ways.

123
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,680
We once lived together,

124
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,640
together,

125
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,920
and dated.

126
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,120
We also watched with you

127
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,520
the first episode of Heart Signal Season 8.

128
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,760
That's when we realized your house had two dogs.

129
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,920
Do you walk the dogs yourselves every day?

130
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:36,960
Yes.

131
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,440
Nico and Winnie.

132
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,600
After work, everyone would walk them.

133
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,480
When you feed them,

134
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,160
do you have any rules?

135
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,920
We do set rules.

136
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,560
Basically, when we get back, we ask

137
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,040
if anyone has fed them today.

138
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:55,880
And I remember

139
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,560
Winnie was on a diet then, right?

140
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,480
So she was fed a bit less.

141
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,000
Alright, let's watch together now.

142
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,280
If you’re not careful, your seat is gone.

143
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,040
And you’re still moving slowly.

144
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,800
Watching myself,

145
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,200
I think I move really slowly.

146
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,640
I never noticed it before.

147
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,280
But I really am slow.

148
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:31,960
Way too slow.

149
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,320
So you wanted to sit next to

150
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,360
Chichi (Sun Hanqing), right?

151
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,440
He just went to wash his hands.

152
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,160
He just stepped away for a moment.

153
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,880
And then right away,

154
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,200
Liu Zihan took the seat.

155
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,440
Turned around and left.

156
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,600
You sighed so hard.

157
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,200
That little dog,

158
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,560
Nico kept looking at you.

159
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,120
Really?

160
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,520
She kept watching you.

161
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,920
I’m speechless.

162
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,440
Why can’t you stand still?

163
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,720
I really can’t stand still.

164
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,560
What’s going on?

165
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,480
But at that moment, I was really thinking

166
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,040
that there was finally an empty seat

167
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,160
and I could sit down.

168
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,080
Chichi (Sun Hanqing) was very proactive.

169
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,240
He came to talk to you.

170
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,000
What did you talk about?

171
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,680
I remember it.

172
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,440
You two talked for a long time.

173
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,400
For two hours.

174
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,760
That long?

175
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,520
This scene,

176
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,320
Jin Yuxing looked like he was at military training.

177
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,160
Yeah, Chichi (Sun Hanqing) suddenly came to me

178
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,240
to chat.

179
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,960
And then I

180
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,560
got really nervous.

181
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,880
I didn’t know what to talk about.

182
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,960
I just felt

183
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,760
a bit tense.

184
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,480
Your actions then were just like now.

185
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,400
Are you repeating yourself, bro?

186
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,040
No.

187
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,120
Did you imagine

188
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,760
what she would talk to you about?

189
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,520
No.

190
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,040
I just couldn’t think of anything.

191
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,520
So I

192
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,360
couldn’t imagine it.

193
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,360
Yeah, I was a bit nervous.

194
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,120
A bit nervous.

195
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,080
You already messed up your hair

196
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,440
by grabbing it so much.

197
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,000
Yeah, my thoughts at the time

198
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,560
were probably even messier than my hair.

199
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,800
You're really...

200
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,720
Like being called out by the homeroom teacher,

201
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,440
that feeling of being lectured.

202
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,440
It really looks like that.

203
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,720
Chichi (Sun Hanqing) really is

204
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,560
seems like she has something to say.

205
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,960
Riding bikes that day,

206
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,520
So why did you go cycling?

207
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,760
Weren't you supposed to work out with her?

208
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,600
No.

209
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,360
He went by himself.

210
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,000
I originally said I'd go work out alone.

211
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,720
Then,

212
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,960
the five of them

213
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,920
enthusiastically invited me.

214
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,280
I noticed she was actually wearing a skirt.

215
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,320
It's not convenient for cycling.

216
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,400
So I thought,

217
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,720
if she went, I'd go with her.

218
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,040
But she said she wasn't going.

219
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,360
So then,

220
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,400
we missed each other.

221
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,320
Jiao Ge (Jiao Zhiheng),

222
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,600
I was a bit too enthusiastic, sorry.

223
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,480
Sorry.

224
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,400
At that point, you'd already

225
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,880
put me on the spot.

226
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,320
I couldn't say no.

227
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,680
My friends basically dragged me to go cycling.

228
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,640
Thinking like that will hold you back.

229
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,880
Chichi (Sun Hanqing) is pretty nice.

230
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,440
Yeah.

231
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,040
I think she would

232
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,160
take the initiative to talk to you about it.

233
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,200
That shows she's really proactive.

234
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,440
More than you are.

235
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,200
True.

236
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,240
I think talking with

237
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,840
Chichi (Sun Hanqing)

238
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,840
shouldn't be stressful.

239
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,920
She never lets any topic

240
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,800
fall flat.

241
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,760
That's great.

242
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,120
And she's very empathetic.

243
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,400
You can feel it.

244
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,400
Did you notice

245
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,680
her eyes back then?

246
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,960
No.

247
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,240
I wanted to ask too.

248
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,760
I feel like I'm not very observant.

249
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,360
After watching the clips,

250
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,280
I realized there were so many

251
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,120
things I missed.

252
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,000
I only noticed afterwards.

253
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,480
It's fine.

254
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,320
Misunderstandings should be cleared up.

255
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,800
Just talk it out and it's resolved.

256
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,480
Being direct is good.

257
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,880
So you went out cycling because

258
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,680
you didn't want to kill the mood?

259
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,160
Didn't know how to turn him down?

260
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,720
So that's why you went along?

261
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,920
It's not that I didn't know how to refuse.

262
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,880
I try to put myself in others' shoes.

263
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,320
When I really want to do something

264
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,520
and invite someone,

265
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,760
actually,

266
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,520
if they turn me down,

267
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,720
I'd feel a bit disappointed.

268
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,640
There's a sense of letdown.

269
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,680
So sometimes,

270
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,760
when everyone invites me together,

271
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,720
it's really hard for me to say no.

272
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,720
I worry about a lot.

273
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,920
Yeah, lots of concerns.

274
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,080
Let me ask a tough question.

275
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,800
If your friends invite you on one side,

276
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,440
and your girlfriend on the other,

277
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,320
which would you choose?

278
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,760
I'd definitely choose my girlfriend first.

279
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,120
I enjoy romance more.

280
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,560
That's how it should be.

281
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,080
What about Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng)?

282
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,280
I think friendship and love

283
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,480
both support you.

284
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,320
They're the two main pillars of your life.

285
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:30,680
But

286
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,440
the pillars don't "fight" each other.

287
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,480
Because they're always

288
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,200
supporting and understanding each other.

289
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,040
Right.

290
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,880
Okay, let's keep watching.

291
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,120
I'm starting to feel awkward too.

292
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,040
I didn't see myself earlier.

293
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,120
When I showed up on screen,

294
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,240
I got restless.

295
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,000
You didn't even finish answering Ruilong

296
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,040
before you walked straight over.

297
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,760
A little excited.

298
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,880
A little nervous.

299
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,200
Okay, handed it over.

300
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,800
What?

301
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,480
What did you give?

302
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,360
What is it?

303
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,000
Invitation card.

304
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,960
Invitation card.

305
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,880
It's my first time seeing this little windmill.

306
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,480
It's spinning.

307
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,600
I didn't even look.

308
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,880
I just grabbed it and ran.

309
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,720
Turns out all the spots in the park

310
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,680
were set up for this park time.

311
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,360
They were prepared for it.

312
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,040
It's like charging ahead for love.

313
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,040
Nicely done.

314
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,840
So nice.

315
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,600
You drove this little car over.

316
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,080
You decorated the car too.

317
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,720
Yeah.

318
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,440
You're really good at this.

319
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,080
You even brought mosquito repellent.

320
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,840
You're so thoughtful.

321
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,480
I thought it was because

322
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,760
you think Xu Rulan looks like a rabbit.

323
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,680
You find her cute.

324
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,360
Didn't expect her zodiac is rabbit.

325
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,000
She was born in 1999.

326
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,280
1999.

327
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,080
I just remembered.

328
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,920
Was it the day before

329
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,720
when we were riding bikes

330
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,560
you deliberately blocked the way there?

331
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,080
That exact spot.

332
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,080
You didn't want us to see it.

333
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,320
So how did you block it?

334
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,640
At that time, Jiao Zhiheng said

335
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,520
It's so dark here.

336
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,160
Let's hurry and move forward.

337
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,400
That's how it was.

338
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,640
It's so dark here.

339
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,560
It was all foreshadowing.

340
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,600
It's so dark here.

341
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,720
So tense.

342
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,720
I feel like when you were preparing all this

343
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,920
you must have felt

344
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,160
really happy inside.

345
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,160
Very happy.

346
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,160
Very excited.

347
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,120
You were sweating and asked Xu Rulan if she was cold.

348
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,800
Yeah, I wanted to say that too.

349
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,520
Call Chang'e.

350
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,920
I thought you were doing magic.

351
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,880
Making her look over there.

352
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,960
Suddenly making something appear.

353
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:25,920
There was a magic trick too.

354
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,200
You can keep watching.

355
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:27,560
Really?

356
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,280
Still holding back a big move.

357
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:29,760
There's another big move.

358
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,920
Even bigger than this.

359
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,600
Not really, yeah.

360
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,920
Just a small surprise.

361
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,400
It's beautiful.

362
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,240
So pretty.

363
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,520
Are you nervous?

364
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,120
Nervous, very nervous.

365
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,920
Overflowing with happiness.

366
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,760
Overflowing with happiness.

367
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,840
I got goosebumps.

368
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,840
Me too.

369
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,560
It's about lighting up her wish, right?

370
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,640
This tree is actually her wishing tree.

371
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,800
And your signal tree.

372
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,360
Sent up to the sky.

373
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,320
Well said.

374
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,360
Sending the Heart Signal

375
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:33,840
through this tree

376
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,640
out into the whole universe.

377
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:41,840
Did you ever find out

378
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,960
what wish she made?

379
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:45,480
I didn't ask.

380
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,640
Because I thought

381
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,800
maybe it would come true if she didn't say it.

382
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,120
I think watching under the tree would feel more special.

383
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:54,800
Right?

384
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,920
Because that tree is actually huge.

385
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,440
Then she

386
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,000
would look up along with it.

387
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,280
It must look amazing.

388
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:04,880
There's more.

389
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,840
More surprises.

390
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,320
There's more.

391
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,440
More surprises.

392
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,640
This one doesn't count.

393
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,720
This one's really small.

394
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,240
Honestly,

395
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,520
where is this little cabin?

396
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,320
I have no idea.

397
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,520
I've never even seen it.

398
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,400
This little cabin.

399
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,240
Why is it so funny?

400
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:40,640
You don't know?

401
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,080
Another big reason is

402
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,080
he said it was too dark ahead.

403
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,080
He didn't let you go.

404
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,880
That's my fault.

405
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,040
Xu Rulan must be really happy too.

406
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,000
Why did you

407
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,600
say that at the time?

408
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,200
There really are a lot of people in the house.

409
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,640
Everyone might interact

410
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,800
with different people every day.

411
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,800
The space is so small,

412
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,200
but there are so many people.

413
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,480
I still hope

414
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,120
to give her more

415
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,600
mental space.

416
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,920
Take care of your own feelings more.

417
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,480
You should be happy too.

418
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,160
Wait,

419
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,640
we're getting "shipped" again.

420
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,520
That's so sweet.

421
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,440
He really did throw it up like that.

422
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,920
It's so hard to toss.

423
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,120
That's nice.

424
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,960
Kind of cool.

425
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,880
Chasing the wind, young man.

426
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,960
Yeah, chasing the wind.

427
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,240
He really did each one

428
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,040
by himself.

429
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,560
That's impressive.

430
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:05,960
So romantic.

431
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,800
So thoughtful.

432
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,800
Report finished.

433
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,920
Why is it called the "Building Blocks Plan"?

434
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,680
Because on the first day,

435
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,680
at the dinner,

436
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,160
everyone

437
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,240
prepared a gift.

438
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,520
Her gift was building blocks.

439
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,920
She asked how I prepared

440
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,800
this.

441
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,080
I said it's like building with blocks.

442
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,560
We happened to chat about it while walking.

443
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,600
We talked about making wishes.

444
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,280
Like I just mentioned.

445
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,520
At that time, I thought

446
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,760
we could make something for wishes.

447
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,760
Later, I chose a tree.

448
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,680
Then I picked that tree.

449
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,680
Because that tree

450
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,440
is very round.

451
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,560
It looks nice.

452
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,800
So I decided on the wishing tree.

453
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,640
Basically, I built it bit by bit.

454
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,120
In the end,

455
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,040
I might have built

456
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,680
a big plan.

457
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,880
After hearing your building blocks plan,

458
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,000
I want to applaud.

459
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Come on, let's clap.

460
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,240
Let's applaud Xiao Jiao's initiative.

461
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:01,840
Applause.

462
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,040
Thank you.

463
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,360
Wang Yifan's standee.

464
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,560
Her job seems really busy.

465
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,280
She even works on weekends.

466
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,560
Yeah, on Saturdays.

467
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,080
That day happened to be Saturday.

468
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,680
It's the busiest time at the museum.

469
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,440
Xiao Yuan is really interesting.

470
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,560
That's me.

471
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,160
I'm really shipping them.

472
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,520
So jealous.

473
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,320
They're all so great.

474
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,120
So sweet.

475
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,280
I'm really shipping them.

476
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,440
Before you two came in,

477
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,960
we talked a lot with them.

478
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,680
It was pretty nice.

479
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,240
Did they answer?

480
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,720
Great question, Teacher Zeng.

481
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,600
Because at that time,

482
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,440
we didn't really know

483
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,040
how your previous dates went.

484
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,480
What happened?

485
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,160
Including what happened.

486
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,800
But now things have progressed

487
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,520
to this point.

488
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,640
There should be some clues now.

489
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,280
Right?

490
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,720
Can't stand anymore.

491
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,880
Why?

492
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,800
Why do you get shy when your friend comes?

493
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,920
You seem more bashful.

494
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,640
Because we're so close, yeah.

495
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,480
He knows everything about you

496
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,360
since you were little.

497
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,240
Then suddenly you feel

498
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,440
like you're totally exposed in front of him.

499
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,240
Just like a little brother.

500
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,480
You're always the little brother to him.

501
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,840
You recovered from that so fast.

502
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,880
Your friend is really interesting.

503
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,720
Actually, before he commented on me,

504
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,720
I was already feeling a lot of pressure.

505
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,120
Because their friends were all praising them.

506
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,840
But in real life,

507
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,280
it's like

508
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,040
we don't really compliment each other directly

509
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,720
when we're together.

510
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,160
We're all "roasting friends."

511
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,960
Yeah, pretty much.

512
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,840
Actually, the other's

513
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,840
good points

514
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,000
are kept in our hearts.

515
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,760
But we don't say them out loud, right.

516
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,720
I felt a lot of pressure too.

517
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,160
I didn't know what he'd say.

518
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,240
Didn't expect his first words

519
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,120
to be so surprising.

520
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,440
Kind of unreliable.

521
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,800
That broke my guard right away.

522
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,760
I'm really shipping them.

523
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,200
We shipped them the whole time.

524
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,480
We were totally facing each other.

525
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,680
We stood face to face.

526
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,320
You guys are amazing.

527
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,880
We're pretty awesome.

528
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,920
We're really good at sports.

529
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,360
That's the chemistry of an old married couple.

530
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,520
Really in sync.

531
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,120
We practiced this at home before.

532
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:56,760
Practiced for a month.

533
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,040
The practice bloopers were released.

534
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,800
I had a really strong impression that day.

535
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,360
It was

536
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,040
your hands were together for a long time.

537
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,080
You kept holding hands.

538
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,520
Super sweet.

539
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,880
Me, my brother, and Wang Lechen

540
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,360
said we were shipping them.

541
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,520
Really interlocked fingers.

542
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,840
Really, so many times.

543
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,680
Did you feel

544
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,600
any tension back then?

545
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,680
There was a bit.

546
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,120
Duoduo already responded for me.

547
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,360
Duoduo hugged first.

548
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,720
Hug first to show respect.

549
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,720
Did you feel competitive?

550
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,360
Did you feel it then?

551
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,080
Yes.

552
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,400
Yeah, I really wanted to win.

553
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,840
Not bad.

554
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,080
Duoduo jumps really high.

555
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,720
How many did your team get?

556
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,880
I remember over seventy.

557
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,680
Yeah, maybe got a bit flustered at the end.

558
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,200
Your rhythm wasn't as good

559
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:16,600
as it was at the start.

560
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,840
Duoduo too.

561
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,800
It's okay, let's go again.

562
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,840
Duoduo is also very

563
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,800
good at comforting people.

564
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,520
Yes.

565
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,080
Got affected by the desire to win.

566
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,480
A little bit, yeah.

567
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,760
Actually, we should've

568
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,760
let the girls

569
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,200
turn the rope.

570
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,480
It would've been better if they did.

571
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,840
Looking back now,

572
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,560
I still remember it.

573
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,480
When you said

574
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,520
you invited Lanlan (Xu Rulan),

575
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,760
we were both so surprised.

576
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,640
Seriously,

577
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,400
Duoduo (Ke Ailin) is

578
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,160
Duoduo (Ke Ailin) is really good at this.

579
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,360
Duoduo (Ke Ailin) made me feel

580
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:27,880
an illusion

581
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,760
that she was on our team.

582
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,240
Duoduo (Ke Ailin) was just a bystander.

583
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,600
Teacher Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng) is really skilled.

584
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,760
How did you feel at that moment?

585
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,080
It was complicated.

586
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:52,840
Just...

587
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,080
I really didn’t know what to say then.

588
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,720
You felt pretty down, right?

589
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,040
No, it was okay.

590
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,760
We worked together pretty well.

591
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,960
It was written all over my face.

592
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,280
This round is yours.

593
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,040
You really showed off.

594
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,680
Totally showed off.

595
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,440
You definitely did.

596
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,040
See how jealous I am.

597
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,240
I was stunned at the time.

598
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,800
I’m just your tool.

599
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,000
No.

600
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,520
Because after he finished the last round,

601
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,760
he must have been exhausted.

602
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,680
Yeah.

603
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,040
They jumped over a hundred times in a row.

604
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,800
A hundred and twenty times.

605
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,640
Yes.

606
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,400
I really wanted to applaud him.

607
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,200
Duoduo (Ke Ailin),

608
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,320
every jump landed

609
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,880
right in Dr. Fang’s (Fang Yijiong) heart.

610
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,240
She’s really good.

611
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,400
The host was amazing.

612
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,880
Xiaobao (Zeng Zhaohao) did a great job hosting.

613
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,680
So cool.

614
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,880
Like a little PE teacher.

615
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,680
Pretty good, not bad.

616
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:31,720
Wonderful.

617
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,640
The sports event was fantastic.

618
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,800
Let me share my thoughts.

619
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,760
Because when we went to film

620
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,720
your sports event

621
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,800
for that episode,

622
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,240
we didn’t really know

623
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,360
what happened before.

624
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,040
The events.

625
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,400
So when we

626
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,760
look back at that sports event,

627
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,320
I think

628
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,040
there are so many details

629
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,480
that we all missed.

630
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,920
Yeah, really.

631
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:50,960
I’m thinking,

632
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,600
there’s a lot I didn’t know either.

633
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,440
Right?

634
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,600
Jin Yuxing really needs to pay attention.

635
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,800
He’s anxious.

636
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,440
Alright, let’s keep watching.

637
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,680
It’s time for the second round of mutual selection dates.

638
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:06,960
It’s date time.

639
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,400
Mutual selection date.

640
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,760
Everyone has two

641
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,440
date invitation cards.

642
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,640
One for each day’s date.

643
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,360
Who do you want to invite?

644
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,920
Just give your invitation card to them.

645
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,320
So basically,

646
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,360
you have to exchange invitation cards.

647
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,280
Us too.

648
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,720
No, one-way is fine, right?

649
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,560
No, it’s mutual.

650
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:26,480
You have to give them to each other.

651
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,440
Are you in the show?

652
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:27,880
I am.

653
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,480
No, bro.

654
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,400
It’s mutual.

655
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,520
Yeah, you have to exchange.

656
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,960
Is everyone thinking about it?

657
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,480
Please, go on a date with me.

658
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,800
Feels just like a Japanese drama.

659
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,480
Please, go on a date with me.

660
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,840
So at that time, Jin Yuxing

661
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,640
reminded Dr. Fang (Fang Yijiong),

662
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,640
if you write something,

663
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,920
you’ll be a step behind.

664
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,440
So did you write anything?

665
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:58,920
I did.

666
00:32:59,400 --> 00:32:59,840
I did.

667
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,440
Just as I was about to write,

668
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,680
then suddenly,

669
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,960
someone knocked on my door.

670
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,880
Why is this so funny?

671
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:20,880
Dr. Fang just

672
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,960
gave up the room.

673
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,160
That's bold.

674
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,920
Bro.

675
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,040
Who was she originally giving it to?

676
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,120
You don't know?

677
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,560
It was supposed to be for me.

678
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,400
He probably didn't see it.

679
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,280
Yeah, I didn't see it.

680
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,040
I was blocked at that moment.

681
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,960
I didn't see it.

682
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,040
Feels like you wrote a lot.

683
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,720
Why am I writing so slowly?

684
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,960
Now I feel like I'm slow at writing.

685
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,040
Lanlan (Xu Rulan).

686
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:12,920
So happy.

687
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:14,920
True.

688
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,000
Front row for the drama.

689
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,400
Are you pinching your brow?

690
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,760
Jin Yuxing's hand never came down.

691
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,960
What are you doing?

692
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,240
Exactly.

693
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,240
I don't know either.

694
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,800
I was probably a bit nervous just now.

695
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,560
I don't know either.

696
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,560
Jin Yuxing is always like that.

697
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,600
Because I think

698
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,280
it said to do it secretly.

699
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,560
But everyone seems so open about it.

700
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,200
So I felt really

701
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,600
kind of at a loss.

702
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,440
You made "at a loss" literal.

703
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,320
You acted it out.

704
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,480
Seriously.

705
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,360
Your expression

706
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,040
Jin Yuxing looks so goofy

707
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,280
I can't take it anymore

708
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,840
This invitation card

709
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,320
How do you secretly give it to someone?

710
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,520
I thought you weren't supposed to

711
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,600
let everyone know

712
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,080
Only the two people should know

713
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,000
At first,

714
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,840
I thought the same as you

715
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,960
But actually, it's allowed

716
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,280
I also thought it was a secret at first

717
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,360
But later realized there's no need

718
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,440
You just have to act quickly

719
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,000
But that's normal

720
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,720
Because in the beginning, everyone is getting to know each other

721
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,200
and interacting

722
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,280
So it's totally normal

723
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,280
Spicy beef with chocolate

724
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,560
Mixing sweet and spicy together

725
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,920
I climb those stairs every day

726
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,560
Even though I'm on the first floor

727
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,920
I climb as much as the people on the second floor

728
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,560
She just handed it to you directly

729
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,000
You two look like spies

730
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,640
Just passing it over like this

731
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,280
You have to do it quickly

732
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,960
You guys are the real spies, bro

733
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,640
Dr. Fang is really

734
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,320
catching spies

735
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,360
Dr. Fang (Fang Yijiong) must be calm, right?

736
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,960
Let's just say his eyes are determined

737
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,880
Not calm at all

738
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,120
Definitely not calm

739
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,840
And from this angle

740
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,000
you really can't see

741
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,440
You really couldn't see it then

742
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,360
That's it

743
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,400
No, I want to watch more

744
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,640
Play half an episode more

745
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,760
Play half an episode more

746
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,560
Binge-watching and now it's over

747
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,680
Your first time recording your own "Watching Heart Signal with You"

748
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,520
How do you feel?

749
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,960
When watching my own clips

750
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,640
I feel like I get totally immersed

751
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,440
But watching others

752
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,880
feels so amazing

753
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,880
It's like a sudden realization

754
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,640
Like another world in a parallel universe

755
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,040
In real life, you rarely get the chance

756
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,280
to really look back

757
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,200
on your past

758
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,680
especially from a third-person perspective

759
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,640
and see what you were doing

760
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,120
I think

761
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:52,960
it's a great

762
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,760
opportunity for self-reflection

763
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,400
At the same time, I saw that in the house

764
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,680
everyone was working so hard

765
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,880
actively

766
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,800
pursuing love

767
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,320
and making their own choices

768
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,880
I think it's awesome

769
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,760
There's a message bottle on the table

770
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,880
Yeah, what's inside should be

771
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,600
from the last group of guests

772
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,880
who wrote messages for the bottle

773
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,440
Each of us draws one and responds

774
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,120
Then we'll write new ones to put in

775
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,360
for the next group

776
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:17,880
of friends coming to "Watching Heart Signal with You"

777
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,600
or guests coming to "Watching Heart Signal with You"

778
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,000
I've wanted to open it for a while

779
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:22,640
I'm so curious

780
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,280
The moment he entered the house

781
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,080
he wanted to open it

782
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,320
Then you go first

783
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:26,640
Since you want to

784
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,400
Go ahead

785
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,560
I'll read mine first

786
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,360
Pick someone in the house

787
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,120
the opposite sex who impressed you most

788
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,640
and say something from your heart

789
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,000
Tell those two.

790
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,920
Any impressions?

791
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,720
Then I'll speak from the heart.

792
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,040
I hope you two can

793
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,040
be happy.

794
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,000
get rich.

795
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,280
Thank you.

796
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,040
Thanks, Haoyun (Zhang Jin).

797
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,240
Mine was written by Wang Lechen.

798
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,440
He wrote to pick a place

799
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,240
and take me bungee jumping.

800
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:58,680
Hehe.

801
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,800
But I...

802
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,080
He doesn't dare, he's scared.

803
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,120
You don't dare.

804
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,480
He can't even handle roller coasters.

805
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,640
He throws up as soon as he gets off.

806
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:09,680
Alright then.

807
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,480
We can go together.

808
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,440
I'll just watch you guys jump.

809
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,120
Okay, sounds good.

810
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,720
I think mine was written by Xiaopai (Sun Xing).

811
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,400
Written by Xiaopai (Sun Xing).

812
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,720
Please post on Xiaohongshu now.

813
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,400
The photo should be you with your arms around

814
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,800
the two people on either side, close-up.

815
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,960
Caption: "Lifelong"

816
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,960
friends.

817
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,720
Let's switch seats.

818
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,280
Or maybe I should

819
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,440
take the photo for you.

820
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,040
Sure.

821
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,320
Okay.

822
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,240
Mine is from Liu Zihan.

823
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,440
An old friend, a familiar one.

824
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,440
He said to post a photo of us together.

825
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,480
If not, post a nice solo photo.

826
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,240
Post it on Xiaohongshu.

827
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,360
But I'm really not sure

828
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,960
if I have a photo with him.

829
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,440
I thought you meant

830
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,720
not sure if you're close with him.

831
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,200
Because I was thinking,

832
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,000
if there's no photo together,

833
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,480
just edit one in, right?

834
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,080
I don't think I'd post just myself anyway.

835
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,080
Alright.

836
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,200
Okay, let's do it.

837
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,080
Let's write our messages for the drift bottle now.

838
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,720
Whoever comes to "Watching Heart Signal with You" next time

839
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,320
is in for it.

840
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,000
Have you decided what to write?

841
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,080
I've already decided.

842
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,480
Wang Lechen inspired me.

843
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,880
Bungee jumping? You too?

844
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,600
Definitely not bungee jumping.

845
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,440
It has to be something different.

846
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,520
Everyone can start writing now.

847
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:12,680
Go ahead.

848
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,840
He brings his friends.

849
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,800
I bring mine.

850
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,120
We all go diving together.

851
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,520
On social media,

852
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,360
post a set of

853
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,120
photos of yourself eating lemons.

854
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,880
And let everyone here know.

855
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,920
That's savage.

856
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,720
A "Haoyun Dance Experience Card."

857
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,240
You can come dance at the studio.

858
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,080
Have a meal together.

859
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,840
Take three funny selfies and post them.

860
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,240
On social media.

861
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,360
Whoever gets this card

862
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,240
joins us for skiing next time.

863
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,520
(In the next two months)

864
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,400
There's a time limit.

865
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,480
There's a deadline.

866
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,280
Let's roll it up first.

867
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:42,880
Put it in.

868
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,840
Can't wait for the next person to open it.

869
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,320
Alright, let's all

870
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,560
take a nice photo together.

871
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,600
to wrap up today's "Watching Heart Signal with You."

872
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,280
Watching Heart Signal with You.

873
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,000
Heart Signal never ends.

874
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,040
See you next time.

875
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,400
Goodbye.
