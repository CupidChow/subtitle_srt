1
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,760
Here they come.

2
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,120
They're here, I'm really looking forward to this.

3
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,480
Who is that?

4
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,600
That's so cool.

5
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,560
There's another boat in front of us.

6
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,520
I'm so nervous.

7
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,880
Hello.

8
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,560
This is...

9
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,400
Looks a bit like Wang Jue.

10
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,640
You can tell who it is just from the back.

11
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,520
It must be Wang Yifan.

12
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,720
Okay.

13
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,280
No need to think about it.

14
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,320
That's definitely it.

15
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,120
They're here.

16
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,280
Missed it.

17
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,560
They're like this on the boat.

18
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,720
Missed the chance to meet.

19
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,440
Hello.

20
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,520
Hello.

21
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,560
Who?

22
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,040
Hello.

23
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,960
Wang Jue and Jin Yuxing.

24
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,480
He was chosen.

25
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,320
It was Jin Yuxing who went over.

26
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,520
Yeah, Jin Yuxing.

27
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,240
Hello.

28
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,200
Teacher Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong).

29
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,720
This one, Wang Yifan is correct.

30
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,000
I saw it.

31
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,800
It's like I saw them, but not completely.

32
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,520
Tell them we'll see them next time.

33
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,440
This scene is really...

34
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,680
so romantic.

35
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,880
I got it right.

36
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,000
You're so accurate.

37
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,320
No need to think about it.

38
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,520
Today we have a new friend joining us.

39
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,600
I want to give

40
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,120
um,

41
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,280
I want to give Jin Yuxing some

42
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,440
cold medicine.

43
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,480
Because he

44
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,360
was coughing a bit yesterday.

45
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,320
Someone is setting up the projector over there.

46
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,400
Are you catching a cold?

47
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,320
No.

48
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,040
I should be fine.

49
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,120
You still say you're not.

50
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,280
Then I'll go get Wang Jue.

51
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:24,880
Okay.

52
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,200
She’s very attentive too.

53
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,520
Wang Jue.

54
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,880
Hello.

55
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,080
Hello.

56
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,480
I'm looking for Jin Yuxing.

57
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,720
Is he here?

58
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,600
He left.

59
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,600
Didn't you know he left?

60
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,280
He left.

61
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,680
Who left?

62
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:48,840
Who left?

63
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,520
Jin Yuxing left.

64
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:49,960
Hello.

65
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,360
Was he transferred?

66
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,240
He was chosen to go.

67
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,680
Wang Jue went too.

68
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,320
Where are we going now?

69
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,640
Let's walk around.

70
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,000
Let's go.

71
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:02,880
So, Jin Yuxing...

72
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,560
So, Jin Yuxing...

73
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,720
Will he come back?

74
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,240
We'll see him sooner or later.

75
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,600
He even got over his cold.

76
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,280
Just getting some sun over there helped, right?

77
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:09,960
Who had a cold?

78
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,080
We're wearing the same clothes.

79
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,720
Look.

80
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,720
No one really cares.

81
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,200
If it were me, I definitely would have thought of that.

82
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,920
This is so funny.

83
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,320
This is hilarious.

84
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,240
Sit here.

85
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,880
We can come over with them tonight.

86
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,160
Come over and listen to some music or something.

87
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,000
Do you want to?

88
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,920
Lost in thought.

89
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,000
We can go out for a walk and listen to music.

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,040
Sure.

91
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,240
Feeling a little down.

92
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,120
We can keep looking.

93
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,120
Where are we going this afternoon?

94
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,240
I should at least take a photo of you two.

95
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,520
That's so nice.

96
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,240
Then look.

97
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,520
Look.

98
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,400
There's also a Buddha's hand stone here.

99
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,760
You can watch the sunset here.

100
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,480
We can check it out later.

101
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,720
When the sun isn't so strong.

102
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,120
Let's go watch the sunset.

103
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,920
Watch the sunset with me.

104
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,800
Okay.

105
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,520
I'll keep you company for a bit.

106
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,600
That's so sweet, baby.

107
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,240
I actually quite like it.

108
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,880
Duoduo (Ke Ailin)'s.

109
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,520
Very generous.

110
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,280
Actually, what we guessed yesterday was correct.

111
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,840
What did we guess?

112
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,360
That there would be a swap.

113
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,520
Yes, there would be a swap.

114
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,880
We guessed it too.

115
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,240
I think they probably also chose

116
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:27,920
the one from their own side.

117
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,760
Maybe.

118
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,280
A type they don't have.

119
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,080
That love personality type.

120
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,120
The one that's less common.

121
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,240
So what type is Jin Yuxing?

122
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,760
He's the giving type of lover.

123
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,440
He's the giving type of lover.

124
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,320
Yes.

125
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,160
So he really is.

126
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,280
Yesterday he kept trying to recommend that I use

127
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,480
his

128
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,120
shampoo.

129
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,720
He kept saying this one is really good.

130
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,520
Do you all go to bed early?

131
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,240
We went to bed before midnight.

132
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,400
We just forced ourselves to sleep.

133
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,800
Then I heard you upstairs.

134
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,400
I had no idea what you were doing.

135
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,200
Were you guys dancing?

136
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,560
Was it you?

137
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,160
It was probably us.

138
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,840
We were sleeping there.

139
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,880
Yeah, it was the two of us.

140
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,000
We were saying we could invite you next time.

141
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,280
The three of us could go running together.

142
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,200
I refused.

143
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:17,920
What did you say?

144
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,280
I refused.

145
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,600
How mean!

146
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,320
He turned me down.

147
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:20,840
That's so cute.

148
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,080
Can you...

149
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,800
Do you work out?

150
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:26,840
You mean exercise?

151
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,160
Yeah, exercise.

152
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,440
I was on the track team for seven years.

153
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,520
Seven years on the track team.

154
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,720
I used to do high jump.

155
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,480
You probably can't tell, right?

156
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,720
High jump.

157
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,080
Then you must be good at chasing boys.

158
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,800
Don't click on me.

159
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,000
Who can outrun me?

160
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,800
That's too much.

161
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
That's too much.

162
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,600
That's true.

163
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,720
Today we're welcoming two new friends.

164
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,400
Should we set some rules?

165
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,000
Let's say the newcomers have to

166
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,360
Let's say the newcomers have to

167
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,680
perform a dance.

168
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,560
He's so naughty.

169
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,680
Here we go, starting the antics.

170
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,680
Show a talent.

171
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,600
You can show a talent as your self-introduction.

172
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,120
Self-introduction.

173
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,000
More than three minutes.

174
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,600
This place is fine for today.

175
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,480
Let me invite

176
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,240
one more person.

177
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,840
Baby, I'm begging you.

178
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,840
I'm begging you.

179
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,240
The cold medicine is ready.

180
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,160
I'm giving it to someone else today.

181
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,880
Two.

182
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,480
One for each person.

183
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,560
One today, one tomorrow.

184
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,440
Give one to someone today.

185
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,080
Give one to Jin Yuxing tomorrow.

186
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,800
I'll save it for you.

187
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,800
I'll split it into two.

188
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,520
One on each side.

189
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,200
It's fine.

190
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,720
I'll pass the message to Jin Yuxing.

191
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,360
When he sleeps at night,

192
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,120
I'll give it all to him.

193
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,040
Fan him until he catches a cold then.

194
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,080
You stuff it in for him.

195
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,160
Turn the cold water up higher for him.

196
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:41,960
He'll catch a cold whether he wants to or not.

197
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,120
Just pull his blanket off directly.

198
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,120
You're actually not an introvert.

199
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,760
Then why did you talk so little yesterday?

200
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,040
Take a guess.

201
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,760
She told me yesterday that you didn't talk much.

202
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,480
Yeah.

203
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,280
Both of us are still learning.

204
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,400
Learning what?

205
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,840
We were too nervous.

206
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,800
Once Wang Lechen gets comfortable,

207
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,280
all those mischievous ideas come out.

208
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:17,600
Yeah.

209
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,840
Once he gets comfortable,

210
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,120
he's a really mischievous boy.

211
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,720
A really mischievous boy.

212
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,200
It's so relaxing here.

213
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,680
Yeah, really.

214
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,720
Xu Rulan is really beautiful.

215
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,840
I've been admiring her all along.

216
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,520
Yeah.

217
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,000
She has such a great aura.

218
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,920
She has such a great aura.

219
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,080
What do you think,

220
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,840
when will our new friend arrive?

221
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,160
I think they'll be here before six.

222
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,400
Is this a loquat?

223
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,480
No, it's not. This is

224
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,320
a mango.

225
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,680
Did you notice that both of them

226
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,120
are wearing yellow clothes?

227
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:58,840
Yeah.

228
00:08:59,400 --> 00:08:59,960
They match so well.

229
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,320
Which of these fruits do you like the most?

230
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,320
Which fruit?

231
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,120
I like lychee the most.

232
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,480
What do you like best?

233
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,360
Me?

234
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,840
Blueberries.

235
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,800
And then,

236
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,440
tomatoes.

237
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,360
There are so many stories about lychees.

238
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,640
Isn't "Feizixiao" one of them too?

239
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,400
Yeah.

240
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,840
That's interesting.

241
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,360
Here, let me peel one for you.

242
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,160
Thank you.

243
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,600
He peeled it for her.

244
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,680
Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng).

245
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,880
Got it, I learned something new.

246
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:31,800
I've learned it.

247
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,840
He's just "eating melon" here.

248
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,400
But there’s still some trash left.

249
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,360
Go pick it up.

250
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,280
Let's go.

251
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,520
Feels much better.

252
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,680
What's going on?

253
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,440
Let's go.

254
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,440
Almost.

255
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,760
This is what I want to see

256
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,600
in a dating show?

257
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,800
I'm going to the restroom.

258
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,600
Are you coming?

259
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,280
No, I'm not.

260
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:17,760
Then I'll go.

261
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,480
This (phone) can take pictures from really far away.

262
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,520
Really?

263
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,120
Turn on the 10x zoom.

264
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,200
It's really clear.

265
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,480
Your hand is bleeding.

266
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,160
Yeah.

267
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,120
I got poked by your Jin Yuxing this morning.

268
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,080
What?

269
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,880
By yours.

270
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,720
By yours.

271
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,520
Why did you just pair up right away?

272
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,280
What if today I end up liking

273
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,000
that possessive lover?

274
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,600
What should I do?

275
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,000
Alright.

276
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,760
Then there won't be me.

277
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,080
Then I

278
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,960
Then maybe I can take a liking to you today too.

279
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,000
Then can I take a look at you today too?

280
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:55,920
I'm not sick.

281
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,760
I'm in great health.

282
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,760
But I feel like you

283
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,240
are still

284
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,320
the kind of

285
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,880
very quiet person.

286
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,880
I was nervous on the first day.

287
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,720
Nervous on the first day.

288
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,360
That's why

289
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,360
I was too nervous.

290
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,840
Why were you nervous?

291
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,640
Because I was surrounded by extroverts.

292
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,560
Surrounded?

293
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,400
Yeah.

294
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,600
I became your "toy."

295
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,520
What?

296
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,400
But after talking so much today,

297
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,560
I feel like you're actually quite

298
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,800
quite

299
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,880
quite an outgoing person.

300
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,880
Actually, once I get familiar, it's fine.

301
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,920
Why do I feel like Lu Yuan and Wang Lechen

302
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,560
might actually have a chance?

303
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,600
I think so too.

304
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,000
If you had talked a bit more yesterday,

305
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,560
maybe I would have invited you yesterday.

306
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,320
See?

307
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,360
I just finished saying that,

308
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,240
and right after, she said

309
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,440
Thank you.

310
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,120
You're welcome.

311
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,000
Lu Yuan and Wang Lechen

312
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,800
I think there is.

313
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,920
And mainly, she realized today

314
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,920
that Chenchen (Wang Lechen) has another side.

315
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,480
Right.

316
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,280
Jin Yuxing left.

317
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,560
She felt a bit down.

318
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,040
Then Wang Lechen

319
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,280
kept telling jokes.

320
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,080
The atmosphere lightened up.

321
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,120
Then Lu Yuan became happier.

322
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,280
And started to pay attention to him.

323
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,200
Wang Lechen told her

324
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,080
that you two are paired up.

325
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,080
When you were with Jin Yuxing,

326
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,720
she immediately said,

327
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,320
"Why are you pairing up now?"

328
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,720
Then she said she wanted to invite him.

329
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,840
But that was the next day.

330
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,240
I think having such thoughts

331
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,680
is completely normal.

332
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,120
A new friend is here.

333
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,480
It should be here.

334
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,600
Here.

335
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,600
I think I saw

336
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,400
a girl in a yellow dress.

337
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:04,920
She's here.

338
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,480
She's here.

339
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,160
These shoes...

340
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,600
These shoes...

341
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,680
Be careful.

342
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,720
Do you need me to help you?

343
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,880
Okay, thank you.

344
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,640
Hello.

345
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,200
Hello.

346
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,240
Hello.

347
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,760
There's one more.

348
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,600
There's one more.

349
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,440
Hello.

350
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,480
Let me introduce myself.

351
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,400
I'm Ruilong.

352
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,760
Hello, which "Ruilong" is that?

353
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,680
Rui...

354
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,200
Take a guess.

355
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,840
I guess it's the "Rui" from "auspicious."

356
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,680
Is that right?

357
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,520
Is that right?

358
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,000
Yes.

359
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,360
Yes.

360
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,000
My name is Wang Jue.

361
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,440
Hello.

362
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,600
Hello, Wang Jue.

363
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,160
"Jue" is the character for "king" with "jade" next to it.

364
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,080
My name is Xu Rulan.

365
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,160
Xu Rulan.

366
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,680
"Xu" is the one with the double person radical.

367
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,400
"Ru" as in "if."

368
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,360
"Lan" as in "blue."

369
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,280
That's beautiful.

370
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,280
You too.

371
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,040
Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng) looks very nervous.

372
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,480
My name is Jin Yuxing.

373
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,280
That's really golden and dazzling.

374
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,000
Shall we sit down and talk?

375
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,040
Sure.

376
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,920
Jiao Zhiheng really looks like he's come to his own home.

377
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,080
Really.

378
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,640
And Jiao Zhiheng and Xu Rulan

379
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,640
have the same color.

380
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,760
It creates

381
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,000
a barrier between them and the others.

382
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,800
My name is Jiao Zhiheng.

383
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,840
My name is a bit hard to remember.

384
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,040
You can call me Xiao Jiao.

385
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,480
"Jiao" as in "anxious."

386
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:55,800
Okay.

387
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,360
Do you want to eat?

388
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,440
Just put it in the middle.

389
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:07,960
Thank you.

390
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,080
Thank you.

391
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,280
Thank you.

392
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,040
Look.

393
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,640
Thank you.

394
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,880
He's very straightforward.

395
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,200
Who is he interested in?

396
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,520
This is when it looks the best.

397
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,240
May I ask where you are from?

398
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,240
I'm from Shanghai.

399
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,440
I'm from Shanghai.

400
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,600
Hello.

401
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,320
Hello.

402
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,120
And you are?

403
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,320
I'm a native of this island.

404
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,640
I see.

405
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,160
Really?

406
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,600
There was only one road here twenty years ago.

407
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,080
Really.

408
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,960
Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng) is a native.

409
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,720
That must be fake.

410
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,880
You believe everything people say.

411
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:55,880
It's true.

412
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,120
Back then, when I went to school,

413
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,040
there was only one school and one clinic here.

414
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,640
And then,

415
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,160
just the residential area.

416
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,520
There was nothing else.

417
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,000
Then I really believed it.

418
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,360
That's nice.

419
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,280
I really envy this kind of island life.

420
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,440
That was a very formal response.

421
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,240
I really envy this kind of island life.

422
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,960
She made her laugh.

423
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,600
Are you really not going to question it again?

424
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,920
What he just said?

425
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,200
Why?

426
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,160
Are you just going to let it go like that?

427
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,400
Because he said it so seriously.

428
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,800
No, it's just because I was worried about you all.

429
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,640
You must be tired from the journey.

430
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,560
For you all.

431
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,600
Just joking.

432
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,400
But it wasn't even funny.

433
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,480
But think about it.

434
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:43,840
Xu Rulan

435
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,080
She can understand it.

436
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,800
She can get it.

437
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,600
This from Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng)

438
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,520
and from Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong)

439
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,960
She really appreciates these kinds of jokes.

440
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,600
Yeah.

441
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,960
So you actually are

442
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,040
Actually,

443
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,680
Shanghai.

444
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,560
That place of his,

445
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,920
the food there is a bit special.

446
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,560
Guangxi.

447
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,760
How did you guess Guangxi?

448
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,880
Sichuan.

449
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,120
Sichuan.

450
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,960
Jin Yuxing's game

451
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,640
is really a black hole too.

452
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,320
You really manage to avoid

453
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,320
all the correct answers.

454
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,520
Really?

455
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,120
Yesterday, we

456
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,360
were also guessing the zodiac signs from our place.

457
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,640
We guessed all eleven,

458
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,280
and the twelfth was the right one.

459
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,680
She's amazing, when she guesses zodiac signs

460
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,480
she's almost always right.

461
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,280
Try guessing his zodiac sign.

462
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,280
Let me think.

463
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,840
Sorry, let me observe for a moment.

464
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:50,760
It's okay.

465
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,840
Because you don't talk much,

466
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,520
I can only rely on observation.

467
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,200
Oh, do zodiac signs also have certain looks?

468
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,560
That gaze is quite charming.

469
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,800
He's really nervous.

470
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,240
I guess Pisces or Scorpio.

471
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,080
One of those.

472
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,040
Scorpio.

473
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,760
Scorpio.

474
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,800
You're really amazing.

475
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,680
You're really amazing.

476
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:27,920
Lanlan (Xu Rulan)

477
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,440
How are you so good at this?

478
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,120
Is she in human resources?

479
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,480
She's pretty sharp.

480
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,720
She guesses anything

481
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,480
and is always spot on.

482
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,200
Yeah, she's amazing.

483
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,040
She really deserves a round of applause.

484
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,040
That's incredible.

485
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,600
I want to know about the other two.

486
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,720
Where are they from?

487
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,480
One is from Hangzhou.

488
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,760
And the other is also from Shanghai.

489
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,840
Can you tell us the story behind your choice?

490
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,600
There's not much to say about our choice.

491
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,680
But it formed a strong contrast with theirs.

492
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,200
So how did you choose him?

493
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,720
Exactly.

494
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,440
First, those two photos.

495
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,000
One with a toothy smile.

496
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,000
Yours.

497
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,680
The other one without a toothy smile.

498
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,080
Then, it's a spot-the-difference.

499
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:21,720
And then,

500
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:23,880
and then,

501
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,800
She's really attentive to detail.

502
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:27,760
And then,

503
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,360
Next,

504
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,160
the other guy.

505
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,720
That (love personality) type.

506
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,400
We have that (love personality) type here.

507
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,200
Who?

508
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,360
She categorized the sunny, handsome boy

509
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,640
as Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng).

510
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,120
Then you should be the friendship type.

511
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,920
How do you know?

512
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,000
I'm the friendship type, yes.

513
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,120
Actually, he told me.

514
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,800
He told me.

515
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,800
Really?

516
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,640
Really?

517
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,000
Yeah, I'm the friendship type.

518
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,960
It's Xu Rulan.

519
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,200
She easily leaves

520
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,080
a very good first impression.

521
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:11,760
Yeah.

522
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,040
Yeah.

523
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,360
Yeah.

524
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,240
Do you believe Rui Long doesn't know anything?

525
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,520
He's just "watching the drama."

526
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,520
Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng) originally

527
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,880
wanted to start a topic himself, but

528
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,160
Xu Rulan and Jin Yuxing started chatting.

529
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,280
Jin Yuxing was totally

530
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,760
Jin Yuxing was like, "Who am I?"

531
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,320
"Where am I?"

532
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:23,680
Yeah.

533
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,360
He's very shy.

534
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,160
They're here.

535
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,680
They're here.

536
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,920
Did they come?

537
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,040
Did you see them?

538
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,480
No.

539
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,000
Didn't see.

540
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,240
At this moment,

541
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,000
I need to use this (phone).

542
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,800
This can zoom in.

543
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,360
Yeah.

544
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:50,960
This can zoom in.

545
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,720
Ten times.

546
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,800
This guy is pretty handsome.

547
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,440
Look, they're so sweet.

548
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,120
They're here.

549
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,200
Let's go.

550
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,280
Put this here.

551
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,200
They came up, right?

552
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:19,720
They're here.

553
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,400
This—

554
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,440
They're here.

555
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,680
Looks good.

556
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,880
Hello.

557
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,280
They’re here.

558
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,320
They’ve already been waiting.

559
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,200
Hello.

560
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,320
Hello.

561
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,800
Hello.

562
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,080
You even brought something.

563
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,400
Yes.

564
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,160
Let’s go up and talk.

565
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,720
Hello.

566
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,160
Hello.

567
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:00,920
Let’s go up and talk.

568
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,960
I feel like the host.

569
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,560
Let’s go up and talk.

570
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,400
You are.

571
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,240
Is that so?

572
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:04,960
Don’t be like that.

573
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,320
Shall we talk inside?

574
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,440
Let’s sit at the table.

575
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,080
Okay.

576
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,640
Please have a seat.

577
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,560
Sit wherever you like.

578
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,320
Hello.

579
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,120
Hello.

580
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,360
I feel like the boys are a little awkward.

581
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,920
Let’s introduce ourselves.

582
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,400
My name is Wang Lechen.

583
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,280
The "Le" as in "happy,"

584
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,280
and the "Chen" as in "morning."

585
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,280
My full name is Ke Ailin.

586
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,760
My nickname is Duoduo.

587
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,280
My name is Lu Yuan.

588
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,600
My MBTI (16 personality types)

589
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,560
is

590
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,760
ENTJ (Commander type).

591
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,320
The two of us are exactly the same.

592
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,640
We’re exactly the same.

593
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,000
Those two like to go running at midnight.

594
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,160
Yes, like at four in the morning.

595
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,440
We all get up at 4 a.m. to do cardio on an empty stomach.

596
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,240
Do you sleep well?

597
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:01,760
No.

598
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,000
Congratulations.

599
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,640
They're right upstairs from us.

600
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,160
It's fine, by four o'clock I'm already asleep.

601
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,080
That's not necessarily true.

602
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,040
They start running at midnight.

603
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,320
It scared people.

604
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,160
Cardio on an empty stomach.

605
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,400
We have a rule here.

606
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,440
Whenever someone arrives,

607
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,640
there's a game segment for everyone.

608
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,000
It's to help everyone get to know each other faster.

609
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,520
Everyone has to do a three-minute

610
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,760
self-introduction.

611
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,080
My mind is completely blank right now.

612
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,760
I'll do it for you.

613
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,480
Then I'll start first.

614
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:45,920
Okay.

615
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,440
She's helping him with his self-introduction.

616
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,040
Um...

617
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,200
This is also a way of showing care.

618
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,800
My name is Wang Yifan.

619
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,040
You can just call me Yifan.

620
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,560
It means "smooth sailing."

621
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,480
But my "Yi" isn't that "one."

622
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,440
It's the "Yi" from "art."

623
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:06,960
Wang Yifan.

624
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,160
My name is Fang Yijiong.

625
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,640
Fang Yijiong.

626
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,040
That's right.

627
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:15,880
The "Yi" from "the more, the better".

628
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,480
The "Yi" from "the more, the better".

629
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,960
And the "Jiong" from "bright-eyed".

630
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,200
People usually call me Xiao Fang.

631
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,200
Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong).

632
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,640
And I am a

633
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,880
100% introvert.

634
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,080
And

635
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,800
usually I

636
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,680
have very few hobbies.

637
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,560
Either I'm playing badminton,

638
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,040
or on my way to play badminton.

639
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,600
That's it.

640
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,960
Please introduce your "possession".

641
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,280
Did you also choose based on love personality?

642
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,520
Did you choose us for that reason?

643
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,320
Yes, we chose based on love personality.

644
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,880
We even guessed about it yesterday.

645
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,560
We guessed it would be the two of us coming.

646
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,960
So why did you choose them?

647
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,080
For the same reason.

648
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,400
We just wanted to pick something different.

649
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:01,720
Yeah.

650
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,360
The two of us were just on the boat.

651
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,120
We ran into them.

652
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:07,960
Two boats.

653
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,000
We just passed by each other.

654
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,560
We just said a quick hello.

655
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,480
Actually, we couldn't see clearly.

656
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,520
Did you just get here?

657
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,440
Then they just left.

658
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,680
They're already gone.

659
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,200
Does it matter if it was just now or not?

660
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,120
They're already gone.

661
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:26,960
Baby.

662
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,080
They're already gone.

663
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,880
Just now or not.

664
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,240
That's so funny.

665
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,560
This girl is so cute.

666
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,120
They're already gone.

667
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:35,920
Baby.

668
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,240
It's fine if you don't take the cold medicine.

669
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,280
I want to ask.

670
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,880
Did you guys have that thing yesterday,

671
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,280
the part where you watched the sunset?

672
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,000
Send a message.

673
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,400
Yes.

674
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,040
Who was it?

675
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,600
You want to know that too?

676
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,640
No, I'm just curious.

677
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,560
Is that not okay?

678
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,600
It was someone else.

679
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,840
It was two other people.

680
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,400
Lanlan (Xu Rulan).

681
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,240
Did they catch a cold?

682
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,800
I brought cold medicine.

683
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,760
Lu Yuan.

684
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,120
It's obvious she cares.

685
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,640
about what happens with Jin Yuxing over there.

686
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,120
She's especially concerned

687
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,880
about what happens after Jin Yuxing goes over there,

688
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,640
in the world she can't see.

689
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,520
What will happen in that world.

690
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,840
Yes.

691
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,840
Let's take a break.

692
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,360
Okay.

693
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,320
What do you want to do now?

694
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,000
We

695
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,920
want to go cycling.

696
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,200
Can you ride a bike?

697
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,520
I feel like if I ride an electric bike, I'll either

698
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,800
fall into a ditch

699
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,160
or crash into someone.

700
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,760
Can you drive?

701
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,160
Yes, I can drive.

702
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,280
Okay, then the girls can drive.

703
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,000
The guys can ride bikes.

704
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,720
Actually, that's pretty fun too.

705
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,440
But, or...

706
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,800
Actually, five people can fit in one car.

707
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,560
Like this.

708
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,600
That works too.

709
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,360
If you want to ride, I can drive.

710
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,680
Then you guys...

711
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,840
I just rode.

712
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,920
Yeah, I just rode.

713
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,480
I haven't ridden yet.

714
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,640
I can drive too.

715
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,600
He wants to come back with...

716
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,880
Lanlan (Xu Rulan).

717
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,120
Then I'll drive after all.

718
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,880
Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng) right now...

719
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,920
His radar is on full blast.

720
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,440
It's fine, we'll go first.

721
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,560
Okay.

722
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,120
Let's go.

723
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,160
I'm fine with anything.

724
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,080
If Ruilong wants to ride, I can go with him.

725
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,040
Alright.

726
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:50,760
Sure.

727
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,200
Let's do that.

728
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,040
Let's go.

729
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,560
Let's go.

730
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,520
That's hilarious.

731
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,800
I like riding bikes.

732
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,360
No, I won't ride anymore.

733
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,040
True.

734
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,520
We're here for romance.

735
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,120
Let's just get in the car.

736
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:03,760
You go first.

737
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,320
Thank you for your hard work.

738
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,320
You could have

739
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,840
ridden (the bike) yourself.

740
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:20,800
It's fine.

741
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,040
Are you guys a little cold?

742
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,440
A little bit.

743
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,000
It's a bit chilly.

744
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,440
Let's turn up the heat on the AC.

745
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,160
That's so thoughtful.

746
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,320
How do you fasten this?

747
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,920
These two are so cute.

748
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,880
This one is really easy to ride.

749
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:44,560
Yeah.

750
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,680
Especially on that kind of island.

751
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,680
And then

752
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,240
These two look no older than three.

753
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,160
So excited.

754
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,440
We get to ride the little e-scooter again.

755
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,280
Did you guys ride too?

756
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,560
Did you ride?

757
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,200
We didn't.

758
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,400
We don't have little e-scooters over there.

759
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,560
It just feels like I can experience

760
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,440
that sense of speeding through the wind again.

761
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,600
Let's go.

762
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,320
You guys go first.

763
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,600
We'll follow you.

764
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,200
Okay.

765
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,800
Riding the little e-scooter really does give

766
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,160
that feeling of setting off.

767
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,560
Isn't this one a bit too slow?

768
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,520
This is way too slow.

769
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,480
It might have a speed limit.

770
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,280
This is five kilometers per hour.

771
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,240
I see the sun.

772
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,800
Just now, Wang Jue and I

773
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,360
were talking on our way up the mountain

774
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,040
about how nice it would be to ride a bike up here.

775
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,680
I didn't expect we'd actually be riding e-bikes now.

776
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,600
Those two look so cool.

777
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,400
Hello!

778
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,720
We're about to pass you!

779
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,040
You guys—

780
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,440
You must be the fastest.

781
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,960
We'll try to keep up.

782
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,920
This is so beautiful.

783
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,720
They're having so much fun.

784
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,880
Everyone's getting into it.

785
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,920
Those two are having a blast.

786
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,640
The lake has that look we talked about yesterday—

787
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,600
shimmering and sparkling.

788
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,600
Yeah.

789
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,080
It's so pretty.

790
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:33,960
Let me record a video for you.

791
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,360
What are you laughing at?

792
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,120
This sunset is truly beautiful.

793
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,640
It's gorgeous.

794
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,120
Feels like we're chasing the sunset.

795
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,760
The sun is about to set.

796
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,280
Speed up!

797
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,160
So full of youth.

798
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,400
This is wonderful.

799
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,240
So beautiful.

800
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,720
I want to take a screenshot of this scene.

801
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,560
We're here.

802
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:16,960
Are you guys cold?

803
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,000
We're already so cold that

804
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,160
when the wind blows, it actually feels warm.

805
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,600
If you're cold, there are still blankets.

806
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,040
It's okay for now.

807
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,520
The sun has set.

808
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,240
Only more than half is left.

809
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,640
Let's catch the last bit of it.

810
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,880
We made it just in time for the sunset.

811
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,760
Actually, the spot we were just at was really beautiful.

812
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,280
Because there's a small island there.

813
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:47,920
And then

814
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:48,920
the sun

815
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,880
the setting sun's

816
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,560
refracted light

817
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,480
shines over like this

818
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,040
it feels really special

819
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,200
So just now, did you

820
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,200
see that scenery along the way?

821
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:58,600
That one,

822
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,640
yes

823
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,440
the light shining on

824
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,480
the sparkling surface of the water

825
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,760
Yeah, it really feels like that

826
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,400
It's beautiful

827
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,240
Now the evening glow

828
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,160
makes all your faces

829
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,360
a little bit pink

830
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:12,880
Really?

831
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,280
Yeah

832
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,000
You too

833
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,560
Really?

834
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,600
I can't see myself

835
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:18,960
It looks pretty good

836
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:19,920
Thank you

837
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,800
I think she looks especially beautiful

838
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,440
So beautiful

839
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,000
It's gorgeous

840
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,000
So pretty

841
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,720
It's gorgeous

842
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,360
So beautiful

843
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,560
Very pretty

844
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,800
You're very pretty too

845
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,800
The sunset is beautiful too

846
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,040
In my eyes, you are too

847
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,040
Thank you

848
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,640
Who's taking pictures in the back?

849
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,360
Wang Lechen

850
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,200
Like

851
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,840
He's amazing.

852
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,240
I'll take a silhouette photo of you.

853
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,760
Even his silhouette looks so precise.

854
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,360
Right?

855
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,160
That silhouette is so precise, don't you think?

856
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:10,440
Like this.

857
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:11,800
That silhouette.

858
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,280
It looks like it was cut out of paper.

859
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,400
Famous historical tower.

860
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,640
Huaniao Lighthouse.

861
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,200
It lights up at night, right?

862
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,000
Yes, it lights up at 6:30.

863
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,080
Do you want to take a photo?

864
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,320
Do you want to take a photo?

865
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:26,920
Yes.

866
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,840
Let's see how good his photography skills are.

867
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,760
You want it all in black?

868
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,360
Yes.

869
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,240
Just take a profile shot.

870
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:33,960
Okay.

871
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,720
Absolutely beautiful.

872
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,760
What are those two doing? They're so slow.

873
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,840
Their little world of two is over.

874
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:02,760
We can go up.

875
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,040
We can go up.

876
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,720
Yes, you can go up inside.

877
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,240
Let's go.

878
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,080
Let's go.

879
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,560
So beautiful.

880
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,560
It's really beautiful.

881
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,440
It's so pretty.

882
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,600
Super beautiful.

883
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,320
You can take photos now.

884
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,000
Yes.

885
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:22,920
Phone.

886
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,520
So beautiful.

887
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,160
Let me take a picture of you.

888
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,080
You look great right now.

889
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:32,760
Come on.

890
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,400
Three, two, one.

891
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,680
You look amazing.

892
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,720
So good-looking.

893
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,800
You all look so handsome and beautiful.

894
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,240
How are you all so good-looking?

895
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:41,880
"Help!"

896
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,680
You have no idea how good you look.

897
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,160
Do you know?

898
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,160
We really don't know.

899
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,160
Yeah, show us in a bit.

900
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,600
You can't see the sunlight in a selfie.

901
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,600
I'll go over and take a picture for you.

902
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,360
Come on.

903
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,400
Okay.

904
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,040
Let me try.

905
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,120
Let's see just how good it looks.

906
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,960
It's so dark, what can you even see?

907
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,200
Amazing

908
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:12,840
Hurry

909
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,280
It's locked onto the face

910
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:14,880
So bright

911
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,320
Three, two

912
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,280
One

913
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,280
So beautiful

914
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,000
Looks great

915
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,560
He's really skilled

916
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,040
Awesome

917
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,360
He really knows how to take photos

918
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,280
His photos are pretty good

919
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,000
How about we take a selfie?

920
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,080
Let's take a selfie then

921
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,240
I'll be here, the girls in the back

922
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,160
Okay

923
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:31,880
Sure

924
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,920
Ready, three, two, one

925
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,240
Got it

926
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,640
I'll send it to everyone later

927
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,000
Done

928
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,680
You're amazing

929
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,640
That shot just now looked great too

930
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,520
So beautiful, I wish I could see this every day

931
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,560
I want to take a selfie

932
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,480
This one's good

933
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:46,920
Can you see?

934
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,120
Three, two

935
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,800
So beautiful

936
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,080
This one's good, looks great

937
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,800
Play the background music

938
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,040
Ten years ago, I didn't know you

939
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,160
I feel like I'm on vacation

940
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,200
Really

941
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,240
We're such a curious group

942
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,360
Such a magical feeling

943
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,160
Don't you think this moment

944
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,920
really has that vibe?

945
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,720
So happy

946
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,640
So excited

947
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,520
That's wonderful.

948
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,960
Everyone can share

949
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,920
our experiences from the second day

950
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,080
and the signals and feelings from island life.

951
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,840
Did anyone notice

952
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,480
any small sparks

953
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,240
or a little flutter of excitement?

954
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,400
First, Jiao Zhiheng

955
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,040
towards Xu Rulan

956
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,840
is very obvious.

957
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:38,640
He cares a lot.

958
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,600
And about Jin Yuxing's arrival,

959
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,360
he's very alert.

960
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,000
That's jealousy.

961
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,320
That little stubborn vibe.

962
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,960
Actually, Xu Rulan hasn't really

963
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,240
shown herself to anyone in particular yet.

964
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,520
So she's someone who needs a sense of distance.

965
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,400
So I think

966
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,000
Jiao Zhiheng

967
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,800
when it comes to Xu Rulan,

968
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,120
might come across as a bit intense.

969
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,760
But if it's someone

970
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,400
who really wants to be surrounded by love,

971
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,600
he might win her over quickly.

972
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,680
But for Xu Rulan,

973
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,600
she naturally keeps her distance

974
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,800
and is someone who observes others a lot.

975
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,680
So I think it's better to slow down a bit

976
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,920
when approaching Xu Rulan.

977
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:13,760
Yes, but I

978
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,600
I think so too

979
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,080
Xu Rulan is also someone who easily gives off

980
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,680
a comfortable feeling to others

981
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,120
For example, her gaze

982
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,080
She will look at you

983
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:21,960
very firmly

984
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,280
Because she is

985
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,600
a very confident woman

986
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,200
Yes

987
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,760
She looks very gentle

988
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,680
not aggressive at all

989
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,480
But in reality

990
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,080
her judgment and observation of people

991
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,960
are both accurate and sharp

992
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,320
She is good at making everyone

993
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,240
around her feel comfortable

994
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:35,920
Inside, she is probably

995
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,560
a rather mature

996
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,800
and also determined

997
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,160
person with her own

998
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,120
thoughts and ideas

999
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,480
Yes

1000
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,960
I think among them

1001
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,760
the one I’m most curious about is Lu Yuan

1002
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,400
Because on one hand

1003
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,200
she obviously cares about Jin Yuxing

1004
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,360
and what’s happening with him over there

1005
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,120
Who watched the sunrise over there

1006
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,280
and how things are going

1007
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,280
She’s especially concerned

1008
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,000
about what will happen after Jin Yuxing gets there

1009
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,920
in that world she can’t see

1010
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,880
what will happen

1011
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,680
But at the same time, she goes to talk to Wang Lechen

1012
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,120
leaving a bit of possibility

1013
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,080
I don’t know either

1014
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,080
She was just joking with Wang Lechen.

1015
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,280
Those were just pure jokes.

1016
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,120
Only close friends would say things like that.

1017
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,280
It wouldn't happen that quickly.

1018
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,480
Why would she...

1019
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,800
be genuinely interested in Jin Yuxing?

1020
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,000
Because she doesn't talk about this kind of thing openly.

1021
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,680
If she can say it to Wang Lechen,

1022
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,040
it means she doesn't really care.

1023
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,400
I understand, you think it's just friends teasing each other.

1024
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,520
Because they're close too.

1025
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,400
I think between her and Wang Lechen,

1026
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,680
it's probably still about Jin Yuxing, to be honest.

1027
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,000
That's why I told you

1028
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,320
you're overthinking it.

1029
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,400
You're reading too much into it.

1030
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,440
I'm no longer that person

1031
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,800
who believes everything you say.

1032
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:33,880
Alright.

1033
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,760
You've grown up.

1034
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,320
The child has grown up.

1035
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,200
Okay.

1036
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,480
Anyway,

1037
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:39,920
It's just that

1038
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,320
Actually, both Xu Rulan and Wang Lechen are

1039
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,240
very good at making a great first impression.

1040
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,240
Yeah.

1041
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,040
But I guess

1042
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:46,680
just like you said,

1043
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,600
Chenchen (Wang Lechen) is someone who really knows how to

1044
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,600
get along with the opposite sex.

1045
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,400
So maybe

1046
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,480
in the end, he might also feel

1047
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,400
that he's like this with everyone.

1048
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,080
He really is good at getting along with people.

1049
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:56,960
Especially with girls.

1050
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,720
That's something I really envy.

1051
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,600
But I think someone like Wang Lechen,

1052
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,760
it depends on whether he focuses on the early stage or the later stage.

1053
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:02,960
Because in the beginning,

1054
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,560
he'll definitely interact very gently

1055
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,640
and communicate with everyone.

1056
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,360
Then it depends on how he acts when it's time to make a move later on.

1057
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,280
How much effort he puts in.

1058
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,280
This time,

1059
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,840
the way we started the trip

1060
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,360
is actually

1061
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,840
very interesting and unique.

1062
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,800
Compared to our previous

1063
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,160
"Signal of the Heart" seasons,

1064
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,520
this is a brand new attempt.

1065
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,480
And I think during this process,

1066
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,440
it really can

1067
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,040
bring

1068
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,680
people closer together.

1069
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,360
Yes.

1070
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,880
Watching this makes me want to travel too.

1071
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:28,720
Indeed, this time

1072
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,400
it truly feels like a travel-style romance.

1073
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,640
So, this time,

1074
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,800
the opening trip can be considered

1075
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,560
a great success.

1076
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,000
So far,

1077
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,800
not everyone has met or gathered together yet.

1078
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,600
When will they finally meet each other?

1079
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,600
Thanks to Master Kong Jasmine Tea

1080
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,520
for their

1081
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,240
strong support of our show.

1082
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,840
Let’s look forward

1083
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,720
and watch together

1084
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,720
the first episode.
