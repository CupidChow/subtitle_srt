1
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:20,880
I asked him if he was happy.

2
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,360
He said my company wasn't great.

3
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,840
That's so funny.

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,360
Dr. Fang's interpretation is also hilarious.

5
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,680
Can I ask that question?

6
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,120
The one from the dinner.

7
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,200
Go ahead.

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,640
Your "what" tonight?

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:39,640
"What," right?

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,160
Yeah.

11
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,440
So "naughty."

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,800
So exciting.

13
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:47,960
It says—

14
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,760
Come on, Jue.

15
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,760
How about we set a rule—

16
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,600
Everyone can only flip

17
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,440
the red ones (Heartthrob and Interaction sections).

18
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,400
Sure.

19
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,360
Sounds fun.

20
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,160
Just the first two (Heartthrob and Interaction).

21
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,280
Wow, why does it fit so well?

22
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,000
Then let's just flip Heartthrob.

23
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,800
This is the answer I gave before.

24
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,520
This is Chichi's answer.

25
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,800
Chichi's answer.

26
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,080
So deep.

27
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,240
A bit too deep, I don't get it.

28
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,480
Give it to Zihan.

29
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,320
True.

30
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,280
Go ahead.

31
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:23,840
Here we go.

32
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,560
You choose.

33
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,280
I pick Heartthrob.

34
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,400
Heartthrob.

35
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,600
I feel like I've answered this before.

36
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,840
So many times.

37
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,560
Yeah, we talked about it back then.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,720
Calm down.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,480
Calm down.

40
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,680
Makes so much sense.

41
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,600
So accurate.

42
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,480
I pick Heartthrob.

43
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,640
Heartthrob.

44
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,640
Also very fitting.

45
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,360
Also spot on.

46
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,040
So precise.

47
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,080
I want to ask you.

48
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,680
Great question.

49
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,000
Keep trying.

50
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,520
That's spot on.

51
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,600
Heading back.

52
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,760
Heading back.

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,160
Going to the cabin.

54
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:06,920
Yeah.

55
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,560
When I first borrowed this car,

56
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,240
I was wondering

57
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,320
if this car

58
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,600
would be slower than riding a bike.

59
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,280
But then I thought, it doesn't matter.

60
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,800
And tonight is pretty warm.

61
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,320
I think today's temperature

62
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,680
is higher than the past few days.

63
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,280
Yeah.

64
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,200
When you came back from Shanghai last night,

65
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,280
did you see the sunset?

66
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,120
I saw it today.

67
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,960
I saw it today too.

68
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,000
It's been there every day lately.

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,560
Yeah.

70
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,400
It's beautiful.

71
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:34,960
And I noticed

72
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,360
it's getting dark later and later now.

73
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,960
Because Summer Solstice is coming.

74
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,680
Actually, I had something else yesterday.

75
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,600
I wanted

76
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,480
to invite you to do something.

77
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:43,920
But

78
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,320
you said

79
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,280
maybe there wasn't enough time.

80
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,600
Because yesterday was Mangzhong, right?

81
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,960
I looked up all the customs of the 24 solar terms.

82
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,160
I went through all of them.

83
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,680
Then I found

84
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,360
there were many things people did in ancient times.

85
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,360
For example, during Mangzhong,

86
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,440
people would cook green plums.

87
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,960
and send off the Flower Goddess.

88
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:04,680
Yesterday,

89
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,720
I actually wanted

90
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,080
to take you to send off the Flower Goddess.

91
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,000
And it's really simple.

92
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,760
Back in ancient times,

93
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,920
people believed that on Mangzhong

94
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,440
since Summer Solstice was coming soon,

95
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,680
the flowers would start to wilt.

96
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:17,720
So,

97
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,320
sending off the Flower Goddess means

98
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,040
basically

99
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,760
sending the Flower Goddess away.

100
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,520
Seeing her off.

101
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,120
Yeah.

102
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,400
And in ancient times,

103
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,600
they would wrap ribbons

104
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,280
or make little horses

105
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,800
or small sedan chair toys,

106
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
and hang them on trees or flowers.

107
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,920
Every night after dinner,

108
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,560
I get hungry again soon.

109
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,880
Then when I get back,

110
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,880
I always eat the snacks you bought for me.

111
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,160
If I get fat, it's your fault.

112
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,520
It's your fault.

113
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,320
Alright.

114
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,320
We're here.

115
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,160
On the first day, you told me

116
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,440
about "Me Before You".

117
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,840
You went to watch it.

118
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,400
After leaving the island, I watched it.

119
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,920
Did you like it?

120
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,160
I thought it was great, and I think

121
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,880
I really like it

122
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,080
for the message it conveys,

123
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,960
you could call it values,

124
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,920
or maybe

125
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,440
a way people relate to each other.

126
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,360
Maybe

127
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,040
people are

128
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,280
meant to be independent and free.

129
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,520
Liking someone means

130
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,560
I hope she can

131
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,240
be braver and more independent,

132
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,360
and pursue her own freedom.

133
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,320
I really agree with that.

134
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,560
So I bought the original book.

135
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,240
The book? Really?

136
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,040
Yeah, the English original.

137
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,000
I have to thank you

138
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,360
for recommending this movie.

139
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,600
Actually, I thought of something else today.

140
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,520
It just came to me.

141
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:57,880
Just the two of us.

142
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,600
We talked a lot about zodiac signs on the first day.

143
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,160
And then,

144
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,240
I feel like you really know a lot about zodiac signs.

145
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,080
Yeah.

146
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,800
It's just...

147
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:11,720
Just...

148
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,680
Even though tonight

149
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,560
maybe

150
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,520
we can't see many stars,

151
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,960
there's a way—

152
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,520
using a phone.

153
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,000
Yeah.

154
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,120
The moon was just in that spot.

155
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,760
Do you remember?

156
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,800
I remember.

157
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,320
Yeah, so after you moved over,

158
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,400
it was really here.

159
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,840
So where is Cancer?

160
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,720
Let me find it for you.

161
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,440
There's a way to find Cancer.

162
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,640
What's the sun sign for today's date?

163
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,640
Now it's Gemini.

164
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,520
Right, it's Gemini now.

165
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,400
So you can turn,

166
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,440
and follow the direction of the sun.

167
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,800
Then we move to the right.

168
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,520
It gradually moves in that direction.

169
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,200
And at this point,

170
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,320
Gemini appears.

171
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,640
Yeah, then if you go further,

172
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,240
Cancer is right after Gemini.

173
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,880
So you can

174
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,560
Cancer is actually a bit lower.

175
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,120
Yeah, I’m not sure if you can see it.

176
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,920
There's a crab shape.

177
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,920
I see it.

178
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,240
Yeah, it's like it's in the sea.

179
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,120
In the sea.

180
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,920
Right.

181
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:15,880
It's just

182
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,520
very fitting for a crab.

183
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,400
And at this moment,

184
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,200
the moon is right here, isn’t it?

185
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,240
Then we can look

186
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,600
at what sign is behind it.

187
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,600
Is that Virgo?

188
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,200
Yeah, it could be.

189
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,960
For example, someone born at this point

190
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,000
would have Gemini sun,

191
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,920
Virgo moon,

192
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,720
that's how it works.

193
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,480
Then we can look for

194
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,000
for example,

195
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,400
Let me select Venus first.

196
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,640
Then,

197
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,880
Venus is near Pisces,

198
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,840
or Aries.

199
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,080
So someone born at this point

200
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,040
would have Venus in Pisces.

201
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,000
Yes.

202
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,560
Their sun and moon are Pisces.

203
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:54,920
That's how

204
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,800
Venus is determined.

205
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,880
So that's how it works.

206
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,760
Right.

207
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,760
Actually, when I didn’t understand astrology before,

208
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,720
I only knew this part.

209
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,760
I always

210
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,120
would look at the stars at night

211
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,920
and do it this way.

212
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,520
So you actually know more about astrology than I do.

213
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,160
No, I might

214
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,960
Maybe we need to complement each other.

215
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,560
I only know a little.

216
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,080
I especially love finding Orion in the sky.

217
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,880
Why?

218
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,240
Because

219
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,440
Orion is right next to the Milky Way.

220
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,960
Near Orion,

221
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,280
there are Altair and Vega.

222
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,560
So where are they now?

223
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,720
Here's a question.

224
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,800
Orion is

225
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,720
below the ground right now.

226
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,000
On the other side of the Earth.

227
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,400
In this direction, maybe

228
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,360
Where is that?

229
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,520
Towards Brazil or Argentina.

230
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,320
They might see it at night.

231
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:58,800
Because in the Southern Hemisphere,

232
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,200
the seasons are opposite to ours.

233
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,640
What does it look like?

234
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,360
Let me tell you.

235
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,000
Go ahead.

236
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,640
And this year,

237
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,280
you might get a chance to see it.

238
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,800
I'll just treat this as a star.

239
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,840
Anyway, it's something.

240
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,280
Its biggest feature is

241
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,200
the three dots in the middle

242
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,400
are lined up in a straight line.

243
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,400
There are two small ones on each side.

244
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,320
So when you are

245
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,000
under the winter night sky,

246
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,480
if you find three

247
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:32,960
you can almost

248
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,120
bright stars in a straight line,

249
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,160
then look to both sides,

250
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,120
if there are two symmetrical dots,

251
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,080
that's Orion.

252
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,080
So just look for a line

253
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,960
of three stars connected like this.

254
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,400
Right, because on a clear night

255
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,600
there are lots of stars.

256
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,520
Many constellations overlap.

257
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,400
Sometimes Cancer's head

258
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,080
connects to Gemini's tail.

259
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,520
They share a star.

260
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,600
So in winter,

261
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,720
it's easier to find.

262
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,600
The winter night sky.

263
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,880
And in the northeast,

264
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,360
we can go see Orion together then.

265
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,280
Sure.

266
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,960
During this time, whether it's the girls

267
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,760
or the guys,

268
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,480
everyone has some questions

269
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,640
and some curiosity.

270
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,080
So,

271
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,680
today we have a chance

272
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,480
for the guys

273
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,720
to represent your friends

274
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,880
and ask the girls

275
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,520
a question you're curious about.

276
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,960
The person you invite and the question

277
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,440
can't be repeated.

278
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,280
And guys,

279
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,360
you have to rely on your understanding of him

280
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,040
to make a judgment.

281
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,000
Guess which girl he's curious about.

282
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:00,520
And

283
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,200
no eye contact allowed.

284
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,840
No eye contact.

285
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,600
No.

286
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,600
No pointing with your nose.

287
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,760
Draw a question.

288
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,520
Okay.

289
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,920
No talking.

290
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,400
Okay.

291
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,440
So, who is interested?

292
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,440
Draw a question card.

293
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,320
Draw a card, it's fine.

294
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,960
I'll do it.

295
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,240
You do it.

296
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,600
You do it.

297
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,720
Brave.

298
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,840
So fast? Not you, bro.

299
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,440
Not you, bro. Right.

300
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,840
Which girl do you want to invite

301
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,000
to answer this question?

302
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,160
I'll ask Duoduo.

303
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,640
Pick a question first.

304
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,080
If the guy you like gets a full score of ten,

305
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,480
how many points would you give my friend?

306
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,400
Full score is ten.

307
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,040
Right.

308
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,480
I would give

309
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,280
Then I would give

310
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,800
seven points.

311
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,240
Can I ask why?

312
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:31,600
No.

313
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,200
Yes.

314
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,960
Why?

315
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,040
But it's up to her to answer or not.

316
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,400
Okay.

317
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,560
I think we

318
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,200
haven't spent much time alone together.

319
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,600
Actually, not very much.

320
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,840
Right, my personality also needs

321
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,840
to get to know someone slowly.

322
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,600
I'm the observant type.

323
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,120
Right.

324
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,760
Thank you.

325
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,320
Let her observe more.

326
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:49,840
Be more proactive.

327
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,360
Be more proactive.

328
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,480
Who else?

329
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,520
I'll ask.

330
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:00,960
Okay.

331
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,160
Up to today,

332
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,120
in your time living in the apartment with my friend,

333
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,240
what's the most memorable moment?

334
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,960
That's a great question.

335
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,640
Ask.

336
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,640
Ask Xiaoyuan.

337
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,120
Xiaoyuan.

338
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,840
The most memorable moment.

339
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,840
So many scenes in my mind.

340
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,920
It should be

341
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:50,960
I can't think of anything

342
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,800
Let me think

343
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,040
In

344
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,640
cooking in the kitchen

345
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,600
You must have cooked with many people

346
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,920
You're so annoying

347
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,000
So how do you think his cooking is?

348
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:06,960
It's delicious

349
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,040
Really tasty

350
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,400
I'm so jealous of you guys

351
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,400
I've hung out with him for over ten years

352
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,640
I've never gotten to try his cooking

353
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:17,880
I'll do it

354
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,160
Do you know who you'll invite later?

355
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,680
More or less

356
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,200
Yuxing's expression

357
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,720
Yuxing asks, "Do you really know?"

358
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,320
Which girl do you want to invite?

359
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,720
to answer this question

360
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,000
Lanlan

361
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,360
Yuxing

362
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:02,800
Yuxing

363
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,520
Use three words to describe

364
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,080
how my friend feels right now

365
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,000
I think

366
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,680
Yuxing

367
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,160
funny, mature, and very hardworking

368
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,080
very hardworking

369
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,120
funny, mature, hardworking

370
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,520
I don't know you well yet

371
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,720
Come on, raise your hand

372
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,200
They're already being proactive over there

373
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,000
Here we go

374
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,320
Who do you want to invite

375
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,320
which girl to answer the question?

376
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,760
Chichi

377
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,160
Okay

378
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,840
The question is

379
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,760
What's your impression of my friend?

380
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,560
My impression is that he's passionate

381
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,720
and funny

382
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,520
Anyone else want to ask a question?

383
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,520
So fast

384
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,680
That's great

385
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,240
Didn't expect your friend to be so bold, right?

386
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,920
Can I choose the same person again?

387
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,440
You want to pick the same person

388
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,160
But you can't now

389
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,440
Then you should've been braver earlier

390
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,560
Should've gone first

391
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,920
Then I'll pick the girl on the far right

392
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,320
Yes

393
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:01,880
Wang Jue

394
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,280
That's right

395
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:02,880
Okay

396
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,480
Please choose one

397
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,040
very proactive, proactive

398
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,040
passive, too passive

399
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,880
one word from these

400
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,240
to describe my friend's current state

401
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,920
I think it's proactive

402
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,200
Baby, am I proactive or not?

403
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,160
So-so

404
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,480
That was sudden

405
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,200
What about my question?

406
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,280
Baby

407
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,840
So sweet

408
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,120
The last one is here

409
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,720
Draw it yourself

410
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,920
Who do you want to invite to answer this question?

411
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,200
The girl who hasn't come

412
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:51,840
Alright

413
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,640
Since Yifan isn't here

414
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,360
you can invite anyone

415
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,400
any girl to answer

416
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,760
So you can actually pick the last one

417
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,040
What's the name of the one in the middle?

418
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,680
No talking allowed

419
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,800
I heard that, no talking allowed

420
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,320
I heard it

421
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,120
That's against the rules

422
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,480
I heard someone say the middle one

423
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,640
Chichi

424
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,120
That's interesting

425
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,720
The guy you've interacted with the most so far

426
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,520
The guy you've interacted with the most so far

427
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,280
Is it my friend?

428
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,480
Is he the one you've interacted with the most?

429
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:02,960
The question is

430
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,520
Yes

431
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,560
No

432
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,720
Then I really want to know who you've interacted with the most

433
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,640
Who is it?

434
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,880
So exciting and intense.

435
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,840
This round of questions.

436
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,960
Alright.

437
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,560
So,

438
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,480
Next is our group photo session.

439
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,600
"Heartthrob Photo"

440
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,280
For this round,

441
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,200
We'll first invite all the guys

442
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,000
to play "Black and White".

443
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,680
to decide the order from one to six.

444
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,240
Guys,

445
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,280
please follow the order.

446
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,080
Invite a female guest.

447
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,400
to take a photo with you.

448
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,080
As for the photo pose,

449
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,680
I have it here.

450
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,640
It's already prepared.

451
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,280
Alright, everyone please step forward.

452
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,400
Let's decide the order.

453
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,960
Okay, let's begin.

454
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,680
Black and White.

455
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,000
Alright, Black and White.

456
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,440
I'm first, right?

457
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,000
Zi Han is first.

458
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,440
Zi Han is first.

459
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,440
Let's play Black and White.

460
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,000
Black and White.

461
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,240
Got it.

462
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:26,760
I'm second.

463
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:27,800
Rui Long is second.

464
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,080
Rui Long.

465
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,400
Okay.

466
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,040
Come on.

467
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,440
Black and White.

468
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,560
Jiao Zhiheng is third. Come on.

469
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,600
Black and White.

470
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,680
Alright, Yu Xing is fourth.

471
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,040
Let's play Rock-Paper-Scissors.

472
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,040
Right, you two will compete

473
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,920
to see whose friend

474
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,320
can invite anyone.

475
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,040
Even female guests invited before.

476
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:02,920
If you lose, you can still invite.

477
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,320
Okay, Rock-Paper-

478
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,600
Alright, Rock-Paper-Scissors.

479
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,360
Scissors.

480
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,880
Le Chen.

481
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,760
Sixth group, that's right.

482
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,760
Alright, so we

483
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,200
First place goes to

484
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,080
Liu Zihan's friend.

485
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,400
Looks like luck isn't on my side today.

486
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,920
Seriously, luck isn't with me.

487
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,160
Come on.

488
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,840
Which girl do you want to help him invite?

489
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,680
Which girl do you want to invite?

490
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,520
They're starting to communicate with their eyes.

491
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,120
Based on what you know about him,

492
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,640
Take a guess.

493
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,520
Chichi.

494
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,040
Chichi.

495
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,200
Alright.

496
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,240
Okay.

497
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,680
You can pick a pose for your friend first.

498
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,680
Choose a pose (photo).

499
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,640
Here, this is the first one.

500
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:08,920
This one.

501
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,640
Okay, second one.

502
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,720
Third one.

503
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,040
What's with the first one?

504
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,920
I'm just asking.

505
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,800
They're all pretty abstract.

506
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,800
What's the first one?

507
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,520
This is really popular now.

508
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,520
This photo style is trending lately.

509
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,600
This one.

510
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,680
This one's so abstract.

511
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,880
Kind of really abstract.

512
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,480
It's hilarious.

513
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,920
"Help!"

514
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:23,760
Let's go with this one.

515
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,480
This one.

516
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,120
Okay.

517
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,360
So Zihan's friend picked this one.

518
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:28,720
So Zihan's friend chose this one.

519
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,400
The most normal one.

520
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
And second place just now was

521
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,760
Here.

522
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,120
Alright.

523
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:34,680
Come on.

524
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,920
Who do you want to invite for Ruilong?

525
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,520
Pick someone? I'll choose Wang Jue.

526
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,880
Wang Jue, okay.

527
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,600
Ruilong invites Wang Jue.

528
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:45,560
Alright then.

529
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,320
Let's pick a photo.

530
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,960
This is tough.

531
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,120
You guys really picked the most normal one.

532
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:55,680
Yeah.

533
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,520
Simple.

534
00:23:59,080 --> 00:23:59,560
This one.

535
00:23:59,560 --> 00:23:59,960
This one's alright.

536
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,560
Yeah, this one's fine.

537
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,560
Okay.

538
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,560
Alright.

539
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,640
Teacher Jiao.

540
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,400
Which girl do you want to invite for Xiao Jiao?

541
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,240
Invite Lanlan.

542
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,280
Lanlan.

543
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,640
At least I can help you pick the pose.

544
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,000
Here, let me pick a pose (photo) for you.

545
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,560
It's actually a bit tricky.

546
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,160
Take a look.

547
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,960
Pick this one, make it harder for him.

548
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:32,800
What?

549
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:33,760
Alright.

550
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,200
Okay.

551
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:45,480
Alright.

552
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,080
Yuxing's friend.

553
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,120
Who do you want to invite for Yuxing?

554
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,560
Which girl do you want to invite?

555
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,760
(Choose) Xiaoyuan

556
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,480
Xiaoyuan, okay.

557
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,920
Let's have Xiaoyuan go first.

558
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:03,960
Okay.

559
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:05,600
Come on.

560
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,520
What's this?

561
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,640
Then I'll choose this one.

562
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,720
This one.

563
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,360
Not bad.

564
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:15,920
Okay.

565
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,600
This one's fine.

566
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,240
Pretty good.

567
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,440
It's okay.

568
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,400
Seems normal.

569
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,200
Seems normal.

570
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,000
Have you watched Dragon Ball?

571
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,000
I've seen a bit.

572
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:25,560
What's up?

573
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,200
Goku in it seems to have two sons.

574
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,480
They can fuse like this.

575
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:29,720
What the heck?

576
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,680
Dr. Fang's friend.

577
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,440
Which girl do you want to invite for your buddy?

578
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,280
This one.

579
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:38,360
Okay.

580
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:38,800
Duoduo.

581
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,840
Alright, so Dr. Fang's friend

582
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,640
will invite

583
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,000
Duoduo.

584
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,040
Come on.

585
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,240
So what's your range of choices?

586
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,240
Kind of, kind of not.

587
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,440
Which one do you like?

588
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,040
You pick.

589
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,720
Honestly, I can't even tell.

590
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,920
This is back-to-back.

591
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,280
Back-to-back.

592
00:25:59,280 --> 00:25:59,840
Yeah, keep it simple.

593
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,640
Back-to-back.

594
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,320
Alright, so your choice is

595
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,560
Back-to-back.

596
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,200
Done.

597
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,320
So,

598
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,720
Lechen's friend.

599
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,280
You don't have a range of photos to choose from.

600
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,080
But you can think about it.

601
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,840
For your friend Lechen,

602
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,200
which girl will you invite?

603
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,080
Duoduo

604
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,040
Okay

605
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,360
So, Lechen's friend,

606
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,560
Duoduo is the one invited for Lechen.

607
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,640
As for this photo,

608
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,760
They left me the two most abstract photos.

609
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,760
Perfect for abstract me.

610
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,760
Shouldn't have picked just now.

611
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,520
They're all yours.

612
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,680
Yeah, I really did.

613
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,360
Still couldn't avoid it.

614
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:52,920
Can't escape it.

615
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,680
Not bad.

616
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,200
"Help!"

617
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:57,520
Alright.

618
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,320
So both the guys and girls have

619
00:26:59,320 --> 00:26:59,960
successfully formed teams.

620
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:04,680
So next,

621
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,040
So next,

622
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,520
let's

623
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,360
go in order.

624
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,880
I'll go first.

625
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,840
Yeah, Zihan and Chichi.

626
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,360
You need to stand on tiptoe for this.

627
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,760
Stand on tiptoe.

628
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,800
So precise.

629
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,800
Come on, you take their photo.

630
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,200
Isn't it like this?

631
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,520
I'm on the left.

632
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,800
You're the smart one.

633
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,040
Yeah.

634
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,640
Alright, give this to me.

635
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,280
Yeah.

636
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,440
Look at me.

637
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,800
You need to stand on tiptoe.

638
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,440
Tiptoe.

639
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,120
You're so meticulous.

640
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,280
You're so meticulous.

641
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,560
Okay, three, two, one.

642
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,360
Looks pretty similar.

643
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,000
Right?

644
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,600
You could say it's identical.

645
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,320
Nice, theirs is pretty good.

646
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,160
Our pose is really simple.

647
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:00,880
Yeah.

648
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,200
Let's show everyone how it's done.

649
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,120
Good example, not bad.

650
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,640
It actually looks great.

651
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,240
Let's take a look.

652
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,240
How can we make it look good?

653
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,840
But ours is hard to make look good.

654
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,520
Then,

655
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,560
I think it's like this.

656
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,440
See if this is right.

657
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,640
I'll use my right hand

658
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,320
and try to lift you up.

659
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,280
Then you grab my hand with both of yours.

660
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,360
And then your feet,

661
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,240
just jump yourself.

662
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,000
Then your friend needs to snap the photo

663
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,400
quickly.

664
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,000
Otherwise my core strength...

665
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,000
It's fine.

666
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,440
(My friend) can do it.

667
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,880
Next, group two.

668
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,600
Group two.

669
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,440
Okay.

670
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,200
Did you get it?

671
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,440
Pretty much.

672
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,200
Let me check again.

673
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,360
Hold hands and jump up.

674
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,400
Then touch feet.

675
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,360
Okay.

676
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,800
I think you don't have to jump.

677
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,720
But you need to hold on here.

678
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,280
Ready?

679
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,120
Step up with your foot.

680
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,280
This one really tests your balance.

681
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,000
Step first.

682
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,480
It's hard to step on.

683
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:09,680
So hard to step on.

684
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,960
You step first.

685
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,600
Can't step up.

686
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,160
You try.

687
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,160
Can't step up.

688
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,160
It's okay.

689
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,640
Just step all the way up.

690
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,120
Okay.

691
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,400
And it doesn't hurt.

692
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,280
Hands down.

693
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,360
Put your hands down.

694
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,120
Yeah.

695
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,640
Yeah, alright.

696
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,880
That's already pretty good.

697
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,840
Jue is blushing now.

698
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,440
Okay.

699
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,680
Core challenge.

700
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,360
Looks good.

701
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,120
I think the way we did it just now was

702
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,040
building trust.

703
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,480
Not bad.

704
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,000
Pretty nice.

705
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:05,920
Alright, next group.

706
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,040
Their pose is really hard.

707
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,280
Just watch me.

708
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,040
Okay, got it.

709
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,160
Then I'll go first.

710
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,680
So first, my hand—

711
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,360
then wrap it around.

712
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:16,960
Then,

713
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,040
You hold my hand tight.

714
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,040
Then I lift you up.

715
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,600
Is that okay?

716
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,320
Alright.

717
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,120
Let's give it a try.

718
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,880
What pose is this?

719
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,400
Them.

720
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,120
Need to lift up.

721
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:25,720
Need one hand.

722
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,800
Yeah.

723
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,640
You lift first.

724
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,040
Then I'll keep snapping photos.

725
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,040
Alright.

726
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,440
You might need to turn sideways.

727
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,600
Turn a bit, yeah.

728
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,440
Dr. Fang is gritting his teeth so hard.

729
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:09,960
Sorry.

730
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,800
Thanks for your effort.

731
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,760
Let's show this to everyone.

732
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,200
This is pretty accurate.

733
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,640
Group four.

734
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,440
It's us.

735
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,120
It's us.

736
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,560
This should be

737
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,440
Then the hands—

738
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,760
They need to touch heads.

739
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:46,560
Yeah.

740
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,040
Is it like this?

741
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,720
Yes.

742
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,160
And the hands on top need to join, right.

743
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,640
Xiaoyuan, lower your head a bit.

744
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,280
Yeah.

745
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,400
This is kind of awkward.

746
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,320
Alright, three, two, one.

747
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:03,680
Done.

748
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,600
All set.

749
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,320
Next up is

750
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:07,960
Group five.

751
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,360
Just sit right here.

752
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,560
We'll sit.

753
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,560
Really taking it sideways.

754
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,440
That's clever.

755
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:27,800
They're smart.

756
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,960
The original photo was with their backs.

757
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,920
They shot it like this.

758
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:30,880
Very good.

759
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,840
Perfect fit.

760
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,480
Is this okay?

761
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,240
It's good. Three, two, one.

762
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,440
Alright.

763
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,280
Group six.

764
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,320
It's group six, yeah.

765
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,360
So tiring.

766
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,360
Not tiring.

767
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,200
Not tiring.

768
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,040
Wait, this one's a bit tough.

769
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,960
This foot goes like this, then—

770
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,120
Facing forward.

771
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,600
You guys need to—

772
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,720
The challenge here is—

773
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,080
You need to make a heart shape.

774
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,520
So the shoes need to match that—

775
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,800
This angle.

776
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,800
Then your hands need to go over and match his.

777
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,080
Both hands together like this?

778
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:14,560
Like this?

779
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,840
Yeah, we can do that.

780
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,200
Like this.

781
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:16,680
That's good.

782
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,720
Quick.

783
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,200
This one's a bit hard.

784
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,120
Three, two, one.

785
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:24,960
Got it now.

786
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,120
Duoduo, match your hand with his like this.

787
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,400
No, you two link like this.

788
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,240
Yeah, just like before.

789
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,080
Heart shape, right.

790
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,080
It's fine, we definitely got it.

791
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,400
Three, two, one.

792
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,000
Thank you.

793
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,640
Alright, thanks.
