1
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,440
Don't you think it looks just like you?

2
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,160
Do you know why I drew this?

3
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,960
That's an improvement.

4
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,280
Those two are just giggling here.

5
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,160
It's actually pretty cute.

6
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,320
Why are you looking at me?

7
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,920
I don't care, I just like watching.

8
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:02,840
Bold.

9
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,720
The graduation gown I prepared.

10
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,040
Why are you so annoying?

11
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,040
Don't cry, don't cry.

12
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,440
Honestly, I want to cry too right now.

13
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,720
Is Pegasus Sagittarius?

14
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,280
Tap over and check.

15
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,680
Hello, Yu Xing.

16
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,520
Yu Xing.

17
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,600
Yu Xing, it's Yu Xing.

18
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,960
Hello.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,800
Life is vast like the sea.

20
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,960
Mountains and rivers flow on.

21
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,120
It's nothing much.

22
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,920
I think a hot air balloon

23
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,160
can bring two people really close.

24
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,160
I guess right now

25
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,000
your phone's input predicts "cc"

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,880
which means Chichi.

27
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,600
That's fine.

28
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,920
Are you about to fall asleep?

29
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,840
Today's (three strengths)

30
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,320
Three strengths.

31
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,840
Actually, I prepared that for everyone.

32
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,840
Actually, I prepared that for everyone.

33
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:06,920
Actually, I prepared that for everyone.

34
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,520
My "mission" ends here.

35
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,920
From now on,

36
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,800
you all need to be braver.

37
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,240
Duoduo.

38
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,360
She's truly a wonderful girl.

39
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,720
I hope out there

40
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,960
you find your own answer.

41
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,720
We're back again.

42
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,520

it's our Confession Day.

87
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,640
Time to confess.

88
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,360
Friends,

89
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,440

00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,600
Thanks to all our

94
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,240
Cupids

95
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,600
for everything this season

96
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,920
you've given

97
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,440
all your effort and energy.

98
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,880
We're about to

99
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,480
welcome Confession Day.

100
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,960
The moment everyone awaits—

101
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,400
whose confession will it be?

102
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,600
I still think

103
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,160
Doctor Fang and Ru Lan

104
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,800
Doctor Fang and our Lan Lan

105
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,080
Honestly, I'm really curious

106
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,000
about Chichi and Zihan

107
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,400
and who Yu Xing will end up with.

108
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,240
Their group is the most suspenseful.

109
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,280
Right.

110
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,040
So this Dating Getaway

111
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,120
everyone has seen

112
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,400
inside it,

113
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:02,960
they've felt

114
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,320
but whether they can become

115
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,080
a couple

116
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,400
is up to our final

117
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,080
Confession Day

118
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,720
to decide.

119
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,400
to decide.

120
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,600
So our

121
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,680
Dating Getaway

122
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,520
is still going on.

123
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,960
Let's see what our

124
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,560
Le Chen and Lu Yuan

125
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,400
got up to today.

126
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,040
Take a look.

127
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,320
Hello.

128
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,400
Hello.

129
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,520
Let's go.

130
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,960
I took your cup.

131
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,920
You took my cup.

132
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,960
I washed it clean for you.

133
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,640
I washed yours clean too.

134
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,320
I washed it several times.

135
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,040
They're using each other's cups now.

136
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,160
Today we're going to

137
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,400
explore the old town.

138
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,480
Okay.

139
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,040
Let's go.

140
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,400
Is your sunburn here any better?

141
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,480
It's so red.

142
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,600
The color difference is showing.

143
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,120
Did you sleep well last night?

144
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,160
What time did you go to bed?

145
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,760
Not really, around four.

146
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,800
You went to bed at four too?

147
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,960
I went to bed at four too.

148
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,560
I think I got up at nine.

149
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,760
You got up at nine?

150
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,960
Youth is wonderful.

151
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,240
So beautiful.

152
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:25,920
Here.

153
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,720
The view ahead looks even better.

154
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,960
So pretty.

155
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,800
Did you bring your film camera?

156
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,760
I did.

157
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,280
Are you shooting me or the scenery?

158
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,680
Which do you want to shoot?

159
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,520
Of course, I want to shoot you.

160
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,120
Three, two...

161
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,640
You look great.

162
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,000
Of course.

163
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:08,880
Look at this.

164
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,400
It feels so special.

165
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,320
Yeah, you look truly happy here.

166
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,960
Did you bring sunscreen?

167
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,000
Yes.

168
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,920
Put some on.

169
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,560
Did you eat today?

170
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,760
I finished eating.

171
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,720
I had the spicy chicken.

172
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,400
I skipped a few pastries.

173
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,240
But I ate two baked buns.

174
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,080
You even ate two baked buns?

175
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,920
I almost finished my breakfast too.

176
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,520
Le Chen treats her like a kid.

177
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,120
He teases her every day.

178
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,880
No wonder you never go hungry.

179
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,920
My breakfast this morning—

180
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,560
I only ate the spicy chicken.

181
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,520
I used to eat three meals a day.

182
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,600
Now it's down to one and a half.

183
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,000
So, my one and a half meals...

184
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,520
What souvenirs should we bring back?

185
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,480
Let's stroll through the old town.

186
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,160
Let's stroll through the old town.

187
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,960
Okay.

188
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,960
Did you grab my water bottle?

189
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,360
I did.

190
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:08,760
Great.

191
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,640
What should we buy for them?

192
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,480
Let me think.

193
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,160
Should we get fridge magnets too?

194
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,600
Let's get them some.

195
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,120
Yeah.

196
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,520
Where are the fridge magnets?

197
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,400
Over there, on the right.

198
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,600
That one over there.

199
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,120
That's a fridge magnet.

200
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,000
Nice.

201
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,800
How many should we get?

202
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,560
I think we should take these two.

203
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,320
Take two.

204
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,120
Twelve—four of each.

205
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,360
Should we get them some snacks?

206
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,200
Sure.

207
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,000
Grab those red dates for me.

208
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,080
Three bags.

209
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,160
Yeah, Ruilong likes them.

210
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,440
Do you eat milk curds?

211
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,640
Milk curds are pretty tasty.

212
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,200
Really?

213
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,440
Yeah, you should try them.

214
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,760
Shredded beef jerky.

215
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,840
Want more?

216
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,320
Yes.

217
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,560
Then let's get one of each.

218
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,640
One of each.

219
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,720
Do you want honey?

220
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,480
He keeps asking Lu Yuan what she wants.

221
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,080
True.

222
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,040
Yes.

223
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,040
Take a box.

224
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,080
Take a box.

225
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,080
He gets everything Lu Yuan wants.

226
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,440
What do you usually like to eat?

227
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,640
Black sesame balls.

228
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,920
Good for the brain.

229
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,680
Good for the brain.

230
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,960
He always likes

231
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,640
to say things

232
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,640
to tease her a bit.

233
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,560
It's sweet, all that playful banter.

234
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,320
This baked milk skin—

235
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,200
Do you want to try it?

236
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,360
Sure.

237
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,920
Little Glutton.

238
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,080
Little Glutton—this...

239
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,280
So cute.

240
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,720
Little Glutton.

241
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,480
Ate too much this morning.

242
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,280
Should've held back at breakfast.

243
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:34,920
Ate too much this morning.

244
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,360
And still eating a lot here.

245
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,920
Want to break off a piece?

246
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,640
You chew forever on each bite.

247
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,960
Look how happy you are.

248
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,640
This is...

249
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,280
Wish sticky notes.

250
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,640
This is so unique.

251
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,480
Can you write your own?

252
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,280
Yes, you can.

253
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,560
Sometimes, in a relationship,

254
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,760
you should do things together

255
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,080
that you wouldn't normally do.

256
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,880
True.

257
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:01,840
Done.

258
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,120
You can pin it to the wall.

259
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,920
Okay.

260
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,240
I'll pin mine higher up.

261
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,720
The higher you stick it, the better it comes true.

262
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,640
High—higher, right?

263
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,440
He put his at the very top, right?

264
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,360
He put his at the very top, right?

265
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,360
Are you done?

266
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,560
Done.

267
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,400
Want me to stick it for you?

268
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,400
I'll do it myself.

269
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,280
Want to stick it higher?

270
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:35,920
I'll do it myself.

271
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,320
What did you stick?

272
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,880
Which one did you write?

273
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,840
Just look—be careful.

274
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,240
Find yours.

275
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:56,880
Can't find it.

276
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,520
Not here—not in this area, okay?

277
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,640
Really? I don't believe it.

278
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,840
Is this the one stuck up high?

279
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,240
No.

280
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,000
May everything go smoothly.

281
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,800
Be happy every day.

282
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,120
This one.

283
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,920
Wishing everyone...

284
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,320
All the treasures in the house.

285
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,720
Their wishes are the same.

286
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,040
We really are alike.

287
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,560
Stick it here.

288
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,840
Le Chen protects her from below.

289
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,520
Wishing all the treasures in the house—

290
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,840
I love you all.

291
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,480
Let's see... Are you hungry?

292
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,800
I'm okay.

293
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,920
You asked if I'm hungry.

294
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,480
You're doing this on purpose.

295
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,080
Yogurt helps with digestion.

296
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,360
Boss.

297
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,760
Is there anything here

298
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,240
that's a specialty kind of bun?

299
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,720
Actually, this little bun is good.

300
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,480
Which little bun?

301
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:57,960
This one.

302
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,920
Le Chen has always been

303
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,120
paying attention to Lu Yuan's needs.

304
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,480
Yeah, strong "boyfriend energy."

305
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,520
This little bun.

306
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,280
Which one do you like?

307
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,280
Pick one for me.

308
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,880
This one suits you.

309
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,600
You...

310
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,880
...would punch me.

311
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,600
Looks great.

312
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,520
Nice.

313
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,600
Give me some advice.

314
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,520
Aren't you picking for me?

315
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,360
The little sheep, then.

316
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,760
Okay.

317
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,120
On a previous date,

318
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,400
he gave her a little sheep.

319
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:30,840
Yeah.

320
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,640
Is my sheep still there?

321
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,080
It is.

322
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,000
What about my flower?

323
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,800
It's on the bedside.

324
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,320
It won't be gone when I get back, right?

325
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,280
That I don't know.

326
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,520
Here comes the cowboy hat.

327
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,840
This one's good.

328
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,480
Western hat.

329
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,320
This one's cool.

330
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,120
This one's good.

331
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,880
Good.

332
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,400
Your usual earrings—

333
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,800
Are they this big?

334
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,800
This really matches your outfit today.

335
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,560
Yeah, it's beautiful.

336
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,040
Right?

337
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,600
Why don't you try it on?

338
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,400
Does it look good?

339
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,520
Done.

340
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,760
Does it fit?

341
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,280
These two...

342
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,400
This is really nice.

343
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,520
This is sweeter than donuts.

344
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,320
So nice.

345
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,720
Why are you sighing?

346
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,000
Wish it was you over there.

347
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,640
So nice.

348
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,320
Like them so much you sigh.

349
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,080
Look at them.

350
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,120
Enjoy it.

351
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,680
What you're wearing today really matches.

352
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,880
The bag.

353
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,520
Perfect for taking your photo.

354
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,680
This one—I'll sit.

355
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,120
You really know how to pick.

356
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,920
The bag.

357
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,080
Three, two, one.

358
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:48,920
This is beautiful.

359
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,520
Looks great.

360
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,840
Really pretty.

361
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,840
Come on.

362
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,680
I want to take a picture of this.

363
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,720
Give me a fiercer look.

364
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,160
Lu Yuan looks better the more you look.

365
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,320
So pretty.

366
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,120
Let me give you something.

367
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,240
This is great too.

368
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,800
These two are a perfect match.

369
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,960
Darn it, I want to get some ice cream.

370
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,880
What flavors are there?

371
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,520
She's secretly taking pictures of him.

372
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,160
Try it.

373
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,520
Eat up.

374
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,840
This ice cream is way too sweet.

375
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,320
That's enough.

376
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,520
No, give me less.

377
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,840
That's enough.

378
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,400
Please, I'm begging you.

379
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,240
That's enough.

380
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,880
"Help!"

381
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,960
This is just too...

382
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,640
Let's go.

383
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,920
What's this?

384
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,480
Beads.

385
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,840
Are these name beads?

386
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:39,960
What are you looking for?

387
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,880
Looking for your "Yuan."

388
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,600
This one's nice.

389
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,680
Found it.

390
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,440
Saw it right away.

391
00:15:59,440 --> 00:15:59,840
That fast?

392
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,400
Yeah.

393
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,600
Le.

394
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,200
Le.

395
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,560
Found it.

396
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,480
Now it's complete.

397
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,800
"Le Yuan"—that's perfect.

398
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,280
I think just "Le" is enough.

399
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,080
Having "Yuan" is enough for me.

400
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,800
Do a little dance.

401
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,040
Dancing like this in the street—

402
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,120
I can't resist.

403
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,280
I'd definitely join in.

404
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:39,840
Me too.

405
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,680
Do a little dance.

406
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,440
Le Chen said, "My legs are dying, hurry!"

407
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,160
Lu Yuan pulled him along.

408
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,880
Dance.

409
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,360
Dance.

410
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,200
Dance.

411
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,560
Play it, let's dance.

412
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,720
You can't escape this "fate" in Xinjiang, right?

413
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,560
Absolutely.

414
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,280
How do you dance?

415
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,960
Lu Yuan dances pretty well.

416
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,640
True.

417
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,360
Like this.

418
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,080
Is there an easier one?

419
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,120
Like this?

420
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,480
This is the easiest.

421
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,360
Any more?

422
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,680
Is there an even easier one?

423
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,000
That's enough.

424
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,680
I'll let you off.

425
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,480
Let you go.

426
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,440
Any stiffer moves?

427
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,440
So cute.

428
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,200
Now I know why he doesn't want to dance.

429
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,520
I got it.

430
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,440
Do you know what I learned?

431
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,040
What?

432
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,520
You look like a worm.

433
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,120
These two...

434
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:18,880
(Snap) Can't snap my fingers.

435
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,240
I can do this.

436
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,000
She's doing the lady's moves.

437
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's different for boys.

438
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,160
I think he's trying to make her laugh.

439
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,040
Don't laugh.

440
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,600
Be serious.

441
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,080
Is there an easier way?

442
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:38,640
How do you say it?

443
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,440
How do you spin?

444
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,720
Le Chen is very cooperative too.

445
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,200
Yeah.

446
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,280
Not a buzzkill at all.

447
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,640
Just enjoy it.

448
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,640
As long as we're happy.

449
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,120
Come on, you dance.

450
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,480
Spin, keep spinning.

451
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,720
Spin, keep spinning.

452
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,600
Those two.

453
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,480
So sweet.

454
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,040
That's enough.

455
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,400
The two of them.

456
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,680
Very good.

457
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,320
Looks great.

458
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:22,880
Yeah.

459
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,560
Now I'm thinking of all the sweets.

460
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,360
Like donuts.

461
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,360
Donuts.

462
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,080
This is sweeter than donuts.

463
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,800
I'm sweating already.

464
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,840
Welcome.

465
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,640
Thank you.

466
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,320
Xinjiang is really fun.

467
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,200
Tried so many new things.

468
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,600
Super happy.

469
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,600
It's nice.

470
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,560
Actually, last night

471
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,760
when I was stargazing,

472
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,600
I already

473
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,400
felt really moved.

474
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,080
It was very touching.

475
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,360
I really think

476
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,600
just meeting some people

477
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,760
is already a stroke of luck.

478
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,800
This line—

479
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,600
Some people,

480
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,120
just meeting them is lucky.

481
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,200
I never expected before coming

482
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,200
it would be like this today.

483
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,960
Life in the house feels

484
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,760
about

485
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,320
four times faster than my daily life.

486
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,640
Pretty much.

487
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,320
Really?

488
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,880
For example,

489
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,880
walking the dog (calling you).

490
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,800
Actually, I

491
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,640
in my daily life,

492
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,680
I'm not like this.

493
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,320
I'm the type

494
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,520
who might hope

495
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,680
it's a bit like when you were little,

496
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,880
I just stand there

497
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,680
and hope the other person notices me.

498
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,760
Maybe I want to walk the dog with you,

499
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,560
but I wait for you to invite me.

500
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,080
But the person I want to invite

501
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,160
is even more like this than me.

502
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,720
So I can only

503
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,520
So I just can't do anything.

504
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm really sorry.

505
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,320
Then I really can't help it.

506
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,800
So when I gave you

507
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,280
that little train card,

508
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,480
I really kept it in my laptop

509
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,280
for a long time.

510
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,680
I can tell.

511
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,040
That's amazing.

512
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,160
I feel like if

513
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,400
you weren't in the house,

514
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,160
I don't know what would have happened.

515
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,240
What I'd be like.

516
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,080
I have no idea.

517
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,080
Everything is the best arrangement.

518
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,040
Fate is a magical thing.

519
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,040
I really think

520
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,000
if I put my current self

521
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,680
back in that time,

522
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,560
I would definitely

523
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,840
be much more proactive.

524
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,280
Who could handle that?

525
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,800
That's enough.

526
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,800
"Help!"

527
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,240
Because it's you, I want to be more proactive.

528
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:28,840
Yeah.

529
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,920
Really?

530
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,880
Yeah.

531
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,520
In her eyes,

532
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,600
there's a sparkle.

533
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,160
If I get a chance when I go back

534
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,640
to ride the little train again,

535
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,200
I'll definitely drive it.

536
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,480
She's really happy.

537
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,760
Will you feel sad

538
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,880
about leaving the house?

539
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,120
Definitely.

540
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,040
Every time I think back,

541
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,160
it feels like

542
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,160
I was dreaming.

543
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,640
Yeah, it really feels like a dream.

544
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,440
Especially after coming to Xinjiang again,

545
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,960
it feels even more dreamlike.

546
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,280
I'm thinking about everyone gathering

547
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,120
in person.

548
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,120
If we go

549
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,280
somewhere to have fun,

550
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,680
it'll definitely be fun.

551
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,360
It'll be a blast.

552
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,040
Yeah.

553
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,600
Yeah.

554
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,240
But after coming to the house,

555
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,320
I realized everyone and I

556
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,680
are really in sync.

557
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,000
I never expected that.

558
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,320
True.

559
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,600
This kind of group life

560
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,920
I've never experienced before.

561
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,600
I don't think I'll ever experience it again.

562
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,320
As long as I invite you,

563
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,760
don't say

564
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,200
you want to be alone.

565
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,680
Go drift on some island.

566
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,680
Go drift on some island.

567
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,200
I'll try my best.

568
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,080
You still have to try.

569
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,000
Make time for it.

570
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:21,800
Busy bee.

571
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,880
Your schedule is so packed.

572
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,600
No.

573
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,960
It always feels like something

574
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,280
is always a comma.

575
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,080
I think that's nice.

576
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,080
It really added a bold stroke

577
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,080
to our summer.

578
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,280
The height of summer is just beginning.

579
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,040
Our eyes are full of stars.

580
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,560
Awesome.

581
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,000
It's like there's a

582
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,680
sparkling, sweet feeling.

583
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:09,720
Just two people together.

584
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,360
Just two people together.

585
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,400
Feels like they've been in love
for a long time.

586
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:11,960
Yeah.

587
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,560
Starting to feel a bit...

588
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,480
Right?

589
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,480
I think it's so beautiful.

590
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,560
Jealousy is kicking in.

591
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,480
Really?

592
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,640
Darn it.

593
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,320
That's how love should be.

594
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,920
Those two really

595
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,800
in this

596
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,840
Dating Getaway

597
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:28,960
got to

598
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,640
understand each other more.

599
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,760
I think that's the whole

600
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,640
point of this trip.

601
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,440
That's the most important part.

602
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,080
Yeah.

603
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:35,560
Come on.

604
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,040
Let's see the last night
in the house.

605
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,040
What will everyone do?

606
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,040
Let's all watch together.

607
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,520
Let's go.

608
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,400
House countdown.

609
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,040
Yes.

610
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,160
The weather is really nice today.

611
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,360
We're here.

612
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,520
Back to the house.

613
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,400
Not sure if we'll get to
visit this park again.

614
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,680
Will we have another chance
to play here?

615
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,040
I really want to explore
the whole park.

616
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,200
It's their last day

617
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,280
in the house, right?

618
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,000
Finally got a chance
to carry your suitcase.

619
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,920
Doctor Fang finally got his wish.

620
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,560
I'll help you carry it.

621
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,560
Thanks.

622
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,560
Went up like this
on the first day.

623
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:39,840
Give it to me.

624
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,480
Give it to me, Yifan.

625
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,480
Okay, thank you.

626
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,240
There are fewer shoes now.

627
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,160
It's not as lively as before.

628
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,280
So now, on the first floor,

629
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,520
only Herry (Zihan) is left.

630
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:05,800
You know,

631
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,600
it's true.

632
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,720
Lonely Herry (Zihan).

633
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,480
I declare you the "king"
of the first floor.

634
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,200
King of the first floor.

635
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,400
What's going on?

636
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,760
You're the only one
on the first floor.

637
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,160
Let's eat.

638
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,040
Food's ready.

639
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:13,640
There's food now.

640
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:14,840
Time to eat.

641
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,680
Yeah.

642
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,200
Let's eat first.

643
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,400
Sure.

644
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,320
Smells so good.

645
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:30,720
Smells so good.

646
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,240
This is the last time

647
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,720
everyone eats together
in the house?

648
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,400
Yeah.

649
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,800
You sit in the middle.

650
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,080
Anything's fine.

651
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,280
I'll sit here.

652
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,840
I want to eat all of these.

653
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,120
Welcome home.

654
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,040
Dinner's ready.

655
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,680
This is our last meal
in the house.

656
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,840
Everyone's quietly eating.

657
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,000
The mood is a bit down.

658
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,320
Yeah.

659
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,800
Looks like everyone's
pretty hungry today.

660
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,960
It's so sudden,
I didn't expect it at all.

661
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,560
Tonight is the last night.

662
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,440
I didn't expect it either.

663
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,040
I thought it would be
tomorrow or Friday.

664
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,840
Me too.

665
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,520
It feels so fast.

666
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,760
The last day.

667
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,800
Actually, it wasn't that long.

668
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,040
This month really flew by.

669
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,240
Way too fast.

670
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,000
I think it's really

671
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,960
different from our usual lives.

672
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,520
So you start to pay
special attention

673
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,720
and deliberately

674
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,600
try to capture these moments.

675
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,040
But it goes by so fast.

676
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,000
I just feel like

677
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,320
we only arrived yesterday.

678
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,560
Yeah.

679
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,480
Now's the time for a toast.

680
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,680
Cheers!

681
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,480
Last meal.

682
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,560
Here's to the last night.

683
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,760
May it be joyful.

684
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,760
The last supper.

685
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,320
Love you all.

686
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,080
The last supper.

687
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,840
Let's capture this moment.

688
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,960
Let's include Nicole and Winnie.

689
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,680
Okay, nine seconds timer.
I pressed it.

690
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,280
Let's do a demo.

691
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,440
Three, two, one.

692
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,600
Okay, put it down first.

693
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,920
Here it comes.

694
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,800
Six, five, four, three, two, one.

695
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,560
Friendship like this
is really wonderful.

696
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,320
Yeah.

697
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,280
So fast.

698
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:32,920
It's really

699
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,000
the last night.

700
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:36,960
I really like

701
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,280
the ball on the second floor.

702
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,600
It's like a sticky rice ball.

703
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,440
Yeah.

704
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,280
Like a sticky rice ball.

705
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,960
Feels like this time

706
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,720
is both fast and slow.

707
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:56,720
It's because

708
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,800
every day

709
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,720
the time spent together

710
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,040
is really long.

711
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,880
It's really long.

712
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,040
And the time you spend
reflecting inside

713
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,560
is also quite long.

714
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,080
So it feels like time is long.

715
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,240
But happy times pass quickly.

716
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:11,960
They're always short.

717
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,480
So it feels so fast.

718
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,120
So it feels so fast.

719
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,280
Yeah.

720
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,280
There are still so many things

721
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,680
we haven't experienced yet.

722
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,880
For example,

723
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,760
the little train.

724
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,800
We really haven't ridden it.

725
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,320
Xiao Jiao hasn't ridden
the little train either.

726
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,560
You two should go
ride the train later.

727
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,800
My regretful thing

728
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,600
is probably with many people

729
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,520
not just a few

730
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,200
many people

731
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,320
I never really had

732
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,360
much understanding

733
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:54,960
or communication with them

734
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,200
Maybe I just focused

735
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,040
all my attention on one thing

736
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,920
always around Lan Lan

737
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,400
Really

738
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,640
That's nice too

739
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,400
But for me, the regretful thing

740
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,600
was at the beginning, everyone

741
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,200
ate hotpot together

742
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,520
I think about that hotpot

743
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,720
We bought so many ingredients

744
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,040
for hotpot that day

745
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,040
but only ate it once

746
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,440
Yeah, just once

747
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,320
And now, as it turns out

748
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,600
some friends have already left early

749
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,840
I think that's quite a pity

750
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,120
Back then, I was imagining

751
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,040
us having hotpot together a second time

752
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,680
There weren't enough seats by then

753
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,880
We really had to stand

754
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,280
But it was so lively

755
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,080
Yeah, very lively

756
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,600
So lively

757
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,560
Delicious

758
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,280
So satisfying

759
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:51,880
So satisfying

760
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,480
Really satisfying

761
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,480
Eating watermelon

762
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,040
Hotpot needs watermelon

763
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,360
Will tomorrow be better than today?

764
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,560
In the next month

765
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,680
Will everything go smoothly?

766
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:10,760
Six

767
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,080
The equipment is usually used like this

768
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,800
For back training

769
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,560
I feel especially regretful

770
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,000
Yeah

771
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,000
Let's talk about happy things

772
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,960
Don't get mad when I say this

773
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,840
Don't be upset

774
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,280
Why?

775
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:34,880
We won't

776
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:41,840
Because I

777
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,440
I

778
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,560
The happiest thing for me

779
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,480
isn't really

780
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,000
when I'm with everyone

781
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,680
My happiest moments are

782
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,440
when I'm alone with the girl I like

783
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,480
just the two of us

784
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,680
That's so true

785
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,240
That's true for me too

786
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,720
Especially in this place, it's so true

787
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,240
Yeah, it's really true here

788
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,480
Every time we're alone, I'm happy

789
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,760
If I have to pick one time

790
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,320
the happiest one

791
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,840
it would be

792
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,560
the time we sang together

793
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,680
Don't you think it's just like you?

794
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,400
Do you know why I drew this?

795
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,400
That's an improvement

796
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,680
Didn't I take your photo on the boat?

797
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,560
It was this pose

798
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,640
Sitting below, alone for a while

799
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,880
Little Fang

800
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,160
The happiest thing

801
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,480
is

802
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,960
feeling like I found my old self from seven or eight years ago

803
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:44,760
So how did you

804
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,320
suddenly get back

805
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,760
to who you were seven or eight years ago?

806
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,560
Was it something specific?

807
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,280
Or something else?

808
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:51,600
I think I

809
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,040
did well during the park date

810
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,720
Yeah

811
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,440
I really gave it

812
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,520
all my strength

813
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,840
Really? I want to hear about it

814
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,240
Yes

815
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:06,720
I was preparing for it

816
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,240
I think

817
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,280
I was really quite

818
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,200
I felt so youthful then

819
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,360
Yes

820
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,240
Yeah, it was great

821
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,080
Yes, chef

822
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,040
The girl was

823
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,760
sitting below

824
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,360
and they were face to face

825
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,400
He made her Japanese food

826
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,520
Yeah

827
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,320
Yes

828
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,160
Yeah

829
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,840
Pretty happy

830
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,080
Actually

831
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,720
I think my happiest time was also

832
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,680
thanks to

833
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,120
life in the house

834
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,840
something I never had before

835
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,160
an experience

836
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,160
Trying new things for the first time

837
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,200
It felt like

838
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,880
I was breaking through my limits

839
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:01,960
Yes

840
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,640
And also

841
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,000
the last time

842
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,040
the choice during the getaway date

843
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,360
I learned something from it

844
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,440
It's really

845
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,160
sometimes

846
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,680
we should truly seize the moment

847
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,240
sometimes you have to take the initiative

848
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,680
I think that's really important

849
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,000
(getaway date groupings)

850
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,440
That time

851
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,680
was quite crucial

852
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,920
Looking back now

853
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,280
that was a major turning point

854
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,120
It's all about seizing the moment

855
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,960
That's how it shows in real life, I think

856
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,680
So everyone came here

857
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,680
and maybe found

858
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,760
what they once longed for

859
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,080
but hadn't achieved before

860
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,480
or hadn't made real

861
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,880
But in the house

862
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,280
suddenly you realize

863
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,520
it feels like you've touched

864
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,480
what you once wanted to reach

865
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,560
I truly believe

866
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,160
after we leave

867
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,280
maybe something one of you said

868
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,240
or maybe

869
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,120
something we did together

870
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,560
and in that moment

871
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,040
it will make me understand again

872
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,200
It hurts so much.

873
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,960
Both of them are actually feeling
pretty complicated inside.

874
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,600
Both of them are actually feeling
pretty complicated inside.

875
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,160
This is truly hopeless.

876
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:43,960
Hopeless.

877
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,120
Putting my clothes back on again.

878
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,920
Have you made up your mind?

879
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,320
I'm actually the most hopeless one.

880
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,360
Actually, Yifan and I never really

881
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,760
talked about anything before.

882
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,320
Because we both know

883
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,280
each other's situation.

884
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,320
Yeah.

885
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,160
So I think

886
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,320
one really good thing is

887
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,480
we've never

888
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,640
disturbed each other.

889
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,200
And we've never interfered
with each other.

890
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,000
Honestly, we don't talk

891
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,600
because we're afraid

892
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,480
that maybe because of some

893
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,280
unknown things

894
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,440
it might affect each other's thoughts.

895
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,200
it might affect each other's thoughts.

896
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:33,400
it might affect each other's thoughts.

897
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,160
It shows we're both good people.

898
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,160
Yeah.

899
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,760
Really.

900
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,200
But actually, I

901
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,640
today,

902
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,960
I even had the same thought
as Duoduo.

903
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,160
The same idea.

904
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,480
What idea?

905
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,040
Just once,

906
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,200
I thought to myself,

907
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,640
there's no need to go to the end.

908
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,440
You mean the idea of leaving?

909
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,640
Yeah.

910
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,160
But later I felt

911
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:55,760
I said,

912
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,760
follow your heart.

913
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,760
I'd be willing to give it a try,
or something.

914
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,640
I've always felt

915
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,520
sometimes you're really amazing.

916
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,560
I'm not

917
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,600
as strong as you.

918
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,840
I'm not as brave as you.

919
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,760
I really wanted to tell you this.

920
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,720
But what I really want to say

921
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,800
is just these things.

922
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,080
Because we're in this environment,

923
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:17,560
so I really feel

924
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,960
so I really feel

925
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,880
you're much braver than me.

926
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,120
Because I remember you told me

927
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,120
you're not that proactive
in real life.

928
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,520
Not someone who just does
whatever you want.

929
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,760
Yeah, I think everyone is like that.

930
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,280
Actually, in

931
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,600
environments outside the house,

932
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,920
everyone has a lot

933
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,040
since it's an adult world,

934
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,160
to worry about.

935
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,520
So you can't really just

936
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,840
do whatever you want so freely.

937
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,120
But I feel in the house,

938
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,400
it's more like a "utopia."

939
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,200
The real me is here.

940
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,000
So whatever I want to do,

941
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I can just do it.

942
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,880
Sometimes it's really just

943
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,400
like this trip in the house,

944
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,120
for us,

945
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:54,960
is really

946
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,320
a unique experience of growth.

947
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,640
It's really helping us open up

948
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,000
windows inside ourselves
we didn't realize.

949
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,920
That window.

950
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,720
So we won't have regrets.

951
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,280
Yeah.

952
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,760
I told Xiao Jiao that day,

953
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,440
I want to give my whole time
in the house

954
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,600
at the end

955
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,080
a tilde as the ending.

956
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,480
Because I think

957
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,480
a lot of communication
between people

958
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,600
when messaging

959
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,640
you usually use a period.

960
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,520
I do that too.

961
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,280
When I use a period, I feel

962
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,000
the message feels a bit cold.

963
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,480
Indifferent.

964
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:22,840
Yeah.

965
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,200
I usually use a tilde.

966
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,320
A tilde also means

967
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,600
the sentence might be over,

968
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,240
but there's more to come.

969
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,240
So have you thought about
how to use the tilde?

970
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,440
I think I have my own

971
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,560
eighty

972
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,520
percent idea.

973
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,120
You're totally a Sunflower type.

974
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,080
Me? No, that's not right.

975
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,800
It's just because I described

976
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,040
myself as a certain flower.

977
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,640
I said I'm like a sunflower.

978
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,920
But I actually want to be
a sunflower.

979
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,400
Because I feel I don't have

980
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,640
that sunny energy yet.

981
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,960
But I think you really are

982
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,040
a Sunflower type personality.

983
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,040
That's so well said.

984
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,880
Healing yourself every day.

985
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,200
Very strong inside.

986
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,720
They also seem to have

987
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,960
not communicated much before.

988
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,360
And built walls between themselves.

989
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,840
But those walls are gone now.

990
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,720
I suddenly realized

991
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,600
I never took a photo
with Chichi.

992
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,120
Is it because Chichi and I

993
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,520
aren't really

994
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,320
the type to take photos actively?

995
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,720
Didn't you take photos
on the hot air balloon?

996
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,560
No.

997
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,120
You don't know, that day
on the hot air balloon

998
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,080
I felt it was so shaky.

999
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,560
The balloon wasn't like this.

1000
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,520
It was tilted, you know?

1001
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,560
And it was so high up.

1002
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,520
I felt a bit shaky.

1003
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,160
I kept holding onto the railing.

1004
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,440
You held the railing.

1005
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,280
Did you hold her?

1006
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,280
I forgot.

1007
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,800
I was just admiring

1008
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,960
just admiring the sunset.

1009
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,360
But Chichi was really brave.

1010
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,880
She leaned right against the door.

1011
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,600
I said, you're really brave.

1012
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,760
She leaned right against the door.

1013
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,680
Even though the door had

1014
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,160
a lock.

1015
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,040
Yeah, it was locked.

1016
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,280
But I still think that's brave.

1017
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,880
Even though there aren't many photos,

1018
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,880
they're all of important people.

1019
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,160
Doctor Fang really is like that.

1020
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,440
Lan Lan, wait a moment.

1021
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,080
This is for you.

1022
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:23,520
Thank you.

1023
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,920
And it's a...

1024
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:25,920
Guess what it is.

1025
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,200
Is it...

1026
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,680
A cassette?

1027
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:32,400
No.

1028
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,200
It's actually...

1029
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,200
It's actually a power bank.

1030
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,040
But it looks just like

1031
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:37,800
a cassette-shaped power bank.

1032
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,920
I picked this one on purpose.

1033
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,840
Because I remember we talked on day one

1034
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,520
about music, cassettes, and videotapes.

1035
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,920
And those discs.

1036
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,920
And albums.

1037
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,880
So I thought this

1038
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,040
even though it's not a cassette,

1039
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,760
it looks like one.

1040
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,720
But it can charge devices.

1041
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,600
Thank you for always "charging me up."

1042
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:55,920
Good night.

1043
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:56,720
Good night.

1044
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,640
If I go out tomorrow

1045
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,960
holding flowers in one hand and this in the other,

1046
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,400
will I look crazy?

1047
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,280
Not really.

1048
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,000
Are you sure?

1049
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,320
Light-colored flowers all look nice.

1050
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,600
I'm tired.

1051
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,400
Are you looking forward to tomorrow?

1052
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,520
Actually, I am.

1053
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,120
How come?

1054
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,640
It feels like a lot of things

1055
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,480
are clear to me,

1056
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,240
but also not so clear.

1057
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,480
Hard to figure out.

1058
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:09,400
It's the last night.

1059
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,480
Everyone is preparing so thoughtfully.

1060
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,320
This is what youth is.

1061
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,400
Here it comes.

1062
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,320
So excited.

1063
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,320
It's the end.

1064
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,600
What are they doing?

1065
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,720
Getting ready with confession gifts.

1066
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:16,360
Lan Lan.

1067
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:17,520
Is buying flowers.

1068
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:22,640
They're all so thoughtful.

1069
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,440
She prepared so much.

1070
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,480
Everything is well prepared.

1071
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,440
They're confessing in Xinjiang.

1072
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,400
So beautiful.

1073
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,400
So beautiful.

1074
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,360
Pretty handsome, too.

1075
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,240
When Yu Xing wears a suit,

1076
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,520
he looks really good.

1077
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,480
Doctor Fang's jawline is quite striking.

1078
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:47,840
I'm so nervous.

1079
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,120
Hello?

1080
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,680
Here comes the excitement.

1081
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:51,280
Hello?

1082
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:53,560
Hello?

1083
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,960
Can you tell who I am?

1084
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,040
Is that Lan Lan?

1085
00:49:59,400 --> 00:49:59,960
Yes.

1086
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,000
Hi.

1087
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:03,640
Good evening.

1088
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,680
Everyone's here.

1089
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,440
Dear viewers,

1090
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,800
Everyone's dying of impatience.

1091
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,360
Who's with whom?

1092
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:13,920
Right.

1093
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,120
We're anxious too.

1094
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,160
But now we have something

1095
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:16,920
very important to do.

1096
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,440
It's the final deduction of the season.

1097
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,800
This season's confession

1098
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,400
only has two outcomes:

1099
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,320
becoming a couple or not.

1100
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,280
So choosing who to confess to

1101
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,320
is extremely important

1102
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,120
for every guest.

1103
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,440
It's very important.

1104
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,280
This deduction

1105
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,520
is a team challenge.

1106
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:38,080
The Cupids must work together

1107
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,960
to guess which guests will become couples.

1108
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,280
Unlock new identities.

1109
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,880
If all guesses are correct,

1110
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,800
everyone gets a Heartstone.

1111
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:52,480
Let's join forces and win the last round.

1112
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,120
So,

1113
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,880
first, Lu Yuan.

1114
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,080
I think Lu Yuan and Le Chen

1115
00:50:59,080 --> 00:50:59,800
are basically

1116
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:00,560
locked in.

1117
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,240
No doubt.

1118
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,640
The next obvious one

1119
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:05,200
is Lan Lan.

1120
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,560
Lan Lan and Doctor Fang.

1121
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,080
Chichi with Zihan or Yu Xing?

1122
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:10,680
Do this first—

1123
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,480
Put Yu Xing and Zihan up first.

1124
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,800
We'll pick one later.

1125
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:14,160
Okay.

1126
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:16,960
And then

1127
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,120
Yifan and

1128
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:18,560
Xiao Jiao.

1129
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,680
Chichi with Zihan or Yu Xing?

1130
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,000
Let's vote.

1131
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,040
I think it might be

1132
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:26,360
Zihan.

1133
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,080
I've voted.

1134
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,360
Okay, Hani picks Zihan.

1135
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:29,400
Chunye thinks

1136
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,240
it's Zihan.

1137
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,240
Xu Ge?

1138
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:32,240
Zihan.

1139
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,240
But could it be Yu Xing?

1140
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,360
Yu Xing is the love-at-first-sight type.

1141
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:36,400
Yu Xing is the love-at-first-sight type.

1142
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:38,280
No.

1143
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,840
I think he

1144
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:40,600
just

1145
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:43,040
Both Yu Xing and Zihan will pick Chichi.

1146
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:43,480
Right.

1147
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,360
But Chichi

1148
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:45,720
won't pick either.

1149
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:47,760
I think she might

1150
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,000
choose Zihan.

1151
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:50,800
Because I think

1152
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,720
she often says

1153
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,240
she wants encouragement

1154
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:54,640
and to feel supported.

1155
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:55,840
These are things

1156
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,600
Zihan has done for her.

1157
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:58,440
And then

1158
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,400
I think girls always notice

1159
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,360
and pick up on these things.

1160
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,480
At first,

1161
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,480
when Zihan appeared,

1162
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,440
I didn't pay much attention to him.

1163
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,160
But I think his

1164
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:11,680
the more you get to know him,

1165
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,360
the more you're drawn to him.

1166
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,160
He's put in so much effort.

1167
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:16,600
I hope he can

1168
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,920
get a good outcome.

1169
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,560
I don't think Chichi will

1170
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,440
before that talk with Yu Xing

1171
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,440
(in the car),

1172
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,840
she might've picked Yu Xing.

1173
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,320
But

1174
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,280
after their talk,

1175
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,080
her feelings for Yu Xing dropped a lot.

1176
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,320
And Zihan,

1177
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,400
her feelings for him are slowly growing.

1178
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,280
But

1179
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:39,840
I think she's hesitant.

1180
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:41,600
How to choose?

1181
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,840
Teacher Xu is right.

1182
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:44,720
That's true.

1183
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,440
There really is another possibility.

1184
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,480
This isn't something

1185
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,240
you figure out overnight.

1186
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,520
Is it about feelings or getting along, right?

1187
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:51,520
I choose to be single.

1188
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,760
So it's three to three now.

1189
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,200
Let me say one last thing.

1190
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:56,880
Go ahead.

1191
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,080
I think it's Chichi.

1192
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:58,640
Because she's

1193
00:52:58,640 --> 00:52:59,880
a very independent girl.

1194
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:00,840
She always thought

1195
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:01,840
she was

1196
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:02,440
the love-at-first-sight type.

1197
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,680
But today, Chichi

1198
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,520
is so hesitant.

1199
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,920
That shows how much she likes Zihan.

1200
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:07,600
That shows how much she likes Zihan.

1201
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:08,720
Or how strong her feelings are.

1202
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:08,960
Or how strong her feelings are.

1203
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,040
Because it means Zihan

1204
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:10,520
Because it means Zihan

1205
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,840
has really shaken her up.

1206
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:12,760
So in my

1207
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,120
view,

1208
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,440
she leans toward Zihan.

1209
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:19,560
That makes sense.

1210
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:23,680
I pick Yu Xing.

1211
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,240
You're switching your vote?

1212
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,400
You switched to Yu Xing.

1213
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,040
I understand how Yu Xing feels now.

1214
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:29,920
Sometimes,

1215
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,480
sticking to your heart

1216
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,480
is a kind of feeling.

1217
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,160
But people like us

1218
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,400
often bring something

1219
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,760
extra to life.

1220
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:44,600
I choose Yu Xing.

1221
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,800
So in the end,

1222
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:49,760
the one who remains is

1223
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:51,120
Zihan.

1224
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:52,360
Friends,

1225
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,480
the most anticipated confession

1226
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,320
is about to begin.

1227
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,880
The house guests

1228
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,480
will confess in the park

1229
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,480
filled with their own memories.

1230
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:02,840
They will make their confession.

1231
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,120
Each person gets

1232
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,520
one chance to confess by phone.

1233
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,840
Whoever they call

1234
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,040
is the one they confess to.

1235
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,240
If the confession succeeds,

1236
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,640
the two can meet at the date spot

1237
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,400
and decide whether

1238
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,640
to become a couple.

1239
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,120
But if the confession fails,

1240
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,480
after receiving

1241
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,760
the rejection call,

1242
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,240
they will leave alone.

1243
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,840
So, who will be the first couple

1244
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,280
to get together?

1245
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,280
When jasmine blooms, it's a sign of love.

1246
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,360
Next, we enter

1247
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:32,240
the Kang Sifu Moli Cha romantic moment.

1248
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:45,680
Xiao Jiao.

1249
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,280
Teacher Jiao.

1250
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:22,240
Nervous.

1251
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:29,600
Hello?

1252
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,200
Hello, hi.

1253
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,200
Xiao Jiao.

1254
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:34,760
Lan Lan.

1255
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,360
Good evening.

1256
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:38,720
Good evening.

1257
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,120
Do you know who I am?

1258
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:43,360
I do.

1259
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,960
That day on the island,

1260
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,480
when I first met you,

1261
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,840
I always felt

1262
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,720
you were like

1263
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:56,680
the sun—

1264
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,080
generous,

1265
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:00,480
beautiful,

1266
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:01,840
radiant.

1267
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,200
And also,

1268
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,240
you take care of

1269
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,720
everyone here.

1270
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:09,840
At that moment, I thought

1271
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:12,120
this is someone

1272
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,080
I want to get to know

1273
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,840
and be close to.

1274
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,040
During that time,

1275
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,560
I kept feeling

1276
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:27,360
I was so lucky.

1277
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:28,640
Because I felt

1278
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,360
so lucky to have met you.

1279
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:36,960
And later,

1280
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:41,320
you became the moon in my eyes.

1281
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,920
I saw your gentleness,

1282
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,640
and your sincerity

1283
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:50,600
when you made wishes.

1284
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,000
And that

1285
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,800
free-spirited run

1286
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,720
that I admired so much.

1287
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,800
Later, it felt like I saw

1288
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,640
hundreds of stars.

1289
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,040
I saw a whole sparkling universe.

1290
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,240
This is how I see

1291
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,920
the real

1292
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,600
you from these past twenty days.

1293
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:30,920
And I also want to say,

1294
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,960
from the very start,

1295
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:39,360
I was counting down

1296
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:42,320
these nearly thirty days.

1297
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,600
I know your birthday is

1298
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:44,760
June twenty-seventh.

1299
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:48,800
Back then, I thought

1300
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:51,560
I

1301
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,280
wanted you to have

1302
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,640
thirty days before your birthday

1303
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,800
with a small gift each day.

1304
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,000
Turns out, I planned it long ago.

1305
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,280
I hoped each gift

1306
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,880
would always be with you,

1307
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:03,680
blessing you.

1308
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,600
So today, I also prepared

1309
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,080
a little gift.

1310
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,320
I brought a globe.

1311
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,320
I assembled it myself.

1312
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,320
I used lights on it

1313
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:21,840
to mark the milestones

1314
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:25,240
of your life journey.

1315
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,400
It was made with care.

1316
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:33,280
In our lives so far,

1317
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,440
we've each been to many places.

1318
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,080
But today, we can

1319
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:39,280
meet here in the house.

1320
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,400
I think this

1321
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,200
is truly

1322
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:43,720
a special kind of fate.

1323
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:44,960
I'm so happy.

1324
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:45,120
And so grateful.

1325
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:46,160
Really grateful.

1326
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,880
To have this connection.

1327
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:52,160
Hello.

1328
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:53,640
Hello.

1329
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,040
My name is Jiao Zhiheng.

1330
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:56,880
Zhiheng. Zhiheng.

1331
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,200
Love at first sight.

1332
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,720
I need two photos of this sunset.

1333
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:01,080
Okay, I'll drive slower.

1334
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,480
It's my first time—

1335
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:03,400
really my first time—

1336
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:04,200
first time in my life—

1337
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,320
someone guessed me so well.

1338
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:07,760
So happy.

1339
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:08,960
Lan Lan gave me

1340
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,280
He was truly happy that day.

1341
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,000
Made this wish today.

1342
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,200
The whole universe will hear it.

1343
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,640
Everything you prepared today

1344
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,400
is far beyond

1345
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,440
what I imagined,

1346
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:23,320
making me feel so happy.

1347
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:24,400
And so lucky.

1348
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,320
This is the happiest thing

1349
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:26,360
I've heard all week.

1350
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,200
Careful.

1351
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:30,400
It's hard to remember all three hundred sixty-five days

1352
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,600
and everything that happens.

1353
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:33,640
But if we try our best

1354
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:35,320
to make each day

1355
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:37,680
filled with more joy and happiness,

1356
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:39,280
then those days will be remembered.

1357
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:40,440
Really.

1358
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:41,880
That's so well said.

1359
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,040
Finally, I want to say

1360
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,360
because on the first day,

1361
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:01,720
you said your favorite movie is

1362
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:03,040
"Me Before You."

1363
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,200
"Me Before You."

1364
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,360
I really agree with

1365
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:10,560
the message in that film.

1366
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,880
It's also what I want to say to you now.

1367
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:19,760
That's right.

1368
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:21,040
I like you.

1369
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:23,000
It's more than just liking you.

1370
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:23,920
The you right now,

1371
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,000
and the you from before,

1372
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:27,240
and every part of you.

1373
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,720
And I hope

1374
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:34,840
you can be even braver,

1375
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,320
more confident in being yourself.

1376
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:41,080
Xiao Jiao is truly sincere, too.

1377
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,160
So I want to ask,

1378
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:56,920
in the future,

1379
01:00:58,680 --> 01:00:59,240
can I

1380
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:01,040
witness with you

1381
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:02,600
an even

1382
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:03,880
colorful

1383
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:05,440
and confident you?

1384
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:30,080
Thank you.

1385
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:34,480
First, thank you for saying so much

1386
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,880
such wonderful

1387
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,240
and unforgettable words.

1388
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,160
Thank you for that.

1389
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,000
But now it's my turn.

1390
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:47,800
Go ahead.

1391
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:59,360
Actually, it's not just about me.

1392
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,960
You really are like a little sun,

1393
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:04,160
lighting up everyone in the house.

1394
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,600
But in the time we've spent together

1395
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,160
and gotten to know each other,

1396
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,800
I've slowly realized

1397
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:14,360
maybe

1398
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:16,640
I might hold you back.

1399
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:28,320
And that's the last thing I want.

1400
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:38,720
So I hope in the days ahead,

1401
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:40,720
you keep being yourself.

1402
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:42,840
And

1403
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:43,920
stay happy every day.

1404
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:48,360
I'm really grateful

1405
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:50,320
for all the days we've shared,

1406
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:53,800
you've given me so many dreamy,

1407
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,080
fairy-tale-like

1408
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,320
romantic moments.

1409
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,400
That glowing wishing tree,

1410
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,560
that midsummer snow,

1411
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,560
will all become

1412
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:12,960
my most beautiful memories.

1413
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:19,920
Thank you.

1414
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:23,360
Thank you.

1415
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:25,160
I hope you find happiness.

1416
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:26,960
You too.

1417
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:29,760
You hang up.

1418
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:30,960
Bye.

1419
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,400
Bye.

1420
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:26,200
Xiao Jiao and Lan Lan's confession

1421
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,440
ends here.

1422
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,760
Lan Lan gently

1423
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,680
and sincerely

1424
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:33,400
turned down Xiao Jiao.

1425
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:34,680
He gave it his best shot.

1426
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,600
And found closure for himself.

1427
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:38,640
Sometimes, it's not always

1428
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:39,520
a perfect ending,

1429
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,880
but it's always a beautiful beginning.

1430
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,640
Xiao Jiao truly

1431
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:50,840
shows many

1432
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:53,800
wonderful

1433
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:55,640
qualities.

1434
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,080
In love,

1435
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,600
he loves so purely,

1436
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:01,160
so passionately,

1437
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,720
and always follows his heart.

1438
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,920
He'll learn in time

1439
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:08,280
how to express that passion

1440
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:11,040
in more ways.

1441
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:12,120
At every stage,

1442
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:14,000
just love in your own way

1443
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,040
the person you care about.

1444
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:18,120
Then reflect,

1445
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:19,120
and keep growing.

1446
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:20,360
Honestly, that's enough.

1447
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:21,360
Yes.

1448
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:23,240
Boys at this age,

1449
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:25,000
their feelings are so pure.

1450
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:25,760
They just want

1451
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,000
the person they like

1452
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,400
to have their wishes come true.

1453
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:29,800
Besides that,

1454
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:30,600
maybe

1455
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,000
between two people,

1456
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:32,840
often

1457
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:33,480
you also need

1458
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:34,840
deeper

1459
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:37,760
emotional connection and communication.

1460
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,880
Xiao Jiao, thank you

1461
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:45,240
for letting me see so much

1462
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,200
of myself in you.

1463
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,280
And honestly, so many things

1464
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:50,760
I feel I should learn from you.

1465
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:53,720
Actually, Xiao Jiao

1466
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:54,680
has always used

1467
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:55,800
his sincerity

1468
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:56,800
and his energy

1469
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:57,640
to inspire

1470
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:58,520
every one of us.

1471
01:05:58,520 --> 01:05:59,280
I wish Xiao Jiao

1472
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:00,640
finds someone in the future

1473
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:01,400
who truly

1474
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:02,320
understands him.

1475
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:03,880
Alright.

1476
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:05,360
Our confessions continue.

1477
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:06,400
Next up,

1478
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,440
we'll see

1479
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:08,520
Doctor Fang and Lan Lan

1480
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:09,520
how they'll

1481
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,560
express their feelings.

1482
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:12,680
Let's keep watching.

1483
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:14,080
Looking forward to it.

1484
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:19,000
Doctor Fang is here.

1485
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:19,720
Doctor Fang.

1486
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,600
Can't wait for his confession.

1487
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:53,760
Come on, connect, go.

1488
01:06:58,720 --> 01:06:59,520
Hello?

1489
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:02,480
Hello?

1490
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:04,840
Hello?

1491
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:08,560
This is Doctor Fang.

1492
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:10,560
I know.

1493
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:12,560
Are you nervous?

1494
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:17,640
I'm nervous.

1495
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:19,560
You're nervous too.

1496
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:20,440
I'm so nervous.

1497
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:27,000
Just like the first day I met you.

1498
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:29,600
I didn't know whether to sit

1499
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:30,960
or stand.

1500
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,120
But

1501
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:34,040
that day,

1502
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:35,640
I was so happy

1503
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:36,760
to meet a princess.

1504
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:42,840
Hello.

1505
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:44,440
My name is Xu Rulan.

1506
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:45,200
Xu Rulan.

1507
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:46,320
Yes.

1508
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:50,840
Doctor Fang still

1509
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:51,840
came to the house

1510
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:53,320
and never looked at anyone else from the start.

1511
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:53,760
Yes.

1512
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:08,240
At the dinner party,

1513
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,240
weren't we supposed to pick gifts?

1514
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,240
I put a little extra thought into it.

1515
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:16,760
When I first arrived,

1516
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:18,400
only you and Wang Jue

1517
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,920
were the two girls there.

1518
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:24,440
That day, I really wanted your gift.

1519
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:27,400
So I volunteered to pick first.

1520
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:30,920
But with a fifty-fifty chance,

1521
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:32,720
I still missed it.

1522
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:39,920
Later, there was another time

1523
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:40,920
when we could

1524
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:43,360
choose our date ourselves, right?

1525
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:45,280
So I just

1526
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:46,720
from

1527
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:48,600
I didn't even

1528
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:49,960
read the message clearly.

1529
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,160
I rushed down the stairs to get there.

1530
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,600
I thought it was first come, first served.

1531
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,200
But after I saw what you drew,

1532
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:14,240
I immediately

1533
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:15,120
knew.

1534
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,120
I think I made the right choice.

1535
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:21,360
Okay.

1536
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:25,680
Then we

1537
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:27,160
went to make pearls.

1538
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:35,760
Do you remember

1539
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:37,040
that one time

1540
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,240
we drew

1541
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,400
portraits of each other?

1542
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:42,040
I remember.

1543
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:44,600
That was probably the first time

1544
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:45,600
I dared to openly

1545
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:48,560
stare at you so boldly.

1546
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:55,880
I was totally smitten.

1547
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,600
Turns out, drawing does that.

1548
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,160
You can look openly.

1549
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:08,280
It made the air feel sweet.

1550
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:11,600
You are truly beautiful.

1551
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:15,920
So sweet.

1552
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:22,680
And we made breakfast together.

1553
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,320
You once said

1554
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:27,000
you don't really like carbs.

1555
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,840
But that day, I made

1556
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:29,880
scallion oil noodles.

1557
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:32,400
You said they were tasty.

1558
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:33,680
That made me happy.

1559
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:35,920
It's the best scallion oil noodles I've had.

1560
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:36,960
Really?

1561
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:39,200
Really.

1562
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:41,840
Absolutely true.

1563
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:50,240
If I get the chance,

1564
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:52,280
I want to

1565
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:53,840
make breakfast for you often.

1566
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,480
Breakfast is great. Breakfast.

1567
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:02,040
Wake up together, eat together.

1568
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:17,560
You know,

1569
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:19,680
there's a term in medicine called

1570
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:20,960
afterimage

1571
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:22,440
afterimage.

1572
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:24,200
It means

1573
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,720
if you stare at something

1574
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:27,200
bright for a long time,

1575
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:30,000
even after you look away,

1576
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,160
you still see

1577
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,400
its image in front of you.

1578
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,320
What I want to say is,

1579
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,000
you're like my

1580
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:41,720
afterimage.

1581
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,200
Because you shine so brightly in my eyes.

1582
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:49,800
Now that's a

1583
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:50,760
professional term.

1584
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:52,280
That's how a science major confesses.

1585
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:53,760
It's got its own style.

1586
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:55,960
What I mean is,

1587
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:58,520
you're like my

1588
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,280
afterimage.

1589
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:03,760
That's just

1590
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:08,040
Maybe all of you

1591
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:10,440
is imprinted on my retina now.

1592
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,840
You are my afterimage.

1593
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:17,640
You could be my astigmatism too.

1594
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,440
I see you everywhere I go.

1595
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:20,960
Well, there's a solution for that.

1596
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:22,160
Just wear glasses.

1597
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:24,440
But afterimage can't be fixed.

1598
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:25,440
For eye problems,

1599
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:26,400
Doctor Fang is the one to see.

1600
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:26,840
Right.

1601
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:29,240
Maybe all of you

1602
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:31,640
is imprinted on my retina now.

1603
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:38,320
I hope to see

1604
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:39,680
the real you every day.

1605
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:45,480
All these moments

1606
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:46,640
put together

1607
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:48,440
make me even more certain

1608
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,960
I don't want the feelings from the house

1609
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,640
to stay only in the house.

1610
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,840
I want to tell you clearly

1611
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:01,800
you deserve to be chosen with certainty.

1612
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:07,080
And my choice

1613
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:08,200
has always been you.

1614
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:19,360
Do you remember

1615
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:21,160
what I said at the dinner?

1616
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:23,640
I remember.

1617
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:25,760
You said

1618
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:27,520
the message was sent late.

1619
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,520
The message was sent slowly.

1620
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:37,320
I'm really curious

1621
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:38,880
what you figured out.

1622
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:40,400
Not telling you.

1623
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:42,280
It's all for you.

1624
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,280
Because at the dinner that day,

1625
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:50,320
you didn't get a gift from the guys.

1626
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:51,280
Thank you.

1627
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:52,280
So I prepared a gift for you.

1628
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:53,400
Thank you.

1629
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:56,080
So are you

1630
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:57,680
Ke Ai or Xin Lan?

1631
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,560
Xiao Lan, I guess.

1632
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:04,160
He's always been sure.

1633
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,640
Zero five two five.

1634
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:06,640
Zero five two five is

1635
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:08,240
the day we first

1636
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:08,600
met.

1637
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:09,600
The day we met.

1638
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:16,800
Xu Rulan,

1639
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:26,360
I want to

1640
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:29,600
keep this feeling

1641
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:33,200
going with you.

1642
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:36,800
I like you.

1643
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,320
I like you.

1644
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:44,440
Like you.

1645
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:45,560
I like you.

1646
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:00,080
I have a lot I want to say to you too.

1647
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:01,920
Hope you'll listen closely.

1648
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:04,640
Come on, let me hear it too.

1649
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,720
In the past twenty-some days,

1650
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:18,080
being with you,

1651
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,200
many things you said

1652
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,640
weren't that funny,

1653
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:21,360
but

1654
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,200
they always made me laugh anyway.

1655
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:30,880
A delayed realization

1656
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:32,040
I just realized

1657
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:33,040
actually,

1658
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:35,200
it's because

1659
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:36,480
when I'm with you,

1660
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:37,960
I am genuinely

1661
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:38,720
happy.

1662
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:41,720
Those two...

1663
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,640
Your unwavering sincerity

1664
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,960
and your resolute choices

1665
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:56,320
have truly moved me.

1666
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:59,440
They've gradually opened my heart.

1667
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,720
Honestly, I'm still very curious about you.

1668
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:14,440
I also want to

1669
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:15,920
immediately

1670
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:17,800
step into your real life

1671
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:19,920
and get to know

1672
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:21,160
more sides of you.

1673
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,400
Then, together, create more

1674
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,040
shared memories just for us.

1675
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:28,000
Okay.

1676
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,240
So, right now,

1677
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:36,520
do you want to come see me?

1678
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:37,480
Come.

1679
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:38,200
I do.

1680
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:42,000
I'll wait for you at Central Station.

1681
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:43,040
Okay.

1682
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:44,960
I'll be there soon.

1683
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:46,000
Then come.

1684
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:49,400
Bye.

1685
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:50,160
He can't wait.

1686
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:50,640
Bye.

1687
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:53,240
Run!

1688
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:54,080
Go!

1689
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:03,360
It's my first time seeing someone run with a cart.

1690
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:05,320
After so many seasons,

1691
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:06,320
I've seen people run,

1692
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:07,480
but never with a cart.

1693
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:33,800
This flower is for you first.

1694
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:38,440
Thank you.

1695
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:40,160
Wait a second.

1696
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:40,840
Alright.

1697
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:45,600
Do you want to hear my heartbeat right now?

1698
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:56,160
I thought when he said heartbeat,

1699
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:57,240
he meant he'd hug her.

1700
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,000
He actually took this out.

1701
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:05,920
You want me to listen to your heartbeat?

1702
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:06,320
Yes.

1703
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:14,960
You can use it like this?

1704
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:22,400
It's fine.

1705
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:24,680
Do you know where to put it?

1706
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:25,880
I do.

1707
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:26,640
Then you place it.

1708
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:36,040
I can't really hear it, why?

1709
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:38,200
No, that's not right.

1710
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:38,840
Here.

1711
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:39,880
Here.

1712
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:56,360
Falling in love.

1713
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:10,200
I hear it.

1714
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:13,640
It's fast.

1715
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:14,920
Really fast.

1716
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,160
It's not just because I ran here.

1717
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:20,000
It's because my heart is racing.

1718
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:21,600
From day one until now,

1719
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:23,720
it's been like this every single day.

1720
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:38,360
I still have so much to tell you.

1721
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:38,960
Okay.

1722
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:41,640
Let me bring this up first.

1723
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:42,120
Okay.

1724
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:45,840
Let's see what's in the cart.

1725
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:47,200
Let me go first.

1726
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:50,160
Inside each ball here,

1727
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:53,280
there's a note.

1728
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:56,800
On it is written

1729
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:58,800
something I want to do with you

1730
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,160
outside the house.

1731
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:04,960
That's awesome.

1732
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,880
It's not too many or too few,

1733
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:08,000
exactly ninety-nine.

1734
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:08,880
Ninety-nine.

1735
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:11,360
Some might be

1736
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:12,640
pretty simple things,

1737
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:14,600
like going to the beach,

1738
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:16,120
watching the sunset in the evening,

1739
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,680
or trying every

1740
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:20,680
cilantro beef dish in a city.

1741
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,240
These ninety-nine little things

1742
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:25,480
are more like

1743
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:27,160
ninety-nine invitations.

1744
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:33,800
I want to invite you into my planned future.

1745
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:48,720
Can you help me put this down first?

1746
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:49,760
Thank you.

1747
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,360
Actually, I brought a gift today too.

1748
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:56,240
Yes.

1749
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:02,400
Even though you

1750
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:03,920
wrote things you want to do with me,

1751
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:05,600
I've kept them all in my heart.

1752
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:10,240
And this is the flower I'm giving you today.

1753
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:11,000
Thank you.

1754
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,080
It's blue.

1755
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,920
And your favorite tulips.

1756
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:15,600
So thoughtful.

1757
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:21,160
This is a blue tulip from Lan Lan for you.

1758
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:31,040
Actually, this is my first time

1759
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:32,720
receiving flowers?

1760
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:34,440
Getting flowers from a girl.

1761
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:39,800
Do you like it?

1762
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:43,800
I do.

1763
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:47,640
It matches you perfectly today.

1764
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:51,320
How did you know

1765
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:52,800
I'd wear blue today?

1766
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:55,760
I believe it's fate.

1767
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:56,480
Really, blue.

1768
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:57,680
It's blue and white.

1769
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,080
Just like this.

1770
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:03,040
You're wearing this necklace.

1771
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:03,720
Yes.

1772
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:06,120
That pearl

1773
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:07,080
is from the day

1774
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:07,520
we made it.

1775
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:08,480
I made it for you.

1776
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:08,760
Yes.

1777
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:10,840
The one we made on our date.

1778
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:12,360
You really wore it.

1779
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:15,480
You noticed all these little details.

1780
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:17,880
I'm so happy.

1781
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:20,120
He's so happy his forehead veins are popping.

1782
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:20,520
Did you see that?

1783
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:21,960
So real.

1784
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:22,880
Yeah.

1785
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:26,760
I really like it.

1786
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:29,400
I really like it.

1787
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:32,320
It matches what you're wearing today.

1788
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,840
I haven't finished saying this yet.

1789
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:39,960
Okay, go ahead.

1790
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:43,440
Among these ninety-nine little things,

1791
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:46,320
I added a special gift.

1792
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:48,240
A special one.

1793
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:51,360
It might need

1794
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:52,200
waiting.

1795
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,400
Or maybe it's a promise

1796
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:55,920
that can only be fulfilled at a certain time.

1797
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:57,480
What is it?

1798
01:22:59,280 --> 01:22:59,960
Do you want to find it yourself

1799
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:01,200
or should I find it for you?

1800
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:02,680
Let me look for it first.

1801
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:03,160
Okay.

1802
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:12,280
I see it.

1803
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:16,200
What is it?

1804
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,040
Can I open it?

1805
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:18,680
Yes, you can.

1806
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:23,760
What?

1807
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,440
Kitten voucher.

1808
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:29,400
This is for the kitten you like most.

1809
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:30,560
Abyssinian.

1810
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:33,920
I know that too.

1811
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,600
You might not be able

1812
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:36,840
to raise another cat right now.

1813
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:38,000
So I’m giving you

1814
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:41,240
this kitten voucher.

1815
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:42,440
It has no expiration date.

1816
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:43,320
It has no expiration date.

1817
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:48,240
It shows how I feel right now.

1818
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:49,600
It means I’m ready.

1819
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:53,160
Whenever you feel ready,

1820
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:54,320
we can go and bring it home.

1821
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:55,400
We can go and bring it home.

1822
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:57,440
Bring it home.

1823
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:04,360
That’s so sweet.

1824
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:12,360
Thank you.

1825
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:17,840
And I also want to say,

1826
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:24,160
Our time in the house is short.

1827
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:26,880
It might not let us

1828
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,960
decide something forever.

1829
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:31,880
But it does tell me

1830
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:33,160
one clear thing—

1831
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:34,080
I want my future

1832
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:35,200
to include you.

1833
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:39,960
So romantic.

1834
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:46,640
Outside the house,

1835
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:47,760
I want to write

1836
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,360
our own story with you.

1837
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:50,640
And I also know

1838
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:52,000
you might

1839
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:52,880
usually be

1840
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:54,080
someone who feels insecure.

1841
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:56,720
I don’t talk much either.

1842
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:59,360
But when you need me,

1843
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:02,120
I’ll always stand by you.

1844
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:03,080
Support you.

1845
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:13,000
So sweet.

1846
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:16,200
And I want to say one more thing.

1847
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:17,080
Go ahead.

1848
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:21,560
Maybe you’ll chase freedom,

1849
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:24,760
but I can be your strong support

1850
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:26,800
or go wild with you.

1851
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:28,120
That’s great.

1852
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:29,400
Really good.

1853
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:30,520
Xu Rulan.

1854
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:31,040
Here she comes.

1855
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:31,440
Come on.

1856
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,680
Will you be my girlfriend?

1857
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:42,040
I will.

1858
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:01,120
He’s so cute.

1859
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:01,800
Why do I feel like

1860
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:03,000
you’re the one who’s grown up?

1861
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,480
Why are you acting so strange?

1862
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:06,240
I feel like you’re bursting with joy.

1863
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:07,000
You’re really into it.

1864
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,080
He’s totally into it.

1865
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:09,200
I have to imagine I’m him.

1866
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:10,600
I feel so happy right now.

1867
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:11,320
Isn’t that true?

1868
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:21,160
I’m really looking forward to it.

1869
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:22,920
With a new identity,

1870
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:24,360
I want to enter the next stage with you.

1871
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:42,240
And I have a gift for you too.

1872
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:45,320
Let me give it to you.

1873
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:51,080
You open it yourself.

1874
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:52,760
What is this?

1875
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:55,280
I think I can

1876
01:26:58,440 --> 01:26:59,480
guess what it is.

1877
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:02,920
I think it might be

1878
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:04,120
glasses.

1879
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:06,040
Is it?

1880
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:06,600
Yes.

1881
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:07,800
And they’re square-shaped.

1882
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:08,640
Yes.

1883
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:09,160
Right?

1884
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:10,480
Glasses.

1885
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:12,720
I do know you pretty well.

1886
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:15,440
I have one more question.

1887
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:17,560
Should I wear glasses or not?

1888
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:19,360
Want the truth?

1889
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:20,240
Tell me the truth.

1890
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:21,480
Honestly, both look good.

1891
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:25,880
But if I pick glasses for you,

1892
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:27,000
I probably wouldn’t choose

1893
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:28,200
round frames.

1894
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:31,520
Xiao Fang should wear square glasses.

1895
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:36,160
Do you want to put them on now?

1896
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:39,800
Of course I do.

1897
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:43,640
Square glasses.

1898
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:48,200
Very Sigma Male vibe.

1899
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:51,640
Looks pretty good.

1900
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:52,320
Looks good.

1901
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:53,840
My Sigma is only for others.

1902
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:55,800
I know.

1903
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:57,600
Handsome.

1904
01:27:58,360 --> 01:27:59,720
Just a little tease between them.

1905
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:01,880
Why are you laughing?

1906
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:03,800
I don’t know, every time

1907
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:04,720
you say nothing,

1908
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:05,880
I still find it funny.

1909
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:09,200
No, it’s just you—

1910
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:11,080
Seeing someone you like makes you smile.

1911
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:12,400
Really?

1912
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:19,120
Really?

1913
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:21,080
Now it does.

1914
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:27,360
I always have.

1915
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:28,760
I often just smile at you.

1916
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:29,960
I noticed.

1917
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:34,600
What are you smiling at?

1918
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:37,720
I can’t help it.

1919
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:42,080
Smiling again.

1920
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:43,440
I’m just happy.

1921
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:44,800
Can’t help it.

1922
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,480
I just want to smile when I see you.

1923
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:52,120
Do I look that funny?

1924
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:53,400
Not funny.

1925
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:54,520
It’s because you look good.

1926
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,560
Beautiful things make me smile.

1927
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:06,600
No, I don’t want to draw.

1928
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:07,600
I just want to look at you.

1929
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:16,880
That’s way too lame.

1930
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:19,960
That’s what makes it real.

1931
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:28,120
On the first day, I thought

1932
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:29,400
you might be a bit odd.

1933
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:30,800
You mean the first day?

1934
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:31,200
Yeah.

1935
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:33,200
You’d just stare at me and Rui Long and smile.

1936
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,560
Wasn’t I staring at him?

1937
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,360
You kept saying he’s handsome.

1938
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:38,760
But he—

1939
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:40,040
I—

1940
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:42,040
I was too shy to compliment you at first.

1941
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:43,120
You know,

1942
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:44,200
I could only compliment guys.

1943
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:45,880
I was too shy to compliment girls.

1944
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:48,040
Then from now on, only compliment me.

1945
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:00,360
That look in your eyes—

1946
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:02,680
What’s wrong?

1947
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:23,360
I can't take it anymore.

1948
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:28,120
Are you still nervous?

1949
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:29,160
Not nervous.

1950
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:30,680
Not nervous.

1951
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:33,520
Happy.

1952
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:35,040
That's awesome.

1953
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:35,840
This is simply...

1954
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:39,720
This scene is so beautiful.

1955
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:41,920
What are you doing?

1956
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:45,760
No, I really looked forward to today.

1957
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:54,040
Let's go.

1958
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:54,720
Let's go.

1959
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:00,240
They're walking hand in hand.

1960
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:01,240
So romantic.

1961
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:05,320
Smells like floral water, right?

1962
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:06,760
You didn't spray it today.

1963
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:07,600
Floral water.

1964
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:09,200
You really didn't spray it today.

1965
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:09,880
Perfume?

1966
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:10,360
Yeah.

1967
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,280
It's fine, I'll spray it every day.

1968
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:22,280
Okay.

1969
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:22,960
Congratulations to our

1970
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:23,720
Doctor Fang and Lan Lan

1971
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:25,160
for becoming a couple.

1972
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:26,760
Entering together into

1973
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:27,520
the next stage

1974
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:29,320
of life.

1975
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:30,680
Best wishes.

1976
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:32,960
That's wonderful.

1977
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:34,160
Even though they didn't kiss,

1978
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:34,800
Even though they didn't kiss,

1979
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:36,520
I think it's just like...

1980
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:37,520
Like he said, what's it called...

1981
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:38,560
Afterimage.

1982
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,560
And the stethoscope,

1983
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:42,680
listening to the heartbeat.

1984
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:44,400
Yeah, that's the medical student

1985
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:45,120
exclusive confession.

1986
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:46,600
I think it's so romantic.

1987
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:46,920
And also,

1988
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:48,600
their romance

1989
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:50,000
is just like our romantic

1990
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,880
Kang Sifu Moli Cha too.

1991
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:53,600
It's truly fate.

1992
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:54,640
From their first meeting on the island

1993
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:55,840
to every

1994
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:57,120
date deepening their bond,

1995
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:59,000
every stage of their feelings

1996
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,040
has our

1997
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:02,080
Kang Sifu Moli Cha helping out.

1998
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:03,800
When Doctor Fang first met Lan Lan,

1999
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:05,280
I remember he was so nervous.

2000
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:06,880
He kept drinking Kang Sifu Moli Qing Cha.

2001
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:08,160
Turns out it was to calm his nerves.

2002
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:09,800
On their first date,

2003
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:10,480
Doctor Fang also

2004
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:12,400
held Kang Sifu Moli Flower Tea and the card

2005
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:13,720
close to his chest the whole time.

2006
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:15,360
And on their second date,

2007
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:16,640
he thoughtfully prepared our

2008
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:17,480
Kang Sifu Moli Pomelo Tea

2009
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:18,520
and jasmine flowers.

2010
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:20,480
Their confession

2011
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:21,040
Their confession

2012
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:21,720
felt to me

2013
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:23,760
just like Kang Sifu Moli Honey Tea,

2014
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:25,160
sweet and loving.

2015
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:26,200
I think their story

2016
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:26,680
also

2017
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:27,880
perfectly explains

2018
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:29,600
Jasmine blooms, fragrance arrives.

2019
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:30,760
That's the Signal of the Heart.

2020
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:31,600
Come on, friends,

2021
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:34,040
take out your

2022
01:32:34,040 --> 01:32:36,040
Kang Sifu Moli Honey Tea,

2023
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:37,400
let's celebrate together

2024
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:40,440
the birth of this season's first couple.

2025
01:32:40,440 --> 01:32:42,200
Come on, cheers!

2026
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,120
Full of jasmine fragrance.

2027
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:49,040
Sweet aftertaste.

2028
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:49,680
A must for confessions.

2029
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:52,920
Hope every day for the Ru Yi couple

2030
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:54,800
is as sweet as Kang Sifu Moli Honey Tea,

2031
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:56,200
romantic and worth remembering.

2032
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:57,280
That's great.

2033
01:33:00,440 --> 01:33:01,760
Then our confessions

2034
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:02,440
are still going on.

2035
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Next,

2036
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,520
let's keep watching.
