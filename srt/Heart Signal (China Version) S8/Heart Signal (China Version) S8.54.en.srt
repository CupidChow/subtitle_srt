1
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,720
Didn't eat a single bite.

2
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,600
He couldn't eat either.

3
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,720
Hello, Dr. Fang.

4
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,040
Duoduo is finally here.

5
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,920
Hello, Dr. Fang.

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,840
Were you the first to arrive?

7
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:32,920
No.

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,360
You weren't?

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,240
Those two went to chat.

10
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:43,520
Okay.

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,680
Then I'll sit here.

12
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,200
I'll sit here.

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:45,840
Yeah.

14
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,000
They're outside.

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,920
You guys arrived during the day?

16
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,640
We arrived a while ago.

17
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,520
Today feels different.

18
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,120
It feels really harmonious here.

19
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,440
Looks good.

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,560
I took a cool photo of you yesterday.

21
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,320
I've already exported it.

22
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,240
Was it when you were on the sofa?

23
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:28,880
Yeah.

24
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,720
And also in the kitchen.

25
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,520
Did you bring it?

26
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,560
What?

27
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,200
Did you bring it over?

28
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,560
I deleted it.

29
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,520
I put it on my phone.

30
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,520
It's on my phone now.

31
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,560
So it's a good one.

32
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,360
Finally, someone came to chat with me.

33
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,960
Duoduo really is something.

34
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,160
She radiates light.

35
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,280
She's like a little sun.

36
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:51,760
You just feel like

37
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,520
she brings warmth whenever she shows up.

38
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,080
When did they go out?

39
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,000
They've been out for a while.

40
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,080
Really?

41
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,000
We'll start when they're back.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,480
You mean start eating, right?

43
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,360
If you want to eat, we can start now.

44
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,560
No.

45
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,080
I'm just asking, I'm fine with anything.

46
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,920
I'll go with the group.

47
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,320
I'll follow everyone.

48
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:17,920
They've been talking for so long.

49
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,400
Dr. Fang is getting impatient.

50
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,560
I get it.

51
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,760
Should I call them instead?

52
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,480
I'll go.

53
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,760
Little sun.

54
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,880
That's me.

55
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,520
I'm someone who really doesn't like

56
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,640
letting bad feelings last overnight.

57
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,960
So I quickly

58
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,960
pulled you out to talk.

59
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,840
Because I worry if we drag it out,

60
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,920
it might lead to more misunderstandings.

61
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,120
I'm here.

62
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,680
Duoduo.

63
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,000
See?

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,680
Everyone who sees her seems

65
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,520
so happy.

66
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,560
It's like they're lit up.

67
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,040
Yeah.

68
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,200
She livens things up.

69
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,080
Duoduo is so important.

70
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,240
Duoduo.

71
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,400
Come on, let's eat.

72
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,120
Feeling happy now.

73
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,320
Was today tough for you?

74
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,320
Not bad.

75
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,760
I just looked forward to seeing everyone.

76
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,440
So I'm really happy.

77
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,200
You finally made it.

78
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,120
We've waited so long for you.

79
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,680
This wait...

80
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,560
I've longed for you so much.

81
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,120
Then I'll do this.

82
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,760
I'll go first.

83
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,120
You go first.

84
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,480
I'll take a sip first.

85
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,640
Jiao said we couldn't eat until you came.

86
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,440
We really, really waited for you.

87
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,200
The vibe is much better now.

88
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:23,960
Really.

89
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,120
If it's that important,

90
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,200
then I suggest we all do it together.

91
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,560
We can go boating later.

92
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:30,760
Okay.

93
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,160
Before you came,

94
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,840
the three of us took a lap.

95
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,600
Like that.

96
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,920
Now that you're here, let's go again.

97
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,920
It might feel different this time.

98
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,520
Eat a bit more.

99
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,880
How about we go to the boat?

100
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,880
Let's go.

101
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,240
It's so beautiful at night.

102
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,840
It feels totally different during the day.

103
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,000
I think it looks better at night.

104
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,680
Come on, take a photo.

105
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,560
You two take a picture of us.

106
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,760
One, two, three.

107
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,000
Alright, we've taken several shots.

108
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,280
They're nice.

109
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,520
Jiao, try this angle.

110
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,520
Take a few vertical ones for us.

111
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,040
Okay.

112
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,120
You both look like you've lost weight.

113
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,160
You said exactly what I wanted to hear.

114
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,480
Looks great, come on.

115
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,560
Looks good.

116
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,040
No matter how you pose, it looks great.

117
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,840
Thanks.

118
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,600
So pretty.

119
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,240
Can I see them later?

120
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,160
Sure.

121
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,920
This feeling...

122
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,920
It's just so beautiful.

123
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,400
We can go in July, August, or September.

124
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,120
There are lots of places like this.

125
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,600
Lots of places like this.

126
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,680
I'm good with that too.

127
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,520
Me too.

128
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:48,960
Alright.

129
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,800
Duoduo, you're awesome.

130
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,200
You really livened everyone up.

131
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,440
Did you notice...

132
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,720
Jiao suddenly seems so lively.

133
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,600
Yeah.

134
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,240
I think even we...

135
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,120
feel more alive now.

136
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,880
Yeah, all of us...

137
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,920
feel relieved.

138
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,480
We really prefer the nighttime vibe.

139
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,680
During the day, we don't even dare to look.

140
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,120
Yeah.

141
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,960
We're here.

142
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,760
Thank you.

143
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,360
Take it slow.

144
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,240
We can sit here for a bit.

145
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,640
Sure.

146
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:24,680
Okay.

147
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,160
Move the whole thing inside.

148
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,440
Be careful.

149
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,520
Alright.

150
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,120
Don't get wet.

151
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,880
This is so relaxing.

152
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,640
They have tiramisu here.

153
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,680
Can we?

154
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,120
Let's order.

155
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,640
We can go.

156
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,200
Go buy it at the shop.

157
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,160
I'll go buy it.

158
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,560
Let's go together.

159
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,040
Let's go.

160
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,400
Bring an umbrella.

161
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,280
One is enough.

162
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,440
You two are so romantic.

163
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,840
A walk in the rain.

164
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,600
Do you think they'll eat stinky tofu?

165
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,560
Did you hear them mention it?

166
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,560
Will they eat stinky tofu?

167
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,120
It's fine, let's order it.

168
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,680
They'll probably eat grilled sausages.

169
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:04,680
Hello.

170
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,000
Two stinky tofu, four grilled sausages.

171
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,440
And two orders each of tangyuan and wontons.

172
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,800
What fillings do the tangyuan have?

173
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,680
Sesame and peanut.

174
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,440
There's also local shepherd's purse with meat.

175
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,320
One shepherd's purse with meat.

176
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,640
And one more with a different filling.

177
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,920
Sesame.

178
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,040
Sesame is a safe choice, right?

179
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,760
Yeah.

180
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,040
Boss, you can start making them.

181
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,240
We'll go look around over there.

182
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,640
I think there are some snacks here.

183
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,960
They'll probably eat ribs, right?

184
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,760
Seems like a lot of people like ribs.

185
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:34,920
Let's get some vegetables.

186
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,080
Let's get some vegetables.

187
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,080
Because they're girls,

188
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,960
they might want veggies.

189
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,160
They might want veggies.

190
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,800
Okay.

191
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,760
Let's get these two.

192
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:40,720
Hello.

193
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,440
We'd like one garlic ribs.

194
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,840
And one...

195
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,560
Um...

196
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,000
You order it here.

197
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,040
Okay, no problem.

198
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,400
I feel like Xiao Jiao

199
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,240
and Dr. Fang

200
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:49,880
have developed

201
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,720
a different kind of feeling.

202
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,680
Yeah.

203
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,880
From the start, the two of them

204
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,880
both liked the same person.

205
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,680
Then suddenly, out of nowhere,

206
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,600
there's this subtle

207
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,840
friendship between us.

208
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:58,440
You know?

209
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:58,560
You know?

210
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,560
They also acknowledge each other.

211
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,200
This kind of harmony

212
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:00,720
makes you feel

213
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,000
they are

214
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,320
still have

215
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,600
a sense of mutual appreciation.

216
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,440
There's a sense of mutual appreciation.

217
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm glad you came.

218
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm glad you came.

219
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,120
What's wrong?

220
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,560
Actually, during this time,

221
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:32,760
I've been under a lot of pressure too.

222
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,920
I've been under a lot of pressure too.

223
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,520
Maybe

224
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,120
I look happy every day,

225
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,200
but I also have a lot of

226
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,400
difficult moments.

227
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,040
Even today.

228
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,360
Honestly, I was feeling down just now.

229
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,800
Before you came.

230
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,960
Yeah, but after you arrived,

231
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,800
when you saw me sitting there,

232
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,080
that was me.

233
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,880
And after you came, I felt...

234
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,240
Sometimes I wonder

235
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,600
if what I did yesterday

236
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,760
the choice I made yesterday

237
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,960
was the wrong decision.

238
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,280
It makes me feel sad.

239
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,760
And I feel a bit guilty.

240
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,360
It's like I made

241
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,600
things a little worse.

242
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,280
Things got a bit worse.

243
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,480
But I know you came.

244
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,360
That makes me feel much better.

245
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,720
Baby.

246
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,240
But I think

247
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,160
your worries

248
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,120
are something others might have too.

249
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,080
So,

250
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,600
everyone is actually prepared

251
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,040
and ready for it.

252
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,920
So I think

253
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,480
any decision you make

254
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,840
is the best decision.

255
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,040
And I believe

256
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,360
in the end, everyone will be smiling.

257
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,080
That's enough.

258
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,040
Yeah.

259
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,960
Duoduo is the best.

260
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,080
She's so good at comforting people.

261
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,760
Don't feel pressured.

262
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,280
Even though making decisions

263
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,400
usually comes with some pressure.

264
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,880
It's the same in life.

265
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,080
Even having a cup of milk tea

266
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,280
can be stressful sometimes.

267
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,560
Especially lately.

268
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,520
Yeah.

269
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,920
Be yourself.

270
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,240
Yeah, be yourself.

271
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,320
And do what you want to do.

272
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,240
I'm liking Duoduo more and more.

273
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,040
I can't take it anymore.

274
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,880
I really like her so much.

275
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,760
Should we go inside and wait for them?

276
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,240
Let's go.

277
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,640
There are so many mosquitoes here.

278
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,080
Let's go.

279
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,440
It's more comfortable inside.

280
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,200
Yeah.

281
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,560
They should be inside.

282
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,080
They should be inside.

283
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,000
You guys took so long.

284
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,080
Sorry to keep you waiting.

285
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,720
Sorry.

286
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,480
We bought a bit too much.

287
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,280
Your clothes are all wet.

288
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,280
Both of you are soaked on one side.

289
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,320
I can tell you stood on the right.

290
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:11,880
He stood on the left.

291
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,280
At least the mosquitoes didn't bite us for nothing.

292
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,120
Really.

293
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,880
Lanlan already got a bump from a bite.

294
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,120
A lot of them.

295
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,960
You can spray this.

296
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,360
Came prepared, you know.

297
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,840
Didn't expect you had something in your pocket.

298
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,000
I was just thinking

299
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,480
she might need it.

300
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,760
When will you come back and spray me?

301
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,920
Feels like we're having a feast.

302
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,320
It's delicious.

303
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,400
Thank you.

304
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,040
Cheers!

305
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,160
Here.

306
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,080
So happy.

307
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,040
So happy.

308
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,000
What did you give me?

309
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Just something to pad it.

310
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,840
There's friendship besides love.

311
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,800
This kind of friendship is really wonderful.

312
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,520
Yeah.

313
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,040
I think Duoduo

314
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,600
after she came,

315
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,840
the whole atmosphere

316
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,080
became much more comfortable.

317
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,840
Yeah.

318
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,840
Actually, that's even harder.

319
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,480
Most people might think

320
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,680
I'd rather leave.

321
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,360
I can't find myself anymore.

322
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,560
Any possibility for myself here is gone.

323
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,080
But Duoduo is still here.

324
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,480
She radiates warmth.

325
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,480
Like a little sun.

326
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,520
I just feel

327
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,320
how hard this must be.

328
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,680
She must really cherish

329
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,480
the group atmosphere.

330
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,560
Xiao Jiao went to find Lanlan.

331
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,480
To apologize.

332
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,040
I think

333
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,480
when a guy

334
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,720
shows me his

335
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,680
charming side,

336
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,120
it's his ability to solve problems.

337
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,800
Yes.

338
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,080
He wasn't happy either.

339
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,280
When he talked to Lanlan,

340
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,640
he was very specific

341
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,440
about what made him unhappy.

342
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,680
He explained the reasons.

343
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,800
Clearly.

344
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,680
In detail.

345
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,680
He told her directly.

346
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,000
That way, the other person

347
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,280
can answer his questions easily.

348
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,680
And resolve the issue efficiently.

349
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,920
To solve the conflict.

350
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,480
Otherwise, this conflict

351
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,880
couldn't be resolved so quickly.

352
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,560
I think I'd be just like Xiao Jiao.

353
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,680
I can't let a conflict last overnight.

354
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,080
A lot of people say

355
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,320
let's calm down first.

356
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,560
Let's talk when we're calm.

357
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,360
No.

358
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,160
I'm not afraid of arguing.

359
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,920
I'm just afraid when two people

360
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,520
stop talking.

361
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,440
Hide things.

362
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,600
When things pile up,

363
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,600
sooner or later, the relationship

364
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,560
will fall apart.

365
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,000
You and I are

366
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,760
exactly the same.

367
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,920
I don't like guessing.

368
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,360
I just think

369
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,040
just ask directly.

370
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,480
Yeah, don't make me guess.

371
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,160
Yeah, don't make me guess.

372
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:51,680
Because I'm someone

373
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,360
who doesn't hold grudges.

374
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,200
Once we argue, it's over.

375
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,920
But if you

376
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,240
ignore me,

377
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,000
I can't take it.

378
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,200
I really can't sleep.

379
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,960
And Xiao Jiao is willing to be

380
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,800
the one who solves problems first.

381
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:01,680
In a romantic relationship,

382
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,480
In a romantic relationship,

383
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,960
when conflicts arise,

384
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,440
I think if at that moment you

385
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,000
handle it as if it were a friendship,

386
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:07,760
it would be much better.

387
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,800
Because in love, you might feel

388
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,440
like you're being targeted.

389
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,960
But in friendship, you're less likely

390
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,560
to have that kind of obsession.

391
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,960
So I think in the midst of conflict,

392
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,120
if you approach it from a different perspective,

393
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,800
the outcome might be very different.

394
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,400
When I'm emotional or upset,

395
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,040
or not feeling happy,

396
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,000
I ask myself,

397
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,120
does what I'm upset about now

398
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,840
really matter in three years,

399
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,560
or five years from now?

400
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,120
Will it still be important

401
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,720
in my life then?

402
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,400
Actually, it's easier

403
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,360
to not get so

404
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,760
caught up in those emotions.

405
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,280
In close relationships,

406
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,560
when you argue,

407
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,880
everyone gets a chance to say things

408
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,520
they usually want to say or ask

409
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,200
but hold back for the sake of pride.

410
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,840
Things left unsaid,

411
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,720
questions left unasked.

412
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,800
After the argument is over,

413
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,520
and both sides have calmed down,

414
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,760
we realize

415
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,600
that in your heart,

416
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,920
there was something unresolved.

417
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,520
You still care

418
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,800
about this perspective.

419
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,680
So after this argument,

420
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,200
once it's over,

421
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,320
at least the issue can be discussed.

422
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,200
There's now room to resolve it.

423
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,720
Alright, so the mood in the old town

424
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,680
has its ups and downs.

425
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,280
Now, as for

426
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,520
the other two dates,

427
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,720
what interesting things

428
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,200
will happen with them?

429
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,000
It's raining.

430
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,280
Where it's raining,

431
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,160
who will it be?

432
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,280
Chichi.

433
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,400
She looks great today.

434
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,240
Here she comes.

435
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,240
Zihan is here.

436
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,280
She's guessing who it is.

437
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,640
Hello.

438
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,640
Zihan is very happy.

439
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,640
It's complicated.

440
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,520
Come on.

441
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,240
Give it to me.

442
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,440
Looks like you didn't sleep well last night.

443
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,320
I'm okay.

444
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,400
Wait a second.

445
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,840
I happened to bring breakfast today.

446
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,280
It's this Yinlu porridge.

447
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,640
Thank you.

448
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,400
There's black rice porridge and lotus seed corn porridge.

449
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,480
See which one you want.

450
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,160
I'll have the black rice porridge.

451
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:15,640
Okay.

452
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,760
It's tasty.

453
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,080
It's soft and smooth.

454
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,040
Not too sweet, either.

455
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,960
Feels like one can is enough for breakfast.

456
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,480
Right? It's filling.

457
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,200
And it tastes good.

458
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,240
Plus, it's nutritious.

459
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,440
Perfect for breakfast.

460
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,880
Let's go.

461
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,840
Why don't you have any luggage?

462
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,760
Mine's already loaded.

463
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,320
Are you cold?

464
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,200
Then turn it up a bit.

465
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:58,920
I feel like you...

466
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,280
I feel like you're a bit cold.

467
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,200
Or you can set it to whatever you want.

468
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:02,920
It's fine, just leave it.

469
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,040
Where do you think we're going today?

470
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,400
Spring outing.

471
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,440
You're bluffing.

472
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,800
You're bluffing.

473
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,840
Spring outing.

474
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:17,960
Spring outing.

475
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,400
The weather isn't cooperating.

476
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,160
I turned this on on purpose, can you hear it?

477
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,600
Yeah.

478
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,680
I logged in with my music account.

479
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,760
You can just search with mine.

480
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:30,880
That's nice.

481
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,440
Really?

482
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:31,880
Really.

483
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,960
You can play any song you like.

484
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,840
See if they have it.

485
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:36,800
Listen.

486
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,480
Just listen.

487
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,880
Look at him swaying.

488
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,920
He's so happy.

489
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,680
I don't recognize a single word.

490
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,080
I don't know how to sing it either.

491
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,320
I don't recognize any of it.

492
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,440
Would you practice their dance with them?

493
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,520
No, I really can't.

494
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,840
We can't sing either.

495
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,160
Can't dance either.

496
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,040
Zero skills here.

497
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,880
As long as we can enjoy it.

498
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,320
Look at me, look at you.

499
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,000
Made her laugh.

500
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,600
I can only speak English.

501
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,120
You, look at me.

502
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,240
Clueless and can't do anything.

503
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,440
Can we watch music videos?

504
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:42,720
Watch music videos.

505
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,760
You're not going to start dancing, are you?

506
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:45,960
I can't dance.

507
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,000
Just sway along.

508
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,560
Please stay by my side.

509
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,320
Please stay by my side.

510
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,480
Sing to make her laugh.

511
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,680
Alright, you sing the next line.

512
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,240
You can't sing it.

513
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,120
The vibe is so nice.

514
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,800
He's got some moves.

515
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,480
Pretty good.

516
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,600
Actually, I feel like...

517
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,520
The way Chichi is with Liu Zihan...

518
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,080
It's actually really nice.

519
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,640
He uses his own humor...

520
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,400
to try to open up Chichi.

521
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,920
Giraffe park.

522
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,960
Let's go.

523
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,800
First stop, beautiful photo spot.

524
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,120
This is a wildlife park.

525
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,880
I like it.

526
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,120
I want to feed the little one.

527
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,320
Little buddy.

528
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:36,880
So cute.

529
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,240
Come here.

530
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,640
Hello.

531
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,800
Here, you go first.

532
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:48,800
Awesome.

533
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,600
Come on.

534
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:53,640
Come on.

535
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,840
You again.

536
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,120
Switch to another.

537
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:02,840
Next.

538
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,720
Next.

539
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:07,800
Next.

540
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,480
You're done here.

541
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,200
Next.

542
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,720
You're done here.

543
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,720
Zihan's emotional intelligence is off the charts.

544
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,400
He really helps people relax.

545
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,600
Little one, come here.

546
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,280
What's up with you?

547
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,600
So cute.

548
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:31,880
That's it.

549
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,240
That's it.

550
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,360
Can I pet it?

551
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,160
Try petting it while I feed it.

552
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:37,680
He really is...

553
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,200
trying all sorts of ways to make Chichi happy.

554
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:40,480
How is it?

555
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,760
Its fur is pretty rough.

556
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:43,920
Come here.

557
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,440
So tall.

558
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,640
I'll go get an umbrella.

559
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,360
Change it.

560
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,120
Next one.

561
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,640
This one.

562
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,480
We're closed now.

563
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,720
He's really interesting.

564
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,560
What do you think about walking in the rain?

565
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:02,600
What do you think about walking in the rain?

566
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,080
What do you think about walking in the rain?

567
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,280
If we walk in the rain,

568
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,520
it's quite

569
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,360
unique.

570
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,600
Parrot.

571
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,760
So many parrots.

572
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,200
Raccoon.

573
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,360
This is the "golden rooster stance."

574
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,280
Hello.

575
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,120
Eat seriously and focus.

576
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,160
Look at this.

577
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,400
Feed it.

578
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,120
You fed it onto your face.

579
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,280
Still not eating.

580
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,600
This is a bit too fun.

581
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,080
So scared.

582
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,080
Put it in my hand.

583
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,840
Give it to me.

584
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,440
It's okay.

585
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,160
Can't fit anymore.

586
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,280
Look at this.

587
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,120
Be careful.

588
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,080
Go fight somewhere else.

589
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,000
They're really fighting.

590
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:49,760
They're arguing too.

591
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:50,600
Bickering.

592
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,160
If you want to fight, do it outside.

593
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,720
Don't fight in my shop.

594
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,880
He's really funny.

595
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,840
I feel like I'm running back and forth.

596
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,160
Now I feel like being with him

597
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,960
would be really happy.

598
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,200
I've already been healed.

599
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,400
So actually, you might also feel

600
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,800
that Liu Zihan is pretty nice too.

601
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,200
I'm the king of the jungle.

602
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,000
So beautiful like this.

603
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,000
This scene.

604
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,560
Tortoise.

605
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,520
So big.

606
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,920
Touch the tortoise's shell for a long life.

607
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,080
Then I'll keep my hand here.

608
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,680
Two hundred, three hundred, four hundred, five hundred.

609
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,320
We're disturbing them.

610
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:40,640
Sorry.

611
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,560
Tortoise bath.

612
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,560
Feels a bit like washing a car.

613
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,240
Feels like

614
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,480
washing a car.

615
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,040
Car wash.

616
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,280
This owner, please park your car properly.

617
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:50,880
Don't drive recklessly.

618
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,040
Chasing to wash.

619
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,880
Scrub scrub.

620
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,840
Scrub scrub.

621
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,040
Just like the day they bathed the dog.

622
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,720
Not bad.

623
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:10,840
Let's go.

624
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,040
Actually, I can't see anything clearly.

625
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,320
So now are you

626
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,320
feeling discomfort in your eyes

627
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,000
or is it blurry?

628
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,360
It's just

629
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,440
just this.

630
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:19,960
Both.

631
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,600
I think I need some drops.

632
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,240
Eye drops.

633
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,360
Not pressing.

634
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,160
What are you doing?

635
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,520
So natural.

636
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,520
I never thought using eye drops

637
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,640
could happen in this kind of situation.

638
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,360
Is this a "Help!" TV drama?

639
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,160
This is

640
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,160
Are your eyes better now?

641
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,960
This feels more like a date.

642
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,600
This is faster than ours.

643
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,680
Is this a bit too far?

644
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,080
A little.

645
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,800
Just can't reach the table.

646
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,720
Thank you.

647
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,320
How is it?

648
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,600
It's good.

649
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:36,960
Okay.

650
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,200
Alright.

651
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,080
So thoughtful.

652
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,080
Let's start with dessert.

653
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:48,640
Great!

654
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,520
I can't wait anymore.

655
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,160
I'm about to dig in.

656
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,400
French fries.

657
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:56,800
French fries.

658
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,240
We can make a wish again.

659
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,640
We can make a wish again.

660
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,360
All the time.

661
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,280
I'm really hungry.

662
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,120
I haven't been this hungry in ages.

663
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,760
Did you lose weight?

664
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,600
I feel like I did.

665
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,560
But the scale doesn't show it.

666
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,200
When they left yesterday,

667
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,840
I really felt the time in the house.

668
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,000
I really...

669
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,320
I...

670
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,400
felt pretty bad.

671
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,600
To be honest,

672
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,760
since the night before last,

673
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,400
I've felt pretty down.

674
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,000
Is it because of Ruilong?

675
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,080
You just feel a bit lost.

676
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,920
Because I hoped everyone would

677
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,640
leave here happy.

678
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,640
But that day,

679
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:57,920
everyone was in tears.

680
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,840
Honestly, I felt really bad.

681
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,480
I can't watch that kind of thing.

682
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,840
And sometimes, because you're too

683
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,120
empathetic, you don't know how to

684
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,160
comfort others.

685
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:13,840
It feels even worse.

686
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,560
I'm mainly worried about Chichi.

687
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,360
I hope she doesn't do things

688
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,880
against her nature.

689
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,280
We're all looking out for each other.

690
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,640
Even last night,

691
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,440
we talked about being in the house,

692
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,760
and whether we've changed.

693
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,360
It's different from real life.

694
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,960
Actually, I think

695
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,400
I've changed, if I think about it.

696
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,320
In real life,

697
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,040
I'm straightforward.

698
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,960
But in the house,

699
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,800
I've become more cautious.

700
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,200
I've become

701
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,880
less direct.

702
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,640
I get it, it's like

703
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,000
So what I wanted to say yesterday is,

704
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,160
whether outside the house

705
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,240
or inside, it's all

706
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,680
the real you.

707
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,440
It's just that outside,

708
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,440
you didn't realize

709
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,320
this side of yourself.

710
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,240
Now, in this

711
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:20,960
environment,

712
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,360
maybe this side comes out.

713
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:22,960
But that's also

714
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,080
you.

715
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,840
I don't really like this version of me.

716
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,800
I feel like I'm someone who often

717
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,640
denies myself.

718
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,360
But you're someone who doesn't regret your actions.

719
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,680
But not regretting is just

720
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,560
because I can't regret.

721
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,000
She's still very clear-headed.

722
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,800
Maybe she's just

723
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,320
more doubtful about herself.

724
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,200
Like today,

725
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,800
I made a really bad fried rice.

726
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,880
I'd feel pretty upset too.

727
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,080
If you think it's bad,

728
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,240
doesn't mean others do.

729
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,640
But I just think it's bad.

730
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,240
But if someone finishes it for you,

731
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,480
would you think it's

732
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,520
I'd feel they're just sparing my feelings.

733
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,640
They forced themselves to eat it.

734
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,600
He really had a hard time.

735
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,680
It's so tough.

736
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:40,840
So actually,

737
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,520
maybe at first,

738
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,000
your expectations for your fried rice

739
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,640
were a bit too high.

740
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,000
He's really good at finding angles.

741
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,720
You don't have a clear sense of yourself, right?

742
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,920
You thought you could make it taste great,

743
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,680
but actually, you didn't.

744
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,920
Expectation management.

745
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,320
It's also possible

746
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,680
to help you feel more confident,

747
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,520
every time we meet,

748
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,280
I can compliment you three times first.

749
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,400
Every time we meet,

750
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,160
I can say three nice things about you.

751
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,520
Every day we meet,

752
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,000
That's worth learning.

753
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,320
I think you can also

754
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,960
find confidence

755
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,960
in small things.

756
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,160
Every little achievement

757
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,560
will give you

758
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,280
progress and confidence.

759
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,560
How about that?

760
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,760
When I face it, I might feel

761
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,600
when I face

762
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,280
very enthusiastic people,

763
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,600
you subconsciously

764
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,160
protect yourself.

765
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,680
I've wrapped myself up pretty well.

766
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,200
Actually,

767
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,440
it's quite

768
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,640
on one hand, I want

769
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,880
to be chosen firmly.

770
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,000
That's for sure.

771
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,960
But on the other hand, I feel

772
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,000
I'm really worried

773
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,920
that this warmth and happiness

774
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,400
will disappear in a flash.

775
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,680
It can be taken away at any time.

776
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,440
So I'm afraid of falling into

777
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,400
this kind of situation.

778
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,680
If I really enjoy it

779
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,680
or really like this feeling,

780
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,280
but when it's gone,

781
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,640
I'll have nothing left.

782
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,080
She's already starting to feel insecure.

783
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,520
That might actually be a good sign.

784
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,240
She's starting to feel anxious about gains and losses.

785
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,200
She said

786
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,320
on one hand, I want to be chosen firmly,

787
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,560
so she enjoys it.

788
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,560
But she's afraid this passion

789
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,240
will fade quickly.

790
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,480
She's already starting to feel

791
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,840
insecure.

792
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,240
She's afraid to let herself accept this warmth.

793
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,560
To enjoy this passion.

794
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,720
One day, if this passion

795
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,960
doesn't last anymore,

796
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,760
she'll get hurt.

797
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,080
But

798
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,080
I think this is

799
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,520
a feeling of anxiety about gains and losses.

800
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,480
Usually, it's when you have feelings for someone

801
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,440
or when there's a possibility,

802
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,400
that you start to worry about this.

803
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,560
Makes sense.

804
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,120
I think I'm like that too.

805
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,520
I don't think you should feel pressured

806
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,320
to

807
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,920
accept others' kindness

808
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,000
or anything like that.

809
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,840
You deserve it.

810
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,160
Handsome.

811
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:54,880
Cool.

812
00:30:59,080 --> 00:30:59,840
We match.

813
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,840
You're just great.

814
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,360
Actually, like you asked before,

815
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,480
is similarity or complementarity more important?

816
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,560
I think having similar values

817
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,880
is enough.

818
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,840
The rest doesn't matter.

819
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,200
The rest doesn't matter.

820
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,080
I can go along with others' pace.

821
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,600
I mean, for example,

822
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,800
you might think some things

823
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,280
are as fleeting as fireworks.

824
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:57,840
You can

825
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,280
let the fireworks go off a few more times.

826
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,600
A few more times.

827
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,000
Let the fireworks go off a few more times.

828
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,400
See if they're always this dazzling.

829
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,280
If you're afraid of it

830
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,320
it flashes by

831
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,520
like a shooting star

832
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,200
you can

833
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,120
watch it a bit longer

834
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,080
Amazing

835
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,960
The charm of a mature man

836
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,480
Handsome

837
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:50,760
Let's go then

838
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,840
I'll drive

839
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,280
You drive

840
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,640
Finally saw the "turn-back meal"

841
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,160
What?

842
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,440
You drive

843
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,040
Wait a second

844
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:16,440
Sorry

845
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,160
Don't be nervous

846
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,600
I'm not nervous

847
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,560
Reading the hurt I gave you

848
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,120
I can't forgive myself

849
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:38,560
Just pretend I'm no longer here

850
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,520
You go to concerts

851
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,760
That must be pretty relaxing

852
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,000
Jumping around

853
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,360
Shouting a bit

854
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,160
Mainly, there are lots of people at concerts

855
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,720
Even if you sing off-key, no one will notice

856
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,360
Yeah

857
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,360
That's right

858
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,280
No problem

859
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:56,640
See?

860
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,840
Zihan always has his own way

861
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,440
to make Chichi

862
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,520
feel comfortable

863
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,800
throughout the process

864
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,800
He also gives very firm

865
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,000
and focused praise

866
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,480
I think this

867
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,840
is also important in a relationship

868
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,600
really needed

869
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,840
Yeah, Chichi is also gradually

870
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,880
getting more relaxed

871
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:13,920
She said she couldn't sing

872
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,920
She said she couldn't sing

873
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,520
but ended up having a great time singing

874
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,520
That's right

875
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,640
I think he's funny

876
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,720
He used that umbrella

877
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,240
to stop the giraffe from eating

878
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:24,840
"Little troublemaker"

879
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:25,880
So cute

880
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,040
Yeah

881
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,880
I think Zihan really

882
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,600
can influence others

883
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,160
and get people involved

884
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,320
He's great at responding to others

885
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,920
Yeah, he's really good at it

886
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,600
So next

887
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,960
it's our

888
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,880
Yuxing and Yifan

889
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,840
date

890
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,840
This one might be a bit

891
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,280
Well

892
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,520
Let's see

893
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,240
Yifan's reaction

894
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,200
will be like

895
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,400
And let's see Yuxing

896
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,520
on this date

897
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:53,880
and what kind of

898
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,800
expression he'll show

899
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,760
Yifan

900
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,680
Yuxing is here

901
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:21,720
Hello

902
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:23,760
Hi

903
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,200
Yifan is happy now

904
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,160
Is it heavy?

905
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,560
It's fine

906
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:31,960
Get in the car

907
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,440
Okay

908
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,440
I'm starting to regret wearing a hat today

909
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,440
because I can't lean my head on the seat

910
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,560
You can take it off then

911
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,800
It's fine, I'll keep it on for now

912
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,160
I said today that wearing this makes me look like

913
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,840
I'm wearing a bamboo hat

914
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,240
But I think it's great for a trip

915
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,200
But after she learned why Yuxing came this time

916
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,920
after knowing the reason he showed up

917
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,400
I think it's just

918
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,200
so cruel

919
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,560
But I think she's already prepared

920
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,840
because he already rejected her once

921
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,880
She said she'd try even if there's only a one percent chance

922
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,520
Thinking about how to start the conversation

923
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,560
Your date choice yesterday

924
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,080
I was quite surprised

925
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:28,920
Why?

926
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,960
Because I thought you'd go with Rulan

927
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,800
First, you and Rulan are pretty good friends

928
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,280
And also

929
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,080
But yesterday we actually went through

930
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,200
After careful consideration

931
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,240
That's how we made our choice

932
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,080
Did you make the decision because of Duoduo?

933
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,720
And that's why you decided this way?

934
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,960
At the time, I thought

935
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,880
Only those who need to make a choice

936
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,320
Need that one-on-one time

937
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,520
But

938
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,000
If you've already made your choice

939
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,880
It doesn't really matter what you do

940
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,080
She's determined to choose Yuxing

941
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,360
Are you speaking from a girl's perspective?

942
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,640
Is that why you say this?

943
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,240
Not really from anyone's perspective

944
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,360
But if you've already decided in your heart

945
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,360
It's the same no matter where you are

946
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,440
Yifan means

947
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,720
I get it even if you don't say it

948
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,400
If you've made up your mind

949
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,920
It's the same wherever you are

950
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,000
I feel like I'm someone

951
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,920
Who easily

952
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,000
Trusts others quickly

953
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,800
And might give my true feelings

954
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,200
To others

955
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,680
Sometimes I really don't overthink things

956
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,160
It has its pros and cons

957
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,320
I think this way

958
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,200
Reminds me

959
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,960
Of Cheer Chen's "Too Smart"

960
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,160
Come on, sing it

961
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,640
I can't sing it

962
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,240
Every time you mention a song

963
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,040
I have to think about which one it is

964
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,440
Unless you tell me the tune

965
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,120
I'd rather not embarrass myself

966
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,800
Still holding back a bit

967
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,920
When we become

968
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,120
Really good friends

969
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:27,240
I'll sing freely without caring

970
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,680
He's drawing boundaries

971
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,400
So what he means is

972
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,200
When I hang out with you

973
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,240
I just want to have fun, nothing more

974
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,240
Not asking you to do anything for me

975
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:36,520
Not expecting anything from you

976
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,040
That's nice

977
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,360
Yifan must be feeling sad too

978
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,200
Let's just enjoy this trip

979
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:04,920
We're here

980
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,640
Heart Pond

981
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,560
I want to sit here

982
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:22,880
Thank you

983
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,440
Thanks

984
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,240
It's a bit sweet

985
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:29,840
Is it sweet?

986
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,080
I usually drink things

987
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,280
A bit less sweet than this

988
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,720
So you don't really like sweets

989
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,200
When I eat sweets on my own

990
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,400
It means I'm in a bad mood

991
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:46,760
Sometimes maybe you

992
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,480
Eat something sweet when you're feeling down

993
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,080
You'll feel

994
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,120
A lot better

995
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,840
I think working out when you're down

996
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,680
Sweating a bit

997
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,880
Also helps

998
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,760
Do you go hiking?

999
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,440
If you hike, will you stick with it?

1000
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,280
Yes

1001
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:03,960
I will

1002
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,360
I do

1003
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,600
Even if it's really high

1004
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,120
Yes

1005
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,080
I don't like giving up

1006
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,480
I feel if you give up

1007
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:09,680
You'll miss better views ahead

1008
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,120
There are better views ahead

1009
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:11,920
Then you'll miss out

1010
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:14,840
True

1011
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,320
I'm also very persistent

1012
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,320
I don't quit halfway

1013
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,400
Yuxing means he won't give up on Chichi

1014
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,360
But Yifan says she'll stick with Yuxing

1015
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,680
I won't give up on you

1016
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,800
I'm also very persistent

1017
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,800
I don't leave halfway

1018
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,920
The present matters most

1019
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,640
Let's go.

1020
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,560
What's this white thing?

1021
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,320
You mean that white one?

1022
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:13,880
Yeah.

1023
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,280
Outdoor movie.

1024
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:24,640
Remote control.

1025
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,160
You do it.

1026
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:25,960
I'll do it.

1027
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:27,760
Look at this.

1028
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:28,560
Okay.

1029
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,400
"Begin Again: New York Encounter"

1030
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,960
Have you ever watched a movie outdoors like this?

1031
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,760
Yes.

1032
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,520
Yeah.

1033
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,600
I watched one in the park when I was a kid.

1034
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,080
I think the atmosphere here

1035
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,400
is something I really like.

1036
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,000
There's a movie I like,

1037
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,360
and the rain I enjoy,

1038
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,400
plus someone I like.

1039
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,040
I thought you meant the scene in the movie.

1040
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:20,920
With good friends,

1041
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,240
hanging out, having a drink,

1042
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,400
Yeah, that's my life too.

1043
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,720
He's emphasizing again that we can only be friends.

1044
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,640
And it's a coincidence,

1045
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,640
the female lead actually

1046
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,560
her best friend is also

1047
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,520
a friend of the opposite sex.

1048
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,160
Because I often

1049
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,520
get asked a question,

1050
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,600
do you believe

1051
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,160
men and women can have pure friendship?

1052
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,000
She's talking about the two of them.

1053
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,320
I believe it.

1054
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:00,920
You believe it?

1055
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,480
I do.

1056
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,360
Their feelings are actually pretty complicated.

1057
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,920
But I feel most people would say

1058
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,000
they don't believe it.

1059
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,080
The key is boundaries.

1060
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,080
Right?

1061
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,040
Boundaries matter.

1062
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:23,400
Right?

1063
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,000
When it comes to relationships,

1064
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,760
sometimes there's no solution.

1065
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,680
Relationship issues.

1066
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,080
If you don't like someone, you just don't.

1067
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,600
Not liking is just not liking.

1068
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,440
What? Did I swear an oath or something?

1069
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,440
Why is it raining so hard?

1070
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,360
Maybe someone's "going through trials" in the mountains.

1071
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,880
I'm "going through trials" in the mountains.

1072
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,640
What kind of trial?

1073
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,080
A love trial.

1074
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,920
Honestly, I feel bad she's still forcing a smile.

1075
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,120
A love trial.

1076
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,560
What you said just makes me feel

1077
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,280
No, I'm just going through life's trials.

1078
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,120
It's so sad, anyone hearing it would feel sad.

1079
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,440
I think Yifan has already accepted it.

1080
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,640
She knows Yuxing sees her as a friend.

1081
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,040
And she's okay with Yuxing

1082
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:31,880
seeing her as a friend.

1083
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,760
I think Yuxing, just like before,

1084
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,880
when he was making that

1085
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,200
decision,

1086
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,800
didn't want Yifan

1087
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,160
to have more misunderstandings.

1088
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,320
I think this date

1089
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,720
he set the boundaries very clearly.

1090
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,080
It's a sign of growth.

1091
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:47,920
And self-improvement.

1092
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,760
Yifan is still very persistent.

1093
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,240
She already knows the outcome.

1094
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,240
I believe after this, Yuxing

1095
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,440
might reflect on things.

1096
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,800
Maybe next time,

1097
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,440
right from the start,

1098
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,320
he'll set the boundaries

1099
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,000
even clearer.

1100
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,320
Hope he grows in this way.

1101
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,120
So next,

1102
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:12,080
we switch gears

1103
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:12,840
and head to

1104
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,240
a place where it's not raining.

1105
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,720
We're going to follow the Leyuan couple's

1106
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,720
trial love trip.

1107
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,360
Let's see their

1108
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,840
romantic journey.

1109
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:08,600
This weather

1110
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,800
They definitely can't see this in Jiaxing

1111
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,600
We found a place where it's not raining

1112
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,720
It's been days since I last saw

1113
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,240
such a sunny day

1114
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,960
So beautiful

1115
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,440
Gorgeous

1116
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:29,720
Eagle

1117
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,120
I see it

1118
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,440
A woman like an eagle

1119
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,200
Niu Niu

1120
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:37,920
Little calf, look at that

1121
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,920
So many sheep on the hill

1122
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:43,720
Lambs

1123
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,320
This horse is so relaxed

1124
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,960
Why do horses like to stay together in pairs?

1125
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,440
Why are they facing each other like that?

1126
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:51,560
Showing affection

1127
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:52,560
Showing affection

1128
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,000
These two horses

1129
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,280
This is so romantic

1130
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,200
This is beautiful

1131
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,120
We should play that song now

1132
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,520
"Flowers" by Huichundan

1133
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:06,680
How does it go?

1134
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,400
You haven't heard it?

1135
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,520
Sing it, maybe I'll recognize it

1136
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,360
What are you doing, warming up your voice?

1137
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,040
You sing

1138
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,640
Aren't you tone-deaf? You're still going to sing?

1139
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,320
Why doesn't this car have an eject button?

1140
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,680
This is really fun

1141
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:31,520
Is there one that can just

1142
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,280
pop you out instantly?

1143
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,160
So disrespectful to elders

1144
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,160
Do you care about the young?

1145
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,720
Do you care about the young?

1146
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,200
I do care about the young

1147
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,320
I haven't seen you care about the young

1148
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,200
Darn it, I just love this

1149
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,040
I really like how they get along

1150
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:51,760
Yeah

1151
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,480
Pretty caring, actually

1152
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,360
Why are these two so lovey-dovey?

1153
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:06,400
You really don't know

1154
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,600
what we're doing today?

1155
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,800
What are you looking forward to doing?

1156
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:10,680
I'm looking forward to it

1157
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,520
You can make a wish

1158
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,160
I'll make a wish

1159
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,760
I'm your wishing bottle

1160
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,760
Then you have to make it come true

1161
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,080
If you don't, I won't make a wish

1162
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,000
So you'll cry, right?

1163
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:20,520
I'll cry

1164
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,120
I'll cry for you to see

1165
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,520
I want to use the bathroom, are you coming?

1166
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,080
You're not going?

1167
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:34,640
Don't cry secretly by yourself

1168
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,560
Come find me when you cry

1169
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,840
Which one should she wear?

1170
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,160
The white one

1171
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:51,760
This one looks good

1172
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:52,760
Right?

1173
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,000
Such a tall guy

1174
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:54,960
It's not for me

1175
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:56,960
It's for the girl

1176
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,360
This owner is awesome

1177
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:02,560
Wait a bit

1178
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:03,840
Get a hat

1179
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,480
Just take this one

1180
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,480
That's so thoughtful

1181
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,400
Do you need a bag?

1182
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:10,920
No need, it's fine

1183
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:11,600
Thank you

1184
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,080
Don't cry

1185
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,120
Look

1186
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:16,440
Look

1187
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,120
What?

1188
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,160
Shawl

1189
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:21,920
And yours

1190
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,120
Bib

1191
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:23,680
What's this?

1192
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,120
You can wear it while eating

1193
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:25,560
Did you know?

1194
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:26,040
You're silly

1195
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:26,760
Just in case you spill

1196
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,200
And there's a neck pillow too

1197
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:29,600
Thank you

1198
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,360
I'll put this behind me

1199
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,480
So sweet

1200
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,080
Wear this on the road

1201
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,040
This is so considerate

1202
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,080
You instantly made me laugh

1203
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:59,160
Let's go

1204
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:01,880
This one's good

1205
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,400
With this, my head won't hurt on the plane

1206
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,080
All wobbly.

1207
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,000
This is really beautiful.

1208
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,720
Quick, take a photo.

1209
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,680
You take it, I can't.

1210
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,040
Selfie.

1211
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,040
Leave a selfie on your phone.

1212
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,600
Leave a selfie on your phone.

1213
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:29,040
Got it.

1214
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,920
I'll use it as my wallpaper tonight.

1215
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,320
I'll use it as my wallpaper tonight.

1216
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:38,840
"To ward off evil."

1217
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:39,640
"To ward off evil."

1218
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,960
This is so pretty, hurry and take a photo.

1219
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,040
How did you know I was taking your picture?

1220
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,000
That jawline.

1221
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,280
Can you take the photo first, tease me later?

1222
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:04,920
Otherwise, we can't get it back together.

1223
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,000
Get out of the car.

1224
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,520
Isn't this what couples do every day?

1225
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:21,720
That's so funny.

1226
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,280
That effortless charm.

1227
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:25,880
Give me one.

1228
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,920
You can take a selfie of us.

1229
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:29,760
That's a good idea.

1230
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:33,960
They're so sweet.

1231
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,640
They make a great pair.

1232
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,280
Are we there?

1233
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,040
It's not that one up ahead, is it?

1234
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,800
A building like a garden?

1235
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,680
My wish came true.

1236
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,240
I hope we get to stay in a big villa.

1237
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:46,920
I still have to rely on you.

1238
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,720
Is it next door?

1239
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:55,640
Let me check out yours.

1240
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,280
Yours should be the same as mine, right?

1241
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,200
Probably the same.

1242
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:10,480
It's the same.

1243
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:10,920
Same.

1244
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,640
Where else? Let's take a look around.

1245
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,160
What's over there?

1246
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,520
Is this the balcony?

1247
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,000
Such a big balcony.

1248
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,000
Where there's Kang Shifu Jasmine Tea,

1249
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:22,560
there must be a story.

1250
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,400
Looking forward to what will happen here.

1251
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:29,600
Can't wait.

1252
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,400
What do you want to happen?

1253
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:31,560
What do you want to happen?

1254
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,000
I've got a lot in mind.

1255
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
You've got a lot in mind.

1256
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:34,680
That's right.

1257
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:45,720
You go change first.

1258
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:46,160
Okay.

1259
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:46,960
Once we're changed, let's go out.

1260
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:50,680
Let's take a photo.

1261
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:51,600
Let's take a group photo.

1262
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:53,600
You two can interact a bit.

1263
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:54,560
Let's go.

1264
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:56,400
What's going on?

1265
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:00,640
It has to be you.

1266
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:03,200
Let's go.

1267
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:04,920
Let's go.

1268
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,640
Very proactive, that's great.

1269
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,040
I'll stand here.

1270
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,320
You stand on the steps.

1271
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,160
Just take one of you.

1272
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,440
So pretty.

1273
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,400
Looks like a comic.

1274
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,480
Let's go.

1275
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,680
I'll take you to do something really exciting.

1276
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:32,360
What?

1277
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,280
Go rock climbing.

1278
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,240
Sure.

1279
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,560
There's also Via Ferrata.

1280
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:36,760
I'm looking forward to it.

1281
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,080
As long as it's not scary.

1282
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,520
We're here.

1283
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:43,760
We've arrived.

1284
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:46,520
Take two more photos.

1285
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:47,360
What?

1286
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:47,760
What?

1287
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:48,840
Take two more photos.

1288
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:49,760
Come on.

1289
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:57,360
So pretty.

1290
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,880
This one is so sweet.

1291
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,160
This one looks great.

1292
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,440
Let's put on our safety gear.

1293
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,240
Getting ready to go in.

1294
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,280
Should I go first or should she?

1295
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,240
Either way, it's up to you.

1296
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,240
I'll go first then.

1297
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,240
I'll go down first.

1298
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,240
It's so high.

1299
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,280
Feels pretty fun.

1300
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:23,960
Awesome.

1301
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,520
Awesome.

1302
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,520
That was really fun.

1303
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,520
Let's just sunbathe here.

1304
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,040
Feels so natural.

1305
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:49,560
Okay.

1306
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,320
Like two cartoon characters.

1307
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,960
Lechen is so proactive.

1308
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:14,520
Let's go, let's keep going.

1309
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:29,640
Picking flowers for Yuanyuan.

1310
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:30,960
I'll just pick one, okay?

1311
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:31,880
Not greedy.

1312
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:37,720
Where's your flower?

1313
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,040
Where's your flower?

1314
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,280
It's gone.

1315
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,120
The flower is bare.

1316
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,440
The petals got blown away.

1317
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:49,320
There's still some here.

1318
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:54,480
That's impressive.

1319
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,560
Squatting up there is nerve-wracking.

1320
00:56:58,520 --> 00:56:59,440
You're good at this.

1321
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:00,800
A complete flower.

1322
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:02,640
A complete flower.

1323
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,520
Thank you.

1324
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,800
That guy in the back is acting like me.

1325
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:07,240
I'm that person.

1326
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,320
Edit my face onto him later.

1327
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,400
Thank you.

1328
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:16,760
Then I'll just have to carry it in my mouth.

1329
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:17,480
Yeah.

1330
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:19,360
Make it harder for me.

1331
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,040
You can pin it here.

1332
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,200
Then pin it for me.

1333
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:25,960
Sure.

1334
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:27,840
Take a look.

1335
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:30,200
Can you stick it?

1336
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:30,840
Stick it on yours.

1337
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:31,440
Sure.

1338
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:32,960
In your earring hole.

1339
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,040
You.

1340
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,320
So cute.

1341
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:40,480
Smells so good.

1342
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,680
The one you picked.

1343
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:45,280
A heart.

1344
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,240
It's even heart-shaped.

1345
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:48,880
What do you want to shout?

1346
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,000
I want to shout.

1347
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:52,520
Shout what?

1348
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,600
Wang Lechen, you jerk!

1349
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:56,760
I'll go to that

1350
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,480
pointy spot and shout.

1351
00:57:59,080 --> 00:57:59,880
Come on, you shout.

1352
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,600
Shout to the mountains, rivers, and lakes.

1353
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,160
Today I'm not being a workhorse.

1354
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:49,840
Today I'm riding a horse.

1355
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:51,280
Why isn't it moving?

1356
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,280
Be good, sweetheart.

1357
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:54,840
Turns out it's following me.

1358
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,120
Then you have to follow me.

1359
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,120
Now I'm following you.

1360
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,680
Guess I'll have to run away with you.

1361
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,360
Let's ride off together.

1362
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:08,240
Life is a wilderness.

1363
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,480
I haven't cheered myself up today.

1364
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,280
I forgot.

1365
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,200
I'll cheer you up.

1366
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,080
Three compliments for her.

1367
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:18,880
So sweet.

1368
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,440
You keep your word.

1369
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:21,920
This is great.

1370
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:22,760
Wipe the lens.

1371
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,600
You're good at finding things.

1372
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:26,640
I think

1373
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,400
First, I want to make my stance clear.

1374
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,840
What stance?

1375
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:30,280
Accompany.

1376
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:34,520
It's the day to gather for the trip.

1377
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:35,120
Hello.

1378
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:36,080
Have you settled in?

1379
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:36,800
Hi.

1380
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,320
(Lanlan) heads straight for Dr. Fang.

1381
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:39,280
The seat next to him.

1382
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,360
So where did you guys go?

1383
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,000
We went to see the animal migration.

1384
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:42,680
I don't believe it.

1385
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:43,440
Really.

1386
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,480
You went to the zoo.

1387
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:47,440
There were some little incidents.

1388
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:48,960
Tell me about the incidents.

1389
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,800
Then I'll tell you one from here.

1390
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:51,360
A secret.

1391
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,040
Go ahead, tell yours.

1392
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,040
What secret of yours?

1393
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:00,080
I was wondering what he was going to say.
