1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,040
I think there are two sides to it.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,160
One is external, the other is internal.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,840
Externally, I think your smile is beautiful.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,080
Yeah.

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,640
Just like right now.

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,160
Yeah.

7
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,440
And internally,

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,880
I feel you're very talkative,

9
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,600
and you have goals in life.

10
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,600
On our first meeting,

11
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,840
Do you think there might be some misunderstanding?

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,600
Actually, I'm not that talkative.

13
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,800
And at first,

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,040
I tend to have

15
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,440
social distance.

16
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,920
I put up a protective shell.

17
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,320
I feel like you do that too.

18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,800
You're really afraid of losing things.

19
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,120
Yeah, because I'm afraid of losing,

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,440
I don't want to have them.

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,880
I'm afraid to have them.

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,280
I think I understand all your concerns.

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,480
From my perspective,

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,800
I definitely get it.

25
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,520
But

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,800
I'll do my best to

27
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,720
make you feel, for example,

28
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,240
less worried about these things.

29
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,400
But I think you just

30
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,880
You're really great.

31
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,320
Do you see me as

32
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,120
a very confident person?

33
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,440
I can sense that.

34
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,920
You might have some

35
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,440
But you try hard to show

36
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,400
a very optimistic and cheerful girl.

37
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,280
So that day,

38
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,720
when we played badminton,

39
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,600
I should've asked you to talk about

40
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,920
your strengths.

41
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,600
Mind and body in sync.

42
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,920
You're really nice.

43
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,160
What about you?

44
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,240
What did you think of me at first?

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,920
On our first meeting,

46
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,680
I think you're good at expressing yourself too.

47
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,200
I'm good at expressing myself.

48
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,960
Sometimes I go too deep when I talk.

49
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,600
Maybe I just overthink things.

50
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,920
That's probably why I have insomnia.

51
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,880
Maybe.

52
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,840
Thinking about stuff every day keeps me up at night, yeah.

53
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,280
So I choose to write it down.

54
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,720
I found that after writing things down,

55
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,200
my mind feels much clearer.

56
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,640
And I sleep much better.

57
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,880
Writing down all my thoughts

58
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,600
is a really good outlet, I think.

59
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,520
Your eye bags are pretty big.

60
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,920
That's just dark circles.

61
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,960
From staying up late.

62
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,160
Cheer up.

63
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,160
Let's go then.

64
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,440
Feels like we're almost there.

65
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:48,920
We're here.

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,920
Thanks.

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,120
You take your water bottle.

68
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,400
I'll take the other two suitcases.

69
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,240
Sure.

70
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,480
So,

71
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,800
I'm over here.

72
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,920
This one's probably yours.

73
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,560
Looks great.

74
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,240
Warm and cozy.

75
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,880
Barbecue's here!

76
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,960
As soon as food arrives,

77
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,880
your face instantly lights up.

78
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,880
You look so happy.

79
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,080
Smells amazing.

80
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,640
Suddenly I'm hungry.

81
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,640
I wasn't hungry before.

82
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,080
Really?

83
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,120
Really.

84
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,360
The smell made me hungry.

85
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,800
Let's try it first.

86
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:06,760
Beef fat.

87
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,160
Beef fat.

88
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,760
Do you like barbecue?

89
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,800
I absolutely love barbecue.

90
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,080
Since I'm in Beijing anyway,

91
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,040
I have to eat it at least once a week.

92
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,800
What kind? Northeastern barbecue.

93
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,040
Xi'an barbecue.

94
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,600
Xi'an barbecue is super delicious.

95
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,000
Everything in Xi'an tastes great.

96
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,800
Even the noodles.

97
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,400
You like Xi'an noodles?

98
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,320
Alright.

99
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,560
Next time I get a chance,

100
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,400
I'll make it for you.

101
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,280
You know how to make it?

102
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,200
Oil-splashed noodles.

103
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:42,800
You can make them?

104
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,480
Because I have a good friend from Xi'an.

105
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,160
We went to school together before.

106
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,040
He taught me how to make oil-splashed noodles all the time.

107
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,360
Secret tips.

108
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,120
I'll tell you next time.

109
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,000
You mentioned before

110
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,240
that your expectation in a relationship is

111
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,000
to be well-matched.

112
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,720
How do you think I should understand that?

113
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,400
I think being well-matched actually

114
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,040
breaks down to

115
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,760
having similar values.

116
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,240
And

117
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,440
the ability to handle things.

118
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,120
Each other's place in your heart.

119
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,000
You want both people to have

120
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,240
the ability to handle things.

121
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,720
The ability to solve problems.

122
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,800
But aren't you the silent treatment type?

123
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,720
When did I ever say that?

124
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,480
You did say it.

125
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,600
I said we shouldn't rush things.

126
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,280
Let's calm down first.

127
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,640
Calm down before

128
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,520
discussing the issue.

129
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,600
So are you someone who avoids conflict?

130
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,120
I am.

131
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,480
Right?

132
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,640
I try to avoid conflict and arguments.

133
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:58,960
What about you?

134
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,480
Me too.

135
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,640
Are you the spontaneous type?

136
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,720
I wasn't before.

137
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,200
But now I hope I am.

138
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,160
Life is full of surprises that way.

139
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,200
I used to be

140
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,000
someone who needed a detailed plan before going out.

141
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So for example,

142
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,600
you make

143
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,080
a really perfect plan.

144
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,480
You look at it every day and feel happy.

145
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,720
Thinking, "This plan is amazing."

146
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,280
Can't help it.

147
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,000
I do that a lot.

148
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,240
I often look at my plans and laugh.

149
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,080
Really.

150
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,560
See, I knew you'd be like that.

151
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,520
But then the next day comes,

152
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,320
and it rains.

153
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,120
What do you do?

154
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,320
My mood gets really bad.

155
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,160
Yeah, you just plan too much for yourself.

156
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,280
You put too much pressure on yourself.

157
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,640
If things don't go as planned,

158
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,200
Exactly.

159
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,400
You can't handle it, you freak out.

160
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,960
Yeah, I really do freak out.

161
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,360
So now I don't want to be like that anymore.

162
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,960
Right, just relax a bit.

163
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,600
Don't be so tense.

164
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,400
I used to also

165
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,720
be obsessed with watching the sunrise.

166
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,120
I think it's harder to catch the sunrise.

167
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,920
Because sunset is easier.

168
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,640
You can just see it.

169
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,000
And the weather

170
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,120
is a big factor too.

171
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,080
If I can't see the sunrise, I feel really disappointed.

172
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,520
Now I just let it go.

173
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,680
Sunsets are pretty nice too.

174
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,720
Sunsets are nice.

175
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,480
It doesn't have to be something others can't see

176
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,520
to be the best view.

177
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,640
After eating well,

178
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,800
just go to bed early.

179
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,800
Completely blocked.

180
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,480
I mean, the curtains here are fully closed.

181
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,280
I thought I could still see the view.

182
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,840
The view.

183
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,320
It's all dark.

184
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,920
I think you're a romance killer.

185
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,840
Conversation killer.

186
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,520
You're a conversation killer.

187
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,960
Xiaoshan, there are flowers on this.

188
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,960
What kind of flowers are these?

189
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,640
I can see them.

190
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,200
There are a lot more in my room.

191
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,440
Children's books.

192
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,600
What?

193
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,320
Children's books.

194
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,240
Books.

195
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,400
Comic books.

196
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,680
I thought "children's dubu" was something else.

197
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,880
Books.

198
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,800
Okay.

199
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,000
Is that a family room for kids?

200
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,360
I said today I probably

201
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,440
won't sleep on that bed.

202
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,840
I'll probably sleep on the kids' bed.

203
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,840
I think I stayed in one before.

204
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,640
The kind that's

205
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,320
also a family room for kids.

206
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,760
But it had a slide.

207
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,880
Our cabin has a slide too.

208
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,480
So what does your room look like?

209
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,640
My room just has a tatami mat.

210
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,320
There's a sofa in front of the tatami.

211
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,400
And in front of the sofa is a

212
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,360
TV.

213
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,560
A big TV.

214
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,920
There's a window on the left where you can see the tea garden.

215
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,840
You can see the terraced fields.

216
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,960
I thought we'd go for barbecue.

217
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,840
Because I'm not used to

218
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,240
formal meals.

219
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,120
My friends and I are usually more

220
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,520
relaxed.

221
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,640
Formal meals make me lose my appetite.

222
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,560
It's fine.

223
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,680
Just take it easy.

224
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,160
Let's just eat like friends.

225
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,040
So what's your ideal life?

226
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,920
What does it look like?

227
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,240
My ideal life is

228
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,920
I want to experience

229
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,880
all kinds of things in this world.

230
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,960
To be able to try everything.

231
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,520
Though that's a pretty ideal state.

232
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,240
If I get more realistic,

233
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,480
and think about what's actually possible,

234
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,280
then my ideal life

235
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,200
is maybe

236
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,360
the kind of life I want right now.

237
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,080
A certain way of living.

238
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,840
What is it like?

239
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,080
For example,

240
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,400
if I want Chongqing hotpot,

241
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,920
I have the time and energy

242
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,080
to fly to Chongqing and eat hotpot.

243
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,480
Or go

244
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,880
take a break and relax.

245
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,320
And maybe at least twice a year

246
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,840
have this kind of

247
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,800
chance to travel.

248
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,880
So is this something

249
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,120
you can't do right now?

250
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,120
Because it seems like

251
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,800
you're pretty free now.

252
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,320
But there are a lot of things that

253
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,120
hold you back.

254
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,680
You could do it,

255
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,440
but some things still hold you back.

256
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:48,840
Like what?

257
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,600
All kinds of company chores.

258
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,320
You have to take care of them.

259
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,560
Only then can you have your own time.

260
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,400
Because if you don't make the decision,

261
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,520
no one else can do it for you.

262
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,520
Because you're

263
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,320
the company's

264
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,880
final decision-maker.

265
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,800
If you don't give

266
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,080
those instructions,

267
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,880
those orders,

268
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,160
the people below can't

269
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,360
Yeah, they can't carry them out.

270
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,760
They can't do it.

271
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,440
When I was born, you were probably in

272
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:27,920
kindergarten.

273
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,600
Kindergarten.

274
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,520
Yeah, just a little bit apart.

275
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,440
Just a bit.

276
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,640
But actually,

277
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,400
you're about the same age as many of my colleagues.

278
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,120
You told me that last time.

279
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,760
But you're totally different from them.

280
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,280
How? What's different?

281
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,720
You just don't seem like

282
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,120
someone born in 1997.

283
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,400
You seem more like

284
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,120
I think

285
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,440
you're older than that

286
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,040
at least in terms of mental age.

287
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,640
Just more

288
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,600
More mature, right?

289
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,240
Yeah.

290
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,680
I thought you'd say

291
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,760
I seem like someone born in 2000.

292
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,680
You wish.

293
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,800
Are you saying I'm even more like that?

294
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,280
When you're being silly, you really seem like someone born after 2000.

295
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,320
But usually, you're very formal.

296
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,680
When you're serious,

297
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,440
Yeah.

298
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,680
You seem more like

299
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,080
someone older.

300
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,000
Like which year?

301
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,600
1985.

302
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,280
1985.

303
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,560
Are you serious?

304
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:23,720
1985?

305
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,400
Sometimes I feel like

306
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,120
when you're really serious,

307
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,320
you really seem

308
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,400
like your mental age

309
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,280
is very steady.

310
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,240
In the way you handle things,

311
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,320
you seem very thoughtful and careful.

312
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,440
Why do I feel like my mental age is only

313
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,120
twenty-four or twenty-five?

314
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,560
No,

315
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,280
my mental

316
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,800
Mental age means

317
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,720
how you deal with

318
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,680
more serious things.

319
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,760
That kind of approach.

320
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,200
But when you're just being yourself,

321
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,320
like when you sing

322
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:47,920
or act silly,

323
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,360
you really are like a kid.

324
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,600
It's a big contrast.

325
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:54,960
You're just different.

326
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,240
After all, you have to

327
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,760
be the one to make the final decision.

328
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,000
Still,

329
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,320
that's important.

330
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,240
That's work stuff.

331
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,120
Yeah.

332
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,120
You definitely need to be

333
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,520
mature and steady at work.

334
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,720
But I feel like you're also

335
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,800
very mature emotionally.

336
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,480
That's just

337
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,560
Yeah, I do think more about things.

338
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:15,680
But when

339
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,920
I'm with friends, I'm more

340
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,640
You only really relax when you're with friends.

341
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,920
That's when you're most relaxed.

342
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,760
You told me today

343
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,200
that yesterday was the least sleep

344
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,120
you've had in a while.

345
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,600
Not the least.

346
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,240
No.

347
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,320
Just slept pretty little.

348
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,280
But I still felt rested.

349
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,280
The quality of sleep was pretty good.

350
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,480
So how long do you usually sleep?

351
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,880
Seven and a half hours.

352
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,560
Seven and a half hours.

353
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,440
I thought you slept a lot every day.

354
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,320
But I—yeah, I thought so.

355
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,120
Was it because you practiced Baduanjin yesterday?

356
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,160
I was thinking

357
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,880
maybe I should do Baduanjin before bed every day.

358
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,400
Or practice Baduanjin in the morning.

359
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,800
Hi.

360
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,600
Let's do archery.

361
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,600
Okay, let's go over there.

362
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:34,920
Alright.

363
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,640
Let's go.

364
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,360
You've never

365
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:41,840
No.

366
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,280
shot an arrow before?

367
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:42,920
Never tried.

368
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,160
Do you

369
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,160
hold it like this?

370
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:47,720
Yeah.

371
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,560
Wrap one finger of this hand around it.

372
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,480
Like this.

373
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,240
Yes.

374
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,720
Almost there.

375
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,280
Just a little bit more.

376
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:02,920
A tiny bit.

377
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,800
Just a hair's breadth.

378
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,080
You can do it.

379
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:14,720
Amazing!

380
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,320
I beat you to it.

381
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,200
Nice.

382
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:17,640
Really impressive.

383
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,800
I think you're really athletic.

384
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,600
Really?

385
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:20,960
I think you

386
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,440
pick things up super fast.

387
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,960
Not bad.

388
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,720
Last chance, I bet you'll hit it.

389
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,240
See, I was right.

390
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:43,800
Let's go.

391
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,160
Archery is so much fun!

392
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:45,800
Really?

393
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,600
Let's go sit over there for a bit.

394
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,240
Okay.

395
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,400
I brought you something.

396
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,440
So cute!

397
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,720
It's called Dangling Bunny.

398
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,640
I really like its expression.

399
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,240
It's just so

400
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,880
relaxed.

401
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,120
I hope you

402
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,200
can, in the next few days,

403
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,320
not let anything

404
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,160
make you feel uncomfortable.

405
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,280
People get tense.

406
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,240
Yeah, so I got you this bunny.

407
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,400
Did you notice this part?

408
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,360
It's got a magnet.

409
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,080
So you can hang it anywhere.

410
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,320
You can hang it on your hand.

411
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,720
Or on your bag.

412
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,040
It'll never get

413
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,920
mixed up with someone else's bag.

414
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,000
Makes it easy to find your bag.

415
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,440
Right.

416
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,160
I really like it.

417
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,040
I'll hang it up.

418
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,000
Like this?

419
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,320
Yeah.

420
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,280
It's actually really cute.

421
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,720
Thank you.

422
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,440
The clouds look great today too.

423
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,240
Usually, I'm someone who

424
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,080
isn't very good at making friends.

425
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,440
No way, I think in the house

426
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,920
you're the best at making friends.

427
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,960
Why?

428
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,040
Because I think you

429
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,920
really take care of everyone.

430
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,360
You're so kind.

431
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,560
Like Duoduo,

432
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,920
and Xiaoyuan, they've told me

433
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,680
Brother Jiao often gives them advice

434
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,640
or

435
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,720
after talking, he

436
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,200
comforts and encourages them.

437
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,920
Honestly, I'm afraid to give advice.

438
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,720
Every time, I always stress

439
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,480
I say,

440
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,760
I'm not giving you advice.

441
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,440
I'm just sharing my thoughts.

442
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,400
That means you're a really good friend.

443
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,840
You're great at listening and being there for others.

444
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,000
Because I think everyone in the house

445
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,840
is really nice.

446
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,000
Suddenly met so many

447
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,840
It's like happiness came all at once.

448
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,200
So in your heart, if

449
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,200
you had to rank family, love, and friendship,

450
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:05,640
how would you rank them?

451
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,600
In your thirties, it's family, love, friendship.

452
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,280
After your thirties,

453
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,360
it's love, family, friendship.

454
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,440
What about you?

455
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,560
If I'm sure this is the person for life,

456
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,400
if it's really them,

457
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,000
then I think in my life,

458
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,080
the one who stays with me all my life

459
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,360
and spends the most time with me

460
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,240
should be that person.

461
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,360
So it's love.

462
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:33,760
Let's go.

463
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,680
Let's go.

464
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,800
We can take some photos.

465
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,360
Take a picture with the kitten.

466
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,680
Why does it always sleep facing this way?

467
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,600
It's so cute.

468
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,240
Mimi

469
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,880
Eye contact is fine.

470
00:18:59,240 --> 00:18:59,960
Take a look at it.

471
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,240
It's mostly just shaking around.

472
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,040
This one looks good.

473
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,120
The one with eye contact.

474
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,120
Let's go for a walk.

475
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,840
Let me check.

476
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,920
I'll walk around, and you keep looking at me.

477
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,960
See which side looks better.

478
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,760
Is there? But this is top lighting.

479
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,840
Actually, it's the same everywhere.

480
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,600
Yeah, the face will look dark.

481
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,520
Or you can hold it.

482
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,760
Take a photo on the bike.

483
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,520
What do you think?

484
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,200
How about like this?

485
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,040
But this top lighting is a bit scary.

486
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,440
See, it still turns out like this.

487
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,520
Or find a shady, completely dark spot.

488
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,880
What's this?

489
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,400
Take a look.

490
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,040
Graduation group photo.

491
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,440
Yearbook.

492
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,160
Class of 2003.

493
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,120
Did you write in it as a kid?

494
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,120
Of course I did.

495
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,680
Had to write for everyone, even forced to.

496
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,760
When I was a kid,

497
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,440
I was a chubby kid in elementary school.

498
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:06,840
Really?

499
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,280
Yeah.

500
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,120
And then

501
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,200
Were you this tall as a kid?

502
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,320
No, I was just short and chubby in elementary school.

503
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,200
Short and chubby, that's what I was.

504
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,600
Yeah.

505
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,880
Then by ninth grade,

506
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,200
I was already the tallest in my class.

507
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,120
Starting, wait a sec.

508
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,400
Sit up there.

509
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,240
Let's start creating.

510
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,280
Three

511
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,160
Two, one

512
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,440
Okay.

513
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,200
But there's red behind you.

514
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,440
Doesn't matter, I'm beautiful.

515
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,880
As long as you're beautiful, right?

516
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:49,920
Are you still taking photos?

517
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,120
We can go somewhere else.

518
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,440
Do you like taking photos?

519
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,720
I did want to learn before.

520
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,800
But it seemed a bit troublesome.

521
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,720
You asked me the other day,

522
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,880
Do you love photography?

523
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,600
I thought you loved photography.

524
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,440
Me?

525
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,600
I don't love photography.

526
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,720
But I love being photographed.

527
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,120
That's fine then.

528
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,200
Do you want to go explore up there?

529
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,680
I can.

530
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,120
Let's go.

531
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,560
Let's see what it is.

532
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,560
Stand there.

533
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,080
Look over there.

534
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,240
Feels like I'm being directed.

535
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,520
We can take a photo together here.

536
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,880
But I'm right on top of a character.

537
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,320
You're really good at finding spots.

538
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,200
You can look for one.

539
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,040
You can.

540
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,920
Move over a bit.

541
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,960
Show your right side.

542
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,600
Smile, yeah.

543
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,920
Nothing left.

544
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,760
Stand up there.

545
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,160
I'll take a couple shots from below.

546
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,960
Get out your long lens.

547
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,720
Telephoto, full range.

548
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,200
Hello, teacher.

549
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,040
Three, two, one.

550
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,360
Move a bit more to the right.

551
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,160
Okay.

552
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,400
Very good.

553
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,480
Take a look.

554
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,840
Getting a bit nervous.

555
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,800
Really?

556
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,680
I'm a little nervous.

557
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,440
Watch the steps, you go down first.

558
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,600
Looks great.

559
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,040
This one looks really good.

560
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,440
You're better at posing.

561
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,800
The ones upstairs look good too.

562
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,320
You're so good at this.

563
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,920
As long as you're happy with it.
