1
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,360
What's going on?

2
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,840
So, what happens if two people
haven't seen each other for a long time?

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,760
I can't take it anymore.

4
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,760
Don't sit down.

5
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,200
That's the only way.

6
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,080
That won't work.

7
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,760
Let me set a scenario for you.

8
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,880
You really spend every day together.

9
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,080
Have morning tea together.

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,640
Then suddenly, something happens.

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,200
Lan Lan feels a bit dizzy now.

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:50,640
So dizzy.

13
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,880
And you're driving right now.

14
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,160
You've been driving for three hours.

15
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,040
You see Lan Lan downstairs at her place.

16
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,160
What would you do at that moment?

17
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,040
Three.

18
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,160
Two.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,920
One.

20
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,720
He would...

21
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,560
Seriously ask me,

22
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,680
"Why are you dizzy?"

23
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,480
Why?

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,560
So, those ninety-nine Niu Dan Cards
(randomly drawn reward cards) you have—

25
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,080
How many have you finished so far?

26
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,120
How many have you completed?

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,240
Maybe a dozen or so.

28
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,400
About a dozen.

29
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,840
You know, we said back then—

30
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,680
There were so many, it felt like
we'd never finish them in three lifetimes.

31
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,400
But you've already used up more than ten.

32
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,440
Out of those ten things,

33
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,760
For example, among those ten,

34
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,320
Which one do you think was the most "exciting"?

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,080
Which one is it?

36
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,000
Actually, the things written on them

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,040
aren't really that "explosive."

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,760
Then tell us the most ordinary one.

39
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,440
Watching a movie.

40
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,560
Watched at home.

41
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,280
At home.

42
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:38,920
Yes.

43
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,520
Tao, how about we hug?

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,640
Just a hug.

45
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,600
Stop messing around.

46
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,200
So, you do your thing, we'll do ours.

47
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:50,720
Alright.

48
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,600
What are you doing?

49
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,120
I'll follow your lead.

50
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,560
Come on.

51
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,040
Let's go, come on.

52
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,240
Do the princess carry.

53
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,040
Come on.

54
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,080
Come on.

55
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,440
This won't work.

56
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:00,880
Switch.

57
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,200
Yeah, over there.

58
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:02,760
Okay, like this.

59
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,600
We can't lose.

60
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,640
Ma Boqian.

61
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,680
I'll carry you.

62
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,240
Three, two, one, go!

63
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,240
Nice.

64
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,240
Ma, you did it!

65
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,600
Alright.

66
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,240
Leave some space.

67
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:30,920
Yeah.

68
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,000
So, during this process,

69
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,240
I bet everyone hasn't had enough fun yet, right?

70
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,560
Right.

71
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,000
Because the start of this season

72
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,800
was all about the trip.

73
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,200
So we've prepared

74
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,040
a Yunnan Lijiang tour for everyone.

75
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,680
We hope all our friends

76
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,640
can have a great time.

77
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,600
Careful.

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,920
Be careful.

79
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,720
Okay.

80
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,280
Looks pretty nice.

81
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,400
The front desk is here.

82
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,880
Let's go.

83
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,120
It's so beautiful here.

84
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,000
Hello.

85
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,720
Hello.

86
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,480
Welcome to Shujia Hotel.

87
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,400
Hello.

88
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,200
I'll get the room card first.

89
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,200
Girls are in Courtyard One.

90
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,600
And boys are in Courtyard Two.

91
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,920
Okay, thank you.

92
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,600
I'd like to check today's activities.

93
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,520
Hiking from seven to nine.

94
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,840
What time is it now?

95
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,600
You have to hold that plate the whole time.

96
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,280
Lunch at one, and in the afternoon—

97
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,040
"Magical" Wildland.

98
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,840
Then dinner is the Mushroom Banquet
(Yunnan specialty mushroom feast).

99
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,040
Alright, let's sit for a bit.

100
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,120
We'll sit together.

101
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,160
There's nothing to lean on.

102
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,440
Should we sit by the edge?

103
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,240
Just like this.

104
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,240
You decide.

105
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,640
The environment is nice.

106
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,720
Very Yunnan-style.

107
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,360
What's wrong?

108
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:57,920
Nothing.

109
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,520
What are you doing?

110
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,320
How can I not laugh?

111
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,520
Think of something sad.

112
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,600
There's nothing sad.

113
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,360
Then you're really happy.

114
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,840
What's inside yours?

115
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,480
You didn't put bricks in there on purpose, did you?

116
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,000
Just messing with you.

117
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,960
Hello.

118
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,440
Hello.

119
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,400
Hello.

120
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,000
Hello.

121
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,760
Where do we put the suitcases?

122
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,440
Put the luggage up front first.

123
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,960
Pick a seat first.

124
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,280
Okay.

125
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,040
What's this?

126
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,760
Is it the room card?

127
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,800
Yes, wait for everyone to arrive.

128
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,120
Then we'll discuss how to arrange the rooms.

129
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,920
So, whoever draws that card is the housekeeper?

130
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,520
Doctor Fang is the housekeeper.

131
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,320
Or are you the housekeeper?

132
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,520
Both of us are.

133
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,960
Thank you.

134
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:31,920
Take one.

135
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,880
That's mine.

136
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,920
We can share

137
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,200
what everyone got from the Niu Dan Card
(randomly drawn reward card).

138
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,400
What's the little surprise?

139
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,200
Mine is the "Umbrella for You Card."

140
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,840
You can choose a travel buddy

141
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,080
to shield you from wind and rain on the trip.

142
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,840
I'll shield you.

143
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,400
No need to pick.

144
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,280
Yeah, you don't need a card for that.

145
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:48,920
No need to choose.

146
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,280
"Heartbeat Butler Card."

147
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,480
You can invite any travel buddy

148
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,120
to be your partner.

149
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,440
It's "locked in."

150
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,680
These two cards are "locked in."

151
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,200
Mine is the "Travel Trio Card."

152
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,960
You can use this voucher to get

153
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,840
a steam eye mask, neck pillow, and slippers.

154
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,400
It's the "Nothing Card."

155
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,280
But I think the second line is nice too.

156
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,960
It gives you

157
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,400
three hundred sixty-five blessings.

158
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,320
Mine is the "Wake-Up Call Card."

159
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,680
"Limited Group Favorite Card."

160
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,800
Mine is the "Birthday Blessing Card."

161
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,800
You can celebrate your birthday anytime, anywhere.

162
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,680
Mine is the "Charge It to Me Card."

163
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,880
Buy something for them once.

164
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,680
Mine is the "Full of Energy Card."

165
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,920
Mine is the "Skip the Line Card."

166
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,200
Mine is the "Personal Photographer Card."

167
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,040
I'll take care of the girls, he takes the boys.

168
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,720
What's that pillow you have?

169
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,040
It's from the Travel Trio Card.

170
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,520
You drew the "Birthday Card."

171
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:54,880
Yeah.

172
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,800
What did you get?

173
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,720
I just said it.

174
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,640
What did you say?

175
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,520
The trio set.

176
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,560
Sorry.

177
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,720
"Misheard Master."

178
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,720
I wasn't listening just now.

179
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,680
Is this the butler's charm?

180
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,680
Which three things?

181
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,160
Which three things?

182
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,400
I wondered why you suddenly

183
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,120
posted a picture in our group chat.

184
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,880
I asked them at the time,

185
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,040
"Is it really this?"

186
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,280
I said, "Really?"

187
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,800
I'm a bit sleepy.

188
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,000
You can lean on my shoulder to nap.

189
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,560
No, that's not okay, right?

190
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,600
I'm really leaning on you.

191
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,520
Go ahead, lean on me.

192
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,040
I remember you drew the birthday one, right?

193
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,600
You're staying outside now (in Lijiang).

194
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,800
No roommate.

195
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,640
Not getting a roommate?

196
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,080
Come on, party time.

197
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,360
Someone's here.

198
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,440
I heard a sound.

199
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,000
So pretty.

200
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,480
I said, it's almost too beautiful.

201
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,120
Hello.

202
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,560
Hello, please leave your luggage at the front desk.

203
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,520
Okay, hello.

204
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,080
Hello.

205
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,960
Everyone, please have a seat.

206
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,120
Sit here.

207
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,960
Then I'll sit here.

208
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,080
Come quickly.

209
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,200
Jue, come sit with me.

210
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,840
Are you excited? Happy today?

211
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,040
Happy.

212
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,120
Doctor Fang said he's nervous, but I'm not scared.

213
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,600
I can hold Lan Lan's hand.

214
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,240
Yes.

215
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,520
We'll hold hands too.

216
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,440
So sweet.

217
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,880
What are you saying, whispering secrets?

218
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,920
Everyone can check today's activities.

219
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,760
Over there.

220
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,800
Mushrooms.

221
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,280
That's great.

222
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,840
We got to try something special.

223
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,200
The mushrooms are delicious.

224
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,400
Then a bunch of people just collapsed.

225
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,760
Slept straight through for three days.

226
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,040
What are you two talking about?

227
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,280
What happened?

228
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,040
Nothing.

229
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,960
I don't know why he started laughing.

230
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,200
Give me a moment.

231
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,640
Did you eat mushrooms?

232
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,440
It's not that funny.

233
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,960
Stop laughing, think of something sad.

234
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,640
Doctor Fang said there's nothing sad.

235
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,600
How did you know he said that?

236
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,000
He started laughing before you arrived.

237
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I said, think of something sad.

238
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,160
He said there's nothing sad, what now?

239
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,240
Alright.

240
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,400
Serious.

241
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,400
Okay.

242
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,120
Doctor Fang is the butler today, right?

243
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,080
Both of us are.

244
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,480
You two are both.

245
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,000
So hard.

246
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,640
Is it tough, your "domain"?

247
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,080
Then Duoduo, pick a topic.

248
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,880
Assistant butler, right?

249
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,560
Yes.

250
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,320
Okay.

251
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,640
No, she's the main butler.

252
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,680
She's the assistant butler.

253
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,240
Sorry.

254
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,120
Sorry.

255
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,920
I'll be the discipline officer.

256
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,400
Where are they?

257
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,280
It's so beautiful here.

258
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,680
They're here.

259
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,400
They're here.

260
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,000
That's great.

261
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,640
Hello.

262
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,880
Hello everyone, welcome!

263
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,040
Let's leave our luggage at the front desk first.

264
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,800
Hello.

265
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,000
Hello.

266
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,320
Jin, your hairstyle looks great.

267
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,320
Thank you.

268
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,920
I got it cut.

269
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,000
Looks handsome.

270
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,920
It's shorter now.

271
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,920
I'll go with you.

272
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,800
Everyone, it's time to pick our rooms.

273
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,240
Okay.

274
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,720
Okay.

275
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,600
Alright.

276
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,200
Girls, over here.

277
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,960
Guys, Doctor Fang, can you handle this?

278
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,800
There are first and second floors.

279
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,440
There are two buildings, which one do you want?

280
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:11,920
First floor.

281
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,800
First floor.

282
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,880
First floor.

283
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,600
First floor.

284
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,720
Alright.

285
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,400
Want to stay with me?

286
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,840
Sure, then the three of us.

287
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,000
The three of us.

288
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,360
Three.

289
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,600
Then this one is for Herry (Liu Zihan).

290
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:23,720
Right.

291
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,240
Herry (Liu Zihan) isn't here yet.

292
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,640
Yeah, just us three.

293
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,960
Let's go.

294
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,040
Let's go.

295
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,320
This place is huge.

296
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,200
Guys are over here.

297
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,400
Go to your room first.

298
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,200
Right.

299
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,920
The girls are all in Courtyard One.

300
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,360
Alright.

301
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:42,920
Come on.

302
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,400
Give it to me.

303
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:44,960
Okay.

304
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,440
The guys should all be on this side.

305
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,760
Doctor Fang got taken away.

306
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,520
Zihan isn't here yet?

307
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,240
Not yet.

308
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,800
Isn't this 501?

309
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,720
This is 501.

310
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,440
Right.

311
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,200
So spacious.

312
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,440
This environment is nice.

313
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,760
This is a double bed.

314
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,680
Who's sharing this bed?

315
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,000
No way.

316
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,520
See, two pillows mean two people can sleep here.

317
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,640
I can use five pillows when I sleep alone.

318
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,080
So beautiful.

319
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,640
We're on these two sides.

320
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,440
Right.

321
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,040
I like it here.

322
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,720
Let's check out the rooms first.

323
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,120
Let's go.

324
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,680
Wait, Jue'er, don't move.

325
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,880
Looks great.

326
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,240
Go.

327
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:45,520
We're here.

328
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,760
We're stuck at the first step.

329
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,680
We got stuck right at the entrance.

330
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,840
Every step can trap us.

331
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,680
Honestly speaking,

332
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,480
This looks nice.

333
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,440
Anyone looks beautiful under the maple tree.

334
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,480
Three, two, one.

335
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,040
Looks good.

336
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,120
I'll take your photo.

337
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,680
I'll wait a bit.

338
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,640
It's your turn.

339
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,240
The lighting here is amazing.

340
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:02,800
Yes.

341
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,880
See?

342
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,320
Three, two, one—fix your hair.

343
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,440
That's just a strand.

344
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,080
You're about to compliment me—three, two, one.

345
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,160
This is perfect, the lighting here.

346
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,160
Five yuan per photo.

347
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,200
Alright, teacher.

348
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,480
I'll send you fifty right away.

349
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,080
Come on.

350
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,320
Duplex.

351
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,080
Yours looks so good.

352
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,440
I like green.

353
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,480
You look stunning.

354
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,680
Thank you.

355
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,760
Very pretty.

356
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,960
So beautiful.

357
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,520
It's on both sides.

358
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,560
This side is one room.

359
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,520
So pretty, really beautiful.

360
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,560
We're already in the room now.

361
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,520
I've decided to wear that scarf (for photos).

362
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,680
It looks great in photos.

363
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,720
Right?

364
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,120
Can you hold my little jacket?

365
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,440
When you film this video,

366
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,160
The floating effect should look amazing.

367
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,640
Then help me record it.

368
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:23,920
Okay.

369
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,840
Should it be bigger or smaller?

370
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,720
No need to move,

371
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,160
Just be in the shot.

372
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,920
Follow me.

373
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,560
I want to take some photos first too.

374
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,320
Wait for me a bit.

375
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,240
Alright, I want that one.

376
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,400
Let's do a transition.

377
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,040
Just stand at the back.

378
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,200
Like this, yes.

379
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,160
Just like last time.

380
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,400
No, not like that.

381
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,120
Don't move.

382
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,880
Okay.

383
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,080
Like this, good, don't move.

384
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,240
Don't move.

385
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,480
Not moving.

386
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,320
No smiling.

387
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,520
Taking photos.

388
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,920
Is the housekeeper coming back?

389
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,240
Sorry, everyone.

390
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,280
Have you picked your room yet?

391
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,680
Yes, I have.

392
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,920
Just save me a room, that's fine.

393
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,520
It's saved.

394
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,960
We saved you a sofa.

395
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,200
It's fine, a sofa is okay.

396
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,440
It's fine, a sofa is okay.

397
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,400
That's about it.

398
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,680
Let's head to this magical Wildland.

399
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,640
Let's go.

400
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,040
Hello.

401
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,520
Herry (Liu Zihan) is here.

402
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:42,880
Hello.

403
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,480
Put the suitcase over there.

404
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,160
Let's head out.

405
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,920
Let's split up among the three cars.

406
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,160
Wait, how do we sit?

407
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,240
Are there two more inside?

408
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,360
There are two.

409
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:52,840
Alright.

410
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:02,960
Come in.

411
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:03,920
Come in.

412
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,240
Which seat should I take?

413
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,160
I'll sit here.

414
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:07,960
Two more can sit here.

415
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,240
No rush, take your time.

416
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,240
No rush.

417
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,080
I'll just sit here.

418
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,160
Okay, you sit here.

419
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,360
I'll sit in the back.

420
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,760
It's much hotter today than I expected.

421
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,840
I'm really happy.

422
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,160
It's warm and the weather is great.

423
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,720
Airplane.

424
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,640
Little airplane.

425
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:44,840
Where is it?

426
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,360
Where's the airplane?

427
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,080
On the right.

428
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,760
I want to ride this.

429
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,440
There's a little train over here too.

430
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,800
I've seen this before.

431
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,000
I was wondering if that's a pyramid.

432
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,040
It looks like a pyramid from far away.

433
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,280
We're here.

434
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,000
So excited!

435
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,040
Amusement park, here I come!

436
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,240
Does your camera not have a strap?

437
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:10,960
No strap.

438
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,720
Nothing at all.

439
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,720
No lens cap either.

440
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,560
It's bare.

441
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:15,880
Completely bare.

442
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,200
Did you lose it or what?

443
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,480
Never had it again.

444
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,440
That's just your style.

445
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,760
It's lucky you haven't lost your camera.

446
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,440
Yeah.

447
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:25,720
Not bad.

448
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,760
I've even lost the battery before.

449
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,640
Still not bad.

450
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,800
Wildland

451
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,400
Such a mysterious place.

452
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,000
So cute.

453
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,120
So playful.

454
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,320
You all came today

455
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,920
Mainly, we hope that here

456
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,400
everyone can be an "adventurer."

457
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,760
We've placed

458
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,960
thirty-two pieces in Wildland.

459
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,240
Each of you needs to find them

460
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,600
and put together a complete picture.

461
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,440
Love it.

462
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,640
Collecting pieces.

463
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,760
Okay.

464
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,960
Let's get started now.

465
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,680
If you choose to ride, it's two per group.

466
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,000
But you don't have to ride.

467
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,640
You can also

468
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,320
just stroll around slowly.

469
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,520
Then let's ride that one.

470
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,040
Let's go.

471
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,800
Come on, let's go.

472
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,880
You drive.

473
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,240
Do you want to drive?

474
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,720
No, you drive.

475
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,960
Walk or ride?

476
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,560
Drive.

477
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:23,960
Alright.

478
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,960
But actually, I think

479
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,400
it's easier to find things if you don't drive.

480
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,600
Yeah, I think that's what he means.

481
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,800
I think driving is faster.

482
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,520
But you'll miss things.

483
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,000
If you want to drive, you can still look.

484
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,640
You won't miss anything.

485
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,960
Stop, hit the brakes.

486
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,440
Back up.

487
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,800
I want to drive that "dog."

488
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,360
Let's go.

489
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,320
If you want to drive, just do it.

490
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,440
Ride with me.

491
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,240
Can you fit in?

492
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,120
It's tight.

493
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,600
It's fine.

494
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,400
Let's go.

495
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,760
Slow down.

496
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,440
We're off!

497
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,040
"Danger"

498
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:12,880
Let's drive!

499
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,720
Let's go.

500
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,320
Let's go.

501
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,400
You're driving so fast.

502
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,880
Slow down.

503
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,400
Are you racing?

504
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,480
Whose car is this?

505
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,920
This feels great.

506
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,800
Water.

507
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,120
Careful.

508
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,880
Careful! What are you doing?

509
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,160
Can you get a shot from here?

510
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,200
Wait.

511
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,000
I forgot my sunglasses.

512
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,480
Forgot.

513
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,920
You really don't want to talk about it?

514
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,400
Is something wrong?

515
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,960
Nothing's wrong.

516
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,120
Say it.

517
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,160
I'm fine.

518
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,080
Go down and look.

519
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:21,880
Go down and search.

520
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,280
Did they already search here?

521
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,840
Do you want to search here or there?

522
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,560
Here.

523
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,040
Here.

524
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,200
Are you feeling better?

525
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,360
Better about what?

526
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,240
Weren't you in a bad mood this morning?

527
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,240
I'm okay.

528
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,200
What's wrong?

529
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,760
Nothing.

530
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,240
"Nothing" means something's wrong?

531
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,600
It's my own issue.

532
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,640
Are you really okay?

533
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:57,840
Here.

534
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,400
Mona Lisa.

535
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,000
You went home.

536
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,520
You're clearly hanging up there.

537
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,840
Water.

538
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,920
Can you really sit on this?

539
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,280
Seems like you can.

540
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,360
Can you slide on this?

541
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,760
Sit on it.

542
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,200
Wait a second.

543
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
Does it spin?

544
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,600
How does it...

545
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:29,840
It spins like this.

546
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,160
Good thing my legs are long.

547
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,400
You're so weird.

548
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,400
There's a trampoline here too.

549
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,520
This is a trampoline.

550
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,040
Nope, can't jump.

551
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,280
So silly.

552
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,640
Is there?

553
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,000
What's this for?

554
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,600
Wait a second.

555
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,240
What is this?

556
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:23,840
Squat down.

557
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,320
Your hair is completely soaked.

558
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,280
Really?

559
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,880
The back is all wet.

560
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,400
It's fine.

561
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,400
What's this?

562
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,480
Wait a second.

563
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,880
How about we just stay here?

564
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,840
You'll need to deal with this later.

565
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,120
Let's go first.

566
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,120
Wipe it off.

567
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,520
I think you need to fix that.

568
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,840
It's okay.

569
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,840
It's fine, pretty good.

570
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,960
Eyes.

571
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,320
Eyes.

572
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,120
There's a bit here.

573
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:15,840
Here.

574
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,720
That's it. That's where your hair is.

575
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,120
Okay.

576
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,600
It's snowing.

577
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,080
I want to take a picture of this.

578
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,160
It's like it's snowing.

579
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,760
You're still laughing at me.

580
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,640
Let's drive and leave then.

581
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,800
Let's sit for a while.

582
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,480
This is nice.

583
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,040
Let's stay here.

584
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,080
That's good.

585
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,200
So sweet.

586
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,800
Take a nap.

587
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,360
Here, have some.

588
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,520
Here, have some.

589
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,240
I'm telling you, this will fall out.

590
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,280
Three, two, one.

591
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,880
No.

592
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,680
I'm overlapping with the carousel.

593
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,000
So you don't want to overlap, right?

594
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,640
It kind of looks like it's growing on my forehead.

595
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,360
Take a look yourself.

596
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,240
I framed it like this on purpose.

597
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,400
There's one growing on my head.

598
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,560
I framed it like this on purpose.

599
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,840
One, two, three.

600
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,600
That's the end.

601
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,000
I'll take a photo here then.

602
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,920
Come.

603
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,040
Give me that card.

604
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,520
You might need to hold my clothes too.

605
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,320
Put it on me.

606
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,240
I'll take the bag.

607
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,400
Okay, let's go down.

608
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,360
So close.

609
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,720
Are you sure?

610
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,520
Don't worry about it.

611
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,320
One, two, three.

612
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,840
Why aren't you managing your expression?

613
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,240
I'm capturing the mood.

614
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,400
You need to manage your expression every time.

615
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,240
Haven't taken it yet.

616
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,240
Go back and stand.

617
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,000
One, two, three.

618
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,480
Am I getting more "round"?

619
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:27,680
Am I getting rounder?

620
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:30,880
It's fine.

621
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,920
What are they doing up front?

622
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,080
Wasn't it about the mood before?

623
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:40,560
Let's go.

624
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,480
No more photos.

625
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,760
I want to go a bit farther.

626
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,920
It's just that there aren't many houses in the back.

627
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,040
Can it look a bit fuller?

628
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,880
Then I'll stay here.

629
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,800
Will I look too small then?

630
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,640
Pull it a bit.

631
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,080
Then it's a full-body shot.

632
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,000
Okay.

633
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,640
One, two, three.

634
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,080
My necklace is crooked.

635
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,000
You need to tell me.

636
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,680
What's crooked?

637
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,000
The necklace is crooked.

638
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,520
Let's take another one. Come on.

639
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,320
Forget it.

640
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,360
Come on, take it.

641
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,760
One, two, three

642
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,640
It should be fine

643
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:17,760
Let's go

644
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,840
Should we go look for cards?

645
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,360
I kind of want to get first place

646
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,680
Do I have a chance at this?

647
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,280
Go

648
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,040
I want to go there

649
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:25,720
There

650
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,360
There's a sticker on the tiger's paw

651
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,760
Everyone's eyesight is so sharp

652
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,280
It's just your eyesight that's bad

653
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,880
It's not that others have good eyesight

654
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,160
Slow down

655
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,880
Are those shoes comfortable?

656
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,160
Wait, isn't this just one?

657
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,440
I stared at it for ages just now

658
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,360
No need to be so dramatic

659
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,160
I want to take a photo here

660
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,320
One, two, three

661
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,400
I'm so beautiful

662
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,160
My least noteworthy strength

663
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:03,960
Thank you

664
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,720
We can still go up

665
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,320
Yuxing, stay still, I'll take your photo

666
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,240
I think it's nice

667
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,040
This cloud

668
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,000
Looks good

669
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,400
Yeah, hold on

670
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,720
Okay, Yuxing, the photo's done

671
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:22,920
Really

672
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,440
There's a huge area over there

673
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,520
So pretty

674
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,000
No fragment here at all?

675
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,440
Darn it

676
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,840
We reached the top, right?

677
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,480
Yeah

678
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,720
Look at the mountain over there

679
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,040
It's just like

680
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,760
a cow

681
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,840
The cloud's shadow is cast on the mountain

682
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,200
If there's no fragment here

683
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,920
I really can't believe it

684
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,600
Could there be one here?

685
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,320
I'll go check

686
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,080
But the question is, where?

687
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,280
I found one

688
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,000
And it's Xiaoyuan's

689
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,280
What a coincidence

690
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:53,960
Really, it's actually a poster

691
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,760
There's another one here

692
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,400
You're amazing

693
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,480
"Braver with every challenge"

694
00:29:59,040 --> 00:29:59,960
Can you guys do it or not?

695
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,360
Three guys haven't found as many as I have

696
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,200
You just made me want to win

697
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,160
I'm getting serious now

698
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,920
I'm really going to try now

699
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,160
That's not it

700
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,160
What's going on?

701
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,320
What's going on?

702
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,120
Wait a second

703
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,360
There's nothing over there

704
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,560
Seems like there's nothing there

705
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,520
No way

706
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,200
It shouldn't be behind

707
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,720
It can't be this high up

708
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,920
He said the place he wants to go

709
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,360
Maybe there's one in the bathroom too

710
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,760
Go, Jin Yuxing!

711
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,600
Take a look around

712
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,840
This one looks great too

713
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,000
I see one

714
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,600
Yes

715
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,640
Jin Yuxing

716
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,120
So obvious

717
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,360
Go, Yuxing, hurry

718
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,200
Why am I not that happy?

719
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:46,920
Seriously

720
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,960
You found one

721
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,320
Nice job, Jin Yuxing

722
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,240
Yes, I finally found a piece

723
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,600
Yifan

724
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,080
Wait for us

725
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,440
We're taking photos

726
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,320
Yuxing, come here

727
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,640
Take a "Sailing Forward" photo

728
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,760
Three, two, one

729
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,600
There are thirty-two in total

730
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,560
Yeah, almost a third now

731
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,720
They've got a dozen here

732
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,960
We can stick them on now

733
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,120
This is Yifan's foot

734
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:14,960
Yifan's foot

735
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,120
Is this Herry's (Liu Zihan's) leg?

736
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:16,840
Seems like it

737
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,600
Herry, you found your whole body

738
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,360
You found all of yourself, right?

739
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,520
Yeah, I found myself

740
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,080
Finding myself

741
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,560
Perfect

742
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,040
So who found the most?

743
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:27,920
Definitely me

744
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,600
Me

745
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,240
How many pieces did you find?

746
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:29,840
Nine

747
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,840
You found nine

748
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,920
Let's go have dinner

749
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,840
Duo, why don't you sit with me?

750
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,400
I'll sit here.

751
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,040
You sit next to her.

752
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:01,880
Sure!

753
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,480
Have you ever played with a yo-yo?

754
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,040
I have, but I'm not good at it.

755
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,000
I can only do this.

756
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Just up and down.

757
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,120
Yeah, like in TV shows.

758
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:12,840
Don't they do that trick?

759
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,000
They make it come up like this.

760
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,200
And then swing it over like that.

761
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,520
I can only do this.

762
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,480
I can only do this.

763
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,440
I can't even do that.

764
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,520
Me too.

765
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,000
I can hook it up like this.

766
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
You can do it!

767
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,720
I can't.

768
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,240
We also played that as kids.

769
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,400
String figures.

770
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:28,920
That one.

771
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,560
Yeah.

772
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,840
Like I just mentioned.

773
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,800
You mean cat's cradle?

774
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,600
Cat's cradle.

775
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,520
Yeah, it's a real brain teaser.

776
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,600
But aren't there only a few patterns?

777
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,080
Can you keep changing them?

778
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,120
There are more, right?

779
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:39,480
There are lots.

780
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,600
Yeah, it's a cycle.

781
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,400
It's just a loop.

782
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:41,800
Like this?

783
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,600
Yeah, still like this.

784
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,640
It's different from how I played.

785
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,600
So Yu Xing played cat's cradle too.

786
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,440
I played with my cousin.

787
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,960
She taught me, actually.

788
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,480
Did you know?

789
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,400
I've played it.

790
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,200
Really? You have?

791
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,200
But it's been ages.

792
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,240
I really want to try again.

793
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,120
Yeah, me too.

794
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,000
Yeah, it starts out like this.

795
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,400
There's another one like this.

796
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,640
Just look for those X shapes.

797
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,920
Yeah, just find the X.

798
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,720
The X shape pops out like this.

799
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,120
It's the same everywhere, right?

800
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,360
Same everywhere.

801
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,520
Didn't we visit

802
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,840
that childhood park today?

803
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,040
It had a bit of that Dream Essence vibe.

804
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,920
So Herry (Liu Zihan),

805
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,160
share some childhood memories first.

806
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,640
Isn't Doctor Fang supposed to go first?

807
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,480
My childhood was so long ago.

808
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,440
Wait, what are you saying?

809
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,360
What you said...

810
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,360
How do we follow that?

811
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,280
No, that's not it.

812
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,160
I'm at this age.

813
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,240
How am I supposed to answer later?

814
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,840
Yours is already past.

815
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,560
My childhood was all about

816
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,080
What?

817
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,840
Fishing at the reservoir.

818
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,120
Fishing at the reservoir.

819
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,040
Fishing at the reservoir.

820
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,960
Catching crayfish.

821
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,120
Crayfish have pincers, right?

822
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,840
Just grab them tight and lift.

823
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,440
Then cook the crayfish and eat them.

824
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,960
No, I kept them as pets.

825
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,600
So you could cook crayfish since you were little?

826
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,240
So that's how it was.

827
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,280
"Crayfish Family."

828
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,320
"Crayfish Family."

829
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,240
So that's how it was.

830
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,320
All that buildup...

831
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,000
was just about crayfish.

832
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,960
Here we go again.

833
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,840
Doctor Fang, you're so good at this.

834
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,560
Learn from him.

835
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,320
Take notes.

836
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,440
Remember to set things up.

837
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,600
I told you,

838
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,440
Doctor Fang never says anything for nothing.

839
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,920
This is kind of like Jian Shou Qing.

840
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,800
That's it.

841
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,920
That's it.

842
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,520
Because it's already turned blue.

843
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,080
What's this?

844
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,760
This is a grasshopper.

845
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,880
This is a grasshopper.

846
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,760
This is one of Yunnan's three treasures.

847
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,160
I'm going to be brave and try one.

848
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,920
It's fine, it's been deep-fried and disinfected.

849
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,960
Smells good.

850
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,640
Kind of tastes like fries.

851
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,440
Fries.

852
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,640
If I'm eating freely, I have to try it, right?

853
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,680
It's tasty.

854
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,840
Can you get it for me?

855
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,160
My sleeve's in the way.

856
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:36,960
Hand it to me.

857
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,640
Is it good?

858
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,520
It's good, grab that one.

859
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,640
I want sesame sauce.

860
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,440
I want lots of sesame sauce.

861
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,280
That's what you call

862
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,240
That's what you call authentic.

863
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,560
That's what you call authentic.

864
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,360
So does anyone

865
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,800
want to show their childhood

866
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,920
cute photos?

867
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,280
Lan Lan, you go first.

868
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,440
Isn't Doctor Fang supposed to go first?

869
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,120
Agreed.

870
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,960
Let me look for one.

871
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,840
There's a photo of me doing the splits.

872
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,040
Did you learn dance?

873
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,040
Yeah, I did folk dance as a kid.

874
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,640
Yeah, I could do the splits back then.

875
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,640
Can't do it now.

876
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,080
There's another one like this.

877
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,440
So cute.

878
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,760
Does everyone have one?

879
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,400
Come on, Doctor Fang.

880
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,640
Show it.

881
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,040
Doctor Fang doesn't look much different.

882
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,520
There's only one ID photo.

883
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,360
He was this handsome back then.

884
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,440
So handsome.

885
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,440
This was in middle school.

886
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,760
Really handsome.

887
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,640
Big eyes.

888
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:22,960
Very well-proportioned.

889
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,040
Campus heartthrob.

890
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,520
Yes, campus heartthrob.

891
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,080
And the background is red.

892
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,080
It looks so official.

893
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,840
ID photo.

894
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,960
Found one.

895
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,240
Were your legs always this long?

896
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:38,800
Oh my!

897
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:39,840
No idea how old you were.

898
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,400
Feels like fifth or sixth grade.

899
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,160
Sixth grade, right?

900
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,160
Looks like you were tall.

901
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,640
Yeah, I was tall in elementary.

902
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,760
That's me on the right.

903
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,800
So handsome.

904
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,440
Childhood and now—

905
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,640
Not the same style, right?

906
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,840
You were pretty "round" as a kid.

907
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,920
Your face shape is different now.

908
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,800
Yeah, I got "stretched out."

909
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,040
Like pulling noodles.

910
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,040
Herry was fair-skinned before.

911
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,120
Yeah, really fair.

912
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,280
You used to be so pale.

913
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,880
The sun is harsh.

914
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,240
True.

915
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,400
Let me see which one.

916
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,000
See which one I can pick.

917
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,320
This one looks like me.

918
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:33,800
Kindergarten, with my sister at school.

919
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,680
I look more mixed now.

920
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,680
Yeah, not so much as a kid.

921
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,520
This looks like a Chinese kid.

922
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,720
Yeah, a Chinese baby.

923
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,680
Your sister is in Switzerland now.

924
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,560
All in Switzerland.

925
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,880
Only Ruilong is in China.

926
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,280
Every year in elementary school,

927
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,920
I'd study for a week or two.

928
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,200
At a Swiss school.

929
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,560
So after starting elementary, I went.

930
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,680
We in China were already learning

931
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,960
multiplication and division.

932
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,520
But there, they were still on addition.

933
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,560
Like, teens plus teens.

934
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,720
Then it became hundreds plus hundreds.

935
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,040
I thought, isn't it all the same?

936
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,440
My photos are just

937
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,680
exactly the same.

938
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,160
Grew up proportionally.

939
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,280
Yeah, scaled up evenly.

940
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:16,880
Identical.

941
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,040
This is clearly Duoduo.

942
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,520
I have a set in green—

943
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,360
Smiling so happily like this.

944
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,280
So cute.

945
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:27,760
Looks great.

946
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,960
Really adorable.

947
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,280
You had such a sweet smile as a kid.

948
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,280
It's a photo that seems

949
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,880
to be from when I was a baby.

950
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,080
My mom was holding me.

951
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,280
Show it.

952
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,280
I was really ugly.

953
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,280
Already not that young.

954
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,680
You were a "tomboy" as a kid.

955
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,360
And this one—

956
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,280
Super moody.

957
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,880
This one's nice.

958
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,360
Let me see.

959
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,680
Why does it feel

960
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,960
so mature for that age?

961
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,520
Born to be a leader.

962
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,040
Looking at childhood photos,

963
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,320
isn't really a challenge.

964
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,080
We should look at

965
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,400
ninth and eighth grade photos, you know?

966
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,600
Those are really

967
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,320
all for comparing, right?

968
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,560
"Mainstream era."

969
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,320
"Mainstream era."

970
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,440
"Mainstream era."

971
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,360
This one's not wild at all.

972
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,880
Should look at middle school ones.

973
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,920
Like tenth or eleventh grade.

974
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,720
Been ugly.

975
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,960
Never went non-mainstream.

976
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,720
Really, you didn't?

977
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,320
You must have.

978
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,920
I think you did.

979
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,480
How do you remember that?

980
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,560
I think you did.

981
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,080
Hurry, open it.

982
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,720
I used to giggle in class as a kid.

983
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,320
Is yours thick?

984
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,040
Does the inside taste like the outside?

985
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,440
So crispy.

986
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,000
Crispy.

987
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,360
No, it won't.

988
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Sit on the sofa for a bit.

989
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,520
Squeeze it.

990
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:24,880
Take a bite.

991
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,320
So cold.

992
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,560
Lean on me.

993
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,760
Spoil me for once.

994
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,960
I love you.

995
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,800
Absolutely perfect.

996
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,800
Lost the room card.

997
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,200
See if it fell.

998
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,440
Not here.

999
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,160
Can't find the room card.

1000
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,520
From now on, I'll just tell you—

1001
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,240
I just want you to praise me.

1002
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,480
My makeup skills are good.

1003
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,440
You get it now, right?

1004
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,720
So now you'll know

1005
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,920
how to compliment me.

1006
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,560
Yeah.

1007
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,920
You really can handle my emotions.

1008
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,920
You know what I'm saying.

1009
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,720
I hope we can always

1010
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,760
stay like this.

1011
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,280
Should I take a photo of you two?

1012
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,120
Time to relax.

1013
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:03,880
You look like an old man.

1014
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,080
Don't relax so much.

1015
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,600
What's wrong?

1016
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,200
Nothing much.

1017
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,440
Isn't it uncomfortable to hold it in?

1018
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,520
What do you think "lighting up" means?

1019
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,560
I really feel exhausted.

1020
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,880
My emotions are really

1021
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,880
not right.

1022
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,960
I'm leaving.
