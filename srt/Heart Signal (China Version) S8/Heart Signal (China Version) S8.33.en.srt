1
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,560
The second big date at Heartbeat Apartment is here.

2
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,640
Surfing time.

3
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,720
Life requires taking the bravest step.

4
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,720
Like a family of three.

5
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,240
Yeah.

6
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,400
Happy birthday to you.

7
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,760
It feels like the two of us

8
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,400
are evenly matched.

9
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,680
Smooth sailing.

10
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,080
Everything goes well.

11
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,400
Sometimes my thoughts jump around.

12
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,080
But every time you jump,

13
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,680
you land right where I do.

14
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,800
You’re very talented.

15
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,280
You are too.

16
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,440
Really, I am?

17
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,080
A little talent, a big talent.

18
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:36,800
I ship us.

19
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,440
I can’t take it anymore.

20
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,640
It’s hard to remember every single day.

21
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,320
Today I’m a happy kid.

22
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,640
Falling down together with her.

23
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,240
So sweet.

24
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,120
Three.

25
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,080
Two.

26
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,400
One.

27
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,360
What is it?

28
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,160
This is so touching.

29
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:06,840
It’s snowing.

30
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,240
Yeah.

31
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,600
This is so romantic.

32
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,400
I’m a strong person.

33
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,120
Sometimes you don’t have to be so strong.

34
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,320
Then next time I’ll come to you to cry.

35
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,800
I can’t stand it.

36
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,720
Takumi is coming down the mountain.

37
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:26,880
Okay.

38
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,600
Takumi is coming down the mountain.

39
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,280
What does that mean?

40
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,520
You haven’t seen Initial D?

41
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,280
What’s Initial D?

42
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,160
Generation gap.

43
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,920
I’ll go study it tonight, okay?

44
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,840
I’ve decided, I’ll buy a motorcycle tomorrow.

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Chi Chi

46
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,640
Pink basketball

47
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,120
They finally got a one-on-one date.

48
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,320
Chi Chi

49
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,400
Hello

50
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,320
Hello

51
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,360
Hello

52
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,200
This is for you.

53
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,960
This is a basketball.

54
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,080
What does giving me a basketball mean?

55
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,160
It's because I like basketball.

56
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,080
And also, you can

57
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,280
bring me a basketball.

58
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,000
Right, guess what this is.

59
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,120
This is...

60
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,480
A badminton racket.

61
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,600
A drawing.

62
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,280
What do you think it is?

63
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,080
A skateboard.

64
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,000
A skateboard? Is there one this thin?

65
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,320
Then what is it?

66
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,760
A tennis racket?

67
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,560
No.

68
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,640
You can take a look.

69
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,280
Let me hold it for you.

70
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,600
What is it?

71
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,120
A badminton racket.

72
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,480
Yes.

73
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,120
It's a badminton racket.

74
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,760
Badminton racket.

75
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,600
Then we can play badminton tonight.

76
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:34,760
Sure.

77
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,160
But I only bought it for you.

78
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,840
It's fine.

79
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,760
It's okay, I can still have one.

80
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,240
Yeah.

81
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,320
Thank you.

82
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:40,800
You're welcome.

83
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,520
I brought a gift too.

84
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,640
What is it?

85
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,640
At the last dinner,

86
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,960
didn't you give me a bouquet?

87
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,040
And that bouquet

88
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,120
had one flower that

89
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,400
never wilts, right?

90
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,800
So I bought a whole bouquet

91
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,760
of flowers that never wilt.

92
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,520
It matches yours.

93
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,320
This looks like that gerbera daisy.

94
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,120
Yeah.

95
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,680
Then we can put it together.

96
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,480
Sure.

97
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,280
Thank you.

98
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,080
We can put it together.

99
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,480
Have you been here before?

100
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,920
No, it's my first time.

101
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,960
I was amazed when I first arrived.

102
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,200
Did you choose this place or...

103
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,280
I originally wanted to

104
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,840
Didn't we say before

105
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,880
that we haven't been to an amusement park in ages?

106
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,560
But

107
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,840
it's raining outside today,

108
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,880
so we changed it to here.

109
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,640
It's indoors.

110
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,120
I think you picked a great place.

111
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,120
You picked a great place.

112
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,160
I'm so happy.

113
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,640
Did you

114
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,160
hear people screaming already?

115
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,920
This is so exciting.

116
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,880
This is intense.

117
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,720
Isn't it easy to get that

118
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
suspension bridge effect here?

119
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,440
Yeah.

120
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,720
This is kind of like

121
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,320
Do you dare to try it?

122
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,160
Tarzan

123
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,800
I think it should be

124
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,720
This one should be fine.

125
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,320
This should be

126
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:55,680
I think so too.

127
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,120
Not as thrilling as a roller coaster.

128
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,680
Yeah.

129
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,760
I feel like every time I...

130
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,720
We can start with the most exciting one.

131
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,160
Sure.

132
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,040
Should we try the swing first?

133
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,320
I want to try this too.

134
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,640
This makes it easy

135
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,720
to have physical contact.

136
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,440
This won't work.

137
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,240
Both are strapped in.

138
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,160
How can there be physical contact?

139
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,480
Hold hands if you're scared.

140
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,440
How do we get on this?

141
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:21,800
This...

142
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,600
A little nervous.

143
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,080
How high does this go?

144
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,920
When it suddenly moves, I feel really—

145
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,640
It's a bit scary.

146
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,680
So high.

147
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,000
Is this really okay?

148
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,840
I think—

149
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,800
I think I'm really nervous.

150
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,240
The first drop really feels a bit—

151
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,560
Like you're weightless.

152
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,560
This is much better, much better.

153
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,280
This activity is great.

154
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,400
I feel like I've lost control of my expressions.

155
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,320
This feels awesome.

156
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,160
This is so romantic.

157
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,600
This works.

158
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,640
We could—

159
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,480
We could try this too.

160
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,200
It's actually pretty fun.

161
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,320
It's just—

162
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,200
Quite—

163
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,240
Thrilling.

164
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,360
But—

165
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,920
It's the platform that's shaking.

166
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,760
I'm telling you—

167
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,720
It's not me shaking.

168
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,080
No.

169
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,560
It's you shaking.

170
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,080
Really not.

171
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,200
It's not me shaking.

172
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,240
I think your voice is about to give out.

173
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,520
No.

174
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,160
How many stories high is this?

175
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,560
Here—

176
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,720
I guess it's at least three stories.

177
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,400
Why aren't you scared?

178
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,640
I am scared.

179
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,640
Turn around and face that way.

180
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,720
Should we check this?

181
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm a bit scared, my legs feel weak now.

182
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,040
Don't we need to check it?

183
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,720
No need to take this.

184
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,320
No need to take it.

185
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,080
Is this—

186
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,760
Do we jump down ourselves?

187
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,440
Yes, you two have to jump.

188
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,600
We have to jump down.

189
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,000
Yeah.

190
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,040
I feel like suddenly—

191
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,600
Jumping down—

192
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,120
Let me mentally prepare myself.

193
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,400
Can you do it? Don't rush.

194
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,480
We have to jump by ourselves.

195
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,680
There's tension.

196
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,640
But you two still need to jump a bit.

197
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,680
They'll jump together.

198
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,240
Yeah.

199
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,160
That scream was so miserable.

200
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,720
I'm telling you, even if you're not scared—

201
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,600
You hear that scream and you start to get scared.

202
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,160
Yeah.

203
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,680
I think—

204
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,240
No way.

205
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,880
Maybe the guys need protection.

206
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,560
No way.

207
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,520
You can't think you can't do it.

208
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,640
Okay, fine.

209
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,880
Wait a second.

210
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,320
Hold here.

211
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,160
Okay.

212
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,600
Hold each other.

213
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,400
This spot is great, really nice.

214
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,800
Where should I hold for more stability?

215
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:26,880
Awesome.

216
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,080
This is what I meant—

217
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,200
We should ride a roller coaster together.

218
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:29,840
It's the same idea.

219
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,360
They're both a bit shy.

220
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:36,920
Wait a second.

221
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,160
Go down.

222
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,800
Why are you starting to sweat?

223
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,760
Am I sweating?

224
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,440
You're sweating a lot.

225
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,240
I'm just wearing a lot of clothes.

226
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,600
It feels a bit hot.

227
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,080
You...

228
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:49,680
Just...

229
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,200
Is that okay?

230
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,800
Can you do it?

231
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,720
Of course I can.

232
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,720
Can you do it?

233
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,560
I...

234
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,200
I think...

235
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,720
I think I can.

236
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,080
I...

237
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,600
Really step out a bit.

238
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,520
Don't shake, don't shake.

239
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,240
I'm not shaking, it's not me.

240
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,240
It's really not me shaking.

241
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,960
You're shaking.

242
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,680
He's gripping tightly.

243
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,520
He doesn't want to go down.

244
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,160
Let's count down before we jump.

245
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:18,800
Five.

246
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,280
Two.

247
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:19,720
Zero.

248
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,120
Jump!

249
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,160
We're stuck.

250
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,080
Don't be afraid.

251
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm holding onto you.

252
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,400
Don't be afraid.

253
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,880
We're about to jump.

254
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,560
Wait a second.

255
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,320
The guy still won't let go.

256
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,560
The guy is really scared.

257
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,120
His grip is getting stronger.

258
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:45,920
Holding the rope?

259
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,840
Holding on.

260
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:48,960
Bend your knees.

261
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,480
Squat down.

262
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,120
I can't do it.

263
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,200
Okay, three, two, one, jump!

264
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,200
Protected.

265
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,800
So sweet.

266
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,280
Princess carry in the air.

267
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,240
Hug in the air.

268
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,720
This is good.

269
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,680
This is really good.

270
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,080
Holding completely.

271
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,720
What's going on?

272
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,680
What's going on?

273
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,360
What's going on?

274
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:32,960
Scoreless streak.

275
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,000
I just can't get up.

276
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,320
Chi Chi seems to really enjoy teasing him.

277
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,520
Super happy.

278
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,920
She looks at him being silly and clueless.

279
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,720
It's really cute.

280
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,680
Yeah, it's the contrast.

281
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,280
So Chi Chi is different today.

282
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:50,920
Today, she is

283
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,120
the one in control.

284
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,120
I noticed that when people

285
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,200
are in front of someone they like,

286
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,000
they keep smiling foolishly.

287
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,960
Not even knowing why they're smiling.

288
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,360
Their body language changes too.

289
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,320
She just took the initiative

290
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,840
and grabbed his hand back.

291
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,960
He didn't pull away.

292
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:01,920
Not her.

293
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,320
She grabbed back.

294
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,200
Because she was scared.

295
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,920
She really wanted to hold on.

296
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,960
That's possible too.

297
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,600
I'm really hungry.

298
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,120
Then let's hurry up

299
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,760
and go.

300
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,880
So, did you have fun today?

301
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:15,720
Yes, I did.

302
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,960
Super happy.

303
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,000
That's great.

304
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,320
I've actually never been to this place before.

305
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,520
And the activities

306
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,720
should all be things we're interested in.

307
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,160
Yeah.

308
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,760
I like hearing that.

309
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,560
Why?

310
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,920
Because they're things we both like.

311
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,560
And what did you say before?

312
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,800
You said I seemed scared.

313
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,280
What?

314
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,480
I think that's nonsense.

315
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,400
Now he's starting

316
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,360
to defend himself.

317
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,040
Yeah.

318
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,560
He's fine now.

319
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,160
Driving.

320
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,320
No problem.

321
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,640
Does it bother you?

322
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,440
I don't really like it.

323
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,520
Being misunderstood.

324
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,880
If you express yourself, you won't be misunderstood.

325
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,920
Okay.

326
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,720
Yeah, I keep saying it.

327
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,640
I really can do it.

328
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,720
So are you someone who expresses

329
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,120
your thoughts directly?

330
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,920
Talking about what matters most to you.

331
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,720
Talking about what matters most to you.

332
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,000
Depends on the situation.

333
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,320
Like at work.

334
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,600
I think I'm pretty direct.

335
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,320
But not when it comes to feelings.

336
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,040
In terms of feelings,

337
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,320
When it comes to feelings, I

338
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,840
I seem a bit

339
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,400
A bit shy.

340
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,680
I'm a little shy, yeah.

341
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,600
See, you're shy.

342
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,960
Yeah, I think he's really shy.

343
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,480
But I think in front of Chi Chi,

344
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,960
he's already pretty proactive.

345
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,880
He's talking a lot.

346
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,520
Yeah.

347
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,720
So you're not good at expressing

348
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,080
your feelings?

349
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,080
But

350
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,960
what if you're misunderstood?

351
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,320
I need to clearly know

352
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,760
that I've been misunderstood.

353
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,720
Only then will I

354
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:02,920
explain.

355
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,840
Yeah, try to explain.

356
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,600
Really.

357
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,840
Staying up late affects your memory.

358
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,280
So what do you remember every day?

359
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,360
I remember things about you.

360
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,280
You like spicy pork stir-fry.

361
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,160
Yeah.

362
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,400
You like spicy pork stir-fry.

363
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,000
You like yellow, right?

364
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,640
You like yellow.

365
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,640
That's great.

366
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,080
You usually seem pretty quiet.

367
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,120
But now

368
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,760
You like spicy pork stir-fry.

369
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,400
You like yellow, right?

370
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,280
Not bad, you remembered some things.

371
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,360
Bonus points.

372
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,040
Do you remember my name?

373
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,320
Why did you suddenly ask

374
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,120
this question?

375
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,280
I'm just asking.

376
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,320
Jin Yuxing.

377
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,520
I'm just asking.

378
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,560
Which "Yu"?

379
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,080
He's acting cute with her.

380
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,400
I'm just asking.

381
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,680
The "Yu" from Dayu, the flood controller.

382
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:01,920
Okay.

383
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,400
I won't quiz you anymore.

384
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,680
So, do you remember my name?

385
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,640
Of course.

386
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,600
I'm just asking.

387
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,160
Why are you laughing?

388
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,520
You always talk so slowly.

389
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,400
Do you think being slow is good?

390
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,680
It's nice, because I'm fast.

391
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,160
Because I'm fast.

392
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,440
So, do you like me this way?

393
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,880
Feels a bit like romance.

394
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,760
It's nice, because I'm fast.

395
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,840
Are you a rapper?

396
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,200
Yeah, do a song.

397
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,000
I'll perform for you.

398
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,720
Go ahead.

399
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,880
Please start your performance.

400
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,800
Do an improv performance.

401
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,320
This is a rare performance.

402
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,520
What's your stage name?

403
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,880
My stage name?

404
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,000
Chi Chi, that's my stage name.

405
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,680
Chi Chi Cake.

406
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,320
Loves cake.

407
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,640
Okay, loves cake.

408
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,480
Got it, I'll remember.

409
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,040
Right here.

410
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,000
The decor here is pretty unique.

411
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,360
But I've really been to this place many times.

412
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,200
Really?

413
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,000
Yeah, because it's really delicious.

414
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,000
Good choice.

415
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,440
Thanks for taking me out today.

416
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,680
I had a great time too.

417
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,800
I'll start with the spicy pork stir-fry.

418
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:39,800
Okay.

419
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,440
I see you've been eating nonstop.

420
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,600
Yeah, I can really handle spicy food.

421
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,400
Seriously.

422
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,720
I really like eating with people

423
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,120
who can just keep eating.

424
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,040
It makes me have a better appetite.

425
00:16:59,320 --> 00:16:59,960
Yeah.

426
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,680
And I really don't like it

427
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,800
when I'm still eating

428
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,000
and someone says they're full.

429
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,280
Me too.

430
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,880
It just makes me feel like

431
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,720
I don't want to eat anymore.

432
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,480
Same, I lose my appetite too.

433
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,080
Yeah.

434
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,680
Being able to eat together is so important.

435
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,840
It's really, really important.

436
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,200
Seriously, it's important.

437
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,480
Did you come back right after graduation?

438
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,160
You went straight home, right?

439
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,160
Actually, I didn't really

440
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,000
finish my undergraduate degree.

441
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,960
Why?

442
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:28,640
Back then,

443
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,840
because of my family's

444
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,760
business situation,

445
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,440
I emailed the school

446
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,120
to suspend my studies

447
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,280
and came back to take over the family business.

448
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,720
So you just came back right away?

449
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,200
From being a student, you suddenly became

450
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,320
From a student to suddenly

451
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,000
Was that a big leap?

452
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,800
Definitely a huge leap.

453
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,800
Back in school,

454
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,000
your only pressure

455
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,840
came from your studies.

456
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,640
If you didn't understand something,

457
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,360
you could just ask your teachers or professors.

458
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,760
But in society, there's no one to ask.

459
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,600
Yeah.

460
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,240
Especially for someone like me

461
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,520
with no work experience.

462
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,760
Totally.

463
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,080
I had no idea how to

464
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,840
run and manage a company.

465
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,520
It was really hard at first.

466
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,200
It was long, tough, and hard to get through.

467
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,520
I could only rely on myself

468
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,280
to figure things out.

469
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,280
Yeah, just figure it out on my own.

470
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,200
Sometimes it was really overwhelming.

471
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,960
Maybe it's only gotten a bit better this year.

472
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,000
This year?

473
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,560
Yeah.

474
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,440
Every year, my mindset and thoughts

475
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,600
have changed.

476
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,680
I do feel like I matured faster.

477
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,280
No wonder your friends say

478
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,160
you've grown a lot in the past two years.

479
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,800
Right?

480
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,200
Yeah, that's probably why.

481
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,400
It feels like

482
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,880
a very unique way to grow up.

483
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,680
There's this feeling of

484
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,640
ups and downs,

485
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:09,880
a sense of highs and lows.

486
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,000
Yeah, there are ups and downs.

487
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,080
So after going through all that,

488
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,200
do you think those ups and downs

489
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,360
were actually worth it, or...

490
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,840
I wouldn't say now that

491
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,120
I'm grateful for

492
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,600
I mean,

493
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,040
the hardships I went through.

494
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,720
Or anything like that, I just think

495
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,800
you should never be thankful for

496
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,520
suffering—suffering is just suffering.

497
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,480
Yeah, I agree.

498
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,680
So what can you actually change?

499
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,680
It’s already happened.

500
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,480
All you can do is

501
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,120
think about how to make the future better.

502
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,760
I totally agree.

503
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,240
Exactly.

504
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,160
Hardship is just hardship.

505
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,080
Never romanticize suffering.

506
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,440
Yes.

507
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:55,800
Right.

508
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:00,960
They don’t appreciate hardship.

509
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,040
I’m truly grateful for it.

510
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,400
I think hardship made me who I am today.

511
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,840
I don’t praise suffering either.

512
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,920
But I’m grateful for my own struggles.

513
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,920
But sometimes I think

514
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,440
what feels like hardship now

515
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,680
turns out to be a gift after a few years.

516
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,560
It’s all a gift.

517
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,640
It’s not about thanking hardship.

518
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,680
I think it’s about appreciating

519
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,640
the person you were facing it.

520
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,120
Yeah.

521
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,920
Luckily, I made it through.

522
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,760
I’m so brave, I’m awesome.

523
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,400
Yeah.

524
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,880
After you talked to me that day,

525
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,880
did you regret it?

526
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,560
Or anything else?

527
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,920
So do you know what you’re thinking?

528
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,240
Do you know your thoughts now?

529
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,440
At this moment?

530
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,120
I’m probably a bit slow to realize things.

531
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,120
Honestly, sometimes

532
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:53,960
I regret it.

533
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,920
Why do I regret it?

534
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,080
I feel like I got

535
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,880
the answer I wanted at the time.

536
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,600
At least this time, it was effective communication.

537
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,680
I think relationship issues

538
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,880
are really hard to handle.

539
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,320
If it happens to someone else,

540
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,320
then it’s like

541
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,680
being an emotional analyst.

542
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,480
But if it happens

543
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,720
to yourself,

544
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,960
you feel like an idiot.

545
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,360
Why?

546
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,240
I feel like

547
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,960
when I do something,

548
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,920
am I

549
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,280
hurting

550
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:53,440
some people involved?

551
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,080
And then

552
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,640
maybe that’s why

553
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,400
in some

554
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,000
emotional matters, I’m slower.

555
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,560
Is he saying he’s afraid of hurting Yifan?

556
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,520
I’m someone who moves fast.

557
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,840
I know what I want.

558
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,400
I think matching pace is important for two people.

559
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,800
It really matters.

560
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,080
Yeah, see,

561
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,160
her personality,

562
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,160
I think she wants things quickly,

563
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,280
she wants answers fast,

564
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,760
and needs clarity.

565
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,920
No two people

566
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,680
are naturally a perfect match.

567
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,800
Effective communication

568
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,200
is what helps you sync up, right.

569
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,800
You can

570
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,560
slow down or speed up.

571
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,240
That way,

572
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,560
with good communication,

573
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,680
many problems

574
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,040
can be solved.

575
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,320
If you want something,

576
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,880
you have to try your best to get it.

577
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,680
Do your best.

578
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,560
Look, your eyes are shining again.

579
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,320
I can see all the love in your eyes.

580
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,200
Yeah.

581
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,480
Pack up

582
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,480
As long as you want to go

583
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,720
Change for the other person

584
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,560
That’s a kind of

585
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,880
positive feedback

586
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,400
No one is born

587
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,120
as a perfect match

588
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,160
There’s always someone

589
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,920
willing to

590
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,760
make changes

591
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,360
And the other is willing

592
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,240
to compromise

593
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,880
But I’m worried Jin Yuxing is too slow

594
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,160
No, he’s already adjusting

595
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,640
But last time he talked

596
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,920
he was pretty clear expressing himself

597
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,840
about himself

598
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,200
I think Chi Chi is great

599
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:10,920
I agree

600
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,960
This girl is really nice

601
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,520
Chi Chi is really generous

602
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,480
I really like her

603
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,680
And she’s already twice

604
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,400
taken the initiative

605
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,440
to solve problems

606
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,400
She won’t keep

607
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,120
holding a grudge

608
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,720
She wants to clarify things

609
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,000
I think that’s great

610
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,440
In future relationships

611
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,280
or in the future

612
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,080
after being together for a long time

613
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,760
I think this

614
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,400
is very important

615
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,040
Communication is key

616
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:28,600
Yes

617
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,240
Right

618
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,080
Her way

619
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,160
makes it easy for others to be with her

620
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,320
You know, many people have to guess

621
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,520
if you’ll say something or not

622
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,840
But if you think about it

623
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,840
Doesn’t Jin Yuxing also make people guess?

624
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,600
Because I think he speaks vaguely

625
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,640
But

626
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,720
Jin Yuxing said

627
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,840
you can ask

628
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,480
Jin Yuxing said

629
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,720
as long as you make the question

630
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,560
clear to him

631
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,280
he will

632
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,560
explain and respond

633
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,240
So I think Chi Chi

634
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,440
understands Jin Yuxing

635
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,880
They both get

636
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,680
each other, they have common ground

637
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,000
Yes

638
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,800
Trying their best to get closer

639
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,000
to what you want

640
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,800
This sentence

641
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,240
doesn’t feel pressuring

642
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,520
It’s very comfortable

643
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,920
And I think Jin Yuxing is sincere

644
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,840
because he analyzes his own issues

645
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,880
He said it’s because

646
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,680
of certain reasons

647
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,120
that he’s slow emotionally

648
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,480
He’s aware of his weaknesses

649
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,480
And the other person told him

650
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,280
If you want it

651
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,360
just do your best

652
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:15,800
That’s nice

653
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,080
I think

654
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,160
in this group

655
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,680
we’ve felt many

656
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,840
heart-fluttering moments

657
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,440
And in this process

658
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,080
I think they

659
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,320
have their own pace

660
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:24,920
It’s very

661
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,000
much their own rhythm

662
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,320
Next

663
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,720
let’s look forward to

664
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,520
the next group’s date

665
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,520
Who will it be?

666
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,880
Let’s find out together

667
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:12,720
Squash

668
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,600
Squash is really fun.

669
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:23,920
Wang Jue

670
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,320
Jue

671
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,760
So happy.

672
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,760
Hello.

673
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,480
You look handsome today.

674
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,720
You look beautiful.

675
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,480
Thank you.

676
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,000
Have you played before?

677
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,800
I haven’t.

678
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,280
I’m a bit nervous.

679
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,840
Have you played before?

680
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,520
I played when I was a kid.

681
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,480
My dad

682
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,560
used to love playing.

683
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,840
He took me a few times.

684
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,280
Maybe you’ll have to teach me today.

685
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:07,600
Okay.

686
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,440
And I also

687
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,640
I bought some snacks.

688
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,440
We can eat them after playing.

689
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,200
Alright.

690
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,320
Cream puffs.

691
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,480
Thanks.

692
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,040
Just put them here.

693
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,520
Is it here?

694
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,640
Yes, inside here.

695
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,160
Let’s go.

696
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,440
Can you show me first?

697
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:31,640
Just

698
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,040
Like this.

699
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,800
But how do two people play together?

700
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,800
You can’t let it stop.

701
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,720
After I hit, you return it. After you hit, I return.

702
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,360
You make it look so easy.

703
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,120
Can you teach me?

704
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,200
I’ll give it a try.

705
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,920
I haven’t played in a long time either.

706
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,000
So I might not be a good teacher.

707
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,560
It’s this vertical angle.

708
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,440
Then swing back.

709
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,000
Hit it backwards like this.

710
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,640
Let me try.

711
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,560
I can return all of them.

712
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,480
Not bad.

713
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,480
Seems like I’m getting better.

714
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,600
At least I can play now.

715
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,120
He keeps feeding her balls.

716
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,920
Yeah, keeps feeding balls.

717
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,600
He’s very gentle.

718
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:42,960
It’s okay.

719
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,760
This is great.

720
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,240
First time with so many rallies.

721
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,080
Almost.

722
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,080
Success.

723
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,560
How about

724
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,160
See if I miss more

725
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,560
or you miss more.

726
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,040
Sure.

727
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,280
If you miss more times,

728
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,880
What does the loser do?

729
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,600
What should they do?

730
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,080
Maybe treat me to food.

731
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,040
Who treats for dinner?

732
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:17,600
I think it’s a very

733
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,360
I was just thinking that too.

734
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,160
friendly

735
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:19,640
No, I think

736
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,600
Promise me one thing.

737
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,200
Just

738
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,480
Ride the little train with me.

739
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,880
Right?

740
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,880
Even better.

741
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,800
That’s impressive.

742
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,840
More than anything we thought of.

743
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,000
Better than all our ideas.

744
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,080
Just ride the little train with me.

745
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:38,480
Yeah.

746
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,920
We were too conservative.

747
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,640
Ride the little train with me.

748
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,640
I like this invitation.

749
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,200
Little train, sure.

750
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,760
If I miss more times,

751
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,760
Then

752
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,600
Pick a gift.

753
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:12,640
Okay.

754
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,560
Maybe I’ve already prepared one.

755
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,280
She’s already prepared.

756
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,120
What? You’re already prepared?

757
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,040
Not telling you.

758
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,200
What are you talking about?

759
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,160
So do you want to win or lose?

760
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,760
Do you want to win or lose?

761
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,000
You two should just go play squash.

762
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,400
Best of three, okay?

763
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,120
Alright.

764
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,200
Okay.

765
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:49,720
You’re not going easy.

766
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,680
You’re not going easy.

767
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,080
This works. Good.

768
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,400
Okay.

769
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,280
Why has Wang Jue suddenly changed?

770
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,320
I think she’s super cute right now.

771
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,400
She’s finally opened up.

772
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:08,480
She’s finally opened up.

773
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,360
Yeah.

774
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,080
Awesome.

775
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,840
Alright, you got this.

776
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:26,760
Looking forward to it.

777
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,400
So, you’re preparing a gift?

778
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:29,800
Yes.

779
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,320
Can’t wait.

780
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,200
Don’t guess.

781
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,760
A perfect ending.

782
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,240
Should we go eat?

783
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:40,960
Let’s go.

784
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,600
That was a direct approach too.

785
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,120
Yeah, she’s brave too.

786
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:48,920
She’s really brave.

787
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,240
She was brave with Le Chen last time too.

788
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,400
But I think it’s different.

789
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,320
Totally different.

790
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,560
Yeah, I think when she’s

791
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,720
with Rui Long, she’s more confident.

792
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,240
Let’s go.

793
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,640
So pretty.

794
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,080
Let’s start eating.

795
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:24,920
Okay.

796
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,800
Everything looks delicious.

797
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,200
I think today is a rare opportunity.

798
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,520
Feels like we rarely get this in the cabin.

799
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,800
A chance to chat one-on-one.

800
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,120
Yeah.

801
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,480
Usually, when there are many people,

802
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,280
I don’t talk much.

803
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:46,960
I’m quiet.

804
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,880
Yeah, I know.

805
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,680
I noticed that too.

806
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,920
So I was a bit worried.

807
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,720
I wondered if maybe

808
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,920
you’re someone who doesn’t really like

809
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,760
for example,

810
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,440
showing yourself in front of others.

811
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:02,840
I worry about that too.

812
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,600
Maybe it’s hard to get close to you.

813
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,600
Yeah, that’s true.

814
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,520
But today, I don’t think that’s the case.

815
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,960
And every time

816
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,000
whether I talk or write,

817
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,240
I think about it for a long time.

818
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,040
Sometimes I

819
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,360
send someone a message,

820
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I’m the type

821
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,560
who can think for half an hour

822
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,600
before sending a single text.

823
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,000
No wonder after you send a message

824
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
it takes so long.

825
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,760
Turns out we’re waiting for you.

826
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,600
Will we have to wait long tonight?

827
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,480
Will we have to wait long tonight?

828
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,120
Very clear.

829
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,600
Not sure.

830
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,000
He didn’t say directly.

831
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,000
There’s another question.

832
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,040
What is it?

833
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,320
Maybe you’d like to talk about this?

834
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,480
Your thoughts on

835
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,760
your attitude toward relationships.

836
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,560
Or something like that.

837
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,440
Because sometimes, in my experience,

838
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,520
the more I do,

839
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,440
the worse the result.

840
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,840
It just turns out worse.

841
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,880
No.

842
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,360
No, that won’t happen.

843
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,920
Not in the cabin either.

844
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,480
Bro Jiao won’t let you fail.

845
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,160
Bro Jiao is really great.

846
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:56,760
Yes.

847
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,360
Bro Jiao really

848
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,120
he’s a

849
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,480
very soft-hearted person.

850
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:02,760
People like that

851
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,800
are super warm.

852
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,080
They’re super warm as friends too.

853
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,560
Duo Duo is similar.

854
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:17,840
Very caring.

855
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,560
Really good at taking care of others.

856
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,920
But sometimes not so good

857
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,720
at taking care of themselves.

858
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:26,960
Just

859
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,360
to consider others’ feelings,

860
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,280
they end up neglecting their own

861
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,520
needs.

862
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,280
Rui Long really understands Duo Duo.

863
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:46,720
What about you?

864
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,840
I think I'm a pretty extreme person.

865
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,400
I either want the best,

866
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,680
or I don't want anything at all.

867
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,360
That sentence...

868
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,120
And you?

869
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,800
I think I'm someone

870
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,560
who sticks firmly to my own ideas.

871
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,400
I know why I do things this way.

872
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,520
I know my reasons.

873
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,600
And I have the motivation to keep going.

874
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,320
So I go ahead and do it.

875
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,760
I feel true to myself.

876
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,200
That's great, really.

877
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,880
Even if you reject me, I'll keep moving forward.

878
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,040
Hope you find your

879
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,040
best match in the house.

880
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,320
This is so heartbreaking.

881
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,120
I feel a bit sad for Wang Jue.

882
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,880
She finally gathered her courage again.

883
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,680
Yeah.

884
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,120
But I think

885
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,320
anything is possible.

886
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,480
Anything is possible.

887
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,840
They're talking about different things.

888
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,520
It's really brave for a girl to do this.

889
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,600
It's pretty good too.

890
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,600
Everything's been made clear.

891
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,600
No one regrets it.

892
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,440
I've said everything I needed to.

893
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,880
But from what just happened,

894
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,960
I feel even more that Ruilong

895
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,880
is someone

896
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,840
who's very perceptive.

897
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,320
He's not dull at all.

898
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,320
He just makes himself

899
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,880
look dull.

900
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,840
Pretending to be clueless makes things less awkward.

901
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,080
Before Wang Jue

902
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,680
expressed herself so directly,

903
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,720
Ruilong was actually

904
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,840
pretty relaxed.

905
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,480
Then Wang Jue

906
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,480
took a step forward,

907
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,720
and he immediately stepped back.

908
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,080
Then during dinner,

909
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:52,680
he showed his thoughts

910
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,880
completely

911
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,640
and openly.

912
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,960
He's quite smart.

913
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,440
But I

914
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,640
really hope Wang Jue

915
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,600
can find someone

916
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,960
who sees her as Wang Jue

917
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,520
and as the very best.

918
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,400
Yeah.

919
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,320
She said before

920
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,640
"I don't want to be

921
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,360
the second choice."

922
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,520
Right.

923
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,080
Next,

924
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,480
let's check out Dr. Fang

925
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,720
and Lan Lan's date.

926
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:23,880
Tulips.

927
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,880
Maybe they have a special meaning.

928
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,320
Here they come.

929
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,760
Thank you.

930
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,520
Did you guess what we're doing today?

931
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:50,800
Playing ball.

932
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:51,960
What kind of ball?

933
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,680
No idea.

934
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,320
On the card you drew before,

935
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,440
billiards.

936
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,320
Billiards.

937
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,440
Just take this with you.

938
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,960
Didn't you want to play?

939
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,040
Okay.

940
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,040
Then teach me.

941
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,520
But I think teaching billiards

942
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,000
is also

943
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,720
a great

944
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,640
and romantic gesture.

945
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,440
That's right.

946
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,720
So teach me.

947
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,080
Actually, I'm not very good either.

948
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,960
Then let's

949
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,040
try something we've never done before.

950
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:19,720
We can

951
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,160
do some novices competing stuff.

952
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:22,880
Sure.

953
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,240
Today you gave me

954
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,480
your favorite flower.

955
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,480
Yeah.

956
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,080
Sit over here.

957
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:28,440
Okay.

958
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,200
It's the flower guys like most.

959
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,880
Last time I gave you that peony, right?

960
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,600
Last time it was your favorite flower.

961
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,880
So this time I picked

962
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,000
the flower I like.

963
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,640
But it's my favorite color.

964
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,760
Do you like it?

965
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,440
I love it.

966
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,040
Those two

967
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:48,920
Look,

968
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,360
their logic for giving flowers is totally different.

969
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,680
Telling you what I like.

970
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,120
Once for what I like.

971
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,000
Once for what you like.

972
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,600
That's bold.

973
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,400
In this relationship,

974
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,640
I'm important too.

975
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,680
So it makes the girl feel

976
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,120
kind of

977
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,480
like meeting a worthy opponent.

978
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,640
So we

979
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,400
I...

980
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,320
Have you played billiards before?

981
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,960
Just a little.

982
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,200
But not very well.

983
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:17,680
I'm not good either.

984
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,720
Let me try.

985
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,200
Okay.

986
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,040
Your turn.

987
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,800
Alright.

988
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,960
The position of your white ball

989
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,520
is a bit tough for me.

990
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,640
You can hit it again.

991
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,760
If not, just hit it softly.

992
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,400
Billiards is actually a pretty good game.

993
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,600
You did well just hitting it.

994
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,480
I'm really a newbie.

995
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:40,920
Seeing how bad I am,

996
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,920
does that make you feel better?

997
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,440
It's really novices competing.

998
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,560
I'll break them up a bit.

999
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,160
Didn't you say

1000
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,280
you've been playing billiards with friends lately?

1001
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,280
Just started.

1002
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,360
Really just started.

1003
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,480
Okay.

1004
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,800
Sure.

1005
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,360
I'll clear some of mine.

1006
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:02,960
Then you can

1007
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,920
see your balls more clearly.

1008
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,400
Alright.

1009
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,040
Right?

1010
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:06,680
Okay.

1011
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,560
Nice.

1012
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,040
Nice.

1013
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,800
You got two in a row.

1014
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,120
This one's hard to get in.

1015
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,240
I think you can.

1016
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,880
See, I told you.

1017
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,200
Go again.

1018
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:46,720
Your turn.

1019
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,720
Give me a rest, please.

1020
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,320
Thanks.

1021
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,400
Impressive.

1022
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:02,520
Finally gave you a chance to get some applause.

1023
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,200
Finally gave you a chance to get some applause.

1024
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:06,560
Keep going.

1025
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,240
The cue ball went in.

1026
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,160
That's a penalty.

1027
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,280
So now you should

1028
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,280
I get a free ball.

1029
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,480
Can you get it for me?

1030
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:19,960
Okay.

1031
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:20,320
Can you get it for me?

1032
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,280
Can you get it for me?

1033
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,400
"Bossy" doctor.

1034
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,120
Your observation skills aren't sharp enough.

1035
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,400
What do you mean?

1036
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,480
Your observation isn't detailed enough.

1037
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,280
What's wrong?

1038
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,600
What's up?

1039
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,360
Nothing, I'll tell you later.

1040
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,200
Is there something inside?

1041
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,840
There's a ball inside.

1042
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,400
It's a surprise.

1043
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:56,800
Yeah.

1044
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,000
Right.

1045
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:57,800
He thought she would notice.

1046
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,880
But she didn't notice.

1047
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,480
So he asked her to get it.

1048
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,600
She found it.

1049
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:09,880
A small ball.

1050
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:10,800
A blue ball.

1051
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,720
Your observation skills aren't sharp either.

1052
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,640
Found it.

1053
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,400
What do you think this is?

1054
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,960
This set of numbers.

1055
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,560
A numeric code.

1056
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,600
It's a warning with no repetition.

1057
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,800
It's the golden window for resuscitation.

1058
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,600
It's the number of human chromosome pairs.

1059
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,840
Plus the DNA helix structure.

1060
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,760
This set of numbers is the code of life.

1061
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,720
Which numbers?

1062
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:51,840
Take a guess.

1063
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,720
Because she said she's sapiosexual.

1064
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:56,760
She likes smart people.

1065
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,680
Which number has no repetition?

1066
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,040
Which number doesn't repeat?

1067
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,000
Zero.

1068
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,400
That's it.

1069
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,760
What do you mean by "that's it"?

1070
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,280
Zero.

1071
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:13,800
Right.

1072
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:15,960
And then?

1073
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:16,680
Go on.

1074
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:17,240
There's more.

1075
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,040
The golden window for resuscitation.

1076
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:19,880
Do you know?

1077
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:20,680
No.

1078
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:21,560
Five minutes.

1079
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,200
Five minutes.

1080
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,240
Zero five.

1081
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,760
It's the number of human chromosome pairs.

1082
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:27,880
Do you know this one?

1083
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,200
No.

1084
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,520
Twenty-three.

1085
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,280
Twenty-three.

1086
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,120
Twenty-three.

1087
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,800
The DNA helix structure.

1088
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,160
I really don't know.

1089
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,120
What structure is it?

1090
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,200
Double helix.

1091
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,680
Double helix.

1092
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,680
Double helix, two.

1093
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,160
Yes.

1094
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,280
Add it up.

1095
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,560
So together it's

1096
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,720
Zero five two five.

1097
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,920
Zero five two five.

1098
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,360
What does zero five two five mean?

1099
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,040
Does this number have any meaning?

1100
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,080
No idea.

1101
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,320
I didn't give you a gift when you arrived.

1102
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,560
Were you a little disappointed?

1103
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:02,400
No.

1104
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,120
Not disappointed.

1105
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,520
Just seeing you makes me happy.

1106
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,040
I'm happy just to see you.

1107
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,320
Okay, actually it's a string of

1108
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:12,680
numbers, a code.

1109
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,320
leading to where I'll give you a gift.

1110
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,680
What’s this?

1111
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,320
Try making the first shot.

1112
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:33,760
Okay.

1113
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,480
I really like his design.

1114
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,400
This is nice.

1115
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,440
And “0525” is

1116
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:43,440
us,

1117
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:44,920
the first day

1118
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:45,800
we met.

1119
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:46,800
The day we met.

1120
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:48,880
So sweet.

1121
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,320
The day we first met.

1122
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,760
He’s really into rituals.

1123
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,640
And you know,

1124
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,680
what’s most important?

1125
00:45:58,840 --> 00:45:59,320
Did you notice?

1126
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,280
We’re giving gifts,

1127
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,880
but not directly.

1128
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,160
You have to stretch out the process.

1129
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,400
You want the treasure,

1130
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,600
but first I’ll give you

1131
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,640
a treasure map.

1132
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,240
And when they’re together,

1133
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,440
Dr. Fang doesn’t

1134
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,560
constantly flatter Lan Lan.

1135
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:13,840
Right.

1136
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:14,360
He’ll say,

1137
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,880
“You’re not observant enough.”

1138
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:16,360
Yeah.

1139
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,480
Yes.

1140
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,880
They challenge each other.

1141
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,840
These two are a great match.

1142
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,360
Hurry, she’s opening the gift.

1143
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,840
Looking forward to the gift.

1144
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,640
Such a brain-teasing process.

1145
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,440
Is it perfume?

1146
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:44,720
Is it perfume?

1147
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,360
Yes.

1148
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,080
How did you know?

1149
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,080
Thank you.

1150
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:51,680
Thanks.

1151
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,680
I think this

1152
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,080
is something you’ll like.

1153
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,680
It’s right from the heart.

1154
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,160
Do you want to see the others?

1155
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,560
A photo of us.

1156
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,520
A photo from our first date.

1157
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,480
Yes.

1158
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,760
Very thoughtful.

1159
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,880
That day, I arrived early

1160
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,680
and asked the owner to take it for us.

1161
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,800
I told him in advance.

1162
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:18,200
So considerate.

1163
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,880
You look so handsome.

1164
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,040
You look even prettier.

1165
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,400
How are you so cute?

1166
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,200
This whole sequence

1167
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,480
is a bit hard to figure out.

1168
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:35,320
This puzzle.

1169
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:35,600
No.

1170
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,760
Aren’t you usually quick at guessing?

1171
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:38,560
Can you hold this for me?

1172
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,080
Sure.

1173
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,440
Thank you.

1174
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:42,800
Bowling.

1175
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,840
So what did you see?

1176
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:46,240
I saw

1177
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,480
What is it?

1178
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,640
There’s a claw machine.

1179
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:51,120
Yeah.

1180
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,520
He’s good at guiding Lan Lan.

1181
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,400
This is for you.

1182
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:57,680
The second gift.

1183
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,040
It’s also a gift for me.

1184
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,280
A note.

1185
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,400
I wrote nine of them.

1186
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,680
I’ve really learned a lot.

1187
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,640
The things I want to do with you in the cabin

1188
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,160
are all written inside

1189
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:41,600
the capsule toy.

1190
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:43,960
There are many.

1191
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:44,840
Nine in total.

1192
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,040
If you want to do them with me,

1193
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,360
you can pick one out

1194
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,400
every day.

1195
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:50,920
Okay.

1196
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,880
Look.

1197
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:57,960
No matter who you meet,

1198
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,200
you have to do one thing with me each day.

1199
00:48:59,200 --> 00:48:59,920
Right.

1200
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,160
For nine days in a row.

1201
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,400
I really feel the charm of intelligence.

1202
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,120
Dr. Fang

1203
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,240
Before doing this,

1204
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:05,920
he was already

1205
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,440
very confident.

1206
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,080
Let me show you how to use it.

1207
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,680
First,

1208
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,120
put a coin in.

1209
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:17,880
Then grab one.

1210
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:18,800
This one.

1211
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,080
Like this.

1212
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:21,480
I’m really looking forward to this.

1213
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,800
You want to do two things.

1214
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,880
One will pop out randomly.

1215
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:34,280
Do you want to check now

1216
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,200
or later?

1217
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:36,920
Later.

1218
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:37,480
Okay.

1219
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,160
Then keep it.

1220
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:38,640
Alright.

1221
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,360
Do you have a pocket?

1222
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,120
Yes.

1223
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:42,360
Put it in your pocket.

1224
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,160
Sure.

1225
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,120
Are you good at bowling?

1226
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:47,840
Do you want to play?

1227
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:48,360
Come on.

1228
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:53,840
Now it’s

1229
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,000
our time together.

1230
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,200
Start with your right foot.

1231
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:02,760
Right.

1232
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:06,680
No.

1233
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,560
You need to step with your right foot first.

1234
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,840
Then when you reach that spot,

1235
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,520
that’s when you swing your arm, right?

1236
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,160
This isn’t what I expected.

1237
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,120
Dr. Fang almost swung himself out.

1238
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,960
You’re even less coordinated than me.

1239
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:26,440
Try again.

1240
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,280
Not elegant at all.

1241
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,760
So awkward.

1242
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,360
I’ll just run myself.

1243
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:32,840
Alright.

1244
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:41,440
You bowl.

1245
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,120
Your form is textbook.

1246
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,520
I think you’ll get a strike.

1247
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,120
You guessed it.

1248
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,680
You’re amazing.

1249
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:06,960
Want to try the basketball machine?

1250
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:07,520
Sure.

1251
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:11,560
Darn it.

1252
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:12,600
Didn’t make a single shot.

1253
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,000
Challenge failed.

1254
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,920
No way, this is hilarious.

1255
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,440
I’m really not good at any of these games.

1256
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,000
Claw machine.

1257
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,760
I’m decent at the claw machine.

1258
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:25,640
This cute puppy

1259
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:26,720
looks a bit like you.

1260
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,000
Let me try.

1261
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:34,840
How did you get two?

1262
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:35,560
Which one do you want?

1263
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:36,560
I want

1264
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,040
this one.

1265
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:37,440
This one.

1266
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:38,840
Thank you.

1267
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:40,960
When you got one,

1268
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:41,800
why didn’t you say anything?

1269
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,600
Because I wanted to get two.

1270
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,240
I’m really mad.

1271
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:46,680
You didn’t get any.

1272
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:47,600
Didn’t get one.

1273
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,520
Do you still want to try?

1274
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:49,800
I’m done.

1275
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:50,360
I’m upset.

1276
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,160
Then

1277
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:53,880
let’s eat.

1278
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,600
I picked

1279
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,520
a Thai restaurant.

1280
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,160
I love Thai food.

1281
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,920
I brought you Kang Shifu jasmine pomelo tea.

1282
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,320
Thank you.

1283
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,680
And a bouquet.

1284
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,640
Such delicate jasmine flowers.

1285
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:16,480
Thank you.

1286
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:17,440
Let’s toast.

1287
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,800
It’s the familiar jasmine fragrance.

1288
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,480
And the sweet, refreshing taste of grapefruit.

1289
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,360
It’s really delicious.

1290
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,640
As long as you like it.

1291
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,640
Let’s all raise a toast.

1292
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,680
And then,

1293
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,160
I have something to give you.

1294
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:40,880
Yes.

1295
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,600
I prepared a gift for you this time.

1296
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,200
She has a gift too.

1297
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,040
Try guessing what it is first.

1298
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,680
Based on the hints I gave you.

1299
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,440
I probably only mentioned that I like playing badminton.

1300
00:52:58,640 --> 00:52:59,840
So I think it might be

1301
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:01,400
a racket.

1302
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:04,440
Is that right?

1303
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,600
Let me take it out for you.

1304
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:10,960
It definitely is.

1305
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:11,520
This one,

1306
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,320
this length.

1307
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:12,760
Yes.

1308
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,920
That’s because

1309
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:16,960
I heard you mention before

1310
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,240
that you play badminton.

1311
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,320
But I didn’t expect, at the sports day,

1312
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:21,640
you played so well.

1313
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,760
And we even won the match.

1314
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:26,880
So I

1315
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:27,480
Thank you.

1316
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:28,360
got you a badminton racket.

1317
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,520
There are a few other things inside.

1318
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,000
But the main thing is the racket.

1319
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:35,680
This is really nice.

1320
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,760
And I hope you can

1321
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,480
keep doing what you love.

1322
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,360
You really play well.

1323
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:46,360
Thank you.

1324
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:49,680
No need to thank me.

1325
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,200
I really like it.

1326
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,440
A shy smile.

1327
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:06,520
Both of them can

1328
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,160
guess each other’s gifts.

1329
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:09,280
They’re evenly matched.

1330
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,320
This counts as a surprise.

1331
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:14,440
Really?

1332
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,080
Didn’t you give me one today—

1333
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,160
a claw machine?

1334
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,720
Didn’t you grab a (little ball)?

1335
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,080
Let’s take a look.

1336
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:27,640
I’ll open it.

1337
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,400
Because you already know what’s inside.

1338
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,720
I don’t know exactly what it is.

1339
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,160
I just know there are nine.

1340
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:39,880
What is it?

1341
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:46,880
Five minutes.

1342
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,440
That staring contest.

1343
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,600
Can you look away?

1344
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:53,880
No, you can’t.

1345
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,040
You can’t look away either.

1346
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,360
No laughing.

1347
00:54:59,360 --> 00:54:59,760
Okay.

1348
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:00,560
No laughing.

1349
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,960
Then I’ll have to think of sad things.

1350
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,560
If you laugh, you have to start over.

1351
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:06,760
Restart the timer.

1352
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:07,560
Okay.

1353
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:10,320
So this—

1354
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,800
Doesn’t this mean we just keep staring?

1355
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,520
Keep playing until no one laughs?

1356
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:17,880
Okay.

1357
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:21,840
Why are we starting now?

1358
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,720
I’ll get shy.

1359
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:37,080
I lost.

1360
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,880
If I get serious, you’ll definitely lose.

1361
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,280
Who can handle this?

1362
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:02,360
I can’t take it.

1363
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,080
No, I really can’t hold it in.

1364
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:10,720
No, I really can’t hold it in.

1365
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,640
You’re setting yourself up.

1366
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,480
I just want to laugh when I see you.

1367
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,240
Do I look that funny?

1368
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,360
Not funny.

1369
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,520
You look good.

1370
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,480
Seeing something beautiful makes me smile.

1371
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,280
I feel my heart

1372
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:36,840
beats really fast.

1373
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:37,240
Yeah.

1374
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,000
So can you really

1375
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:38,880
win a staring contest?

1376
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:39,960
It doesn’t really matter.

1377
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:40,960
That moment of eye contact—

1378
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,960
You've already won her over.

1379
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,120
I have a suggestion.

1380
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,840
Minghao, I want to see you and her have a staring contest.

1381
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:49,960
Let's see who laughs first.

1382
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:50,320
This—

1383
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,400
This is going to be great.

1384
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:52,320
Wait a second.

1385
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:53,320
Pinky swear first.

1386
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,360
No catching feelings.

1387
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:01,160
You're a family man.

1388
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:01,560
Don't mess around.

1389
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,560
So, you can't.

1390
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,640
I think doing things with you

1391
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:09,520
that you're not good at

1392
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,320
is really interesting.

1393
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,160
Yeah, if I'm really good at it

1394
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,080
and you're not,

1395
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:13,880
Right.

1396
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,040
It's not as fun to play.

1397
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:15,560
Yeah.

1398
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,160
When you're not good at something,

1399
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:17,840
I find it

1400
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,080
really funny.

1401
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:22,720
Because I think

1402
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:23,880
in life, things that

1403
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,080
genuinely make me laugh

1404
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,000
and feel happy

1405
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:27,920
aren't that many.

1406
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,240
Is your life that tough?

1407
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:32,400
It's not tough.

1408
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:32,960
I just think

1409
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,200
my threshold for happiness is high.

1410
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:35,720
Yeah, it's pretty high.

1411
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,080
Right, I like being with

1412
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,640
people who can make me laugh.

1413
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,400
Friends too,

1414
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,160
all of them.

1415
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:47,960
Thai food is delicious.

1416
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:50,040
Just looking at it makes me hungry.

1417
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,200
Let's eat.

1418
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,200
Do you want some shrimp?

1419
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,320
Will you peel it?

1420
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,000
If you don't mind, I'll peel it for you.

1421
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,480
Why would I mind?

1422
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:03,560
This back and forth—

1423
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:04,720
Did you see that?

1424
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:06,720
Someone peels for you and you still mind?

1425
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,320
That person is really ungrateful.

1426
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,440
This is just awesome.

1427
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:13,680
So satisfying, I love watching this.

1428
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,080
I'll peel this and give it to you.

1429
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:19,680
Thank you.

1430
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,080
Thanks.

1431
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:31,760
Careful not to drop it in.

1432
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:34,760
I have another question.

1433
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:36,680
Choose one.

1434
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,720
Do I look better with or without glasses?

1435
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,400
You want the truth?

1436
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,080
Yes, the truth.

1437
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,520
Honestly, both look good.

1438
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,960
But if I had to pick glasses for you,

1439
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:47,880
I probably wouldn't choose

1440
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:49,240
round frames.

1441
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:51,760
What then, rimless?

1442
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:52,840
No.

1443
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,160
Square ones.

1444
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:55,800
Of course Xiao Fang should wear square glasses.

1445
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,320
Xiao Fang is wearing blue.

1446
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:03,000
Doesn't everyone call me Dr. Fang?

1447
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,800
In the cabin,

1448
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,120
you were the first

1449
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,280
to call me Xiao Fang.

1450
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:09,880
Didn't you introduce yourself

1451
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,440
as Xiao Fang from the start?

1452
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:14,960
Xiao Fang.

1453
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:17,320
Xiao Fang.

1454
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:22,640
I feel like she's already acting cute.

1455
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:23,120
Right?

1456
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,760
Yeah.

1457
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,160
But it really is just my workplace.

1458
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:42,360
Even people younger than me call me Xiao Fang.

1459
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:44,680
At my workplace,

1460
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,280
everyone calls me Xiao Xu.

1461
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:47,160
I can't imagine it.

1462
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:47,880
I mentioned it last time.

1463
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,280
Said you wore a hat.

1464
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,000
And you were at the construction site.

1465
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,720
If you put on glasses too,

1466
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:53,720
it's even harder to picture.

1467
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,160
Back when I was in school,

1468
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,160
I would

1469
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,760
have classes like that.

1470
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,040
Where you had to wear a hat to the site.

1471
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:05,600
So when your parents named you,

1472
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,400
was there a special meaning?

1473
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,280
I explained it on the first day.

1474
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:11,360
I forgot.

1475
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,160
You don't remember?

1476
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:16,960
You'd better think again.

1477
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:19,440
Darn it.

1478
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:20,560
Did you really say it on the first day?

1479
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:21,560
On the beach.

1480
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,040
After the beach ATV ride.

1481
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,200
You wrapped yourself in that blanket.

1482
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,720
When it was really cold.

1483
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:36,440
Girls always remember.

1484
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:37,880
There's an ancient poem.

1485
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:40,160
"In spring, the river turns green as blue."

1486
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,960
Darn it, I dug myself a hole.

1487
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,000
That look in your eyes.

1488
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:49,760
I really forgot.

1489
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,640
So intense.

1490
01:00:58,640 --> 01:00:59,640
So intense.

1491
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:04,480
I remember now.

1492
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:05,480
A poem.

1493
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:07,320
That poem is called

1494
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:09,600
"Reminiscence of Jiangnan."

1495
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,160
"In spring, the river turns green as blue."

1496
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:16,640
I remember now.

1497
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:18,040
And both of them (my parents)

1498
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,200
also love the color blue.

1499
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:21,960
But the name "Ru Lan"

1500
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:22,760
really sounds beautiful.

1501
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:23,560
It's so romantic.

1502
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:27,440
What's wrong?

1503
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:28,760
What's wrong?

1504
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:34,080
Are you going to play that

1505
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:34,960
no-laughing game with me?

1506
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,120
I'm already playing.

1507
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:41,560
So sweet.

1508
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:57,840
I love watching this kind of push and pull.

1509
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:58,640
Push and pull.

1510
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:01,000
So much chemistry.

1511
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:01,560
Don’t you think

1512
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:02,240
after watching something like this,

1513
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,320
it feels so satisfying.

1514
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,160
Yeah.

1515
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:06,600
It’s like riding

1516
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:08,360
a roller coaster.

1517
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:09,720
It’s really enjoyable.

1518
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,360
Can you peel the shrimp for me?

1519
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,840
If you don’t mind, I’ll do it.

1520
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:14,400
Why would I mind?

1521
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:18,320
Are you playing that five-minute game again?

1522
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:19,520
I’m already playing.

1523
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,360
I’m not memorizing it on purpose,

1524
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,880
but it’s just stuck in my head.

1525
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:26,040
It’s just stuck in my head.

1526
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:27,800
I can’t get rid of it.

1527
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,800
These two are real pros.

1528
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:30,120
Last time,

1529
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:30,880
their date

1530
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:31,720
was still about

1531
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,080
testing each other.

1532
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:33,960
Polite.

1533
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:34,840
But this time,

1534
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:35,840
they’re not holding back.

1535
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:36,640
Yeah.

1536
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,880
Dr. Fang really changed things up this time.

1537
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,960
Compared to how he used to express himself,

1538
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,400
it’s totally different.

1539
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,000
Lan Lan is also different today.

1540
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,280
It’s the first time seeing her like this.

1541
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:47,320
And Dr. Fang,

1542
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:48,520
it’s also the first time seeing him like this.

1543
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:49,960
These two really have

1544
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,160
sparks flying between them.

1545
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,840
I think Lan Lan is really into

1546
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:55,520
Dr. Fang.

1547
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:56,520
Because you’ll notice Dr. Fang

1548
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:57,760
is great at guiding her.

1549
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,520
Lan Lan likes this kind of

1550
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,480
back-and-forth interaction.

1551
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:02,960
She finds it

1552
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:03,800
interesting.

1553
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:04,600
She wants to explore it.

1554
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:05,520
A clash of titans.

1555
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,640
Dr. Fang keeps saying

1556
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:09,120
last time it was your favorite flower,

1557
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,200
this time it’s mine.

1558
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,760
When giving the claw machine, he said

1559
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:12,720
this is a gift for you,

1560
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:13,960
and also for us.

1561
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:15,000
This claw machine

1562
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:15,800
is really nice.

1563
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,360
And his way is great

1564
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:19,640
because it gives Lan Lan a reason to get closer to him.

1565
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:21,400
There’s a basis for it.

1566
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:23,400
So I think with love,

1567
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:26,120
sometimes you shouldn’t forget to show yourself.

1568
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:26,920
Express yourself.

1569
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:28,120
I want to get to know you,

1570
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:29,840
but please get to know me too.

1571
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:30,440
Yeah.

1572
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:31,080
Got it.

1573
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:31,960
Alright, everyone,

1574
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:33,280
we’re about to see

1575
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,920
our last couple,

1576
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:35,840
Le Chen and Duo Duo’s

1577
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:36,480
date.

1578
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,200
Let’s

1579
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:37,880
look forward to it.

1580
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:38,960
Everyone, let’s watch.

1581
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:52,680
Le Chen.

1582
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:58,360
Duo Duo looks great.

1583
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:03,840
Le Chen looks great in a white shirt too.

1584
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:05,640
Hello.

1585
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:07,760
Hi.

1586
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:14,480
Welcome to my turf.

1587
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:16,440
This is awesome.

1588
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:17,560
So awesome.

1589
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,720
The diving center.

1590
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,040
It’s great.

1591
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:26,880
Today I fulfilled

1592
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:29,680
a little dream I had before coming.

1593
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:30,240
Yeah.

1594
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:32,560
Don’t they both love scuba diving?

1595
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:34,280
Let’s go change first.

1596
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:35,520
Okay, let’s go.

1597
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:36,360
Here.

1598
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:42,040
Hello.

1599
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:49,920
Duoduo has that kind of healthy beauty.

1600
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,040
She’s a girl full of energy.

1601
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,880
Let’s wait for the coach.

1602
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,320
Okay, let’s sit for a bit.

1603
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:58,800
Sit down.

1604
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,160
How long has it been since you last dived?

1605
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,240
It’s been about half a year.

1606
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:03,960
Then you need to get used to it again.

1607
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:05,760
We’ll start from scratch.

1608
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:06,760
Alright, starting over.

1609
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:07,640
Yes, that pool.

1610
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:08,560
We’ll go scuba diving soon.

1611
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:08,640
We’ll go scuba diving soon.

1612
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:10,880
You haven’t tried scuba diving before, right?

1613
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,960
There’s surfing next to it, I think.

1614
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,240
Yeah, we can go surfing later.

1615
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:15,680
If you still have energy,

1616
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:16,160
you can go swimming.

1617
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:17,120
But you don’t know how, do you?

1618
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:19,680
I learn quickly.

1619
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:21,440
Really?

1620
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:23,480
I pick things up fast.

1621
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:25,600
Put on the gear first.

1622
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:26,200
Okay.

1623
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:29,120
Alright, I’ll briefly explain the moves.

1624
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:30,560
When snorkeling on the surface,

1625
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:32,320
we need to use our hands

1626
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:34,560
to hold and steady our head.

1627
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:37,200
Use your hand to guide your direction.

1628
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:40,400
Is that okay?

1629
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,560
Can the girls try it once?

1630
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:50,160
Amazing!

1631
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,520
Your finning technique was excellent.

1632
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:03,560
The rhythm was great too.

1633
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:05,320
Thank you.

1634
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:13,400
Okay.

1635
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:14,400
Can the guys give it a try?

1636
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:16,280
Don’t be nervous.

1637
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:17,560
I did pretty well, actually.

1638
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:21,280
So cute.

1639
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:22,960
She’s really happy.

1640
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,200
Both of them can do it.

1641
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:46,920
Is it still okay?

1642
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:48,360
Is it still okay?

1643
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:49,640
It’s more than okay.

1644
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:50,800
Very impressive.

1645
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:53,680
Talent.

1646
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:58,480
Let’s do it this way.

1647
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,640
After we go down,

1648
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:01,960
let’s swim two laps, okay?

1649
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:02,960
Sure.

1650
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:12,600
I want to go out and play.

1651
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:15,400
The girls are amazing.

1652
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:19,120
I want to swim now.

1653
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:20,120
I really want to try this.

1654
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:56,200
It's kind of romantic.

1655
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:02,560
Sure.

1656
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:03,480
Are you still okay?

1657
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:04,320
I'm still good.

1658
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:07,760
I can do another round.

1659
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:10,680
That's fine too.

1660
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:11,440
I think it's still okay.

1661
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,720
I think it's a bit easier than before.

1662
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:15,800
Should we go through that opening?

1663
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:16,960
It's even deeper inside.

1664
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:18,360
Okay.

1665
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:20,800
So much fighting spirit.

1666
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:22,760
You're really determined.

1667
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:26,600
I'm fired up.

1668
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:28,760
I'm fired up.

1669
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:34,600
I can feel it.

1670
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:17,280
Now let's try scuba diving.

1671
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:18,080
Okay.

1672
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:21,640
Putting on the oxygen tank.

1673
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:40,960
Love.

1674
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:42,440
Nice.

1675
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:44,000
This is so fun.

1676
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:46,160
So much fun.

1677
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:47,640
Really fun.

1678
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:49,240
Fun.

1679
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:50,520
Are you still okay?

1680
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:51,200
I'm still good.

1681
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,040
This looks really fun.

1682
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:55,400
Are we surfing?

1683
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:57,680
It's huge.

1684
01:09:58,640 --> 01:09:59,720
This wave feels awesome.

1685
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:06,840
Let's warm up first, okay?

1686
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:09,280
We can do some simple ones.

1687
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:09,880
Wrists and ankles. (stretching)

1688
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:11,360
Loosen up.

1689
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:12,400
Okay.

1690
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:22,560
I'm already tired.

1691
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:22,600
I'm tired already.

1692
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,200
But Duoduo didn't seem to hear.

1693
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:27,760
Didn't hear.

1694
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:29,240
Okay.

1695
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:30,520
Alright.

1696
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:31,600
Then if you come over here,

1697
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:32,920
Let's pick a helmet first.

1698
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:47,800
Come on.

1699
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,440
Yeah, move slowly.

1700
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:52,200
Walk slowly.

1701
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:54,200
Stepped on it.

1702
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:54,760
Step on the board.

1703
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:56,720
No.

1704
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:57,880
Don't.

1705
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:59,000
Feels a bit scary.

1706
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:00,080
No way.

1707
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:02,720
You can do it.

1708
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:04,360
Don't.

1709
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:06,160
The board should lean against the wall.

1710
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,800
Step down with your foot.

1711
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:18,680
You got this.

1712
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:20,000
Go for it!

1713
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:25,200
Don't be nervous.

1714
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:27,720
Let me try.

1715
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:35,080
So hard.

1716
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:43,200
Yeah.

1717
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:44,400
Look straight ahead.

1718
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:44,760
Right.

1719
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,840
She learns so fast.

1720
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:47,880
She's really good.

1721
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:55,280
So impressive.

1722
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:10,360
Amazing.

1723
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:18,800
Duoduo has so much energy.

1724
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:19,720
Come on.

1725
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:22,280
These two.

1726
01:12:59,000 --> 01:12:59,560
Wiping out together

1727
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:09,080
Thank you

1728
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:14,640
Surfing is so much fun

1729
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:15,440
Yeah, this looks really fun

1730
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:16,120
Yeah, it really does

1731
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:18,720
He looks totally wiped out

1732
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,120
He kept wiping out with me

1733
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:43,400
Are you out of energy?

1734
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:46,400
I got knocked silly by the waves

1735
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:48,800
Take a break, you look exhausted

1736
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:52,280
No regrets, right?

1737
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:53,480
None, thanks

1738
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:00,560
You look really tired

1739
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:01,760
Want to eat?

1740
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:03,920
Let’s go

1741
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:13,600
A day for building muscle

1742
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:22,720
Let’s eat something first

1743
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:24,320
You worked hard today

1744
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:25,920
It wasn’t hard for me

1745
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,400
You seem to have endless energy

1746
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:29,760
Really

1747
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:30,240
You know me

1748
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:31,240
My friend said something about me

1749
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:32,560
She said I’m like a dog breed

1750
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:33,520
A terrier

1751
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:35,440
A terrier

1752
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:36,760
And she said

1753
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:38,640
Terriers are known for

1754
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:39,240
Always having

1755
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:40,200
Lots of energy every day

1756
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:43,280
She’s right

1757
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:43,680
Yeah

1758
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:48,000
But today, surfing

1759
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:50,640
I just ran out of energy at the end

1760
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:51,840
Right?

1761
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,440
The waves made my head spin

1762
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:56,680
I feel like my brain is

1763
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:58,840
Seeing stars already

1764
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:00,880
First time it’s been this vivid

1765
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,160
Why do you like scuba diving?

1766
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:13,960
I think

1767
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,360
When you stay in the water

1768
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:18,400
It feels so quiet around you

1769
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:20,040
It relieves stress

1770
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:20,880
It’s like

1771
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:21,720
You feel like you’ve

1772
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:23,120
Left the world behind

1773
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:24,840
That feeling is really unique

1774
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:25,440
It truly is

1775
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:25,840
Definitely

1776
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:26,640
So I really recommend you

1777
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:27,640
Give it a try

1778
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:30,480
It’s really interesting

1779
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,600
Scuba diving lets me

1780
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:33,840
Forces me to slow down

1781
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:38,960
I’m actually a fast-paced person

1782
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,840
I also chase efficiency

1783
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:43,440
But lately, life

1784
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:45,920
Has forced me to slow down

1785
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:52,600
Since coming to the house, do you feel

1786
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:54,560
Any changes?

1787
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:55,280
Me?

1788
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:00,680
I think I’ve changed a lot

1789
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:02,960
At least in

1790
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:04,320
My desire to express myself

1791
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:07,480
I’ve made a lot of progress

1792
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:11,280
But actually, expressing yourself

1793
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:11,920
Is more about

1794
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:13,680
Having someone willing to listen

1795
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:18,120
Usually

1796
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:20,600
Many people don’t really

1797
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:21,520
Empathize with you

1798
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:23,320
Or they don’t really

1799
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:24,280
Care about you

1800
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,720
So after coming to the house

1801
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:28,800
There’s someone willing to listen

1802
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:30,800
And even someone who can empathize

1803
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:33,120
Yeah

1804
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:45,880
Actually, I'm really curious.

1805
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:48,200
Have you ever met

1806
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:50,240
guys like me before?

1807
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:52,480
What type are you?

1808
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,280
I don't know, what type do you think I am?

1809
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:56,440
How do you define yourself?

1810
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,600
I want to see how you see me.

1811
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:03,800
I'm just an ordinary person.

1812
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:07,200
I'm ordinary too. Everyone's ordinary.

1813
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:09,080
Yeah.

1814
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:09,960
I think

1815
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:10,880
when I'm with you,

1816
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,160
it's always pleasant.

1817
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:17,680
So, so far, being together

1818
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:18,600
feels easy and happy.

1819
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:18,840
Easy and happy.

1820
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:19,520
Very comfortable.

1821
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,120
That's good.

1822
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:23,600
I feel like you really have your own

1823
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,640
set hobbies.

1824
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:26,760
I think that's actually pretty important.

1825
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:28,040
I think having a hobby

1826
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:29,040
is really important.

1827
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:34,360
It helps you use your spare time

1828
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:35,720
in a meaningful way.

1829
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:37,880
And through that hobby,

1830
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:38,960
you grow again.

1831
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:42,480
So I'm really grateful too.

1832
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:43,000
I think

1833
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,280
everyone seems to give me

1834
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:46,480
positive feedback.

1835
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:47,840
This kind of positive feedback

1836
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,920
is something in my daily life

1837
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,560
that's hard to get.

1838
01:17:59,120 --> 01:17:59,720
What about you?

1839
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:03,200
Actually, I think I'm

1840
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:04,360
Actually, I think I'm

1841
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:04,920
someone who never gives up.

1842
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:05,800
I'm persistent.

1843
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:09,880
As long as I care about someone,

1844
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:10,400
Because

1845
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:12,400
when I was in middle school,

1846
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:13,960
there was a girl I was really close to.

1847
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:16,160
She deleted me after she went to college.

1848
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:17,880
But I

1849
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:19,760
tried to add her every year, even every month.

1850
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:20,680
I kept sending her friend requests.

1851
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:27,280
Well, maybe not every month.

1852
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:27,800
Why?

1853
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:28,520
Maybe every three or four months.

1854
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:29,280
Because I think

1855
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:30,360
What were you thinking?

1856
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:34,240
My thought was

1857
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:35,840
her sudden departure

1858
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:36,640
must have a reason.

1859
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,560
So I kept trying to add her from time to time.

1860
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:39,960
Until the second year,

1861
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:40,880
she suddenly accepted my friend request.

1862
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:41,800
So how are you two now?

1863
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:42,720
We're good now.

1864
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:44,600
If it were me, I definitely wouldn't do that.

1865
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:46,040
If it were me,

1866
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:46,920
she

1867
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:48,240
if she left, then

1868
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:52,960
that's her decision.

1869
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:54,960
So I respect her choice.

1870
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:55,680
Go with the flow.

1871
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:56,120
Go with the flow.

1872
01:18:57,720 --> 01:18:58,760
She can just reject me.

1873
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:04,440
She can directly reject me.

1874
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:06,280
If she accepts, I probably won't add her again.

1875
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:07,520
Yeah.

1876
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,240
As long as you don't reject me,

1877
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:10,760
I think you have your reasons.

1878
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:11,680
So I'll keep trying.

1879
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:13,840
Unless you clearly reject me.

1880
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:15,760
So their ways of handling relationships

1881
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:17,160
are actually quite different.

1882
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:20,320
I think

1883
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,280
I'm the one who's more afraid of missing out.

1884
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,080
So you try to keep

1885
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:27,960
the important people around you

1886
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:28,960
close.

1887
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:30,720
You want to hold on to them.

1888
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:32,760
Yeah, I think it's mutual.

1889
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:34,520
So the relationship is stronger.

1890
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:36,120
No regrets.

1891
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:38,920
What do you think?

1892
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:41,360
I rarely try to

1893
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,160
hold on to friends on purpose.

1894
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:45,240
Because I think

1895
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:45,880
maybe

1896
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,040
at every stage

1897
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:48,960
you meet new friends.

1898
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:50,840
Yeah, of course.

1899
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:52,320
Because you're changing.

1900
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,120
The atmosphere feels a bit off.

1901
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:06,400
Tastes good.

1902
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:08,880
But I’ll definitely have a late-night snack when I get back.

1903
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:10,760
Alright, let’s talk more back at the cabin.

1904
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:12,000
Okay.

1905
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:12,640
Let’s leave it at that for now.

1906
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:13,400
Alright.

1907
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:16,080
Thank you.

1908
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:26,560
Seatbelt.

1909
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:27,120
Okay.

1910
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:37,400
Do you like Hangzhou?

1911
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:40,720
Actually, I’ve stayed in Hangzhou

1912
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:42,280
for quite a long time.

1913
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,480
I think it really is

1914
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:46,080
a comfortable city.

1915
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:46,840
And I feel like

1916
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:48,520
in my whole life

1917
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:49,840
I haven’t really left Zhejiang.

1918
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:52,080
Right?

1919
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,040
Like,

1920
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:55,360
I went to college here in the province.

1921
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:56,080
My family’s also here.

1922
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:56,600
My family’s also here.

1923
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:57,880
So it’s like my whole life

1924
01:20:57,880 --> 01:20:58,480
has never really left Zhejiang.

1925
01:20:58,480 --> 01:20:59,480
I’ve never really left Zhejiang.

1926
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:01,600
Because it feels like

1927
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:03,280
I’ve always been here,

1928
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,200
just going in circles.

1929
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:07,120
Like a spinning top.

1930
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:13,640
Is someone pushing you from behind?

1931
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,240
It’s gotten to that point.

1932
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:16,840
It’s already

1933
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:17,720
pushing you forward.

1934
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:22,080
Are you okay with that?

1935
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,120
Have you ever

1936
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:30,880
been in that kind of role before?

1937
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:35,120
If I look at it from a third-person perspective,

1938
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:35,920
I think I have.

1939
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:37,120
I think I have.

1940
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:39,280
And I think I’ve been like that in every relationship.

1941
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:42,800
I have.

1942
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:52,520
Would you be willing to hold the whip for a lifetime?

1943
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:55,880
I think maybe I don’t even

1944
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:57,560
feel like I’m holding a whip.

1945
01:21:57,560 --> 01:21:59,240
Like when I socialize, people think

1946
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:00,360
Duoduo, you don’t have to entertain everyone.

1947
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:02,920
That’s true.

1948
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:04,320
They both have different traits.

1949
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:05,640
I’m not deliberately trying to amuse you.

1950
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:07,000
Because I’m genuinely happy myself.

1951
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:07,400
I also hope

1952
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:07,760
I can always

1953
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:09,720
stay in this state.

1954
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:15,800
What if the other person still doesn’t change?

1955
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:17,160
What if they still don’t change?

1956
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:18,520
If they don’t change, then so be it.

1957
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:20,200
I’ll just look for

1958
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:21,440
common ground in the differences.

1959
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,720
Find common ground in the differences.

1960
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:31,040
It seems like you’re always

1961
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:32,920
comforting yourself.

1962
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:35,000
I’m not comforting myself.

1963
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:37,200
I’ve said before

1964
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:39,160
I’m someone who can let go

1965
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:40,600
but also has trouble moving on.

1966
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:46,000
And I don’t think he’s

1967
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,840
never tried to change.

1968
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:50,000
It’s just that everyone changes at their own pace.

1969
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,080
I think he is changing.

1970
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:52,160
It’s just that the speed

1971
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:53,560
isn’t what I’d hoped for.

1972
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,320
I think adults only choose, not adjust.

1973
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:06,240
Adults only choose, not adjust.

1974
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:11,520
Disagree but respect.

1975
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,240
Do you still have time to adjust?

1976
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:15,920
Not good.

1977
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:16,960
This atmosphere

1978
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:18,160
is really not good.

1979
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,720
I think it’s sincere.

1980
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:21,640
It’s heartfelt.

1981
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:23,360
It’s impossible for me to just

1982
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:25,320
meet someone who’s a perfect match right away.

1983
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:25,880
Yeah.

1984
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:28,040
So you have to look for

1985
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:28,640
Or maybe

1986
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,440
he actually

1987
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:30,720
how likely is it you’ll find that?

1988
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:32,600
I’m not talking about a perfect match.

1989
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:34,320
I mean

1990
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:35,800
the gap between you

1991
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:37,400
is something you can

1992
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:43,240
resolve fairly easily.

1993
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:45,040
Or at least narrow the gap.

1994
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:46,160
Instead of

1995
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:47,560
right from the start

1996
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:50,680
having to do so many things

1997
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:52,080
and spend so much time

1998
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:53,920
just to make it work.

1999
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:55,520
It’s not a long march.

2000
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:07,160
Before you get into a relationship with someone,

2001
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:09,160
do you imagine a lot about your future together?

2002
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:10,120
Or do you think about it in general?

2003
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:10,680
I do.

2004
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:11,640
How far ahead do you think?

2005
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:13,240
From the moment I

2006
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:14,240
decide to be with someone,

2007
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:15,120
I’m already thinking about

2008
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:16,600
us getting married and having kids.

2009
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:18,520
Honestly,

2010
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:19,000
Really?

2011
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:20,600
It’s actually stressful.

2012
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:22,920
Isn’t that expectation

2013
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:24,240
a bit too high?

2014
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:26,040
But I think it shows sincerity.

2015
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:27,960
First of all,

2016
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:30,120
if I enter a relationship with this hope,

2017
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:31,000
when I start this relationship,

2018
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:31,600
then I must be

2019
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:32,960
holding myself to this standard.

2020
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:35,240
But I might not say it out loud.

2021
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:36,440
Like telling you to be a good husband first,

2022
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:37,600
or a good father.

2023
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:38,760
This attitude I’m talking about

2024
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:40,720
is a requirement for myself.

2025
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:43,520
I put myself in a position

2026
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:45,360
where I feel I’m compatible with you,

2027
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:47,280
and able to go far together.

2028
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,280
The two of them are completely

2029
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:52,880
different.

2030
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:55,840
I think if

2031
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:57,600
that day really comes

2032
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:58,920
when we have to part ways,

2033
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:00,480
I’ll accept it willingly.

2034
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:01,520
No.

2035
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:05,080
That’s your opinion.

2036
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:07,760
If you had to choose,

2037
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:10,160
would you only choose to walk part of the way with her,

2038
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:10,920
or with her,

2039
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:11,760
walk all the way?

2040
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:13,680
Duoduo.

2041
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:17,320
No, I wouldn’t think that way.

2042
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:18,160
Both of them are

2043
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:20,520
No, I don’t agree.

2044
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:21,440
Love debate.

2045
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:22,000
I just finished watching.

2046
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:23,760
But they’re both very genuine.

2047
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:25,280
By the way,

2048
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:27,720
No, I wouldn’t think that way.

2049
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:29,560
Because you’re going in with assumptions.

2050
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:30,440
I wouldn’t have

2051
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:31,480
those assumptions.

2052
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:33,400
I think no one knows

2053
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:35,320
how far the future will go.

2054
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:37,000
I’ve been thinking about something these past few days.

2055
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:37,480
That is,

2056
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:39,080
feeling moved,

2057
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:40,480
and being suitable

2058
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:43,560
are two different things.

2059
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:50,760
Right.

2060
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:56,440
I think this needs

2061
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:58,200
to be felt, just like when you’re scuba diving.

2062
01:25:58,840 --> 01:25:59,600
You have to feel it yourself.

2063
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:01,520
Yes.

2064
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:19,560
Alright.

2065
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:22,320
It’s a bit stressful.

2066
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:24,040
It sounds a bit tense.

2067
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:24,800
But this

2068
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:26,040
they really did discuss

2069
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:27,000
many unique

2070
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,200
and worthwhile topics.

2071
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:29,800
Because in previous

2072
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:30,880
conversations,

2073
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:31,800
too often

2074
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:34,400
it felt a bit off.

2075
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:35,280
It always felt

2076
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:36,120
a bit awkward.

2077
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:37,280
But I never figured out

2078
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:38,560
why it was awkward.

2079
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:40,600
I think my thoughts and

2080
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:41,680
Le Chen’s thoughts

2081
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:42,800
are quite similar.

2082
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:43,640
It’s not that

2083
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:44,320
you’ll definitely find

2084
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:45,240
a perfect

2085
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:46,080
match.

2086
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:47,360
But I think you can

2087
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:48,600
find someone generally

2088
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:49,640
suitable.

2089
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:50,680
The small details

2090
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:52,440
can be worked out

2091
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:54,160
between two people.

2092
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:55,640
I wouldn’t want to change the other person.

2093
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:57,680
And I don’t want them to change me a lot either.

2094
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:00,360
Of course, I used to think

2095
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:01,400
I wanted to meet the so-called

2096
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:03,560
It seemed like there would be someone in this world

2097
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:03,840
who

2098
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:04,600
just clicks with you

2099
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:05,680
Yes, so perfect

2100
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:06,560
You’d feel

2101
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:08,520
like the other person matches

2102
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:10,160
everything you like

2103
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:13,040
But later you realize no one is

2104
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:14,200
truly perfect

2105
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:15,880
I have a friend

2106
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:18,560
who never exercised before

2107
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:20,440
Then he met

2108
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:21,080
his partner

2109
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:22,600
At first

2110
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:22,840
maybe push-ups

2111
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:23,560
maybe push-ups

2112
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:24,480
he couldn’t even do one

2113
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:25,960
Now he can do several

2114
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:27,800
I think he didn’t change just for his partner

2115
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:29,400
but he saw his partner was better that way

2116
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:30,520
and wanted to try

2117
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:32,360
You know what I mean?

2118
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:33,680
That kind of thing goes both ways

2119
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:34,640
It’s not like

2120
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:35,400
I get it

2121
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:36,520
I’m with you

2122
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:38,160
so I want to please you

2123
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:40,080
and become what you want me to be

2124
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:42,480
It feels more like two people growing together

2125
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:44,560
and realizing it’s better this way

2126
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:45,880
Whether it’s choosing or changing

2127
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:47,240
everyone has their own

2128
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:49,080
standard

2129
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:50,120
So the two of them

2130
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:51,520
are both on different

2131
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:52,920
personal standards

2132
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:53,560
while talking

2133
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:54,680
When many people hear about change

2134
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:55,960
they instinctively resist

2135
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:56,960
Why should I change?

2136
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:58,080
This is who I am

2137
01:27:58,080 --> 01:27:59,040
But people who change

2138
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:01,040
aren’t giving up themselves

2139
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:02,120
But if the change

2140
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:04,080
is relatively positive

2141
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:06,160
or something you can accept

2142
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:08,440
then why resist it?

2143
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:10,680
Growth itself is a kind of change

2144
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:13,200
But since our audience

2145
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:13,960
is mostly

2146
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:15,200
young people,

2147
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:15,840
I think from

2148
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:17,080
a practical perspective,

2149
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:18,200
choosing the right person

2150
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:20,000
is actually quite difficult.

2151
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,440
Especially for those between eighteen

2152
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:22,520
and twenty-five years old,

2153
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:23,640
which in psychology

2154
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:25,200
is called emerging adulthood.

2155
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:26,200
Young people at this stage

2156
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:27,000
have lives

2157
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,600
full of changes.

2158
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:29,400
They don’t know

2159
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:31,200
which city to work in,

2160
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:33,200
what career path to take,

2161
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:34,880
or what kind of person suits them.

2162
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:37,000
So for very young people,

2163
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:37,880
I think experiencing

2164
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:40,080
is more important than selecting.

2165
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:41,520
Only by

2166
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:42,680
growing through relationships

2167
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:44,120
can you learn

2168
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:45,720
how to live within them.

2169
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:47,720
You’ll know what suits you,

2170
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:48,880
and what doesn’t.

2171
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:49,880
Sometimes we

2172
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:51,080
not only understand ourselves better

2173
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:52,280
through relationships,

2174
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:53,600
but are also shaped

2175
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:55,320
by them.

2176
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:56,000
Some relationships

2177
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:56,760
have shaped

2178
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:57,600
how we now

2179
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,000
view love,

2180
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,160
and family,

2181
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,320
and all these things.

2182
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:02,200
So I think good

2183
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:02,880
relationship experiences

2184
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,040
are very important.

2185
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:05,000
Even bad ones

2186
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:08,200
teach you something different.

2187
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:10,320
It’s all part of love,

2188
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:11,240
it’s a process,

2189
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:12,680
just an experience.

2190
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:14,520
So for young people,

2191
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:15,520
I still encourage everyone

2192
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,400
to experience more,

2193
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:18,280
to love more.

2194
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:18,960
Just like we’ve all

2195
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:19,720
heard this saying:

2196
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:20,760
Is the process more important,

2197
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:22,200
or the result?

2198
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:23,240
My instinct is to think

2199
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:24,320
the result matters more,

2200
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:25,480
because I’m result-oriented.

2201
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:26,480
The result is important.

2202
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:27,160
But that day,

2203
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:27,520
I heard someone

2204
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:28,400
sharing their thoughts,

2205
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:29,320
and suddenly

2206
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:30,000
it became clear to me.

2207
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:30,760
He said it’s definitely

2208
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:31,800
the process that matters.

2209
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:33,800
Because the process determines the result.

2210
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:36,000
I personally think these two things

2211
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,000
actually go together.

2212
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:38,800
Like you just said,

2213
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:40,240
if you work hard now

2214
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:42,040
to create happiness,

2215
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:43,280
you’re actually building

2216
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:45,040
its long-term outcome.

2217
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:45,680
So two people,

2218
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:46,240
one day,

2219
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,280
whether it’s the first day together

2220
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:48,440
or after ten years,

2221
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:50,000
might say, “Let’s get married.”

2222
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,240
And the two of them

2223
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:52,000
agree.

2224
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,880
Only the process is real.

2225
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:56,600
The result is vague and uncertain.

2226
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:57,160
For me personally,

2227
01:29:57,160 --> 01:29:57,880
I think

2228
01:29:58,400 --> 01:29:59,920
we shouldn’t focus

2229
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:01,440
too much on the result.

2230
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:02,080
Yes.

2231
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:03,440
Focus on

2232
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:05,200
enjoying happiness in the moment,

2233
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:06,280
and actually,

2234
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:08,320
wherever you end up is where you’re meant to be.

2235
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:11,000
Great.

2236
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:11,760
Our

2237
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:12,720
first day of dates

2238
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:13,840
and second day of dates

2239
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,480
are all finished now.

2240
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:17,800
Each

2241
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:19,920
date was really meaningful.

2242
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:21,800
It’s not just about feeling moved.

2243
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:24,040
It’s also a meeting of minds.

2244
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:26,120
And right now,

2245
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:28,360
everyone needs lots of interaction

2246
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:30,320
to get to know each other.

2247
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:31,600
So let’s look forward to

2248
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:32,320
what happens next in the house

2249
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,000
and see

2250
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:33,880
what stories unfold.

2251
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:40,000
I want to chat with you.

2252
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,120
Sure.

2253
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:43,240
Lu Yuan.

2254
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:45,160
I want to talk with you.

2255
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:46,640
Well,

2256
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:48,640
based on my past experience,

2257
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:51,160
because before,

2258
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:52,520
I moved too fast.

2259
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:54,160
That led to

2260
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:55,560
the whole

2261
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:58,840
relationship becoming

2262
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:00,360
rushed and careless.

2263
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:02,720
Actually, I hope

2264
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,160
to get to know someone slowly.

2265
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:08,040
I’m just confused.

2266
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:08,440
You know?

2267
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:09,080
I get it.

2268
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:11,880
Darn it, I’ll go beat up Le Chen.

2269
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:13,640
That’s kind of cute.

2270
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:15,680
But I think saying this

2271
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:16,440
is a good thing.

2272
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:17,480
First of all,

2273
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:18,280
I understand.

2274
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:19,160
Just do what you need to do.

2275
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:20,760
Being happy is most important.

2276
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:21,520
And then,

2277
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:23,360
Yeah, I’m definitely not

2278
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:24,400
just talking without feeling the pain.

2279
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:26,520
I’m someone with back pain too.

2280
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:30,000
You have back pain too.

2281
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:30,680
I have back pain as well.

2282
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:31,840
We both have back pain.

2283
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:33,200
Yeah, I have back pain too.

2284
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:34,000
So,

2285
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:37,000
there’s really nothing we can do.

2286
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:37,400
It’s just

2287
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:38,800
maybe this is

2288
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:40,920
the hardship of love.

2289
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:45,400
I’m trying now

2290
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:47,600
to find joy in hardship.

2291
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:50,160
Find joy in hardship.

2292
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:51,920
You make yourself sound so heroic.

2293
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:55,600
There’s no way around it.

2294
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:56,360
See,

2295
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:57,800
there’s really no solution, right?

2296
01:31:58,320 --> 01:31:59,040
No solution at all.

2297
01:31:59,040 --> 01:31:59,480
Because

2298
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:01,480
the answer is with the other person.

2299
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:05,520
Xiao Jiao’s mindset is better now.

2300
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:06,920
He used to struggle on his own.

2301
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:08,240
Now he can even

2302
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:10,040
comfort and encourage others.

2303
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:13,720
I think

2304
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:14,720
you should cherish every moment

2305
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:16,080
you spend with him.

2306
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:17,400
Just be together.

2307
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:19,160
Instead of

2308
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:20,800
overthinking everything.

2309
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:32,160
I think we came back

2310
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:33,480
a bit too late.

2311
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:35,840
No, I see some cars haven’t returned yet.

2312
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:36,520
Really?

2313
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:43,040
There’s still a badminton racket here.

2314
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:50,680
Shall we play ball later?

2315
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:51,680
Later.

2316
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:53,840
If you're not tired, we can play.

2317
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:56,880
Playing ball at midnight.

2318
01:32:58,680 --> 01:32:59,880
Are you feeling better now?

2319
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:01,400
Much better.

2320
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:02,520
How about your neck?

2321
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:04,000
My neck's still not better.

2322
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,360
Is it the left or right side?

2323
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:06,240
Both sides.

2324
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:06,920
Both.

2325
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:09,120
He really cares about her.

2326
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:11,240
Are you tired?

2327
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:13,520
I am tired.

2328
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:15,360
But happiness cancels it out.

2329
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:17,160
All the tiredness.

2330
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:20,560
Is there a little extra happiness?

2331
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:21,920
Maybe even overflowing.

2332
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:25,800
They can't finish a sentence together.

2333
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:27,080
They can't finish a sentence together.

2334
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:30,640
Bro Herry, are you

2335
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:31,560
a slow-to-warm-up person?

2336
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:35,040
I match the other person's vibe.

2337
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:35,720
I become like them.

2338
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:37,520
You're like a mirror.

2339
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:40,960
We just follow along.

2340
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:51,400
That look from Xiao Jiao.

2341
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:53,520
Lan Lan.

2342
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:54,320
Hello.

2343
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:55,840
Hi.

2344
01:33:57,920 --> 01:33:58,720
Hello.

2345
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:08,440
Well...

2346
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:10,200
There should be more change.

2347
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:11,320
Change the subject.

2348
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:12,800
Hello.

2349
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:13,160
Hi.

2350
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:14,160
You're back.

2351
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:20,000
Did you just get back?

2352
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:21,240
We've been back for a while.

2353
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:22,160
We were eating over there.

2354
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:25,120
I thought we were the first ones back.

2355
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:26,800
Who else is back?

2356
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:38,560
Lan Lan.

2357
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:40,120
I made some soup.

2358
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:41,880
I want some.

2359
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:44,960
I'll put my stuff away first, then come down.

2360
01:34:58,560 --> 01:34:59,400
I feel awful.

2361
01:35:14,440 --> 01:35:16,040
I'll take them to have soup.

2362
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:16,760
Okay.

2363
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:19,560
Go.

2364
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:21,040
Where are you having soup?

2365
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:21,800
The kitchen.

2366
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:22,600
Kitchen.

2367
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:27,080
Does he really want to go over?

2368
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:28,640
No, his soul is already there.

2369
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:36,360
Do you want some soup?

2370
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:38,920
I made soup.

2371
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:42,480
We've all had some already.

2372
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:43,560
It's really good.

2373
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:44,240
Yeah.

2374
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:45,640
Is Chi Chi going?

2375
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:52,960
Sure, let's go.

2376
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:01,560
I'll come back and eat later.

2377
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:02,160
Okay.

2378
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:02,560
Come back and eat.

2379
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,120
You have soup first.

2380
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:04,480
I'll go have soup first.

2381
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:22,120
Quick, find an excuse.

2382
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:28,080
Someone invite me over for soup.

2383
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:29,520
Want some melon?

2384
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:30,800
Have some more melon.

2385
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:31,600
Eating melon.

2386
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:32,880
Melon time.

2387
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:34,400
The word "eating melon" is kind of...

2388
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:35,800
You know how to talk.

2389
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:37,480
You really know how to talk.

2390
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:41,480
Wang Jue is blushing now.

2391
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:57,600
Hello, everyone.

2392
01:36:58,080 --> 01:36:58,640
Hi.

2393
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:01,360
You're the last one back today.

2394
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:05,320
Chen, what's going on?

2395
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:07,520
The car wheels were speed-limited today.

2396
01:37:15,160 --> 01:37:16,280
I really want to sleep.

2397
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:26,400
No, what did you do today?

2398
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:29,360
What about them?

2399
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:30,840
What did you two do today?

2400
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:31,880
And them?

2401
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:33,120
Upstairs.

2402
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:33,760
Over there.

2403
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:35,560
They're over there.

2404
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:36,520
Having porridge.

2405
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:37,680
Having soup.

2406
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:42,080
Don't want to talk about it.

2407
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:48,760
Seems like everyone except Dr. Fang and Lan Lan

2408
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:50,760
is feeling down.

2409
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:05,160
Is it good?

2410
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:16,080
Feels like the atmosphere is off.

2411
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:17,920
It's painful to be stuck here.

2412
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:20,880
Feels like everyone has something on their mind.

2413
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:22,520
In everyone’s heart,

2414
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:24,000
there’s a sense of exhaustion.

2415
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:38,520
This is for you.

2416
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:40,800
What?

2417
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:41,760
Aren’t you the one who...

2418
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:45,720
Thank you.

2419
01:38:47,080 --> 01:38:48,120
That’s so thoughtful.

2420
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:52,400
I just happened to see it on the way.

2421
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:55,440
Stop saying it was on the way, bro.

2422
01:38:57,840 --> 01:38:58,840
How “on the way” was it, really?

2423
01:38:58,840 --> 01:38:59,720
Was it even the same route?

2424
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:09,160
I can’t just admit I went out of my way to buy it for you.

2425
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:10,800
I just remembered.

2426
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:19,120
That thing from yesterday.

2427
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:21,480
I forgot.

2428
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:22,600
I want that book.

2429
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:24,160
It’s up there.

2430
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:25,120
Here, take it.

2431
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:26,640
Thank you.

2432
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:43,640
Thanks.

2433
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:45,960
I’ll return it to you later.

2434
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:53,240
Go read the first chapter, it’s hilarious.

2435
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:56,160
Really? The “Chejing” part, right?

2436
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:00,840
I’m reading the foreword right now.

2437
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:02,480
You don’t need to read the foreword.

2438
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:03,560
Just read the “Chejing” section.

2439
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:28,600
This date,

2440
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:29,120
really was...

2441
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:31,480
really made my heart ache.

2442
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:32,880
Who’s actually happy right now?

2443
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:34,440
Lan Lan.

2444
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:36,880
Dr. Fang.

2445
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:38,000
So tonight,

2446
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,520
it’s not over yet.

2447
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:40,360
Everyone, let’s keep going.

2448
01:40:40,360 --> 01:40:41,440
Let’s keep watching.

2449
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:45,040
Let’s go.

2450
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:46,080
Good night.

2451
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:47,000
Good night.

2452
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:49,640
Finally, I can take off my makeup.

2453
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:51,240
I’ll take out my contacts first.

2454
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:53,200
You went out today,

2455
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:54,400
and wore contacts all day?

2456
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:55,280
Aren’t your eyes dry?

2457
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:56,880
Not at all.

2458
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:58,520
I was out exercising all day today,

2459
01:40:58,520 --> 01:40:59,880
and my eyes felt fine.

2460
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:00,360
Really?

2461
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:01,600
Then I’ll try it next time.

2462
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:02,080
I think

2463
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:03,120
if you’re out for a long time,

2464
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:04,360
choosing good contacts

2465
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:05,320
is pretty important.

2466
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:05,960
Yeah.

2467
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:19,320
Hi, this—

2468
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:20,920
is what I told you about.

2469
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:22,960
This is the gift she prepared, right?

2470
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:25,120
This color is really...

2471
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,200
I think it looks like your eye color.

2472
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,560
Panda?

2473
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:33,680
Panda.

2474
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:35,840
Thank you.

2475
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:41,440
They’re all brave.

2476
01:42:13,240 --> 01:42:14,160
Panda, guqin

2477
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:21,480
It’s so cozy here.

2478
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:23,240
This is my bed.

2479
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:24,680
Then I’ll come over.

2480
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:26,280
Should I sit here?

2481
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:27,080
Sure.

2482
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:30,000
Are you feeling any better?

2483
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:32,080
I don’t think so.

2484
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:33,920
I’m not very good at

2485
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:34,760
I’m not very good at

2486
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:37,720
handling friendships and signals.

2487
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:42,120
Right now I feel

2488
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:45,600
powerless.

2489
01:42:47,720 --> 01:42:49,480
And I tend to avoid conflict.

2490
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:53,320
And I can’t be like

2491
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:56,000
some really mature people.

2492
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,080
She might handle things gracefully.

2493
01:42:58,080 --> 01:42:59,240
Even if something’s up between us,

2494
01:42:59,240 --> 01:43:00,160
when everyone’s around,

2495
01:43:00,160 --> 01:43:01,200
I still show how I feel.

2496
01:43:01,200 --> 01:43:02,200
But I just can’t hide it.

2497
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:04,520
I wear my emotions on my face.

2498
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:07,000
Don’t be too hard on yourself.

2499
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:08,600
I think you’ve done really well.

2500
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:09,880
You did great today.

2501
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:16,400
Unlike me, I’m just a “deserter.”

2502
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:21,960
Is it because you’re not sure yet,

2503
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:23,880
or you don’t know how to handle it?

2504
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:28,880
That question really hit home.

2505
01:43:30,280 --> 01:43:31,200
I don’t know.

2506
01:43:31,200 --> 01:43:33,800
I’m just a mess right now.

2507
01:43:35,320 --> 01:43:37,160
After my date today,

2508
01:43:37,160 --> 01:43:38,400
I thought it was okay.

2509
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:40,560
It was pretty

2510
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:41,480
pretty good.

2511
01:43:41,480 --> 01:43:42,400
But after I got back,

2512
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:43,520
I was confused again.

2513
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:44,160
Us—

2514
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:45,960
Can we add more soup and cook it again?

2515
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:48,160
But it won’t be as flavorful.

2516
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:53,760
Why isn’t the water boiling?

2517
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:55,080
Mine’s already boiling.

2518
01:43:55,080 --> 01:43:56,480
Drink something lighter.

2519
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:57,720
Don’t drink too much salty stuff.

2520
01:43:57,840 --> 01:43:59,760
I barely added any seasoning.

2521
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:00,640
Is there any winter melon?

2522
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:01,160
Yes.

2523
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:01,840
Mushrooms are fine.

2524
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:02,400
Mushrooms.

2525
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:19,360
I’ll head back first.

2526
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:20,840
Okay.

2527
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:21,480
Okay.

2528
01:44:25,160 --> 01:44:26,080
But after I got back,

2529
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:27,200
I was confused again.

2530
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:27,840
Us—

2531
01:44:28,760 --> 01:44:30,080
Are you like this too?

2532
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:31,840
Me too.

2533
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:35,960
Not exactly confused,

2534
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:37,160
but I do feel a bit

2535
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:38,960
like today’s date

2536
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:40,000
was almost like we didn’t go out.

2537
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:43,520
They really connected.

2538
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:47,560
Don’t squish my cream puff.

2539
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,040
Sorry.

2540
01:44:52,280 --> 01:44:53,400
Total headache.

2541
01:44:54,840 --> 01:44:56,160
I think sometimes for girls,

2542
01:44:56,160 --> 01:44:58,080
this kind of friendship

2543
01:44:58,080 --> 01:44:58,600
means having someone to talk to.

2544
01:44:58,600 --> 01:45:00,080
Going through things together.

2545
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:01,320
Yeah, that’s great.

2546
01:45:01,320 --> 01:45:02,640
Understanding each other.

2547
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:04,160
Between close friends,

2548
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:05,480
talking things out

2549
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:07,400
is better than keeping it inside.

2550
01:45:23,480 --> 01:45:24,920
Saw Dr. Fang.

2551
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:38,080
What are you doing?

2552
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:39,120
Washing a vase.

2553
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:48,400
Do you like it?

2554
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:49,760
Huh?

2555
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:52,600
How could I not like it?

2556
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:54,720
Didn’t expect you got a badminton racket too.

2557
01:45:54,720 --> 01:45:55,880
I just sent one out.

2558
01:45:55,880 --> 01:45:56,760
And you already got one.

2559
01:45:57,240 --> 01:45:58,040
You don’t think

2560
01:45:58,040 --> 01:45:58,560
I sent it, do you?

2561
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:00,040
How did it end up back in the room?

2562
01:46:00,360 --> 01:46:02,000
No, the box is different.

2563
01:46:08,120 --> 01:46:09,960
These two are such trouble.

2564
01:46:22,120 --> 01:46:22,880
Here it comes.

2565
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:28,840
Vase.

2566
01:46:29,640 --> 01:46:30,680
Thanks.

2567
01:46:32,120 --> 01:46:32,760
It’s heavy.

2568
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:33,680
Be careful.

2569
01:46:34,240 --> 01:46:34,720
Thanks.

2570
01:46:35,200 --> 01:46:35,800
Good night.

2571
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:36,320
Good night.

2572
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:40,960
Actually, I think this spot is set.

2573
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:41,600
The one knocking

2574
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:43,160
should be Xiao Jiao.

2575
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:45,840
Seems like it’s always snacks for her.

2576
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:55,960
I feel a bit sorry.

2577
01:47:04,240 --> 01:47:05,000
Here you are.

2578
01:47:06,760 --> 01:47:07,640
Right on time.

2579
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:13,600
Sorry, this is for you.

2580
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:15,400
And this is

2581
01:47:15,400 --> 01:47:16,800
for muscle relaxation.

2582
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:18,840
You can use it tonight.

2583
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:21,120
I just think

2584
01:47:21,120 --> 01:47:23,200
if you haven't skied in a while,

2585
01:47:23,200 --> 01:47:25,200
your muscles might get sore.

2586
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:28,840
Yeah, I was sore all night.

2587
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:29,720
I don't know if today

2588
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:30,760
you'll feel a bit sore too.

2589
01:47:31,120 --> 01:47:32,000
I wrote something else on it.

2590
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:33,880
It's written on there.

2591
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:34,760
Thank you.

2592
01:47:34,760 --> 01:47:35,680
Okay, bye, good night.

2593
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:37,520
Good night.

2594
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:43,240
Giving gifts every day,

2595
01:47:43,240 --> 01:47:44,960
that's really impressive.

2596
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:54,760
Xiao Jiao really is

2597
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:56,600
someone who gives it their all.

2598
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:17,400
This is for you.

2599
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:18,960
You can read it tomorrow.

2600
01:48:20,920 --> 01:48:21,880
Got a letter.

2601
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:23,600
Now that you said that,

2602
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:25,160
I want to read it right now.

2603
01:48:25,480 --> 01:48:26,320
You can read it today if you want.

2604
01:48:26,320 --> 01:48:26,800
It's up to you.

2605
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:28,000
Read it whenever you like.

2606
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:33,480
Then I...

2607
01:48:33,480 --> 01:48:34,320
Now I don't know

2608
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:35,240
if I should read it today or tomorrow.

2609
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:36,720
Either is fine.

2610
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:39,400
I just don't want

2611
01:48:39,400 --> 01:48:41,480
since you went out today,

2612
01:48:41,480 --> 01:48:43,160
reading this to affect your mood.

2613
01:48:43,160 --> 01:48:44,920
So read it whenever you want.

2614
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:48,040
You can wait until

2615
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:49,960
after texting to read it, that's fine too.

2616
01:48:53,680 --> 01:48:56,720
There are still a lot of variables with these three.

2617
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:09,040
Very sincere.

2618
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:10,240
Really genuine.

2619
01:49:11,160 --> 01:49:11,840
There's a second page.

2620
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:12,640
There's another page.

2621
01:49:30,360 --> 01:49:32,200
Such a sincere letter.

2622
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:43,040
It's touching.

2623
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:56,760
His way of communicating

2624
01:49:56,760 --> 01:49:58,760
is a lot like Chi Chi's.

2625
01:49:58,760 --> 01:50:00,240
He lays everything out.

2626
01:50:00,240 --> 01:50:01,960
This is his third time explaining.

2627
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:04,240
His texts the past two days were explanations too.

2628
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:21,000
It's actually quite moving.

2629
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:22,360
It does touch you.

2630
01:50:22,360 --> 01:50:23,800
These days, getting

2631
01:50:23,800 --> 01:50:26,680
a handwritten letter like this is rare.

2632
01:51:41,480 --> 01:51:43,400
These past few days of dates

2633
01:51:43,400 --> 01:51:45,240
everyone's feeling down

2634
01:51:45,240 --> 01:51:46,400
this is what love is

2635
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:50,920
I think this round of dates

2636
01:51:50,920 --> 01:51:52,880
most importantly, we need

2637
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:53,320
to give everyone

2638
01:51:53,320 --> 01:51:54,720
to give everyone

2639
01:51:54,720 --> 01:51:56,560
some time to process

2640
01:51:57,920 --> 01:51:58,960
because honestly, everyone

2641
01:51:58,960 --> 01:51:59,920
in this little house

2642
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:00,800
during this period

2643
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:02,200
belongs to each other

2644
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:04,760
from strangers to friends

2645
01:52:04,760 --> 01:52:06,240
to feeling a spark

2646
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:07,800
to making some

2647
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:09,040
heartfelt connections

2648
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:10,680
everyone's emotions

2649
01:52:10,680 --> 01:52:13,480
are really intense

2650
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:16,400
so maybe everyone

2651
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:17,920
expresses themselves to each other

2652
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:19,520
the way we interact

2653
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:20,760
is very intense

2654
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:22,800
I think after this intensity

2655
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:23,920
maybe we all need

2656
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:25,000
a little time

2657
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:26,720
to let each other

2658
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:27,840
process everything

2659
01:52:29,080 --> 01:52:30,720
I'm afraid of missing out

2660
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:32,440
I thought things would get clearer

2661
01:52:32,440 --> 01:52:35,880
but it's actually more complicated

2662
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:38,760
it really is

2663
01:52:38,760 --> 01:52:41,200
thought it would be clearer

2664
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:42,520
Chi Chi was just about to be clear

2665
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:45,560
Zi Han seems to shine even more

2666
01:52:45,560 --> 01:52:46,720
yeah, that's true

2667
01:52:46,720 --> 01:52:47,680
we're halfway through the show

2668
01:52:47,680 --> 01:52:48,600
and we

2669
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:51,840
all kinds of emotions

2670
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:54,680
are intertwined in this episode

2671
01:52:54,680 --> 01:52:55,160
yeah

2672
01:52:55,800 --> 01:52:57,520
so let's look forward to

2673
01:52:57,520 --> 01:52:59,040
the upcoming love stories

2674
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:00,480
and see how they unfold

2675
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:01,320
that's all for today's show

2676
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:02,680
we're ending here

2677
01:53:04,280 --> 01:53:05,800
Jasmine blooming is the signal of love

2678
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:06,520
this show is sponsored by

2679
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:09,120

every Friday and Saturday at noon

2685
01:53:16,720 --> 01:53:17,720
watching love with you

2686
01:53:17,720 --> 01:53:19,880

let's fall in love together

2692
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:31,320
see you next week

2693
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:14,160
Heartbeat Apartment welcomes

2694
01:54:14,160 --> 01:54:16,320
its second open day.

2695
01:54:16,680 --> 01:54:19,120
There are also mysterious guests visiting.

2696
01:54:19,440 --> 01:54:20,240
Who?

2697
01:54:20,240 --> 01:54:21,160
I'm coming out.

2698
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:22,320
Really?

2699
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:23,040
You went?

2700
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:23,880
It's not just you.

2701
01:54:24,600 --> 01:54:25,400
You went too?

2702
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:26,360
They're here.

2703
01:54:26,520 --> 01:54:27,560
The friends and family are here.

2704
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:30,200
This is so much pressure.

2705
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:33,160
The male guests are all stunned.

2706
01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:34,200
That's too much.

2707
01:54:34,640 --> 01:54:35,360
He's nervous.

2708
01:54:35,480 --> 01:54:37,560
I think she's not very happy.

2709
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:38,840
Maybe there are some misunderstandings.

2710
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:41,000
This is a matter of ability.

2711
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:42,920
I'll choose tonight.

2712
01:54:43,720 --> 01:54:44,800
Do you think it's appropriate?

2713
01:54:46,920 --> 01:54:48,320
That's too intense.

2714
01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:50,040
I prefer someone with

2715
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:51,280
a more stable core.

2716
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:53,800
That's the problem.

2717
01:54:53,800 --> 01:54:54,880
There's no real focus.

2718
01:55:00,840 --> 01:55:01,360
I just came down.

2719
01:55:01,360 --> 01:55:02,240
What does it look like?

2720
01:55:02,240 --> 01:55:02,960
Very handsome.

2721
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:04,080
I'll come back earlier.

2722
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:06,800
Your cooking is really delicious.

2723
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:08,000
Thank you.

2724
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:09,200
Watch me for a bit.

2725
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:10,840
I'm a bit shy to watch.

2726
01:55:10,840 --> 01:55:12,400
When are my clothes not pretty?

2727
01:55:12,480 --> 01:55:13,920
They're pretty every day.

2728
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:16,720
Maybe to Germany or Switzerland

2729
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:17,520
for development.

2730
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:18,200
I'll work hard.

2731
01:55:18,840 --> 01:55:21,080
I feel like my fins are bigger.

2732
01:55:21,080 --> 01:55:21,680
First time hearing that.

2733
01:55:21,680 --> 01:55:23,440
Someone saying their fins are bigger.

2734
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:24,760
I just like this kind of messiness.

2735
01:55:24,760 --> 01:55:25,320
It's very much your

2736
01:55:25,320 --> 01:55:25,920
style.

2737
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:30,440
Pause.

2738
01:55:30,680 --> 01:55:31,640
I'm going to judge now.

2739
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:33,280
It's a bit heavy.

2740
01:55:33,320 --> 01:55:34,240
I think her answer to you

2741
01:55:34,240 --> 01:55:34,760
wasn't satisfying.

2742
01:55:34,760 --> 01:55:35,920
Do you feel uncomfortable?

2743
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:37,440
Even I feel uncomfortable with this atmosphere.

2744
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:39,080
Isn't this a bit too soon?

2745
01:55:39,080 --> 01:55:41,000
That's right.

2746
01:55:41,320 --> 01:55:42,120
The conversation in the car

2747
01:55:42,120 --> 01:55:43,320
Why is it always so awkward?

2748
01:55:43,320 --> 01:55:44,840
The atmosphere is a bit subtle.

2749
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:45,960
Help.

2750
01:55:46,240 --> 01:55:47,400
Today's icebreaker game

2751
01:55:47,400 --> 01:55:49,200
is the "Guess the Noun Challenge."

2752
01:55:49,400 --> 01:55:50,880
What exactly is this?

2753
01:55:51,640 --> 01:55:52,160
Yes.

2754
01:55:52,840 --> 01:55:53,360
Yes.

2755
01:55:54,720 --> 01:55:55,760
So your punishment is

2756
01:55:56,640 --> 01:55:57,160
Okay.

2757
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:00,080
Can I run away?
