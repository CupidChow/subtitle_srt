1
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,640
The key for snacks was taken.

2
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:49,880
Hurry up and go.

3
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,760
I really want to know who it was.

4
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,720
Turns out you took it.

5
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,200
Yuxing

6
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,160
Whenever I have free time,

7
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:02,680
Whenever there's a break,

8
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,920
I just want to be with you.

9
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,560
These two are good to go.

10
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,680
Should we stamp it?

11
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,760
Stamp it.

12
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,000
So, do you have any confusion lately?

13
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,040
That confusion comes from you.

14
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,280
How can I tell you?

15
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,840
She said it.

16
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,520
She said it.

17
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,280
She's so brave.

18
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,320
Heartbeat Apartment welcomes

19
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,480
its second open day.

20
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,280
And mysterious guests are visiting.

21
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,720
Is it the moms?

22
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,960
The friends and family are here.

23
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,000
We're about to meet.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,960
You guys rest, I'll go call them.

25
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,520
No need to be so formal.

26
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,960
Teacher Zihan, what are you up to now?

27
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,320
So what should I do?

28
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,000
Then let's each

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,400
bring our delicious dishes downstairs.

30
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,720
Take a deep breath.

31
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,200
What's wrong?

32
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,640
That's so scary.

33
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,320
That's so scary.

34
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,160
Where to sit is the next problem.

35
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,160
Even Ruilong is confused.

36
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,520
Let's see what to do.

37
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,200
This is a rare chance.

38
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:10,800
Quick!

39
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,920
We can sit now.

40
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,720
We can sit now, go!

41
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,040
Look.

42
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,440
They're here.

43
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,960
They're here.

44
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,120
They're rushing over.

45
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,520
No chance at all.

46
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,040
Now's not the time to be polite.

47
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,480
Now's not the time to be polite.

48
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:18,920
Xiao Fang

49
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,400
is a sharp "scalpel."

50
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,720
Look, Yuxing is making his intentions clear.

51
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,240
Darn it.

52
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:26,640
Darn it.

53
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,240
Heartbroken.

54
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,000
Changed seats for nothing.

55
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,240
Lechen went over.

56
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,200
Look.

57
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,360
Ruilong didn't sit next to Wang Jue.

58
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,360
And not next to Duoduo either.

59
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,280
This seat is so obvious.

60
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,680
Everyone's pretty much finished eating.

61
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,720
So today,

62
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,000
what are we doing?

63
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,320
Here we go.

64
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,200
Tonight's dinner

65
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,680
is just officially starting.

66
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,640
Guys,

67
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,000
that card—

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,520
the questions written by the friends and family.

69
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,320
Here come the questions.

70
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,000
Guys,

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,440
the questions are coming.

72
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,560
So scary.

73
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,600
Terrifying.

74
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,360
Pretty tough.

75
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,160
Okay, today we have

76
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,760
a really cute little segment.

77
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,720
This little segment

78
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,120
is before we

79
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,440
meet everyone tonight.

80
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,920
Our friends and family

81
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,120
prepared some really cute little questions.

82
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,240
Cute little questions.

83
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,560
So cute.

84
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,360
You keep hyping it up.

85
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,040
Cute little questions.

86
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,480
Because these questions

87
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,680
are actually pretty spicy, right?

88
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,240
Some questions are a bit nerve-wracking.

89
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,040
Looking forward to it.

90
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,040
These questions

91
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,160
are all from the girls' families.

92
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,960
Family and friends.

93
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,560
These cards to draw

94
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,240
are only for the guys to pick.

95
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,160
Looking forward to these questions.

96
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,480
So do we go in order,

97
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,600
or does whoever's brave go first?

98
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,000
Whoever's brave goes first.

99
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,120
I'll go.

100
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,040
I'll go.

101
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,040
I'll go.

102
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,040
Zihan is the "warrior" today.

103
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,680
Going all the way.

104
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,480
Alright.

105
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,080
Brother Liu.

106
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,680
Alright, let's go.

107
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,840
I think he's definitely a man of action.

108
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,360
Yeah.

109
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:35,920
Nice.

110
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,560
This is a big plus.

111
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,240
This is a big plus.

112
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,320
A generous guy.

113
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,120
Pretty proactive.

114
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:39,880
That's right.

115
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,040
Let's go.

116
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,200
Here we go.

117
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,600
The brave get to enjoy the world first.

118
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,800
When guys interact with girls,

119
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,200
what do you think you can offer them?

120
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,520
Please name three things.

121
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,800
That's really tough.

122
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,600
Let's see how he answers.

123
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,120
This really tests self-awareness.

124
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,160
And confidence.

125
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,280
It's pretty hard to answer.

126
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,760
That's easy.

127
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,120
Easy.

128
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,080
That's easy.

129
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,880
That's easy.

130
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,560
You guys are impressive.

131
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
There's even harder ones.

132
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,320
I think my top priority is

133
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,480
a sense of security.

134
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,320
Yeah.

135
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,800
Security can mean a lot of things.

136
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,640
Like being loyal.

137
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,440
That's what I mean.

138
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:43,800
Right.

139
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,320
Isn't that what girls want most?

140
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,400
I'm pretty loyal.

141
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,600
The second thing, I think,

142
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,560
is emotional value.

143
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,160
But sometimes, for me,

144
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,720
I need to understand first

145
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,840
what matters to others.

146
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,040
Then I can offer support in those areas.

147
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,720
And the third thing

148
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,840
is my hobbies.

149
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,360
Because my hobbies are pretty

150
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,800
diverse.

151
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:07,640
Yeah.

152
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,320
I especially like outdoor activities.

153
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,640
That answer is already

154
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,680
really good.

155
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,560
Awesome.

156
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,080
Chichi is laughing so happily.

157
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,120
Let me ask next,

158
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,720
this little card,

159
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,560
who from the friends and family group wrote it?

160
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,000
Can I take a look?

161
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,760
That's spot on.

162
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,640
Just pick one directly.

163
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,640
One asked well.

164
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,360
One picked well.

165
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,560
One answered well.

166
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,480
It's fate.

167
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:33,960
Mom.

168
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:34,720
Okay.

169
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,160
Look at his expression.

170
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,280
Look at Zihan's expression.

171
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,760
That's just perfect.

172
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:47,800
Really?

173
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,400
It's just the two of them, right?

174
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,120
Mom, are you satisfied with that answer?

175
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,680
Are you happy with it?

176
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,040
Getting nervous.

177
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,640
Please have a seat.

178
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,640
I'm fine standing.

179
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,160
You sit too.

180
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,880
Go ahead.

181
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,240
These little details

182
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:03,920
Standing up.

183
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,440
Standing and listening, I'm telling you,

184
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,600
Parents are really moved by this.

185
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,680
Especially the details.

186
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,640
Sincerity.

187
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,320
Mom must be super satisfied.

188
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:18,960
I think

189
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,280
when a guy and a girl are together,

190
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,520
in their relationship,

191
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,960
what can the guy give the girl?

192
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,280
First,

193
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,400
it shows the guy's abilities.

194
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,320
What he can offer her.

195
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,440
It's a matter of capability.

196
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,000
Ability.

197
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,320
Second,

198
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,160
he knows what the other person needs.

199
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,880
Does he care about the girl?

200
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,640
If he cares,

201
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,960
he'll know what she needs.

202
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,040
That's insight.

203
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,680
Zihan explained it well.

204
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,160
Actually, most girls

205
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,400
really need a sense of security.

206
00:07:59,440 --> 00:07:59,960
Sense of security

207
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,280
It includes loyalty in love

208
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,200
And material conditions

209
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,280
That's also a kind of security

210
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:04,760
Yes

211
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,520
Right?

212
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,440
Mom is so eloquent

213
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,640
I'm impressed

214
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,880
That's a mother's wisdom

215
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,640
I think mom

216
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,920
should be in the observation room

217
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,200
Really

218
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,440
He even ranked them

219
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,640
First is a sense of security

220
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,120
Second is emotional value

221
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,200
It's about bringing happiness to the other person

222
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,680
Right?

223
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,400
And third

224
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,200
is what he mentioned

225
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,680
Based on his own interests

226
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,040
to guide the other person

227
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,760
into his world

228
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,560
Yes

229
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,840
Mom's interpretation

230
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,280
This answer is perfect

231
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,960
I think he explained it very well

232
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,320
Zihan's answer was great

233
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,800
Zihan scored big today

234
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,440
Yes

235
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,640
Today, Zihan

236
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,600
kept moving forward

237
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,480
Chichi kept smiling happily

238
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,240
Yes

239
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,120
I think most girls

240
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,640
like boys like this

241
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,120
Mom is amazing, so sharp-eyed

242
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,200
Thank you, Hanqing's mom

243
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,000
Thank you, Hanqing's mom

244
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,240
Yuxing, pay more attention

245
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,200
Actually, Yuxing needs this kind of push too

246
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,640
Yes

247
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,320
He needs a sense of urgency

248
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:10,680
Right

249
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,400
Otherwise, he might really miss out

250
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,240
That's good

251
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,200
He did perfectly today

252
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,760
So outstanding

253
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,960
You can sit down now

254
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,040
Thank you, Teacher Haitao

255
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,880
Don't

256
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,160
Feels like a proud moment

257
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,120
Next person

258
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,480
I'll go

259
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,480
Teacher Fang

260
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,160
After spending so much time together

261
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,920
What's your impression of my daughter?

262
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,120
Describe her in three words

263
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,160
Who should I describe?

264
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,040
Describe Lanlan

265
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,920
So it's not the daughter?

266
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:52,880
Yes

267
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,360
Then how would he know who it is?

268
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,320
I think this

269
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,080
doesn't have to mean the daughter

270
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,800
It could also be

271
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:06,800
the younger sister

272
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,040
Younger sister

273
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:09,840
Younger sister

274
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,720
Knows how to fix things

275
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,120
This is really testing me

276
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,360
Younger sister

277
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,040
Even the older sister is laughing

278
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,680
Yes, that's it

279
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,240
Three words

280
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,880
Gentle

281
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,760
Sunny

282
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,760
And there's one more word

283
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,480
What is it?

284
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,640
Take your time to think

285
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,160
Healing

286
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,640
Healing

287
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,280
Healing

288
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,320
Why these three words?

289
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,080
First of all

290
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,840
Gentle people really attract me

291
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,360
I see gentleness in her

292
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,280
Sunny is the feeling she gives

293
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,040
She is

294
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,040
a very positive and cheerful person

295
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,160
As for healing

296
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,680
Her smile is truly healing

297
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,320
He's awesome

298
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,160
Healing is even better

299
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,920
I think it's even better than

300
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,120
praising someone's looks

301
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,000
It's more powerful

302
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,120
That's a great compliment

303
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,080
Jiao is thinking, "I must answer the next question well"

304
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,400
"Help!"

305
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,360
Take a seat

306
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,480
Let me ask who wrote this card

307
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,960
Getting nervous right away

308
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,720
For a question like this

309
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,440
Mom, do you want someone here

310
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,240
another guy to answer

311
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,240
Who do you want to answer?

312
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,480
The one far on the side

313
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,480
The one far on the side

314
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,320
He stands up right away

315
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,440
Look again to confirm, right?

316
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:21,880
Okay

317
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,040
Please use three words to describe

318
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,040
So nervous

319
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,720
I think it's stable

320
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,800
And then

321
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,400
Wise

322
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,280
And then

323
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,160
A pessimistic optimist

324
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,200
Why these three words?

325
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,000
Stable is actually

326
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,840
about the inner core

327
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,720
I think it's quite stable

328
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,000
Very strong learning ability

329
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,760
The third one actually

330
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,840
is similar to my own experiences

331
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,960
Maybe has also gone through

332
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,720
some tough times

333
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,720
but has always

334
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,960
lived positively and optimistically

335
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,720
And is also very

336
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,280
self-loving

337
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,320
Self-love is important

338
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,440
Still able to love life

339
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,200
Even when facing problems

340
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,200
still faces them with optimism

341
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,640
Thank you

342
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,000
I think these three words

343
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,320
show a kind of

344
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,000
deep understanding of the other's inner world

345
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,720
You can only say them if you know well

346
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,000
It means the two understand each other

347
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,520
and have a deep connection

348
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,520
That's why they can say it

349
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:49,960
Okay

350
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,200
Mom, what do you think of the guys' answers just now?

351
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,040
How do you feel about them?

352
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,320
It's obvious

353
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,600
The first one who answered

354
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,720
definitely wasn't talking about my daughter

355
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,920
Those three words aren't my daughter

356
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,680
But the other one, I totally agree

357
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,920
Mom is very satisfied

358
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,520
At least he understands Yuanyuan

359
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,840
In my opinion

360
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,640
I just want my daughter to be happy

361
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,680
As for whether she's moved

362
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,560
I'm not sure

363
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,400
As long as she's happy here

364
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,320
that's enough

365
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,520
Thank you both

366
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,920
Okay, next person.

367
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,520
Who else wants to try?

368
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,760
I'll pick.

369
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,360
Just go in order.

370
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,440
Alright.

371
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,640
Jiao.

372
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,120
Thank you.

373
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,960
What will you get?

374
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,440
What a coincidence.

375
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,440
I feel like this question...

376
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,040
If you end up together,

377
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,080
and with the female guest

378
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,360
in a long-distance relationship,

379
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,080
if

380
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,680
you suddenly face some difficulties,

381
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,400
for example,

382
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,280
illness or work issues,

383
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,520
what would you actually do

384
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,360
to support her?

385
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,160
That's tough.

386
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,920
I wrote this.

387
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,400
Yifan's best friend wrote it.

388
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,560
This is not an easy question.

389
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,520
First, I think not being long-distance.

390
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:30,880
Then,

391
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,720
First, not long-distance.

392
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,720
He thinks long-distance isn't an option.

393
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,720
No need to worry.

394
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,240
You made it very clear.

395
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,240
Everyone's being straightforward.

396
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,880
If it really is long-distance,

397
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,840
I would first take action to

398
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,000
make her feel less distant.

399
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,160
For example, maybe

400
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,120
it's just a short period apart.

401
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,000
Then I'd prepare in advance

402
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,120
by showing more care.

403
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,560
Also, I'd

404
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,280
offer some

405
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,400
ways for us to connect

406
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,560
while apart.

407
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,840
So she feels that being apart

408
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,800
isn't really

409
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,760
so

410
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,440
bad.

411
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,200
Yeah.

412
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,680
Awesome.

413
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,400
Fang is thinking.

414
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,360
Right.

415
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,600
Not bad.

416
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,720
Jiao did well.

417
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:17,840
He raised his hand.

418
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,000
He raised his hand.

419
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,080
He wants to answer too.

420
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,320
He wants to answer voluntarily.

421
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,720
Are those two in a long-distance relationship?

422
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,080
Fang and Lanlan are long-distance.

423
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,160
He wants to show his attitude.

424
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,040
He's bold, really bold.

425
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,160
I'd like to answer this question.

426
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,440
I'd like to answer this question.

427
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,800
He wants to answer too.

428
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,920
Let's hear his answer.

429
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,760
Go ahead.

430
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,920
About long-distance relationships,

431
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,080
actually, if

432
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,440
I'm willing to start

433
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,000
or try a long-distance relationship,

434
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,920
I must really love her.

435
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,440
I must really love her.

436
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,040
I'm willing to start

437
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,600
or try a long-distance relationship,

438
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,560
I must really love her.

439
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:07,720
I must really love her.

440
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,400
Very direct.

441
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,080
Wang Jue is loving this.

442
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,120
And if in a long-distance relationship

443
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,160
some problems come up,

444
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,840
like getting sick,

445
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,480
I would definitely

446
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,000
go to her side without hesitation.

447
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,720
And I think everyone sees distance differently.

448
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,200
Everyone has their own perspective.

449
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,640
For me,

450
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,120
if I want to

451
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,440
be with her,

452
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,880
I can just drive over

453
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,720
and be there in one or two hours.

454
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,800
I don't think that's really long-distance.

455
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,920
True, two hours

456
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,560
isn't that far.

457
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,680
If I

458
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,960
can't handle a long-distance relationship,

459
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,880
then it just means I don't love her enough.

460
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,560
This...

461
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,640
If I

462
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,440
can't handle a long-distance relationship,

463
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,360
then it just means I don't love her enough.

464
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,120
Time to gossip.

465
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,920
Well said.

466
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,160
It was acknowledged.

467
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:30,680
That's fine.

468
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,240
You've already said so much.

469
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,960
Does anyone want to add anything?

470
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,960
Anyone else want to add?

471
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,920
What do the girls think?

472
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,720
How is this answer?

473
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,800
If it were me at that moment,

474
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,960
if I were Lanlan,

475
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,880
I would have already

476
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,520
been spinning around for him.

477
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,280
I think it's about the moment.

478
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,960
You gave it to me so directly.

479
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,760
I would feel I was chosen with certainty.

480
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,480
and with enough affection.

481
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,480
I just think

482
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,280
Xiaofang, just in this situation,

483
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,000
and you’re willing to step up,

484
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,600
firmly letting the girls

485
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,520
feel that emotion.

486
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,240
I think I was moved.

487
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,680
Because he just mentioned

488
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,600
the two-hour drive.

489
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,640
Those two hours show

490
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,720
that he actually calculated it.

491
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,280
The distance from Shanghai to Hangzhou.

492
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,200
I think I can handle that time.

493
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,200
It shows I'm willing

494
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,120
to take on this responsibility

495
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,840
and commitment.

496
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,800
When in love,

497
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,080
you need this kind of passion

498
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,120
and the courage to show it.

499
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,320
Alright.

500
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,760
Let's move on to the next question.

501
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,080
It's my turn now.

502
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,240
Draw.

503
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,440
Ruilong is a pretty relaxed person.

504
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,360
Wang Jue pays a lot of attention to Ruilong.

505
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,800
This

506
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,320
Two questions

507
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,160
What

508
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,840
That might be mine

509
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,400
Wang Jue's sister-in-law

510
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,360
Not necessarily

511
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,680
Social pressure nowadays

512
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,360
is the norm

513
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,640
When you face pressure

514
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,400
how do you relieve it

515
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,080
First

516
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,120
Second

517
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,000
About my daughter

518
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,640
your feelings

519
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,760
what is the reason

520
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,000
It's not mine

521
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,760
I wrote it, and then he picked it

522
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,840
It's fine

523
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,680
I was just thinking it couldn't be Duoduo's mom

524
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,360
I really like this question

525
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,280
Because she said there's a lot of social pressure now

526
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,560
How do you deal with it

527
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,560
You can learn how this boy

528
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,440
handles stress

529
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,320
and his resilience

530
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:26,880
and his emotions

531
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,480
whether they're stable

532
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,320
Right

533
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,440
Social pressure

534
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,640
Usually I

535
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,920
don't let myself

536
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,600
get too stressed

537
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,600
I try to

538
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,800
live better and be happier

539
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:45,960
So cute

540
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,240
That's real wisdom in life

541
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:49,960
Guys

542
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,360
He solved the problem at its root

543
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,920
I don't have much stress

544
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,920
Great wisdom

545
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,160
No internal struggle

546
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,080
And the second question

547
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,480
I need to know who asked first

548
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,600
He doesn't know Duoduo's mom wrote it

549
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:03,920
No need

550
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,520
Or maybe

551
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,760
It's about your

552
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,440
so far

553
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,200
crush

554
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,000
what is it

555
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,000
That's where I'm hesitating

556
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,360
It's hard to answer

557
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,760
Look, he's looking at Duoduo

558
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,360
Wang Jue is also looking forward to it

559
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,160
So who should we talk about

560
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,080
It's okay, you can share

561
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,440
What about her really moved you

562
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,160
That's the question

563
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,120
That's the question

564
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,760
Maybe he thinks

565
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,280
Duoduo's persistence in love touched him

566
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,480
But the person isn't him

567
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,520
Okay

568
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,040
That's it

569
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:44,880
Okay

570
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,440
So

571
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,800
Maybe saying it out loud will

572
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,840
He doesn't want to pressure the other person

573
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,560
That's possible too

574
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,280
Okay, it's fine

575
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,400
Wang Jue is disappointed

576
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,720
It's fine, let's just do it this way

577
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,080
Let's ask who wrote this

578
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,160
On our side

579
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:03,920
On our side

580
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,880
Didn't expect it was Duoduo's

581
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,640
Didn't expect that

582
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,280
You two are really

583
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,320
one in the south, one in the north

584
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,960
This smile is so

585
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,480
Didn't answer

586
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,560
Right

587
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,560
Didn't expect she was picked

588
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,360
Right

589
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,320
Too bad for Ruilong

590
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,440
Mom

591
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,720
Who do you want to answer this question

592
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,400
So who does mom want to ask

593
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,680
Maybe she wants Lechen to answer

594
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,520
It should be Chenchen

595
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,640
That's impressive

596
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,760
Let me check

597
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,560
Actually, I feel like my mom is asking me

598
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,840
She has her own opinions.

599
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,000
Yes, I ask for her advice.

600
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,680
Okay.

601
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,120
Alright.

602
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,720
Very straightforward.

603
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,080
Yes, I ask for her advice.

604
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,560
Duoduo is really super cool.

605
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:07,720
Duoduo is really super cool.

606
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,960
Really handsome.

607
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,720
So bold.

608
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:10,920
She did it.

609
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,200
She did it.

610
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,440
Little Ma.

611
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,560
When I face pressure,

612
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,800
I usually

613
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,480
look for exciting activities.

614
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,720
I think that's how I

615
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,920
relieve stress.

616
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,680
Second point.

617
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,200
I think I'm very optimistic and outgoing.

618
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,720
Very optimistic and outgoing.

619
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,480
She has a bit of optimism.

620
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,800
That's very attractive to you.

621
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,640
His expression and demeanor

622
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,320
Actually, I'm

623
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,320
not a very energetic person.

624
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,800
And I'm not very good at talking.

625
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,880
And I'm quite introverted.

626
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,760
The other person is

627
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,160
very energetic, I think.

628
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:08,560
And

629
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,240
also

630
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,000
in terms of communication,

631
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,400
they're much better.

632
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,080
Are you satisfied with Duoduo's answer?

633
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,440
I think it's pretty good.

634
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,000
What about mom?

635
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,040
It's okay.

636
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,480
It's okay.

637
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,880
Last two cards.

638
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,240
Last two cards.

639
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,480
The people behind

640
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,120
Not looking good.

641
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,960
It's tough for those behind.

642
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,920
Then it's Lechen's turn.

643
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,280
Don't pick those three questions.

644
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,680
Lechen will still draw.

645
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,560
What will he get?

646
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,280
Also two questions.

647
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,360
What guys expect

648
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,000
What type of partner do you want?

649
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,720
What kind of dating environment?

650
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,800
What kind of atmosphere do you want in a relationship?

651
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:00,840
Wang Jue's wife's question.

652
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,920
Wang Jue's wife's question.

653
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,320
The type of partner I want

654
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,840
Personally, I

655
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,880
prefer someone with a

656
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,360
more stable core.

657
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,240
Stronger.

658
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:20,680
Stronger.

659
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,760
Take your seat.

660
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,800
He used "stable" earlier

661
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,240
to describe Luyuan.

662
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,320
Also,

663
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,920
must have their own opinions.

664
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,760
And also,

665
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,280
everyone's values

666
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,440
must be right, for sure.

667
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,400
Values.

668
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:44,880
Romantic environment

669
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,840
Personally, I'm actually very

670
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,120
calm, or you could say a very low-key person

671
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,480
So in relationships

672
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,280
and in my surroundings

673
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:53,920
I'm actually

674
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,800
more inclined toward a stable environment

675
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,160
Stability

676
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,720
He keeps talking about this

677
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,000
You see, he really cares about

678
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
stability

679
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,320
Yeah

680
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,800
Duoduo gets it now

681
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,400
Still feels disappointed

682
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:10,800
This is the last one

683
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,680
The hardest one

684
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,400
Only the sister's question left

685
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,240
Her question is tough

686
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,640
What question?

687
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,400
There are three questions

688
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,920
Congratulations

689
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,840
You picked

690
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,560
three questions

691
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,200
Yours

692
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,000
Really?

693
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,960
She said, just wait and see

694
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,560
The person who speaks the least

695
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,120
got the hardest question

696
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,640
Three questions, and these are the toughest

697
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,560
The first question is

698
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,280
Your longest and shortest relationships

699
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,480
how long were they?

700
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,240
Everyone is shocked

701
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,240
The second question is

702
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,720
What do you think is most important in a long-term relationship?

703
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,360
The third question is

704
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,600
If work requires

705
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,200
you to travel long-term with someone of the opposite sex

706
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,360
and you develop

707
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,640
feelings beyond just work

708
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,320
how do you maintain a sense of boundaries?

709
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,120
That's scary

710
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,600
So hard

711
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,440
That's so you

712
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,000
She's impressive

713
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,800
Don't say how you'd answer

714
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,120
Just reading your question

715
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,040
gave me goosebumps

716
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,720
Everyone's nervous for him

717
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,440
Yeah

718
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,640
Let's see how he answers

719
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,160
First, the first question is

720
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:51,960
It's pretty specific

721
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,160
My longest relationship was probably

722
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,200
four and a half years

723
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,960
As for the shortest

724
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,320
The shortest was about two

725
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,680
less than two months

726
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,440
Less than that

727
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,760
That's pretty honest

728
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,760
And the second question,

729
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,840
what do you think is most important in a long-term relationship?

730
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,280
Tolerance is the most important.

731
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,280
Yes, mutual tolerance is crucial.

732
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,640
For the third question, I think

733
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,360
having feelings beyond work,

734
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,800
how do you maintain boundaries?

735
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,120
That's really difficult.

736
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,760
The premise is,

737
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,280
I'm already in an intimate relationship.

738
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,840
In a close relationship,

739
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,680
already in a relationship.

740
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,480
How should I answer?

741
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,720
First of all, I wouldn't

742
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,440
let myself and a colleague

743
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,080
develop feelings

744
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,240
beyond work.

745
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,280
Affection.

746
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,720
That's acceptable.

747
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,800
Even if there's such a

748
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,480
trend happening,

749
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,760
I think I would immediately

750
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,400
cut it off right away.

751
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:17,840
Yes.

752
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,040
No matter if it's

753
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,000
changing

754
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,680
the work environment or whatever,

755
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,720
I think you must

756
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,040
stop this immediately.

757
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:25,960
Momentum.

758
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:26,760
Yes.

759
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,680
So nothing else will happen.

760
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,120
No further issues.

761
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,920
Yuxing answered very sincerely.

762
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:33,840
Sister,

763
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,040
you can choose one person

764
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,560
or two people

765
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,200
to answer this question.

766
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,200
This is getting interesting.

767
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,040
Choose one or two people?

768
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,480
I'll pick the ones who tonight

769
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,800
peeled shrimp for me,

770
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,440
Xiao Fang,

771
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,560
and the one who picked food for me,

772
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,680
Xiao Jiao.

773
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,840
Yes, Xiao Jiao and Xiao Fang.

774
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,600
Do you think that's appropriate?

775
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,000
Sister is always sister.

776
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,360
Let's see how they answer.

777
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,400
Alright.

778
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,200
Then let's invite

779
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,480
these two to answer the question.

780
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:30,920
Is that okay?

781
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,600
This is so exciting.

782
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,520
The gossip duo.

783
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,960
Looking forward to it.

784
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,440
The longest relationship was

785
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,360
five years.

786
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,840
The longest was almost two years.

787
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,840
The shortest was one month.

788
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,240
The shortest was a few months.

789
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,400
That's explosive.

790
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,920
So dramatic.

791
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:19,960
Gossip Dragon.

792
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,480
What do you think is most important in a long-term relationship?

793
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,400
Trust.

794
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,760
The most important thing is

795
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,240
being yourself,

796
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,680
and being tolerant of each other.

797
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,080
And also

798
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:40,960
helping each other grow.

799
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,520
That works.

800
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,400
If your job requires you to travel long-term with someone of the opposite sex,

801
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:49,880
on business trips,

802
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,760
and you develop feelings beyond work,

803
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,720
how do you maintain boundaries?

804
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,640
I'm really looking forward to this answer.

805
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,160
If I notice even the slightest sign,

806
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,040
I’ll cut it off immediately.

807
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,960
Even if it comes from the other person.

808
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,160
How do you keep boundaries?

809
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,280
First of all, my job

810
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,440
doesn't require long-term business trips with the opposite sex.

811
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,120
If it really happens,

812
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,640
in some special cases,

813
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,760
if something like this happens,

814
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,400
I honestly think it wouldn’t happen.

815
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,120
If I’m already in a relationship,

816
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,400
I might

817
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,520
use social media

818
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,280
or just in my daily life

819
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,560
to let people around me know

820
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,880
that I have a girlfriend.

821
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:31,720
This—

822
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,280
That works.

823
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:32,760
I didn’t think of that.

824
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,280
Definitely works.

825
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,000
When I’m with colleagues,

826
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,200
I keep mentioning her.

827
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,080
I keep

828
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,200
calling her,

829
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:39,720
video chatting,

830
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,640
basically, I talk about her all the time.

831
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,080
I think that keeps most people away.

832
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:44,560
Yeah.

833
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,200
If there’s still someone

834
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,720
who ignores the boundaries

835
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,840
and doesn’t stop,

836
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,520
then I think

837
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,360
if it’s a colleague,

838
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,240
you should “report” them.

839
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,120
Or “call the police.”

840
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,520
Just “report” them.

841
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,480
Or “call the police.”

842
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,400
“Call the police.”

843
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,800
“Call the police.”

844
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,480
“Call the police.”

845
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,000
Just “report” them.

846
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:06,920
“Call the police.”

847
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:10,840
That works.

848
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,440
Awesome.

849
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,600
If you’ve already

850
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,120
received

851
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,800
affection from the opposite sex that crosses boundaries,

852
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,880
He just gave a great answer

853
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,000
about how he shuts down his signals.

854
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,920
Yeah.

855
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,480
I think that last point

856
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,360
I didn’t expect.

857
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,280
Young people are really bold.

858
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,200
And brave in love.

859
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,360
When I need to reject someone,

860
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:34,800
actually,

861
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,200
you can be firm enough to do it.

862
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,600
But I think not causing trouble for yourself

863
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,880
is a great choice.

864
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,480
Very satisfied.

865
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,280
Satisfied.

866
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,440
Satisfied.

867
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,320
Thank you.

868
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,400
Straightforward Jiao.

869
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,080
Jiao's answer

870
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,520
has a really healthy view on relationships.

871
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,280
Very healthy.

872
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,320
If she knows you have a girlfriend

873
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,560
and still wants to

874
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,600
develop things further with you,

875
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,000
then

876
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,920
it's really her problem.

877
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,160
Because I've been clarifying all along,

878
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:07,520
again and again.

879
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,160
The way you put it

880
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:08,840
makes people feel really secure.

881
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,520
Today,

882
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,560
let's give our guys a round of applause.

883
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:13,960
Shall we?

884
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:14,800
Awesome!

885
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,120
Really great!

886
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:16,720
So amazing!

887
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,160
I think it's not just

888
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,200
about answering

889
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,120
so many cute questions.

890
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,400
Tonight, our guys

891
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,600
Tonight, our guys

892
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,160
also for all of us

893
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,920
cooked up

894
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,280
the best dishes they could make,

895
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,520
the most delicious food.

896
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,000
Honestly, for me,

897
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,640
it's not just the girls,

898
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,680
the guys

899
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,920
also need

900
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,120
to be cared for

901
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,120
and

902
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:41,840
to be loved.

903
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,320
Yes.

904
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,200
Because a sincere relationship

905
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,440
is always about two people

906
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,480
being able to truly be themselves.

907
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,480
And in this process,

908
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,680
whether it's the guy

909
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,680
or the girl,

910
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,720
both can appreciate and support each other.

911
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,040
They both give equally.

912
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,600
That's what makes love stronger.

913
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,360
Right.

914
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,400
I also hope everyone can find

915
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,640
the one

916
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,840
you've been waiting for,

917
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,040
the one you can

918
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,480
spend your future with,

919
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,640
the person who makes your heart flutter.

920
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,440
Wishing everyone the best.

921
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:11,880
Alright?

922
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,240
Thank you.

923
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,280
Thanks again.

924
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:15,720
Thank you.

925
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,200
Alright, let's have another toast.

926
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,280
Raise your Master Kong Jasmine Tea.

927
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,000
Wishing you all the best.

928
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
All the best.

929
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,640
Best wishes.

930
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,360
Hope everything goes well.

931
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,160
Wishing you smooth sailing.

932
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:27,560
Thank you, Teacher.

933
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,200
May everything go your way.

934
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,200
Be happy.

935
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,280
Thank you.

936
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:35,880
Thank you, Tao, for giving us

937
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,160
such a wonderful night.

938
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:37,760
Thank you.

939
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,080
This party was great.

940
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,080
This party was great.

941
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:40,760
Really good.

942
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,000
Having friends and family join makes it even better.

943
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,480
I think for those

944
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,240
who are still feeling lost right now,

945
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,520
Yeah.

946
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,640
the opinions of friends and family

947
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,600
might really influence their choices.

948
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,080
It can have a big impact.

949
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,440
Friends and family might tell you from their perspective

950
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,640
who they think suits you best.

951
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,520
And why.

952
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,920
They’ll share their own point of view.

953
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,560
What’s most special, I think,

954
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,520
is that

955
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,320
we actually see

956
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,520
so many different perspectives.

957
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,120
In a relationship,

958
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,720
it’s really about two people,

959
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,800
but it’s not just

960
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,520
about only two people.

961
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,080
It’s very diverse.

962
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,040
That’s what love is.

963
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,800
It’s where its charm lies.

964
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,720
And where its energy comes from.

965
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,480
The question Zihan just picked

966
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,800
I’d like to ask everyone too.

967
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,680
In a

968
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,880
close relationship,

969
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,840
what do you think you can

970
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,720
give to your partner?

971
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,000
And what do you need

972
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,080
your partner to give you?

973
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,320
What I can give my partner

974
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,280
is probably

975
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,600
emotional value.

976
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,000
Because I think

977
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I can make him happy.

978
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,280
What I need from my partner

979
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:37,840
is a sense of security.

980
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:39,840
We can both

981
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,760
trust each other deeply.

982
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,280
No matter when,

983
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,520
we believe in each other.

984
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,720
And when that happens,

985
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,920
many things

986
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,920
are no longer a problem.

987
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:48,920
What about you?

988
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,320
What I can give my partner

989
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,360
is also energy.

990
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,040
What can he give me?

991
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,000
I think it’s answers.

992
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,800
All the things I want to know about this world,

993
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,920
the answers to problems I can’t solve,

994
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,160
he can give me.

995
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,640
I’ve talked about this with my husband.

996
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,200
He said,

997
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,440
Talking about it makes me want to marry him again.

998
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,640
He said that in you,

999
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,440
there’s one trait

1000
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,640
that even if I chose a hundred times,

1001
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,680
I’d always choose you.

1002
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,480
That irresistible attraction

1003
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,560
is your optimism.

1004
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:17,960
In many people's eyes,

1005
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,360
I might seem like a really strange person.

1006
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,040
But he thinks I'm funny and interesting.

1007
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,640
And he never says,

1008
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,480
Can you be more proper?

1009
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,360
Can you behave?

1010
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:26,760
Can you

1011
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,000
not do this or that?

1012
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,880
He understands my

1013
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,040
quirks,

1014
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:30,960
and cuteness.

1015
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,640
Yeah.

1016
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,280
That's how I feel.

1017
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,760
I think it depends on

1018
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,320
what the other person wants.

1019
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,480
Are you the accommodating type?

1020
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,240
I totally am.

1021
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,200
Really.

1022
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,960
Before, if I saw this question,

1023
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,400
I would answer first,

1024
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,240
thinking about what I can give.

1025
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:45,800
What I can offer.

1026
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,240
But now,

1027
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,440
I think more deeply,

1028
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,800
and want to listen first

1029
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,200
to what the other person wants.

1030
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,520
I think Xu,

1031
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,240
your ability to love is really strong now.

1032
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,240
As for what I want from my partner,

1033
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,080
sometimes, when I'm

1034
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,320
not in a good state,

1035
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,800
I hope my partner can catch me.

1036
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,960
It's not that you want her to take care of you,

1037
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:16,120
just that you want her to be there.

1038
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,560
That's awesome.

1039
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,720
I won't promise what I can't do.

1040
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,480
But within my ability,

1041
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,560
anything

1042
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,720
she wants,

1043
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,160
I'll do my best to give.

1044
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,000
What I might need

1045
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,120
is understanding.

1046
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,200
Someone who understands my loneliness.

1047
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,560
That's like giving me freedom and warmth.

1048
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,600
Whether it's a friend or a lover,

1049
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,360
they give me

1050
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,000
a sense of warmth.

1051
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,680
Then I'll open myself up.

1052
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,880
And give myself to them.

1053
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,080
I really think

1054
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,560
girls would be so happy with you.

1055
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,480
Now in the comments,

1056
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,960
so many people want to catch these two.

1057
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,320
I'll do it.

1058
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,280
I'll catch.

1059
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:56,920
Volleyball.

1060
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,000
I'll catch it.

1061
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,040
Okay.

1062
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:02,560
So, our second open day

1063
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,760
So, our second open day

1064
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,560
was a complete success.

1065
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,120
Next,

1066
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,240
let's see what

1067
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:07,920
in our Heartbeat Apartment

1068
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,040
will happen

1069
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,720
next.

1070
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,760
I'm heading to my room first.

1071
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:12,720
Okay.

1072
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,000
I'm exhausted.

1073
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:17,560
Going back.

1074
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,160
Even though it's still early today,

1075
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,040
I'm so tired.

1076
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,480
I didn't need to say much today.

1077
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,120
That's nice.

1078
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:27,640
Pretty good.

1079
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,520
But for every question,

1080
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,080
I wanted to answer.

1081
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,520
But no one asked me.

1082
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,760
You were mentioned the most today.

1083
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,880
Was it six times?

1084
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,960
I really thank you two.

1085
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,240
My heart was pounding all night.

1086
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,680
It never stopped.

1087
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,320
And just now,

1088
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:49,800
my heart rate

1089
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,760
was at ninety-two percent.

1090
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,040
It kept racing the whole time.

1091
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,200
I think you're having a tough time.

1092
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:00,680
You're really struggling.

1093
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,080
Right now.

1094
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,440
Honestly, one side is already

1095
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,240
feeling pretty miserable.

1096
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,040
But I do think Duoduo is really

1097
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,000
having a hard time today.

1098
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,200
Jiao noticed Duoduo.

1099
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,600
Maybe because you were sitting next to her,

1100
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,800
you couldn't see her.

1101
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,360
I saw her showing a lot of

1102
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,080
really

1103
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,080
downcast expressions.

1104
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,320
Really?

1105
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,080
It's a mess.

1106
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:23,920
My head feels dizzy.

1107
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,360
He said again today

1108
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,040
At first, he said

1109
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,840
Xiaoyuan has a stable core.

1110
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,720
Then he called her an optimistic pessimist.

1111
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,200
And then he said

1112
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,680
she longs for a certain emotional state.

1113
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,800
Maybe a bit more than others.

1114
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,600
She hopes for something more stable.

1115
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,800
I never deny

1116
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,400
that I also have a stable core.

1117
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:44,840
Yeah.

1118
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,200
So I'm really troubled.

1119
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,200
Duoduo also wants to be affirmed.

1120
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,960
She's very aware of it.

1121
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,240
Right.

1122
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,080
I feel like

1123
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,280
she (Ke Ailin) is already

1124
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,160
not as happy as before.

1125
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:03,840
Duoduo.

1126
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,320
Yeah.

1127
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,480
I feel like my relationship with Duoduo

1128
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,680
is getting stranger.

1129
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,440
Xiaoyuan is also having a hard time now.

1130
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,040
Yeah.

1131
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,080
I think falling for someone is really torturous.

1132
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,600
Someone always gets hurt.

1133
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,280
There's no way both sides feel good.

1134
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,960
Who's playing the instrument?

1135
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,480
Musician, why aren't you coming out to play?

1136
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,440
Come out and play.

1137
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,800
Once the guqin starts,

1138
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,600
Ruilong takes the stage.

1139
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,160
I'm looking forward to it.

1140
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,600
What piece will you play?

1141
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,520
Play the most passionate one.

1142
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,040
Like "Jiu Kuang."

1143
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:50,680
Sure.

1144
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,640
Give it a try.

1145
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,240
That's awesome.

1146
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,760
Everyone, give it a try.

1147
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,000
This is my nightly privilege.

1148
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,800
You're so lucky.

1149
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,680
She looks at Ruilong with such admiration.

1150
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,920
She's looking at Ruilong.

1151
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,200
And the music he plays before bed is really

1152
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,400
It makes people feel so

1153
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,760
Yeah, it's very soothing.

1154
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,840
It's wonderful.

1155
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,120
At night, I like to play "Liang Xiao Yin."

1156
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:02,880
"Liang Xiao Yin."

1157
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,840
I'm really looking forward to it.

1158
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:40,600
So sleep-inducing.

1159
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,200
This is hilarious.

1160
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,600
Only one person is awake.

1161
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,840
Wang Jue is listening so attentively.

1162
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,520
Wang Jue is really focused.

1163
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,080
Woke up to the applause.

1164
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,800
This music is just too...

1165
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,120
In the future,

1166
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,120
You should play this over the loudspeaker.

1167
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:31,760
Play this piece.

1168
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,320
Yeah.

1169
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,200
Helps you sleep.

1170
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,480
It’s really blissful.

1171
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,960
Anyone want to be Ruilong’s roommate?

1172
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,880
Anyone want to move downstairs?

1173
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,960
Anyone want to move downstairs?

1174
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:51,400
Upstairs.

1175
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,760
Lechen wants to move downstairs.

1176
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,400
Upstairs.

1177
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,880
Help me ask Wang Lechen to walk the dog later.

1178
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,040
Lechen.

1179
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,000
Duoduo is brave and straightforward.

1180
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:09,600
Yes.

1181
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,240
Help me ask Wang Lechen to walk the dog later.

1182
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,560
I think Duoduo just wants to figure things out.

1183
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,480
Heading out.

1184
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,680
I’ll go take a look.

1185
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,960
I really want to try, is that okay?

1186
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,720
I really want to try, is that okay?

1187
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,240
Sure.

1188
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,520
Jue keeps creating opportunities for herself.

1189
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:51,920
Yeah, she’s working hard.

1190
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:52,800
Can I try?

1191
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,280
Okay.

1192
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:58,960
I’m going out with Yuan for a walk.

1193
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:02,400
You can use your middle finger, for example.

1194
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,760
Usually, the notes go downward.

1195
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,400
Like this, going down.

1196
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,800
I don’t know how to play without nails.

1197
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,000
So do you keep your nails a bit longer?

1198
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,720
Yeah, I keep them a little longer.

1199
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,240
Wang Jue’s vibe really suits this.

1200
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,840
Because Wang Jue has a classical beauty.

1201
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,920
The two of them are a great match.

1202
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,040
Ruilong and Jue could work out too.

1203
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,080
Duoduo came down first.

1204
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,240
Here they come.

1205
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:16,840
Here they come.

1206
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:17,920
Going to the appointment.

1207
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,520
Yuxing is here.

1208
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,080
It looks like a painting.

1209
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:32,720
Sis.

1210
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:34,920
You look like a painting.

1211
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:36,920
What kind of painting?

1212
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:38,160
An oil painting.

1213
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:39,640
Kind of.

1214
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,000
The movie "Jasmine Holiday".

1215
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:43,680
So beautiful.

1216
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,760
Okay, I’ll try to keep it up.

1217
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:50,840
You guys go ahead.

1218
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:15,400
What’s wrong?

1219
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,120
What?

1220
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:16,960
Are you okay?

1221
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,840
Why did you suddenly come up?

1222
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,200
So sleepy.

1223
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,160
Duoduo said

1224
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,640
wants to walk the dog with you.

1225
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:24,160
Who?

1226
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,000
Duoduo.

1227
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,280
Depends on what you want.

1228
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:44,960
Now?

1229
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,880
Now or maybe in two or three minutes.

1230
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:51,840
If you’re worried it’ll be awkward,

1231
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:53,760
I can say you’re already asleep.

1232
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,000
No need for that.

1233
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,440
It’s tough.

1234
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,760
So tough.

1235
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:13,880
On the first day,

1236
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,560
Who would’ve thought it’d turn out like this?

1237
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,760
Do you think I need to worry so much?

1238
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,640
Just worrying about other people’s feelings.

1239
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,480
Depends on who they are.

1240
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,040
Yeah.

1241
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,520
I feel like I can’t do this.

1242
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,440
Seems like I can’t.

1243
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,280
I don’t think I can.

1244
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,520
No, I’m really confused right now.

1245
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,880
I don’t know what I’m thinking.

1246
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:50,800
So what should I do?

1247
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:54,480
This really is hard.

1248
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,480
He doesn’t want to hurt either side.

1249
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,000
I think what I said at the dinner

1250
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,200
should’ve been pretty clear, right?

1251
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,440
He thinks he’s already made it obvious.

1252
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,640
So does that mean

1253
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,680
not going down is my answer?

1254
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:19,840
Yes.

1255
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:20,920
But you could go down

1256
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:21,760
and talk to her.

1257
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,640
But this is also a way.

1258
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,080
So does that mean

1259
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,080
not going down is my answer?

1260
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,320
He might not be able to face Duoduo.

1261
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,600
Duoduo.

1262
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,880
Duoduo has been waiting for him.

1263
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,240
Did he come?

1264
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,360
Or did he not come?

1265
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:14,440
Will he answer?

1266
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:24,800
Will he pick up the call?

1267
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,760
Please leave your message after the beep.

1268
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,440
Press "#" to play the recording.

1269
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,120
I don't understand.

1270
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:38,680
I don't get it.

1271
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,880
Why?

1272
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:41,920
Yeah, I just don't get why.

1273
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,280
How did things end up like this?

1274
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,720
It hurts a little.

1275
00:51:58,800 --> 00:51:59,480
At the beginning,

1276
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,280
when they were dating,

1277
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,560
they liked each other.

1278
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,520
It was exciting.

1279
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:03,160
Yeah.

1280
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,920
If I were Duoduo,

1281
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,000
I'd rather you reject me face to face.

1282
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,240
You should tell me.

1283
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,200
If I can meet you today,

1284
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,760
I can handle the disappointment.

1285
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:11,360
So this kind of thing

1286
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,200
depends on the person.

1287
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:12,880
There's no right or wrong.

1288
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,840
Yeah.

1289
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:22,360
Hello.

1290
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:23,200
Hi.

1291
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,480
Did you all just go walk the dog?

1292
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,360
No, we didn't.

1293
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,160
Didn't I see you with Weini?

1294
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,720
No, I was going to take her out.

1295
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:31,360
But I didn't.

1296
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,400
Just me.

1297
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,160
Ruilong probably noticed

1298
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,320
Duoduo's mood.

1299
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:38,280
Yeah.

1300
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:40,760
Where are they?

1301
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:43,960
No idea.

1302
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,080
Didn't see them.

1303
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:49,480
They're all gone.

1304
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:50,680
I don't know where anyone is.

1305
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:53,880
Ruilong.

1306
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,240
Is Jiao upstairs?

1307
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,720
Yeah, upstairs.

1308
00:52:58,520 --> 00:52:59,720
Upstairs.

1309
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:06,680
She went to find Xiao Jiao.

1310
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:16,960
Did you talk to him?

1311
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:17,960
I did, I really did.

1312
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:18,960
But he didn't come down.

1313
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,200
This scene...

1314
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,080
I think he's a bit tired.

1315
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,000
He seems a bit sleepy.

1316
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,600
He's really tired today.

1317
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,240
Xiao Jiao probably doesn't want her to be so sad.

1318
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,640
He just doesn't know what to say.

1319
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,840
Duoduo probably knows the answer now.

1320
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,880
Earlier, she might have thought

1321
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,680
maybe Xiao Jiao hadn't said anything yet.

1322
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:41,960
Yeah.

1323
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,680
It's usually like this at times like these.

1324
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,040
You give the other person a reason.

1325
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:48,000
Because it's really hard to accept.

1326
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
If you just don't show up,

1327
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,320
it's hard to accept.

1328
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:52,920
It's really hard to accept.

1329
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,640
But in real life,

1330
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,200
people can't always get

1331
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,120
what they want.

1332
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,360
If you go down,

1333
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:01,120
it's more respectful.

1334
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,480
But not going down

1335
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,160
is also

1336
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:04,840
okay, I think.

1337
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,120
Maybe right now,

1338
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:06,800
he can't handle

1339
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:07,720
going down and

1340
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:08,880
talking it out.

1341
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:09,440
Yeah.

1342
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,400
How is it?

1343
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:23,960
What do you mean?

1344
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,920
Ruilong noticed Duoduo was upset.

1345
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:26,800
Yeah.

1346
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,080
He wants to comfort her.

1347
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,400
Wants to talk.

1348
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,120
Talk.

1349
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:44,600
Talk to me.

1350
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:45,000
Let's talk.

1351
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:45,480
Let's go.

1352
00:54:58,520 --> 00:54:59,640
You guys haven't gone yet.

1353
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:00,640
You went downstairs, right?

1354
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,280
Yeah, I went down.

1355
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,720
I just went down and walked around by myself.

1356
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:10,760
Okay, let's go.

1357
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:11,560
Let's go have some fun.

1358
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:12,880
Sit here.

1359
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:13,480
Sit here.

1360
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,200
What's wrong?

1361
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:20,400
Nothing.

1362
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,280
I feel like right now, you seem a bit

1363
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:39,040
different from before, when you were so outgoing.

1364
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,120
You were cheerful and sunny, that was the Duoduo I knew.

1365
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,240
Now it feels like you're trapped.

1366
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:47,680
I can sense it.

1367
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:51,000
Actually, you're not someone who's very proactive.

1368
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,320
But maybe

1369
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:55,760
in this situation,

1370
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,880
there's not much you can do.

1371
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,640
I actually said something similar today.

1372
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:03,520
I said I think

1373
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:05,480
about this part,

1374
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:06,840
I feel it's a pity.

1375
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:09,840
Because I think the little house was prepared with care.

1376
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:12,800
But it didn't carry

1377
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,680
She must feel so wronged inside.

1378
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,440
It didn't bring out some of the things

1379
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:34,480
Well, not "should have,"

1380
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,360
but the stories we hoped would happen.

1381
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,080
I've been thinking about this.

1382
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,520
Is it because there was no story

1383
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,640
that neither the guys nor the girls were brave enough?

1384
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:51,440
Or is it because

1385
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,600
you were already very brave?

1386
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,600
You really are brave.

1387
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:12,960
Why?

1388
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,600
Is it because the time was too short?

1389
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,000
Wang Jue cried too.

1390
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:37,080
It feels so hard.

1391
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:00,000
I feel really bad.

1392
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,720
Honestly, I wasn't very happy.

1393
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,120
What I regret most

1394
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,480
is that in the little house,

1395
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,480
I wasn't especially happy.

1396
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,800
It's because I saw you unhappy.

1397
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,920
I don't want you to be unhappy.

1398
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,240
Sometimes it's like doing yoga.

1399
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,040
Doing yoga isn't always fun either.

1400
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:32,920
But maybe after a month of practice,

1401
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,040
you'll feel happy.

1402
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,280
Because you feel your body has improved.

1403
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:37,480
So sometimes,

1404
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:38,520
I think this kind of resistance

1405
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,960
is actually about improving yourself.

1406
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,440
Or maybe it's just because

1407
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:45,800
it's not right for you.

1408
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,840
And I think someone with your personality

1409
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:53,720
is already hesitant to be brave.

1410
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,560
So I feel

1411
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:57,120
this is already

1412
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,760
not the Duoduo I used to know.

1413
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:03,160
Or maybe I really hope you

1414
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:05,280
as a girl,

1415
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,800
can have strong friendships.

1416
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,160
Wang Jue is really great.

1417
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,800
I think maybe this is something

1418
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,080
I need to experience myself.

1419
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:13,120
Yeah.

1420
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,400
This needs a certain spark.

1421
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:17,920
It's a necessary condition.

1422
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,720
Maybe it's suitable.

1423
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:23,120
Or a comfortable relationship is also important.

1424
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:27,200
So really, don't be upset.

1425
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,440
I think the reason for feeling down is

1426
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:30,840
I'm doing something

1427
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:32,880
I'm not really good at.

1428
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,080
Right.

1429
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:36,240
But just because I'm not good at it

1430
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,640
doesn't mean it's a bad thing.

1431
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:42,480
If I don't give it a try,

1432
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,640
I might never know

1433
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:46,280
if it's actually right for me.

1434
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:47,720
If I do it,

1435
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:48,880
I have to take on

1436
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,440
the risks it might bring.

1437
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:51,640
Emotional risks.

1438
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:53,160
Well said.

1439
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,720
I think I can handle it.

1440
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,000
But honestly,

1441
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,440
I'm not yet a very mature

1442
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,840
person who can gracefully

1443
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,360
process my emotions.

1444
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,280
I think

1445
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,560
I still show my feelings on my face easily.

1446
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:08,360
But that's not a bad thing.

1447
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:09,560
It gets your attention.

1448
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,000
That's your strength.

1449
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,760
See, that's why I came to talk to you.

1450
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:15,040
Yeah.

1451
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,200
I think it's actually pretty good.

1452
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:16,880
Because in life,

1453
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,080
I haven't really had

1454
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,600
so many people to spend time with like this.

1455
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:21,160
Right.

1456
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:22,040
I hope

1457
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:22,720
everyone

1458
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,000
can become friends.

1459
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:24,600
It's not that hard.

1460
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,280
As long as everyone wants to be friends first.

1461
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:26,520
As long as everyone wants to be friends first.

1462
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:26,720
As long as everyone wants to be friends first.

1463
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,960
If both people are kind,

1464
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,000
The puppy sighs.

1465
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,240
Because I invited you,

1466
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:34,240
I was waiting downstairs,

1467
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:34,880
but you didn't come down.

1468
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:35,720
I just felt

1469
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:38,560
really sad.

1470
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,520
Then my emotions

1471
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:41,880
just burst out.

1472
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:42,760
So when I saw it,

1473
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,880
I felt so sorry.

1474
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:45,680
She finally cried.

1475
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,360
She finally let go of all her discomfort.

1476
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:48,240
She let it all out.

1477
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,600
I think that's amazing.

1478
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:50,680
It feels so real.

1479
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,920
And I believe things will get better for her.

1480
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,280
After crying, she'll be able to let go.

1481
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,360
It's come to an end.

1482
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,640
I feel like deep down,

1483
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,640
Duoduo has already sorted it out.

1484
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,640
She said something like this:

1485
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:03,840
She said, right now

1486
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:04,640
she's doing something

1487
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,040
she's not good at.

1488
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:07,200
This thing

1489
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,160
makes her unhappy.

1490
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:08,400
But she wants to go through this challenge.

1491
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,360
But she wants to go through this challenge.

1492
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:11,720
It's like practicing yoga.

1493
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:13,840
Maybe after some time, she'll realize

1494
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:16,720
her emotional strength has grown.

1495
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,520
When she thinks of herself then,

1496
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:20,320
she'll be happy again.

1497
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:21,120
Yeah.

1498
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:22,920
She will.

1499
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:27,080
Can I ask you something?

1500
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:30,640
How do you think you can fix

1501
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:33,400
a broken relationship?

1502
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,000
What does a broken relationship mean?

1503
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:43,480
Zihan is still

1504
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:44,560
worried about her relationship with Chichi.

1505
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:44,960
Yeah.

1506
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:48,760
Maybe there were some misunderstandings before.

1507
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:51,440
But the misunderstanding was really sensitive.

1508
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,200
Just say it directly.

1509
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,480
Be straightforward about it.

1510
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,200
But in your heart, because of

1511
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,000
things that happened before,

1512
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,080
you might still have unresolved feelings, right?

1513
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,680
You can't just apologize.

1514
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:04,280
It depends on what you do after apologizing.

1515
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:06,480
Whether your explanation makes sense.

1516
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:08,440
But if

1517
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,800
your explanation is sincere,

1518
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,720
honest and reasonable,

1519
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,560
then I think it makes sense to me.

1520
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:15,920
And it clears up the misunderstanding.

1521
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:16,800
Then I think this issue

1522
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:17,800
can be forgiven.

1523
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:22,360
Just explain everything clearly.

1524
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:25,160
That way, neither person will have regrets.

1525
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:25,480
Right?

1526
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:27,280
Otherwise, the misunderstanding will get worse.

1527
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,880
It's just not worth it.

1528
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:34,200
This mangosteen isn't very good.

1529
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:35,200
It's fine.

1530
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:39,600
Here's another question.

1531
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,160
Do you think

1532
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,320
liking or loving someone is

1533
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:45,720
selfless or selfish?

1534
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:48,320
I get your question now.

1535
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:50,120
Is it conditional or unconditional?

1536
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:51,160
Does it expect something in return,

1537
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:52,160
or not expect anything back?

1538
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,080
You know what I mean.

1539
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:53,880
Go ahead.

1540
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:56,040
I feel like maybe you

1541
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:56,840
your personality

1542
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,360
still hopes that

1543
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:00,760
after you do something,

1544
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,640
you want the other person to give you positive feedback.

1545
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,120
Otherwise, you start to doubt

1546
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:04,920
if the other person

1547
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,640
actually has any feelings for you at all.

1548
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,320
I think a lot of guys are like that.

1549
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:10,200
Zihan is still

1550
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,560
troubled by that issue from before.

1551
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:14,360
Yeah.

1552
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:16,960
Yeah.

1553
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:28,120
Dr. Fang is so thoughtful.

1554
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,040
Is Dr. Fang obsessed with love?

1555
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:34,720
Yeah.

1556
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:35,520
Yeah.

1557
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,320
So cute.

1558
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:42,320
I peeled it for you, but you still peel it yourself.

1559
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:43,320
I didn't see.

1560
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,520
I peeled it for you, but you still peel it yourself.

1561
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,680
Ruolong is always around in these situations.

1562
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,840
Why do you look so bitter?

1563
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,280
He's smiling, but it's a bitter smile.

1564
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,440
A wry smile.

1565
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,520
Your camouflage doesn't work anymore.

1566
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,360
Ruolong has his own troubles too.

1567
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:19,920
Your smile is just your shield, right?

1568
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,760
They're gradually getting to know each other.

1569
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:24,920
Yeah.

1570
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:25,320
Right.

1571
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,080
You tell us.

1572
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:29,440
If you're still unsure,

1573
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,000
and I suddenly ask you deep questions,

1574
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,200
ask you a lot of questions,

1575
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,200
how would you feel?

1576
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:36,080
Feels like Ruolong is asking

1577
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,520
about his feelings for Duoduo.

1578
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,240
Tell her what you really think.

1579
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:42,040
So I say,

1580
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:44,240
I'm interested in you.

1581
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:45,560
But you might not be sure yet

1582
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:46,960
if you're interested in me.

1583
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:49,360
Then I ask you lots of deep questions

1584
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:50,640
all at once.

1585
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:51,920
Coming at you suddenly.

1586
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:53,920
Because he prefers to

1587
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,280
get to know someone slowly.

1588
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:00,080
I think you should just ask if you want to.

1589
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:01,840
See if she minds.

1590
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:03,040
She'll show it.

1591
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:05,600
If

1592
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:06,720
she shows

1593
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,160
she's not bothered by it,

1594
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:09,640
and she's willing to answer,

1595
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:10,960
then that's a good chance

1596
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,040
for you to get to know each other.

1597
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:12,840
Right?

1598
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:13,560
Yeah.

1599
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:18,280
Then I think you can

1600
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,240
be less hesitant

1601
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:22,880
and move forward with more courage.

1602
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,760
So have you taken the first step?

1603
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:34,480
I feel like I haven't figured it out yet.

1604
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:36,800
You should think it through first.

1605
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,280
Then you can act right away.

1606
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:39,920
Be clear about it.

1607
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:40,800
Don't regret it.

1608
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,240
I think that's pretty important.

1609
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:45,800
Lanlan put it really well.

1610
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:50,560
Be a little braver.

1611
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,240
Go Ruolong!

1612
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:55,960
Duoduo.

1613
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:57,680
Take a look at Ruolong.

1614
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:58,440
Did you hear that?

1615
01:05:59,280 --> 01:05:59,840
Me.

1616
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:00,480
Talking about you.

1617
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:02,000
This guy

1618
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,360
he's a bit too bold.

1619
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,000
A reckless guy.

1620
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,840
Today is all about helping everyone with their feelings.

1621
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:12,880
Exactly.

1622
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:15,720
It's Teacher Lan's class today.

1623
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:16,520
It's Teacher Lan's class today.

1624
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,560
This is your own issue to work on.

1625
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:20,480
Take your time to think about it.

1626
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:21,640
Bye.

1627
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:22,680
Bye.

1628
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:25,240
Could you help tidy up?

1629
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:26,920
I'll clean up.

1630
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:27,480
I'll help too.

1631
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:30,640
Let's clean up together.

1632
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:31,320
Let's tidy up.

1633
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:32,760
Where are we going?

1634
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:35,760
To take photos.

1635
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:36,120
Okay.

1636
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:46,160
What's this?

1637
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:49,720
This one's nice.

1638
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,320
This really suits me today.

1639
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,640
Like in "Princess Pearl".

1640
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:03,520
Look at me.

1641
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,040
This is the same as that.

1642
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:05,600
Yeah.

1643
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:06,840
Are you a sunflower?

1644
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,560
Actually, this looks a lot like a tulip.

1645
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:11,560
I feel embarrassed wearing this.

1646
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,440
This is the second wish.

1647
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:15,720
Take a photo sticker.

1648
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:20,240
It's my first time taking photo stickers alone with someone of the opposite sex.

1649
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,920
First time taking photo stickers alone with someone of the opposite sex.

1650
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,160
First time with someone of the opposite sex.

1651
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:24,840
Since I was little.

1652
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:25,400
Yeah.

1653
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:27,080
Taking these photo stickers alone.

1654
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:28,400
Me too.

1655
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:28,840
Really?

1656
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:29,440
Yeah.

1657
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:34,080
You pick one.

1658
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:39,360
Just take it like this?

1659
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:41,720
What else?

1660
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:44,920
Or should I stand on top?

1661
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:48,960
Your expression.

1662
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:49,400
Let's do it again.

1663
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:50,800
Again.

1664
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:53,280
Seven seconds.

1665
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:00,120
It's so slow to respond.

1666
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:01,240
What's going on?

1667
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:03,680
No, let's do it again.

1668
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:04,760
I think it shouldn't be that big.

1669
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:05,680
Don't you think so?

1670
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,240
It has to finish taking all the photos.

1671
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,240
It feels like it's not focused.

1672
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:10,840
Wait a moment.

1673
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:12,040
Wait until it's done, then redo it.

1674
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:16,120
Then I'll put on this headband again.

1675
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:18,960
I think today's crayfish

1676
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:19,960
was really tasty.

1677
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:21,080
I think today's crayfish

1678
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:22,040
was really tasty.

1679
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:24,680
Really.

1680
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:25,080
Okay.

1681
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:27,880
Even though I didn't eat the non-spicy one,

1682
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:29,120
I know I'd definitely prefer

1683
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:29,840
the spicy one.

1684
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:31,840
Do you want more?

1685
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:34,240
Making this must be tiring, right?

1686
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:36,320
How long did you make it?

1687
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,200
I mean, there are some left over there.

1688
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:40,160
Go get them.

1689
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:41,760
This one's okay.

1690
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:42,680
Rock, paper, scissors.

1691
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:43,360
What for?

1692
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:43,880
Just for fun.

1693
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:44,440
Rock, paper, scissors.

1694
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:44,560
Aren't we just waiting?

1695
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:45,520
Aren't we just waiting?

1696
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:47,880
I'm really good at rock, paper, scissors.

1697
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:50,320
Rock, paper, scissors.

1698
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:51,960
Paper.

1699
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,240
Okay, rock, paper, scissors.

1700
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:55,920
Paper.

1701
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:10,640
I think this machine

1702
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,040
is acting a bit weird today.

1703
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:13,560
See, something's off with it.

1704
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:14,960
It didn't even finish the countdown.

1705
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:18,480
Can't look at it.

1706
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:20,120
This one's pretty good.

1707
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:21,560
No, let's not take photos today.

1708
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:22,720
Wait until the machine works.

1709
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:24,840
Alright, I'll do as you say.

1710
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:27,040
Whatever you say goes.

1711
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:30,920
I'll go get that photo later.

1712
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:32,440
No way.

1713
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:33,080
Frame it.

1714
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:37,720
The air outside is so fresh.

1715
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:39,240
The air outside is really fresh.

1716
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:41,760
Yuxing and Chichi

1717
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:43,040
How do you feel today?

1718
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:45,000
Feels like

1719
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,240
Cooking felt pretty rushed.

1720
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:51,320
But everyone made delicious food.

1721
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:55,400
But I really think, for my first time

1722
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:56,440
making spicy stir-fried pork,

1723
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:57,720
it turned out really tasty.

1724
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:59,040
I don't know what you think.

1725
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:00,560
It was pretty good.

1726
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,840
Since you said you love spicy food,

1727
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:04,520
I added a lot of chili peppers.

1728
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,560
Such a sweet spicy stir-fried pork.

1729
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:11,680
Why are you laughing?

1730
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:12,680
Nothing.

1731
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:13,840
Just

1732
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:14,680
Just what?

1733
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,520
Aren't you going to share with me?

1734
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,560
You want to say something but hold back.

1735
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:23,040
Why are you

1736
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:23,640
smiling to yourself?

1737
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:26,240
You're kind of

1738
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:27,840
You're kind of

1739
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:28,360
"bad."

1740
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:30,960
You're a little "bad."

1741
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:33,760
You're kind of

1742
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:34,280
"bad."

1743
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:38,680
What do you think about tonight,

1744
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,720
like everyone's questions?

1745
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:41,880
How were they?

1746
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:43,680
They were all pretty good questions.

1747
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:47,680
Do you have any questions?

1748
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:51,080
Feels like she has a lot she wants to ask him.

1749
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:52,720
Yeah, it's just

1750
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:55,360
because what I want to say is,

1751
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:57,640
when we're together,

1752
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:02,320
if everyone has their own ideas,

1753
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:03,280
then

1754
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:05,760
it's easy to get off track.

1755
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,080
What does that mean?

1756
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,080
Well, I think my thoughts

1757
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:17,680
are getting clearer from being vague.

1758
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:24,200
So what do you think now?

1759
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:31,600
I feel like I don't know how to handle it.

1760
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,120
That's really conflicting.

1761
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:39,680
Chichi,

1762
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:45,600
It's okay if you don't want to talk.

1763
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:52,440
I think I'm even more, you know, than you.

1764
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:53,320
So conflicted.

1765
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:55,000
Yeah, how did it end up like this?

1766
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
It's weird, this isn't me.

1767
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:58,840
See, she's conflicted now.

1768
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:00,400
Her smile today

1769
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,200
is totally different from on the train.

1770
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:06,000
It's fine, I think

1771
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:08,320
you can take your time to think.

1772
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,200
Figure it out.

1773
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:10,920
That's enough.

1774
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:18,480
I'm starting to feel like their pace

1775
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:19,640
isn't quite in sync anymore.

1776
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:22,760
I just sensed it from their eyes.

1777
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:23,560
I could feel it.

1778
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:25,480
Like, during dinner,

1779
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,520
after Zihan did something,

1780
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,120
after his actions,

1781
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:31,120
Chichi's eyes

1782
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:32,000
were shining.

1783
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,080
But when they walked the dog at night,

1784
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,680
the light in Chichi's eyes was gone.

1785
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:38,760
So it's really just at this point

1786
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,320
I think maybe Chichi

1787
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:41,800
her inner scale

1788
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:44,880
is shifting a little.

1789
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:46,200
Every time Yuxing

1790
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,880
spends time alone with Chichi,

1791
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:50,200
Chichi is actually pretty satisfied.

1792
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,040
But once

1793
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:51,680
they're in a

1794
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:52,400
situation with other people

1795
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:53,360
present,

1796
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:54,920
Chichi gets a bit

1797
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:56,520
less satisfied with Yuxing's behavior.

1798
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:58,400
It's not as pleasing.

1799
01:12:58,400 --> 01:12:58,960
I think

1800
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:00,160
today's meeting

1801
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:01,080
will have an impact.

1802
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:01,280
Because

1803
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:03,440
in the end, it's all about personality.

1804
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:06,960
Only compatible personalities can spark things.

1805
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:13,400
What's wrong?

1806
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:15,480
Who did they see?

1807
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:17,080
Which way should we go?

1808
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:18,080
Which way should we go?

1809
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:18,600
Yifan.

1810
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:19,360
So awkward.

1811
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,520
Feels like we're about to run into them.

1812
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:23,360
Should I keep

1813
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:24,320
what kind of expression

1814
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:25,280
when we meet?

1815
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:27,240
Turn around.

1816
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:27,680
Run into them.

1817
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:28,320
Run into them.

1818
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:28,840
That's fine too.

1819
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:29,320
Doesn't matter anymore.

1820
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:31,120
Turning around is too awkward.

1821
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:31,720
Hello.

1822
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:33,200
Looks like they've already pooped.

1823
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:34,720
Really? Did you already walk them?

1824
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:36,400
I cleaned up once already.

1825
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:37,560
They've already pooped.

1826
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:38,040
Really.

1827
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:45,720
This doesn't feel good.

1828
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:48,200
Sometimes I just feel like my emotions

1829
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:51,960
are out of control.

1830
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:06,520
Why does it feel like after this meal

1831
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:09,920
everyone's gotten a bit

1832
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:13,560
weird.

1833
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:15,600
Yeah, it will have an impact.

1834
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:34,840
I'm tired.

1835
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:38,160
Yifan.

1836
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:39,440
Really disappointed.

1837
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:00,080
Educated

1838
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:14,880
She was inspired by the book title.

1839
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:15,720
She was inspired by the book title.

1840
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:16,200
Yeah.

1841
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:17,680
She wants to fly to her mountain.

1842
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:25,760
What?

1843
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:27,080
The little train?

1844
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:27,880
Yeah.

1845
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:28,840
Little train.

1846
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:29,840
The little train is coming.

1847
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:35,800
So brave.

1848
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:37,200
She must really like it.

1849
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,640
Really brave.

1850
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:43,960
Take action when it's time.

1851
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:46,200
Whether there's a chance or not.

1852
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:47,080
Just give it a try.

1853
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:50,240
One-on-one deep talk.

1854
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:08,040
Yours.

1855
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:08,760
It's here.

1856
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:10,480
Yuxing.

1857
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:13,520
What?

1858
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:14,320
What's wrong?

1859
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:17,280
What's wrong?

1860
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:18,800
What?

1861
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:19,880
What's sneaking around?

1862
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:21,960
Little train.

1863
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:29,640
About that thing of yours today,

1864
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:30,520
Do you want to bring mosquito repellent?

1865
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:32,560
Should we bring some cookies?

1866
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:35,280
Are you worried she'll get hungry?

1867
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:36,720
No, just have it ready.

1868
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:38,640
Because we don't know who it is.

1869
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:40,880
How could I not know who it is?

1870
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,040
You know who it is.

1871
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:43,640
He knows.

1872
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:49,680
Let's go.

1873
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:56,400
I really hope they get a clear answer.

1874
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:59,520
Yuxing needs to make his feelings clear here.

1875
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,800
I'm getting nervous too.

1876
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:07,200
They're here.

1877
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:12,200
Hello.

1878
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,240
I didn't pay attention at all today.

1879
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:22,800
About the key thing.

1880
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:28,080
By the time you notice, it'll be too late.

1881
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:29,880
So when was it?

1882
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:32,240
When no one was paying attention.

1883
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:33,600
You even took a book.

1884
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:36,080
This book isn't really important.

1885
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,960
But I think it's pretty interesting.

1886
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:40,160
It matches how I'm feeling right now.

1887
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:43,240
Educated.

1888
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:43,840
Yes.

1889
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:45,600
That's what I thought when I saw it.

1890
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,400
It touched me a little.

1891
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:52,280
Sit here? Is it this one?

1892
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:58,160
We're starting.

1893
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:07,280
Should we open this?

1894
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:11,120
I looked at your questions too.

1895
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,200
But I feel like so many questions,

1896
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:14,160
I think we've already

1897
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:15,520
answered a lot of them before.

1898
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:16,600
Yeah, you've said a lot.

1899
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:17,400
I've said a lot too.

1900
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:19,840
I feel like I've answered a lot already.

1901
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:23,280
They actually know us pretty well.

1902
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:24,240
Yeah.

1903
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,920
I do have a small question though.

1904
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:32,960
Do you think your

1905
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:34,200
seat at dinner tonight

1906
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:36,200
was chosen from your heart?

1907
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,360
She really cares about this.

1908
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:41,760
It was from my heart.

1909
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:44,080
When you sat down later,

1910
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:47,520
I did feel a little nervous.

1911
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:52,760
It's not like I had to sit next to you.

1912
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:53,640
Sitting across is fine too.

1913
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:56,000
It's more direct for eye contact.

1914
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:57,360
Yeah, I noticed today

1915
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,560
you and your friends had a lot of

1916
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:00,640
little gestures.

1917
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,200
I thought it was pretty fun.

1918
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:04,800
A lot of my friends are like that too.

1919
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:07,040
Everyone's just really straightforward.

1920
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:09,800
If friends are similar,

1921
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:11,040
then what do you think

1922
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,400
about couples?

1923
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:14,520
Great question, really good.

1924
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:16,640
Actually, before,

1925
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,240
when the four of us had dinner,

1926
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,600
Lanlan asked me a question.

1927
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:21,400
She meant,

1928
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:23,480
when did I start liking you?

1929
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,480
I think it was that time with the mop.

1930
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:32,600
Washing it at night before going back.

1931
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:34,480
Just like that.

1932
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:36,240
Absorbing some rainwater.

1933
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:37,640
We're real geniuses.

1934
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:38,400
Yeah.

1935
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:42,000
Like that.

1936
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:44,680
Or this.

1937
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:46,760
Those weird little moments moved her.

1938
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:47,760
That, yeah.

1939
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:52,480
She wanted to get to know me then.

1940
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:53,480
And found out

1941
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:54,680
my way of thinking

1942
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:56,320
is actually a lot like yours.

1943
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:57,120
Yes.

1944
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:00,560
So maybe that's

1945
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,320
why I'm more

1946
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:06,160
certain about this.

1947
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:20,000
If it were a few days ago,

1948
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,600
I probably wouldn't have been able to say it clearly.

1949
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:23,480
But things have changed these past two days.

1950
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:25,160
These two days, I can't.

1951
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:26,760
I can't wrong myself.

1952
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:31,960
Why? What's the reason?

1953
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:32,720
I just want to

1954
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:33,600
give you a nudge.

1955
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,160
give you a nudge.

1956
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:40,480
I think I can understand how you feel.

1957
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:42,560
And some of your current emotions.

1958
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:45,840
When we first got to know each other,

1959
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,000
if I realized

1960
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,240
some of my actions or behaviors

1961
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:49,960
might hurt you, I would also

1962
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:52,560
feel quite guilty.

1963
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:53,000
feel quite remorseful.

1964
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,240
So I wouldn't do certain things.

1965
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:05,760
I just don't like to hurt others on purpose.

1966
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:08,800
Even if

1967
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:14,000
it's accidental or indirect, I still don't want to.

1968
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:15,880
Kind person.

1969
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:33,200
I don't know what you're thinking now.

1970
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:35,280
Is it clear?

1971
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:37,680
Or is it firm?

1972
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:38,880
That's very important.

1973
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:41,800
I think you're someone who

1974
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:43,920
expresses emotions very openly.

1975
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:46,720
Because honestly, I don't know why,

1976
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:47,600
but when I first met you,

1977
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:48,960
I actually felt

1978
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:52,720
I really wanted to be friends with you.

1979
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,400
Really wanted to be friends with you.

1980
01:21:58,400 --> 01:21:59,120
I said it.

1981
01:21:59,120 --> 01:21:59,320
I said it.

1982
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:00,120
I said it.

1983
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:01,120
I also really want to be friends with you.

1984
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:02,200
I also really want to be friends with you.

1985
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:04,320
Direct rejection.

1986
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:12,320
So you

1987
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:12,920
So can I

1988
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:14,200
understand that you mean

1989
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:17,400
just friends?

1990
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:19,240
Or would you also choose

1991
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:21,320
She's still holding on.

1992
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:34,800
To be honest, I think

1993
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:40,120
being friends

1994
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:43,320
would be my choice.

1995
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,240
It hurts so much.

1996
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:55,000
Even though it's painful,

1997
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,200
but

1998
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:57,720
thank you for giving me closure.

1999
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:05,040
Because I think I'm someone

2000
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:06,240
who, if I feel

2001
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:08,640
we're only going to be friends,

2002
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:10,480
I wouldn't have

2003
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:11,960
any other thoughts from the start.

2004
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:14,560
Okay.

2005
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:17,960
If it were me,

2006
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:19,200
and I felt

2007
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:22,840
he's someone I'd ideally want to be with

2008
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:24,680
or choose as a partner,

2009
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:26,800
I would hold onto

2010
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,640
my thoughts and my determination

2011
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,520
and make my choice.

2012
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:45,760
The train has arrived.

2013
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:54,680
It's over.

2014
01:23:59,080 --> 01:23:59,880
So

2015
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:03,600
will you always stick to

2016
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:06,120
just being friends,

2017
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:07,920
or will you try

2018
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,680
to be

2019
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,280
moved by someone's unwavering affection?

2020
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,360
She wants a more definite answer.

2021
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:20,200
Yes.

2022
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:21,000
I

2023
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:24,600
Or are you still thinking about it now?

2024
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,080
Actually, I

2025
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:31,240
I really hope to be

2026
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:32,720
friends with you.

2027
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:40,080
I think

2028
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:41,600
the chance of that changing is

2029
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:45,360
99.99% unlikely.

2030
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:49,400
99.99% unlikely.

2031
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:56,560
I think I

2032
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:57,880
am not someone who wants to miss out.

2033
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:01,080
I'll give it a try.

2034
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:02,480
I'll give it a try.

2035
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:06,200
She still doesn't want to let go.

2036
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:08,240
Brave girl.

2037
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:09,360
She really is a brave girl.

2038
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:10,560
She's so brave.

2039
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:12,520
I'll give it a try.

2040
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:14,520
I'll give it a try.

2041
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:44,040
Really brave.

2042
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:44,840
It's wonderful.

2043
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,000
For Yifan,

2044
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:47,160
all along this journey,

2045
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:48,080
I've already bravely

2046
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:49,680
expressed my love.

2047
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:51,320
I want to

2048
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:51,960
get an

2049
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:53,320
answer I truly want.

2050
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:54,560
Whatever that answer is,

2051
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,680
I can accept it.

2052
01:25:56,280 --> 01:25:58,080
But I have to try my best.

2053
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:00,000
Even if it's just 0.01.

2054
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:00,680
Then for this,

2055
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:01,480
I'll still go for it.

2056
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:04,280
I think Yuxing's

2057
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:06,080
99.99 percent

2058
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,840
basically means 100 percent.

2059
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:10,480
Just the tiniest step.

2060
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:11,240
Because his style

2061
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:12,160
is clearly not someone who

2062
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:14,160
says extreme things.

2063
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:15,640
That's just how we are.

2064
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:16,840
He's obviously not like that.

2065
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:17,120
Yeah.

2066
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:19,760
He wouldn't hurt anyone.

2067
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:22,800
He stays gentle whenever he can.

2068
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:24,760
Actually, I think

2069
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:25,680
the two of them,

2070
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,320
what they did this time

2071
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:28,080
was pretty good.

2072
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:29,480
They followed their hearts.

2073
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:30,440
Did the

2074
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:31,280
best they could.

2075
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:32,320
Reply.

2076
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:35,200
Just like Yifan's

2077
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:36,000
question earlier.

2078
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,120
If you get

2079
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:38,160
rejected by your crush,

2080
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:39,480
can you still be friends?

2081
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:41,480
Because from the start,

2082
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:42,520
I had "ulterior motives."

2083
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:45,160
So,

2084
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:46,400
I never saw you as just a friend.

2085
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:48,600
My friends are just friends.

2086
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:49,560
A crush

2087
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:50,520
is just a crush.

2088
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:51,040
Friends won't

2089
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:51,880
become my lover.

2090
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:54,160
Same for me.

2091
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:55,040
I absolutely can't go back.

2092
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:55,920
I'm not that desperate for friends.

2093
01:26:58,360 --> 01:26:59,440
I have too many friends, thank you.

2094
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:01,640
I won't take it back.

2095
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:05,000
Can you go back to being friends?

2096
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:06,680
I really like the other person.

2097
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:07,440
But the other person

2098
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:08,480
doesn't like me.

2099
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:09,120
Then I think

2100
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:10,400
keeping someone like that

2101
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:11,920
by your side, what's the point?

2102
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:13,000
For your future,

2103
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:13,800
everyone else

2104
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:14,800
would be treated unfairly.

2105
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:16,960
That's a good perspective.

2106
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:19,560
Let the past stay in the past.

2107
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:20,720
I think in some ways

2108
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:22,480
I might be like Yifan

2109
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:24,200
and feel

2110
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:25,240
like I want to try harder.

2111
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:25,960
Really.

2112
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:27,800
Even for a 0.01 chance, you'd fight for it.

2113
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:28,840
Because at this point,

2114
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:30,000
I don't think she's

2115
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:30,880
looking for a result.

2116
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:32,520
It's just

2117
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:33,720
for herself,

2118
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:35,400
to give herself closure.

2119
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:36,920
So she won't regret it.

2120
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:38,000
Yeah.

2121
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:40,120
I can, no problem.

2122
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:41,200
Let's just go back to being friends.

2123
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:41,800
I've let it go.

2124
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:42,440
It's like this—

2125
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:44,040
just to show I'm fine.

2126
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:45,040
See, I'm relaxed.

2127
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:47,120
Our audience friends

2128
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:47,760
can also go

2129
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:48,760
on Weibo and use the hashtag.

2130
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:50,560
Rejected by your crush,

2131
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:52,400
can you go back to being friends?

2132
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:53,280
Feel free to share your thoughts.

2133
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:54,040
Our official Weibo

2134
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:55,800
will interact with everyone in real time.

2135
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:57,320
You might get noticed.

2136
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:59,440
and win surprise prizes.

2137
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:00,520
So tonight,

2138
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:01,640
the little train

2139
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:03,240
carried a lot of stories.

2140
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:04,400
For the two of them,

2141
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:05,400
it must be

2142
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:08,200
a truly unforgettable

2143
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:09,120
night in the Heartbeat Apartment.

2144
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:09,960
night.

2145
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:10,920
Next,

2146
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:12,160
how will our love stories

2147
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:13,760
continue to unfold?

2148
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,360
Everyone, let's watch together.

2149
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:22,720
I want to talk to you.

2150
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,000
Sure.

2151
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:29,240
Zihan came to find Chichi.

2152
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:32,720
I didn't really tidy up.

2153
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:37,800
Just moved the clothes from the sofa

2154
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:39,120
to the chair.

2155
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:45,000
You go first.

2156
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:45,840
Okay.

2157
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:46,440
I'll go first.

2158
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:47,120
You go first.

2159
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:50,600
I read your letter.

2160
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:51,920
Actually, that night on the way back from the date,

2161
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:53,120
I was really startled.

2162
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:00,160
Got it.

2163
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:02,240
How should I put it?

2164
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:03,160
I really did arrive at the Heartbeat Apartment

2165
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:04,480
quite late.

2166
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:05,640
Even though I told you that day,

2167
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:08,240
I was honestly feeling anxious.

2168
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:11,120
And you said

2169
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:12,960
you're someone who moves fast.

2170
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:13,920
So I was worried

2171
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:14,520
that

2172
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:16,640
I couldn't keep up with everyone.

2173
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:19,760
So I might have acted impulsively.

2174
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:20,800
And I know

2175
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:24,040
it must have put a lot of pressure on you.

2176
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,040
I felt that too.

2177
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:27,120
But honestly,

2178
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:28,920
the way I expressed myself on our date

2179
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:31,920
or my own mindset

2180
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:33,760
wasn't well managed.

2181
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:37,880
So today,

2182
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:39,520
I really wanted to talk face-to-face

2183
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:41,840
and clear things up with you.

2184
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:44,400
Is this what you wanted to talk about too?

2185
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:45,040
Yes.

2186
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:49,560
I was just worried things were moving too slowly.

2187
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:51,640
No, actually at that time

2188
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:53,000
we were all

2189
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,640
moving at about the same pace.

2190
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:55,320
Everyone was.

2191
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:57,040
Everyone in the apartment was about the same.

2192
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:58,760
When you try to hold onto something

2193
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:00,240
too tightly,

2194
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:01,240
others might feel

2195
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:02,320
a lot of pressure.

2196
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:04,000
I understand.

2197
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:05,680
Because what you're afraid of

2198
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:07,360
is that if you let go even a little,

2199
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:08,720
it'll slip away.

2200
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:09,520
It'll be gone.

2201
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:11,440
But for others,

2202
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:13,120
it might become invisible pressure.

2203
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,240
It's mutual.

2204
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:15,240
Yeah.

2205
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:17,440
So I think maybe

2206
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:19,520
I hadn't really thought this through before.

2207
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:22,680
I hope you don't take it to heart.

2208
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:24,920
He solves problems by eating together.

2209
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:27,520
Their way of resolving conflicts really matches.

2210
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:28,440
Very action-oriented.

2211
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:29,160
Seriously.

2212
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:30,280
For real.

2213
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:31,160
These past couple of days,

2214
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:32,480
I think both of us

2215
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:34,600
didn't know how to face each other.

2216
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:38,320
There was a bit of awkwardness between us.

2217
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:39,160
Yeah.

2218
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:40,720
Really? I didn't feel that.

2219
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:41,160
You didn't?

2220
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:41,560
No.

2221
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:42,320
Then I didn't either.

2222
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:47,480
That's great.

2223
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:48,520
Relax.

2224
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:49,960
I think maybe there's still a bit

2225
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:50,720
of tension, right?

2226
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:02,240
So...

2227
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:08,800
So...

2228
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:12,880
What's up?

2229
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:17,120
So would you be willing

2230
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:19,040
to go out with me again?

2231
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:22,040
Wait, what's going on?

2232
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:23,160
This is...

2233
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:24,600
Is that okay?

2234
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:25,320
Or...

2235
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:26,200
This is...

2236
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:30,320
This is my chance.

2237
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:31,440
Really?

2238
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:34,000
How do you have another chance like this?

2239
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:37,720
Yeah.

2240
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:47,360
His

2241
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:48,040
park time.

2242
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:48,800
Park time.

2243
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:52,160
He has this opportunity.

2244
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:54,120
It's about to start.

2245
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:56,120
Impressive.

2246
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:05,760
Awesome.

2247
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:06,880
That's a big plus.

2248
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:07,800
I really want

2249
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:09,560
to seize the opportunity.

2250
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:14,720
I'm actually pretty action-oriented.

2251
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,000
You were the one who took that.

2252
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:19,600
The pinwheel.

2253
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:20,120
Really?

2254
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:33,160
Really.

2255
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:33,840
Don't

2256
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:34,800
feel any pressure.

2257
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:37,480
We can just talk.

2258
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:39,400
Just chatting is fine.

2259
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:39,880
Yeah.

2260
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:46,280
I think everyone is still

2261
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:48,600
getting to know each other.

2262
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:50,000
And then

2263
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,760
Does she mean she doesn't want to go?

2264
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,880
We can get to know each other more.

2265
01:33:01,640 --> 01:33:02,440
What do you mean?

2266
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:03,320
So is it

2267
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:06,840
okay or not?

2268
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:08,360
It's okay.

2269
01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:09,000
It's fine.

2270
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:09,720
Sure.

2271
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:14,360
Things have taken a turn.

2272
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,520
Isn't this fate coming together?

2273
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:21,720
Actually, during this time

2274
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:23,240
he's been quite touching.

2275
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:23,600
Yes.

2276
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:26,440
He's really trying.

2277
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:28,280
This Xiao Liu

2278
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:29,920
The direction of these three

2279
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:30,920
is a bit unclear.

2280
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:32,680
This group is the most confusing.

2281
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:33,160
Yeah.

2282
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:34,680
But Yuxing's

2283
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:35,680
is getting clearer and clearer.

2284
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:36,280
Right.

2285
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:37,600
But with Chichi,

2286
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:38,440
it's getting blurry again.

2287
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:39,240
Yeah.

2288
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:41,080
Go ahead, say it.

2289
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:42,160
And Zihan,

2290
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:42,960
has another chance.

2291
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:43,440
Yeah.

2292
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:43,960
So do you think

2293
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:47,280
it's because Zihan is working hard

2294
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:50,160
or because Yuxing isn't clear enough?

2295
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:51,160
I think this move is bold.

2296
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:52,080
It's because

2297
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:53,400
of Zihan's "triple action."

2298
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:55,400
"Triple action."

2299
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:57,280
First, wrote a letter.

2300
01:33:57,280 --> 01:33:59,840
Then made the dinner crystal clear.

2301
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:01,640
And ended with the windmill move.

2302
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:03,800
This "triple action,"

2303
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:06,560
anyone would need a moment to process.

2304
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:08,920
I have a slightly different opinion.

2305
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:12,240
I think the difference is

2306
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:13,840
when he was taking a walk with her,

2307
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:15,120
and then

2308
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:17,640
he felt

2309
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:19,080
Chichi still didn't say some things.

2310
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:21,640
So she didn't feel

2311
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:23,760
that Yuxing's attitude was more determined.

2312
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:25,920
So now, after Zihan gave her so much,

2313
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:27,240
she starts to feel

2314
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:30,240
that Yuxing's determination

2315
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:31,520
came a bit late.

2316
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:31,840
Yeah.

2317
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:34,320
Chichi said, "I'm fast,"

2318
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:35,440
"Yuxing, you're slow."

2319
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:36,720
But I think

2320
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:39,440
both Chichi and Zihan are fast.

2321
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:41,320
Their way of interacting

2322
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:43,120
and communicating is quite similar.

2323
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:44,880
I think in the end,

2324
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:45,720
how do we see

2325
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:46,240
their

2326
01:34:46,240 --> 01:34:47,000
emotional connection?

2327
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:47,680
It depends on

2328
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:48,760
tonight's

2329
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:50,800
heart-fluttering messages.

2330
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,720
Will they be affected?

2331
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:54,320
Alright, next

2332
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:55,720
we're moving into this episode's

2333
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:56,520
deduction moment.

2334
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:58,240
Yuxing doesn't need to think much, right?

2335
01:34:58,240 --> 01:34:59,160
It's definitely Chichi.

2336
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:00,280
That's obvious.

2337
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:01,480
As for Lechen,

2338
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:02,000
Luyuan.

2339
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:02,960
Lechen and Luyuan.

2340
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:03,760
Lechen and Luyuan.

2341
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:04,320
Luyuan.

2342
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:04,880
No problem.

2343
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:06,080
Ruilong and Duoduo.

2344
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:07,280
Ruilong.

2345
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:08,240
Wang Jue.

2346
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:10,800
Wang Jue switched.

2347
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:12,080
I think Wang Jue

2348
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:14,080
I also think it's Wang Jue.

2349
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:15,080
I think it's Duoduo.

2350
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:16,720
I think after the last meal,

2351
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:17,880
Duoduo has completely let go.

2352
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:18,880
Will he check on her?

2353
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:20,480
Because he knows she's feeling down.

2354
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:21,640
Alright.

2355
01:35:21,640 --> 01:35:22,480
Next.

2356
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:22,960
Okay.

2357
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:23,800
Next one.

2358
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:25,640
Dr. Fang must choose Lanlan.

2359
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:27,360
That's tough.

2360
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:28,680
It's tough and so "Lan".

2361
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:31,200
So "Lan".

2362
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:31,840
That's way too "Lan".

2363
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:32,120
Little Jiao.

2364
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:32,520
So "Lan".

2365
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:35,240
Way too "Lan".

2366
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:36,280
Both of them are "Lan".

2367
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:37,720
It's really Lanlan.

2368
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:38,680
Zihan.

2369
01:35:38,680 --> 01:35:39,880
So "Chi".

2370
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:42,080
So "Chi", that's super "Chi".

2371
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:44,040
"Chichi's Zihan."

2372
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:45,200
Alright.

2373
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:46,640
Let's put Ruilong last.

2374
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:47,280
Okay.

2375
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:48,000
Wang Jue.

2376
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,240
Wang Jue chooses Ruilong.

2377
01:35:49,240 --> 01:35:50,960
I think that's spot on.

2378
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:52,640
The next one is a bit tricky.

2379
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:54,960
I think she'll pick Chenchen.

2380
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:56,120
I think so too.

2381
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:57,240
Makes sense.

2382
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:00,440
Luyuan and Lechen.

2383
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:03,760
Lanlan.

2384
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:05,040
Probably Xiao Fang.

2385
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:09,040
Is anyone stopping by Little Jiao?

2386
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:09,600
No.

2387
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:10,760
Go take a look at Little Jiao.

2388
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:11,480
No, I won't.

2389
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:14,920
Your curve is really twisted.

2390
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:17,080
I think Yifan is also one.

2391
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:18,400
Still that 0.01.

2392
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:19,360
0.1.

2393
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:20,480
One hundred percent.

2394
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:21,680
Chichi.

2395
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:23,760
I think it could also be that one.

2396
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:24,360
Zihan.

2397
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:25,200
Zihan?

2398
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:26,280
I still think it's Yuxing.

2399
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:27,600
I think it's Yuxing too.

2400
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:28,720
Then majority rules.

2401
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:29,760
Let's go with Yuxing.

2402
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:32,960
There's also Ruilong.

2403
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:33,880
Xu, you just decide.

2404
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:35,000
I think we should go with your choice.

2405
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,280
Right, because it's a tie now.

2406
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:36,760
Yeah.

2407
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:38,200
Whoever you pick, that's it.

2408
01:36:40,240 --> 01:36:40,920
Duoduo.

2409
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:41,280
Okay.

2410
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:41,640
Okay.

2411
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:42,240
Duoduo.

2412
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:49,680
When jasmine blooms, it's a sign of attraction.

2413
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:50,640
Next, we move on to

2414
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:53,560
Master Kong Jasmine Tea's refreshing moment of attraction.

2415
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:54,960
Everyone,

2416
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:56,000
Let's reveal

2417
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,600
tonight's attraction messages.

2418
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:01,120
First, we'll announce

2419
01:37:01,120 --> 01:37:02,680
all the girls' attraction connections.

2420
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:06,720
Are they all correct?

2421
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:07,920
Chichi picked Yuxing, that's right.

2422
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:10,240
All correct.

2423
01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:11,040
Okay.

2424
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:12,080
The boys.

2425
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:19,000
Who did Ruilong send it to?

2426
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:22,680
Ru Lan.

2427
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:23,760
Seriously?

2428
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:25,080
Who did Ruilong send it to?

2429
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:25,920
Ru Lan.

2430
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:27,360
He sent it to Lanlan.

2431
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:28,400
No way.

2432
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:29,400
I can't see it.

2433
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:33,200
I know which moment it was.

2434
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:34,680
They were sitting there.

2435
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:36,600
She helped him analyze his thoughts.

2436
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:38,520
She mapped out a plan for him.

2437
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:39,880
He might not be interested.

2438
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:42,280
I know he was just thanking Lanlan.

2439
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:43,720
He probably just wanted to thank Lanlan.

2440
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:45,880
Can't we just say thanks when we pass by?

2441
01:37:45,880 --> 01:37:47,480
Just say thank you, that's enough.

2442
01:37:47,480 --> 01:37:48,680
Why send a message?

2443
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:49,480
Look.

2444
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:50,360
See for yourself.

2445
01:37:50,360 --> 01:37:50,600
See for yourself.

2446
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:51,480
I think so too.

2447
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:52,360
Come on, let's check.

2448
01:37:52,360 --> 01:37:53,400
Our crush messages.

2449
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:54,440
What's written in them?

2450
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:58,560
It made me happy to see you playing the guqin.

2451
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:01,680
I don't know what to say.

2452
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:03,320
If you're tired, sleep early. Good night.

2453
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:06,440
The spring noodles in the morning.

2454
01:38:06,440 --> 01:38:07,800
The non-spicy tofu soup.

2455
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:09,560
And the braised rice were so delicious.

2456
01:38:09,560 --> 01:38:10,920
All these are heartwarming details.

2457
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:13,000
I know you're noticing my details.

2458
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:15,000
So sweet.

2459
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:18,640
The crayfish you promised and delivered.

2460
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:20,200
Even tastier than I imagined.

2461
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:23,720
Every morning,

2462
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:27,320
I regain my emotional stability.

2463
01:38:27,320 --> 01:38:28,800
But when I face you,

2464
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:30,760
I can't control my emotions.

2465
01:38:30,760 --> 01:38:32,360
I'm not the most composed person.

2466
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:35,800
I realized we don't know each other well.

2467
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:37,160
It's really not much.

2468
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:40,960
Even though we think

2469
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:43,320
we don't understand each other,

2470
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:44,920
or we both have

2471
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:46,560
conflicting thoughts,

2472
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:48,320
I'm still happy

2473
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:49,760
to get to know you in the limited time we have.

2474
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:51,640
I'll try every way to understand you.

2475
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:56,280
I'll listen carefully to my own heart.

2476
01:38:59,000 --> 01:38:59,720
Thank you.

2477
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:01,360
For tonight's deep talk.

2478
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:04,120
Even though I'm still a bit confused,

2479
01:39:04,120 --> 01:39:08,520
I'll see if I can work on myself first.

2480
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:09,840
And think about my next step.

2481
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:10,960
It's a thank you.

2482
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:11,680
Just a thank you.

2483
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:16,840
Today I listened to you seriously guiding others.

2484
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:18,960
Next time I'll bring a little stool.

2485
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:23,080
May your wishes come true.

2486
01:39:23,080 --> 01:39:23,800
Wish you

2487
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:27,320
to untangle your worries.

2488
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:29,120
Let's start getting to know each other again.

2489
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:31,520
Ruilong's thank you letter is really...

2490
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:33,760
They should just

2491
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:35,000
add each other on WeChat.

2492
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:35,920
I really don't get it.

2493
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:37,120
Why send a message?

2494
01:39:37,120 --> 01:39:37,640
Yeah.

2495
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,520
No more thank you letters from now on.

2496
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,000
We're still pretty awesome.

2497
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,320
We got eleven

2498
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:43,520
crush stones.

2499
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:46,360
We're awesome.

2500
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:47,560
We're awesome.

2501
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,080
Your skin looks amazing lately.

2502
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:54,760
Because I've been using

2503
01:39:54,760 --> 01:39:57,000
Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair Serum.

2504
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,680
I've used it for several days in a row.

2505
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:00,640
I use one dropper every night before bed.

2506
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:02,320
Even if I stay up late,

2507
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:04,080
my skin gets to rest first.

2508
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:05,480
So when I wake up the next morning,

2509
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:07,160
my skin is even more

2510
01:40:07,160 --> 01:40:08,560
firm, bouncy, and radiant.

2511
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:10,320
It really looks great.

2512
01:40:14,680 --> 01:40:16,840
Our heartwarming stories for this week

2513
01:40:16,840 --> 01:40:18,080
come to an end here.

2514
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:18,960
I think today

2515
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:20,720
was truly eventful.

2516
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:23,720
There was so much beauty here,

2517
01:40:23,720 --> 01:40:25,480
so much uncertainty,

2518
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:27,200
and also a touch of magic.

2519
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:28,760
And plenty of anticipation.

2520
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:30,880
Because of anticipation,

2521
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:32,120
part of it

2522
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:33,200
is about

2523
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:34,880
Zihan's park time.

2524
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:36,400
During this process,

2525
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:36,480
during this journey,

2526
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:38,040
what new

2527
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:38,640
stories will unfold?

2528
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:40,600
When jasmine blooms, it's a sign of romance.

2529
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:41,320
This show is sponsored by

2530
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:44,000

01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:04,320
We'll continue the romance next week.

2542
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:50,200
Hello

2543
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:51,360
What?

2544
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:52,400
Park time

2545
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:54,160
The mystery person is

2546
01:41:54,160 --> 01:41:55,680
The mystery person is actually me

2547
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:56,760
Me

2548
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:58,280
So mysterious

2549
01:41:58,280 --> 01:41:59,520
I almost guessed it

2550
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:00,960
He really pulled it off

2551
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:02,440
When you're making a wish

2552
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:03,560
You can come to me too

2553
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:05,360
Bro, you make it so ceremonial

2554
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:08,120
Top tier

2555
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:08,920
Pretty impressive

2556
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:09,840
What?

2557
01:42:10,160 --> 01:42:10,960
Light up

2558
01:42:15,400 --> 01:42:16,960
Awesome, this feeling

2559
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:19,080
It really feels like beating a game

2560
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:20,520
It just happened

2561
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:21,080
But I think

2562
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:22,560
I'm still worried

2563
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:24,880
Maybe I haven't seen the real you

2564
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:26,160
That's a deep statement

2565
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:27,800
I've been feeling a bit strange lately

2566
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:29,240
No way

2567
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:30,280
Doing this kind of thing

2568
01:42:30,280 --> 01:42:31,520
I'll talk to you later

2569
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:34,440
Fate really plays tricks

2570
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:35,040
I like someone

2571
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:36,800
I need to let her know first

2572
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:38,520
Really

2573
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:39,760
I'm good again

2574
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:40,520
Let's go for a walk

2575
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:41,560
Let's go out for a bit

2576
01:42:41,560 --> 01:42:42,400
Let's go

2577
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:43,760
How about we go see it now?

2578
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:44,480
I'm heading out first

2579
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:45,000
What?

2580
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:45,640
What are you doing?

2581
01:42:45,640 --> 01:42:46,400
He's going to get that

2582
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:47,360
It has to be mutual

2583
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:48,840
A mutual light up pairing

2584
01:42:48,840 --> 01:42:50,160
Will start an exclusive

2585
01:42:50,160 --> 01:42:51,240
For the two of them

2586
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:52,560
Trial romance trip

2587
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:53,200
Here they come

2588
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:53,680
Who?

2589
01:42:53,680 --> 01:42:54,600
Who?

2590
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,440
Game changer

2591
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:00,640
I want to cry, why?

2592
01:43:03,640 --> 01:43:04,920
Why aren't you drinking this?

2593
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:05,880
Let me try

2594
01:43:06,440 --> 01:43:08,080
It even has a coconut aroma

2595
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:10,200
Can we do it later?

2596
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:11,160
Ten o'clock

2597
01:43:13,400 --> 01:43:14,840
The dish in the cabin is the best

2598
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:15,440
I choose

2599
01:43:17,720 --> 01:43:18,840
I choose hotpot

2600
01:43:22,240 --> 01:43:23,160
Thinking about that time now

2601
01:43:23,160 --> 01:43:24,120
Do you still get nervous?

2602
01:43:24,120 --> 01:43:24,960
I'm really nervous

2603
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:25,960
Can we pause?

2604
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:28,280
I want to sit here

2605
01:43:28,280 --> 01:43:28,920
I want to sit here

2606
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:30,480
Don't say it

2607
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,920
How about we switch seats?

2608
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:37,280
Do you want to answer?

2609
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:39,840
Don't want to watch anymore

2610
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:41,240
Me neither

2611
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:42,720
Wang Lechen

2612
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:44,080
You have so many reaction memes

2613
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:46,520
Why do I have so many expressions?

2614
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:47,720
Businessman

2615
01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:50,560
Give yourself a nickname

2616
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:51,000
I'm called

2617
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:54,120
Read it five times in a row

2618
01:43:54,120 --> 01:43:54,480
Is that okay?

2619
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:56,880
I heard you danced a boy group routine last time

2620
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:58,000
I want to see

2621
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:58,840
Alright
