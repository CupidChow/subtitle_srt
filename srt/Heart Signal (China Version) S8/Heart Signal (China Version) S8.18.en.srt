1
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,120
Our Heartbeat Apartment has finally welcomed

2
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,280
its very first big group date.

3
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,440
The six girls each made a card by hand

4
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,920
related to their own interests and hobbies,

5
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,000
creating cards that reflect themselves.

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,760
Whoever picks a girl's card

7
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,680
will go on their first date with her.

8
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,400
There's definitely some fate involved.

9
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,920
Gotta go for it today.

10
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,440
Teacher Fang.

11
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:09,920
Go for it!

12
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,360
Go for it!

13
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:10,800
Go for it!

14
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,760
Now I understand the importance of this slide.

15
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,760
Hurry up and go.

16
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,400
Start choosing.

17
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,920
This one is drawn so well.

18
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,040
Just take this one.

19
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,600
He took it right away.

20
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,400
He firmly

21
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,760
decided this one is Lanlan's.

22
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,000
Then I'll choose the sunset.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,880
I choose the sunset.

24
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,120
Relax a bit.

25
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,720
Then I'll pick this one.

26
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,680
That's so sweet.

27
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,200
I can't lose.

28
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,360
Gotta protect myself.

29
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,520
I would feel

30
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,400
that prioritization

31
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:58,960
is, for me,

32
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,160
a very important thing.

33
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,120
I absolutely

34
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,000
can't stand this kind of grievance.

35
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,320
Did you see what kind of flower I picked?

36
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,520
Jasmine.

37
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:10,760
Mo

38
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,520
Li

39
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,400
Mo Li—don't leave.

40
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,480
Now I don't even

41
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,920
feel curious at all about where they are.

42
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,640
Because I think it's definitely not

43
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,280
as nice as our place here.

44
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:19,760
Yeah.

45
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,560
We're fun.

46
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,920
Such a super happy day.

47
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,400
It's been so long since I had this much fun going out.

48
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,160
Who will invite me out next time?

49
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,000
My standards are really high.

50
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,960
The two of them are in a great state too.

51
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,680
Yeah.

52
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,720
I feel like we can't quite get out of this.

53
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,840
I've spent my whole life learning

54
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,960
how to open up.

55
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,960
Then we're really complementary.

56
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,600
Here we are.

57
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,600
We're back again.

58
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,400

After a week of this

97
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,800
this agonizing

98
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,080
anticipation

99
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,200
I can't stand it anymore

100
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,960
I can't hold back

101
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,800
I'm so excited

102
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,560
So first

103
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,400
let's welcome

104
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,640
our new Cupid

105
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,400
Welcome, Shi Ce

106
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,040
Hello

107
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,520
Hello, everyone

108
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,920
My name is Shi Ce

109
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,600
and I'm an actor

110
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,200
I'm very happy to be here

111
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,400
on "Signal of the Heart"

112
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,640
I want to experience this kind of signal

113
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,120
Because of Shi Ce

114
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,000
the previous variety shows

115
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,960
also made us really like her

116
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,440
Yes

117
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,800
Let's take a look first

118
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,320
at Shi Ce's

119
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,640
love personality test (results)

120
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,040
Is that okay?

121
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,600
I'm a giving type of lover

122
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,760
Although I also hope

123
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,880
to get some response from the person I love

124
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,280
but actually

125
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,360
you enjoy the process of loving someone more

126
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,720
I hope my boyfriend

127
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,160
is like this

128
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,360
I think this is what I lack the most

129
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,280
She happens to complement me

130
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,800
So you need someone like me

131
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,920
Let's interact more today

132
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,600
And I just predicted Shi Ce

133
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,120
she will probably be amazing later

134
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,040
Don't make such predictions

135
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,600
After making a prediction

136
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,360
if you guess right

137
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,800
it becomes your prophecy

138
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:21,680
Yes

139
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,160
That's pretty good too

140
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,040
Yes

141
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,480
About the first date

142
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,120
Chun Ye

143
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,920
what impressed you the most

144
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,040
which pair was it

145
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,920
The pair that impressed me the most was

146
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,320
the giving type Yu Xing

147
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,120
and Yi Fan

148
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,440
their swing dance

149
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,560
Yifan really likes him.

150
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,360
That Yu Xing.

151
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,280
Actually, I...

152
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,160
I've had this kind of experience before.

153
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,960
For example, when I meet a girl,

154
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,960
and she's very lively,

155
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,560
I can relate to that feeling.

156
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,920
I feel my heart flutter.

157
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,960
Even though I...

158
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,680
Even though my face might look

159
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,840
awkward or embarrassed,

160
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,560
but actually,

161
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,040
I think I really

162
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,160
like this feeling.

163
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,200
So that's how it is.

164
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,760
Xu likes "forced love."

165
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,040
Do you like "forced love"?

166
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,720
Teacher Ma,

167
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,560
I can go "force love" on someone else.

168
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,080
Stop being so stubborn.

169
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,840
You're the most...

170
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,280
You're the most stubborn.

171
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,240
You're the most stubborn one.

172
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,200
I can "force love" on others.

173
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,040
But when the time comes, you'll chicken out.

174
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,080
Like a little lamb.

175
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,520
You'll be bleating every day.

176
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,960
Everyone sees him like this on the surface,

177
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,360
but I think, on the contrary,

178
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,400
when he meets someone he likes,

179
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,520
he'll show a big contrast.

180
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,120
Yeah.

181
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,600
Lanlan and Dr. Fang

182
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,720
then they string pearls for each other.

183
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,040
And when they're stringing them, their eyes...

184
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,480
It's getting stringy.

185
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,600
Hani, please share with us.

186
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,200
Ruilong and Chichi

187
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,800
Yes, I understand you.

188
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
Yes, I understand you.

189
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,520
I understand you.

190
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,240
Got it.

191
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:51,920
Let me say,

192
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:52,880
Don't get too excited.

193
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,600
Calm down for now.

194
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,360
Wait a bit before getting fired up.

195
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,960
Because the two of them make me feel

196
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,480
they're very comfortable together.

197
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,400
Especially when they started doing that...

198
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:00,520
Especially when they started doing that...

199
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:00,880
when they were boxing.

200
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,440
when they were boxing.

201
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,280
At first, we thought

202
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,840
Ruilong wouldn't get it.

203
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,040
But it turns out he's actually good at comforting girls.

204
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,280
He knows when to give in.

205
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,000
Even when they're eating hotpot,

206
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,680
I think it's a reflection of many people.

207
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,840
It's a reflection of many boys.

208
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,720
They just won't admit it.

209
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,120
Even when it's way too spicy,

210
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,360
they say, "It's not spicy, I'm fine."

211
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,240
But their eyes are tearing up.

212
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,760
I think it's really cute.

213
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,520
What impressed me most was

214
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,240
Duoduo and Lechen

215
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,680
went back to their old school together.

216
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,640
And they

217
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,800
got along really well.

218
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,520
It was so much fun.

219
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,800
So I still want to keep an eye on their follow-up.

220
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,360
Okay.

221
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,080
So our first

222
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,760
date,

223
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,240
was really wonderful.

224
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,000
Everyone also shared

225
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,360
a lot of things.

226
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,640
So our exciting

227
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,320
story

228
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,440
is about to begin.

229
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,760
Everyone, let's watch.

230
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,240
I have to leave now.

231
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,240
Okay.

232
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,640
I'll come back after my defense.

233
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,800
Lu Yuan is going to Beijing for his defense today.

234
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,800
Hello, Nicole.

235
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,080
Hello.

236
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,760
Hello.

237
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,480
Good morning.

238
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,800
Do you want breakfast?

239
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,480
Whose banana is this?

240
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,520
I took the banana.

241
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,200
You can have it.

242
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,440
There are some heated ones here.

243
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,360
These are heated in the microwave.

244
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,120
This is also ready.

245
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,800
Yes, that one is just boiled.

246
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,920
That's so considerate.

247
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,960
You like the fried ones, right?

248
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,320
Yu Xing has been secretly paying attention to her

249
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,240
needs.

250
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,880
It will burst with juice.

251
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,280
Really?

252
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,760
It's so delicious.

253
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,280
This...

254
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,120
I have to go, I'm running late.

255
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,720
Bye.

256
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,400
Bye.

257
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,560
Going to the defense.

258
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,560
Yifan.

259
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,480
Duoduo

260
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,280
Ruilong

261
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,680
Jiaxing

262
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,480
Who is this?

263
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,560
Is this a newcomer?

264
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,040
Really?

265
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,440
Those legs...

266
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,120
Here they come.

267
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,840
And the figure looks great too.

268
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,960
That's so tall.

269
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,680
Must be about 1.90, 1.88 meters tall.

270
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,440
Let me see the front!

271
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,080
Here it comes.

272
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,720
Show the front, quick!

273
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:33,960
That side profile...

274
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,240
A passionate lover type.

275
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,960
The passionate type.

276
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,200
This person...

277
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,560
I know them.

278
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,440
You know them?

279
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,840
Are you serious?

280
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,920
I used to be their client.

281
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,160
We went to Nürburgring before.

282
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:51,680
Then I went...

283
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,640
When I was on the track,

284
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,320
at that time,

285
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,200
he was the one organizing us.

286
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,640
Who is this?

287
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,480
Is this a new guest?

288
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,080
That's Chichi.

289
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,120
So beautiful.

290
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:34,920
Here they come.

291
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,800
Hello.

292
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,120
Hello.

293
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,400
They all received it.

294
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,720
But Chichi was the first to arrive.

295
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,800
So it was all the girls

296
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,040
having dinner with him alone.

297
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,040
You look so happy.

298
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,320
All the girls had dinner with him alone.

299
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,280
You're speaking too loudly.

300
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,160
That's really how it was.

301
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,520
All the girls had dinner with him alone.

302
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,240
He arrived late.

303
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,840
He needs to get to know everyone.

304
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Right.

305
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,920
If it were me, I'd be over the moon.

306
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,480
Seriously, I really would.

307
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,960
But if it were me,

308
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,280
I would feel a lot of pressure.

309
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,760
I couldn't do it, really couldn't.

310
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,280
Hello.

311
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:24,640
Hello.

312
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:26,800
Hello.

313
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,400
He's really tall.

314
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,480
Hello.

315
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,640
Liu Zihan

316
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,280
Liu Zihan

317
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:38,640
Yes

318
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,080
My name is Sun Hanqing

319
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,160
You can call me

320
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:41,800
Chichi

321
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,200
I need to remember this

322
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,240
It's easy to remember

323
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:45,560
It's easy to remember

324
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,040
The "chi" from "eating"

325
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,720
The "chi" from "eating"

326
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,520
The first time we met was for a meal

327
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,520
Eating, yes

328
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,600
Where did you come from?

329
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,480
I came from Shanghai

330
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,640
Then it must be quite far for you

331
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,680
Yes, where did you come from?

332
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,880
I also came from Shanghai today

333
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,360
I feel like this guy

334
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,880
is quite generous and talkative

335
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,600
Would you like some water?

336
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,120
Yes, please

337
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,920
Okay, thank you

338
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,240
Thank you

339
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,920
How did you get here today?

340
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:35,920
By taxi

341
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,640
I took a taxi here

342
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,640
It looks like there are six seats here

343
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,080
I don't know what time they'll arrive today either

344
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,840
We usually come late

345
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,520
What time do you usually go home?

346
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,960
Around eight or nine

347
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:54,840
I don't know

348
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,920
Before, did you guys

349
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,440
have any activities already?

350
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,920
Actually, I was late too.

351
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,360
You were late as well.

352
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,400
Yeah, I was two or three days late.

353
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,080
Then they went on a trip to an island.

354
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,400
They've already been to the island.

355
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:06,880
Right.

356
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,440
People from inland.

357
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,640
Have a certain longing for the sea.

358
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,240
You know?

359
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,080
Where are you from?

360
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:12,920
I'm from Hebei.

361
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,000
From Baoding.

362
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,520
Hebei.

363
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,400
Yeah.

364
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,600
I see.

365
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,160
Not really.

366
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:19,720
It's okay.

367
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,560
We can get to know each other better later.

368
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,160
Isn't this quite a coincidence?

369
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,520
I think it's them.

370
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,360
You're deciding too quickly.

371
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:28,760
I think...

372
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,160
The first meeting.

373
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,480
Was really nice.

374
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,600
You're only the third group of friends to come.

375
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,400
Friends.

376
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,960
You think he's a northerner.

377
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,080
Do you mean personality-wise,

378
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,800
or something else?

379
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,520
Personality, and your accent too.

380
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,800
I don't think I have an accent.

381
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,160
Really?

382
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,400
I don't think I have one.

383
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,040
No.

384
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:48,720
No.

385
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,000
Mine's pretty good.

386
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,560
My Mandarin is very standard.

387
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,960
I feel like this is a good start.

388
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,880
It seems like they started off

389
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,560
It feels like they immediately became

390
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,920
very close.

391
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,400
Yeah.

392
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,800
It's like they've found something in common.

393
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,000
You can guess where I'm from.

394
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,320
Southerner

395
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,720
Are you?

396
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,120
I am.

397
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,960
Yes, okay.

398
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,840
I'm a southerner.

399
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,040
I'm from Jiangxi.

400
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,760
Jiangxi native.

401
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,040
Jiangxi

402
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,040
Do you eat spicy food?

403
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,200
I eat spicy food.

404
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,600
But now my tolerance for spicy food

405
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,160
has decreased.

406
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,640
Me too.

407
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,960
I used to really love eating spicy food.

408
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,720
Then the doctor said

409
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,760
because you eat so much spicy food,

410
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,640
your dampness has gotten a bit heavy lately.

411
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,280
Stop eating it.

412
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,000
The dampness is a bit heavy.

413
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,080
Someone in our cabin studies Chinese medicine.

414
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,080
Really?

415
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,320
Yes.

416
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:45,600
Alright.

417
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,440
Later

418
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,200
we can ask for advice.

419
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,880
Have them take a look at me.

420
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,160
Duoduo studies Chinese medicine and acupuncture.

421
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,240
That's it, it's probably hopeless.

422
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,760
You really...

423
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,240
One second you said those two were locked in.

424
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,680
The next second you said it's hopeless.

425
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,000
After wavering many times,

426
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,400
you'll eventually reach a conclusion.

427
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,640
Right now,

428
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,360
it might really be hopeless.

429
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,640
So what do you do for work in Shanghai?

430
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,160
I used to work at a company in Beijing,

431
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,000
an automotive company.

432
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,040
Before that, I worked in sports.

433
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,720
There are a lot of sports events in Shanghai,

434
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,520
and the sports culture is quite strong here.

435
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,320
So I came to Shanghai to start my own business.

436
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,760
That's cool.

437
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,800
So cool.

438
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,560
Fitness enthusiast.

439
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,240
Impressive.

440
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,160
That's a big plus.

441
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,760
Stylish and confident.

442
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,160
So when you were at the automotive company,

443
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,920
what was your main job?

444
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,640
I worked in

445
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,960
brand marketing.

446
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,840
What do you do for work?

447
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:01,960
My previous experience

448
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,800
is quite similar to yours.

449
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,960
You also did brand marketing, right?

450
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,520
Yes, I was a management trainee.

451
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,200
Now I'm rotating through e-commerce.

452
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,440
I'm also doing brand marketing.

453
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,000
So we're pretty similar.

454
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:25,720
You...

455
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,080
What do you think my

456
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:31,560
MBTI type is?

457
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,160
Which one is it?

458
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,600
We've only exchanged a couple of sentences.

459
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,360
And you're already asking me to guess something so difficult.

460
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,480
Everyone's talking about that.

461
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,280
MBTI (the sixteen personality types test).

462
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:47,720
Right?

463
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,440
It's a good icebreaker topic.

464
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,240
I think the first letter is definitely

465
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,040
pretty easy to figure out.

466
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,520
It's quite obvious.

467
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,040
E (extrovert).

468
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,160
Is it E (extrovert)?

469
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,440
Is it E (extrovert)?

470
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,520
I'm definitely

471
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,000
an E (extrovert).

472
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:00,960
ENFJ (protagonist type).

473
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,800
Is it that easy to guess?

474
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,720
That's so accurate.

475
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,040
Because I'm smart.

476
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,400
I could tell.

477
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,960
People with a passionate personality are usually

478
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,320
E (extroverts).

479
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:12,920
Is that so?

480
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,920
Most likely.

481
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,320
Then you can try to guess mine.

482
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,480
This one's actually a bit tricky.

483
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:22,880
You are

484
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:27,760
You must be one too.

485
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,080
An E type (extroverted personality).

486
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,000
Right?

487
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,520
An E type (extroverted personality), and then

488
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,920
You're also an N type (intuitive personality).

489
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,640
A T type (thinking personality).

490
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,160
A P type (perceiving personality).

491
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,160
A J type (judging personality).

492
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,000
ENTJ (Commander personality type).

493
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,080
That's possible.

494
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,480
I'm also like that at work.

495
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,280
ENTJ (Commander personality type).

496
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,040
Sun Hanqing is also like that.

497
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,720
An E type (extroverted personality).

498
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,120
Yes.

499
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,120
I think it's still better with two

500
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,640
J types (judging personalities) together.

501
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,480
It's a bit more comfortable.

502
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:51,480
I think

503
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:51,960
it's still better with two J types (judging personalities)

504
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,080
together, it's a bit more comfortable.

505
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:54,840
Yes.

506
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,000
Yes.

507
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,000
This group feels very comfortable.

508
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,200
Are you looking forward to the cabin?

509
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,240
Yeah, I'm actually looking forward to it.

510
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,920
But I'm also feeling a bit nervous about it.

511
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,400
Everyone is easy to get along with.

512
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:14,920
Easy to get along with, right?

513
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,000
Yeah, and we

514
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,040
have a lot of extroverts here.

515
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,240
That's good then.

516
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:19,760
With more extroverts around,

517
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,720
I can talk less.

518
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,080
So you also adjust based on the environment?

519
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,240
I do.

520
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:25,800
Me too.

521
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,320
If the atmosphere is

522
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,840
everyone chatting happily,

523
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,760
I feel like I can

524
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,840
relax a bit.

525
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,320
Just relax.

526
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,200
And talk less.

527
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,520
I'm the same way.

528
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,680
Those two are kind of similar.

529
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,280
Yeah.

530
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,640
So a lot of times,

531
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,760
I'm seen as an introvert.

532
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,240
Me too.

533
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,000
I feel like we're actually quite similar.

534
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,160
At least on the first meeting,

535
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,360
I think the impression was really good.

536
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,080
Yeah, at least the foundation is great.

537
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,080
When he said that, it felt like the two of them had

538
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,280
some signals between them.

539
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,880
Is this what they call a signal of attraction?

540
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,680
Yeah, you have to catch it.

541
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,320
That's the right way to catch it.

542
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,560
Wait, did you feel

543
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,440
that when the two of them talked,

544
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,360
it was actually pretty close and sticky?

545
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,440
You call that sticky?

546
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,400
Do you think it's a bit weak?

547
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,800
I think you should

548
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,880
just pull it up right from the start.

549
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,160
Lift your eyes up.

550
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,920
Keep the conversation intense.

551
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,080
Pull it up right away.

552
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,000
As soon as you start,

553
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,080
it should be clear at a glance.

554
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,720
It's a kind of

555
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,280
If you do it like this,

556
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,000
the first time you met Xu,

557
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,600
how did you

558
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,640
how did you interact?

559
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,680
Pull.

560
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,720
Just now, it was already pulled up.

561
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,360
It's already been pulled up.

562
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:36,880
Yeah.

563
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,560
So if you want to dodge,

564
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,640
look, you do it like this.

565
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:40,840
You and Ma Boxian,

566
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,640
try dodging, let me see.

567
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,240
You seem shy.

568
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,800
Isn't avoiding eye contact a bit shy?

569
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,200
What I thought of as avoiding,

570
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,320
was if you don't like someone, then...

571
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,080
No, what I mean is,

572
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,080
it's all based on liking someone.

573
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,240
Either you avoid or you pull closer.

574
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,440
I feel that Chi Chi

575
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,200
has a certain ability.

576
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,640
She makes me feel comfortable.

577
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,520
It's a pleasant feeling.

578
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,360
No one feels awkward.

579
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,600
And I think Chi Chi's gaze

580
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,480
doesn't avoid eye contact.

581
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:07,840
Yes.

582
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,280
She really is always present.

583
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,920
It feels like she has a lot

584
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,240
of information and things she wants to say to him.

585
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,000
Yes.

586
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,520
Teacher, I have a question.

587
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,600
Usually, he meets so many girls at once.

588
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,680
So, could it be

589
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,640
that you tend to remember the first girl who appears

590
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,080
Actually, yes.

591
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:21,880
Right.

592
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,520
She leaves a stronger impression.

593
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,320
And you have a better feeling toward her.

594
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,640
Yes, that's called the primacy effect.

595
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:25,840
Yes, that's called the primacy effect.

596
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,840
It means people are influenced by their first impression.

597
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,320
It could also be the last one.

598
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,960
So either you come first,

599
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,680
or you come last.

600
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,280
Yes, there's psychological evidence for this.

601
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:33,560
That's right.

602
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,400
Yes.

603
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,840
It's hard to do this in real life.

604
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,160
It's hard to be the first in someone's life.

605
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:37,880
To be the first to appear.

606
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,880
Yes, timing is really important.

607
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,480
Someone's here.

608
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,120
Who is it?

609
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,440
Duoduo changed her look.

610
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,480
Hello.

611
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,400
Hello.

612
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,000
Hello.

613
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,880
Hello.

614
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,000
Hello.

615
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,520
Hello.

616
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,280
Let's get to know each other.

617
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,040
Hello, Duoduo.

618
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,440
Liu Zihan.

619
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,040
Liu Zihan.

620
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,480
Hello.

621
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,280
I'll sit here then.

622
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:18,880
That's fine.

623
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,240
Just got off work.

624
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,000
Did you also come from Shanghai?

625
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,440
I'm from Hangzhou.

626
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,120
I work here in Hangzhou.

627
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,440
Then it should be a bit closer.

628
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,520
But the traffic is pretty bad now.

629
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,440
An hour and twenty minutes.

630
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,320
An hour and twenty minutes.

631
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,600
It's about the same.

632
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,280
Here, have some water first.

633
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,480
He's quite decent.

634
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,440
Thank you.

635
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,360
With this kind of pot, I'm always worried the lid will fall off.

636
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:55,760
You know?

637
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,320
Just hold it down and it's fine.

638
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,920
She has a really cute personality.

639
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,480
She's the one I just told you about.

640
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,360
The one studying Chinese medicine.

641
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,200
You've already introduced her, right?

642
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,080
I've heard.

643
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,400
At that time, I happened to be talking with Chichi.

644
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,920
We were chatting, saying that...

645
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,520
Before,

646
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,400
Because I went to see a Chinese medicine doctor before,

647
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,840
The doctor said I had too much dampness in my body.

648
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,000
He could tell just by looking at my tongue.

649
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,240
Looking at the tongue.

650
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,920
Let's not look today.

651
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,120
In the future,

652
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,720
If I feel unwell, I'll ask you more.

653
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,280
If it were me, I would definitely...

654
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,280
I didn't see it just now.

655
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,280
I didn't see it just now.

656
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,160
No.

657
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,960
If she brings this up,

658
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,480
After that...

659
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:04,800
No, it's not like that, it's like this.

660
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,080
I think you need to...

661
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,320
Just be yourself a bit more.

662
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,000
Be more direct.

663
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,840
But sticking out your tongue like that,

664
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,600
is a bit much.

665
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,440
I think if I were...

666
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,240
If I were Duoduo,

667
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:11,760
I would say I think...

668
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,440
You're a bit serious.

669
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,200
You can go home and recover.

670
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,200
Come back in two months.

671
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:14,840
No, that's not it.

672
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,480
Then I would say,

673
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,240
Then I'll just go find you, and that's it.

674
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,080
You're really...

675
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,640
But that's also what makes him cute.

676
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,160
I'm really curious about your love life.

677
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,320
What is your romantic personality?

678
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,280
Romantic personality.

679
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,200
I just told her,

680
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,080
that there's a passionate type or something.

681
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,480
Or something like that.

682
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,600
Like someone with a fire sign.

683
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:45,800
In our house,

684
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,840
we don't have anyone with a passionate type right now.

685
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,720
Yeah.

686
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,400
So currently, in our house, there's only

687
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,040
Yeah, just one.

688
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,960
The only one.

689
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,200
Let's see.

690
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,760
Watch how I burn myself out

691
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,320
for everyone.

692
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,520
He really is still

693
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,280
quite good at chatting.

694
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:08,920
Yeah.

695
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:10,880
But in our little house,

696
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,720
there are people who are the giving type.

697
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,840
Ruilong is the giving type.

698
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,360
What are people who are the giving type usually like?

699
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,640
Literally, they’re selfless.

700
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,840
Like, they’ll

701
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,400
cook for others.

702
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,520
How is everyone’s cooking?

703
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,760
It’s all the guys who cook.

704
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,400
Got it, understood.

705
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,560
I think he still prefers eating more than cooking.

706
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,440
His eyes keep glancing at her.

707
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,560
Yeah, it’s instinctive.

708
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,760
He went back to study recipes.

709
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,280
So you can’t cook?

710
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,440
I can cook a little.

711
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,200
Like making caramelized sugar and stuff.

712
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,120
I think I’m okay at it.

713
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:55,680
Those kinds of things.

714
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,000
Making caramelized sugar

715
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,400
isn’t that easy, teacher.

716
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,880
Caramelizing sugar

717
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,000
That’s so cute.

718
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Caramelizing sugar.

719
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,640
That’s not it.

720
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,920
If you look at the recipe, you can do it too.

721
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,120
But your “-er” accent is really good.

722
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,200
Actually, in our

723
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:09,640
little house, on the first floor,

724
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,400
there’s a girl named Wang Jue.

725
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,840
Her nickname, everyone calls her Jue’er.

726
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,520
Jue’er.

727
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,640
Wang Jue’er.

728
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,720
And that day,

729
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,240
we practiced saying “Jue’er” all day.

730
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,080
Jue’er.

731
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,040
Here they come.

732
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,360
They're here.

733
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:30,880
Yes.

734
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,800
Who?

735
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,440
Hello.

736
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,520
Hello.

737
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,360
Jue'er.

738
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,360
She really has the vibe of a Jiangnan beauty.

739
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:38,920
Yes.

740
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:43,720
Hello.

741
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,320
Hello.

742
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:45,880
Hello.

743
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,240
Hello.

744
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,080
My name is Wang Jue.

745
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:48,960
Wang Jue.

746
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,800
I've heard a lot about you.

747
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,400
They just introduced themselves.

748
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,320
They were introduced just now.

749
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,000
Liu Zihan.

750
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:00,840
Hello.

751
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,200
Yes.

752
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,360
I don't know why the two of them

753
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,040
look so good together.

754
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,560
Sit.

755
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,680
Sit wherever is convenient for you.

756
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,040
Yes.

757
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,200
Sit down.

758
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,280
I'll sit over here too.

759
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:12,920
Okay.

760
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,080
"Three judges' trial."

761
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,640
Feels like interviewers.

762
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,640
Interviewers.

763
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,760
Is there any left? Let me check.

764
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,600
Pour another cup of tea.

765
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,800
Thank you.

766
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,440
Thank you.

767
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,400
Where did you come from?

768
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,680
I'm from Hangzhou.

769
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,200
I work locally here.

770
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,200
I'm a new Hangzhou resident.

771
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,520
A new Hangzhou resident, got it.

772
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,320
I'm from Hebei.

773
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,680
I used to work in Beijing.

774
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,440
And I just moved here.

775
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,520
I'm from the north.

776
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,120
No wonder they said

777
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,480
that your nickname is Jue'er.

778
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,200
And I said the "er" sound suits him well.

779
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,320
You can guess.

780
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,680
Guess where I'm from.

781
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,040
She doesn't have an accent, just a hint.

782
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,520
Right?

783
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:36,760
Liaoning.

784
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,080
From Liaoning.

785
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,400
You really don't have an accent.

786
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,760
Actually, Jue'er wasn't

787
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,720
this lively before.

788
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,720
Have you noticed that she

789
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,920
is more lively now and

790
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:52,960
Yeah, maybe it's because

791
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,440
she's met

792
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,480
new friends,

793
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,120
that kind of feeling.

794
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:55,880
But you get the sense

795
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,080
that she's more curious

796
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,280
about him.

797
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,240
Because the only thing we could confirm last time was

798
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:00,960
that Wang Jue at that time

799
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,400
used to like Le Chen, right?

800
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,680
But after their last interaction,

801
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,840
after that one-on-one,

802
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,360
she probably gave up on Le Chen completely.

803
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,040
Yeah.

804
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,840
So now she's

805
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,320
definitely getting to know

806
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:08,760
other people.

807
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,520
And only the two of them

808
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,840
are from the north.

809
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,960
So what do you like to do on weekends?

810
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,280
On weekends, I

811
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:20,880
work overtime.

812
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,560
Work overtime.

813
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,840
That's so rough.

814
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,160
Maybe go out with friends

815
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,480
and play some squash

816
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,920
then go cycling

817
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,080
and in winter

818
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,160
go skiing

819
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,240
as for skiing

820
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,680
you guys probably don't ski

821
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:40,680
No

822
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,160
I've never skied

823
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,320
I can do both snowboard and skis

824
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,280
You can ski?

825
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,040
Me too

826
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,000
But I'm just a beginner

827
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,200
Me too, just a beginner

828
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,480
But I can still ski

829
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,720
I can still make it down

830
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,040
As long as I can get down, yeah

831
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,840
You just need to be brave

832
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,480
Do you think he might be

833
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,000
the most

834
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,760
extroverted person in the house?

835
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,360
I'm okay.

836
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,240
As for me,

837
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,960
maybe among the guys,

838
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,560
I'm the most extroverted one.

839
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,120
You are

840
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,800
an ENFJ.

841
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,200
You are

842
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,160
an ENFJ.

843
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:09,560
Yeah.

844
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:09,880
Me too.

845
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,640
ENFJ.

846
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:11,720
You too?

847
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,520
ENFJ.

848
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,440
In our house,

849
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:15,880
there's another

850
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,600
ENFJ.

851
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:17,960
And also

852
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,600
an ENFJ.

853
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,120
Okay.

854
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:19,960
Jiao is also

855
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,960
an ENFJ.

856
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,440
If you put us all together, it's like a matching game.

857
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:22,920
We'd all disappear.

858
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,440
No, don't let us all disappear.

859
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,240
He's pretty funny.

860
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,640
So there are still two guys left.

861
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,400
It should be girls, right?

862
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,360
I'm just guessing.

863
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,520
Could it be two girls?

864
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,320
But altogether we have

865
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,520
a total of six girls.

866
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,280
Right?

867
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,920
But because

868
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,720
because Xiaoyuan went to her defense,

869
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,480
Yeah, Yuanyuan isn't here.

870
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,440
So there are still two girls left.

871
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,200
Let's look forward to it.

872
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,320
If he (Liu Zihan) in the end

873
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,720
actually has the strongest feelings for Lu Yuan,

874
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,680
that would be so romantic.

875
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,400
Just think, she's the only one not here today.

876
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,840
And then in the end, he might

877
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,760
have the strongest feelings for her.

878
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,400
You have so many ideas.

879
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,680
It's all about imagination, right?

880
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,560
Yeah.

881
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,400
Go on.

882
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,480
Hello.

883
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,240
Here they come.

884
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:33,840
They're here.

885
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,480
Hello.

886
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,040
Yifan and Lanlan.

887
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,600
What does that mean?

888
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,280
What's with that expression?

889
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,080
Do they know each other?

890
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,400
Why does it look like they know each other?

891
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,560
Who does he know?

892
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,200
Sit.

893
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,680
Have a seat.

894
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,160
This feels like

895
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,320
What are you doing here?

896
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,600
They know each other.

897
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,720
Hello

898
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:28,920
Hello

899
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,480
Hello

900
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,280
Long time no see

901
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:34,760
Really?

902
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,360
So you know each other?

903
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,600
Yes

904
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:38,840
Long time no see

905
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,000
Long time no see

906
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,320
You can tell you know each other

907
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,400
That's pretty amazing

908
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,760
I really like seeing this

909
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,040
Are you friends?

910
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,840
Long time no see

911
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,960
Are you friends?

912
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,120
Yes

913
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:51,720
Yes

914
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,120
You really know each other

915
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,040
Know each other

916
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:56,600
Friends

917
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,480
Know each other

918
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:58,640
Yes

919
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,160
What a coincidence

920
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:00,640
It's true

921
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,880
Did you meet here today?

922
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,920
Just found out

923
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,760
Just found out

924
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,680
Really

925
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,040
Yes

926
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,240
What a coincidence

927
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:09,480
Yes

928
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:10,760
Yes

929
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,080
We met before in Beijing

930
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,120
Such a coincidence

931
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,400
Our show has never had

932
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,520
someone familiar appear before

933
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,040
Have some water.

934
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,320
Then you pour it.

935
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,680
Then you pour it.

936
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,000
I really like watching this kind of thing.

937
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,600
We're close enough, you can pour it yourself.

938
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,800
Do it yourself.

939
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:45,840
Go ahead.

940
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,840
It's that feeling of being with someone familiar.

941
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:01,720
Thank you.

942
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,240
You're welcome.

943
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,320
Thanks.

944
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,520
It's getting a bit awkward.

945
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,480
Hey, Zihan.

946
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,080
I'm just afraid of running into people I know.

947
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,760
Especially at events like this.

948
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,400
Before you came,

949
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:28,920
we thought

950
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,920
he must be the most

951
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,880
extroverted guy in the house.

952
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,320
So outgoing.

953
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,080
Why did you stop talking?

954
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,320
It's your show today.

955
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,480
You're really a big deal.

956
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,400
We were just saying today

957
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,920
who's such a big deal

958
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,120
that it's worth it for all of us

959
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,680
to dress up to meet them.

960
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,600
Didn't expect it to be you.

961
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,480
Don't tease me.

962
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,680
That's it, you got me flustered.

963
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,440
Today, you...

964
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:10,960
Stop talking.

965
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,680
My mind's a bit messy right now.

966
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,080
Lanlan knows what he's like

967
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,200
in private.

968
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:19,800
Yeah.

969
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,760
Drink some water.

970
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,520
Why do you care if I drink water or not?

971
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,160
Hello

972
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,520
Let me introduce myself

973
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,720
My name is Liu Zihan

974
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,720
Yes

975
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,240
Zihan

976
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:36,760
Yes

977
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,760
"Where did our Zihan go?"

978
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,360
That Zihan

979
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,760
"Where is our Zihan?"

980
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,680
"Our Zihan"

981
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,840
Wang Yifan

982
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,040
Yifan

983
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,800
Okay

984
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,480
Then let's

985
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,680
start serving the dishes

986
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,080
I'll go take a look.

987
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,520
Talk about him.

988
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,240
Look.

989
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,200
Him.

990
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,320
Tell us more.

991
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,680
Go into detail.

992
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,280
You guys talk.

993
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,920
You can step out for a bit.

994
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,320
We can discuss for a while.

995
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,000
So scary.

996
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,960
So it's this scary when someone you know is here.

997
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,760
Great, we want to know more.

998
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,640
About the male guest.

999
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,480
We can ask you now.

1000
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,560
It's fine, go ahead.

1001
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,920
So what was your impression of him before?

1002
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,320
Is it different now that you're here today?

1003
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,040
Here he comes.

1004
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,120
No.

1005
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,600
Didn't expect that.

1006
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,440
It's you.

1007
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,560
The world is so big.

1008
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,880
Anything can happen.

1009
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,040
What a coincidence.

1010
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,920
He's here.

1011
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,000
Come on, "Mr. Herry."

1012
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,680
You first.

1013
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,280
After you.

1014
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,240
None of us knew.

1015
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,280
His name is "Herry."

1016
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,360
Yes, his English name is "Herry."

1017
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:14,720
That's right.

1018
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:20,720
Everyone, don't be shy.

1019
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,160
Alright, let's get started.

1020
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,720
Why do I feel like ever since Lanlan showed up,

1021
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,320
he's become a bit uncomfortable?

1022
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,360
He's really uncomfortable.

1023
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,160
He's completely different from before.

1024
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,840
It's so hard.

1025
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,440
Is anyone having claypot rice?

1026
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,800
I'll get it.

1027
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,200
Just hand me the bowl.

1028
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,360
I feel like those two have a chance.

1029
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,400
It's really obvious.

1030
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,720
He's interested.

1031
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,480
It seems like Rulan keeps wanting to laugh.

1032
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,400
The two of them keep laughing.

1033
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:45,760
They definitely will.

1034
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,760
They're pretty familiar with each other.

1035
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,640
And then, in a really formal setting,

1036
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,560
it gets a bit awkward.

1037
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,640
Yeah.

1038
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,080
Thank you.

1039
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,400
Thank you.

1040
00:39:59,400 --> 00:39:59,920
It's nothing.

1041
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,680
I don't need it.

1042
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,560
You don't need it.

1043
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,000
Enjoy your food and drinks.

1044
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,840
Enjoy your food and drinks.

1045
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,920
Where do you work?

1046
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,560
You can guess.

1047
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,800
You can guess.

1048
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,320
Mainly, this bowl of noodles is a bit big, teacher.

1049
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,000
Are you here in Shanghai or...

1050
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,400
In Shanghai.

1051
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:24,760
In Shanghai.

1052
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,880
Work.

1053
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,320
Lanlan and I have similar work hours.

1054
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,080
Nine to five.

1055
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,360
Don't look at me.

1056
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,880
Aren't you going to help out now?

1057
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,960
She is a museum guide.

1058
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:50,760
She gives tours.

1059
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,280
That's awesome.

1060
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,360
That really is impressive.

1061
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,720
Actually, this makes the atmosphere quite nice.

1062
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,880
See, just to meet you,

1063
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,360
we all had dinner late.

1064
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,000
Next time, I'll cook.

1065
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,600
Alright.

1066
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,520
It's settled.

1067
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,160
Okay.

1068
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,400
Okay.

1069
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,560
How is everyone's cooking?

1070
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,320
The guys in our house are all really good.

1071
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,440
Yeah, I think it's delicious.

1072
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,400
Feeling any pressure?

1073
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:29,800
No pressure.

1074
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,040
I just eat, that's all.

1075
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,680
There are so many moments of dry humor.

1076
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,120
This person

1077
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,440
is our

1078
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,320
new male guest who makes hearts flutter.

1079
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,280
I think he actually has something really special.

1080
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,760
He connects with every girl

1081
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,600
in some way.

1082
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:55,760
Yeah.

1083
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,840
I actually envy guys a bit.

1084
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,960
Just like Bokian said earlier,

1085
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,920
because he works in

1086
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,800
marketing.

1087
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,120
Marketing and promotion.

1088
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:03,920
Right.

1089
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,200
Maybe it's his

1090
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,760
job that makes him so familiar

1091
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,600
Yeah.

1092
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:07,880
Yeah.

1093
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,320
He's pretty used to interacting with people.

1094
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,240
So he seems able to handle the situation well.

1095
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,280
His social skills are quite strong.

1096
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,000
But this is something he developed over time.

1097
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,240
Like you said,

1098
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,440
his job gives him an advantage.

1099
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,520
Yeah.

1100
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,800
So he's probably very skilled

1101
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,160
at talking to strangers.

1102
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:23,880
Yeah.

1103
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,080
And he even takes the initiative to pour water.

1104
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,840
He's pretty good at taking care of the girls.

1105
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,680
If it were me,

1106
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,120
I'd probably end up pouring the water on my own head.

1107
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,400
No need to be like that.

1108
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:32,920
I'm being serious.

1109
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,840
I really mean it.

1110
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,280
I'm the type of person who

1111
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,760
Even back when I was in F4,

1112
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,560
even though everyone was so familiar with each other,

1113
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,040
I would still often feel

1114
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,880
like I really didn't know how to

1115
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,720
greet people or anything like that.

1116
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,880
What I fear most is waking up in the morning

1117
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,720
and then meeting the other members.

1118
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,960
So here's the question.

1119
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,440
Which member are you most afraid of?

1120
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,040
None.

1121
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,120
I'm not afraid.

1122
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,560
It's just that

1123
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,840
I really envy them for having this kind of job.

1124
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,920
They always have so many topics to talk about.

1125
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,160
They keep bringing up new things.

1126
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,440
I think that's something

1127
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,760
I really envy.

1128
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,200
But, Xu-ge,

1129
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:06,760
I'm especially curious to know

1130
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,480
because, look,

1131
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,440
at this table, we have all kinds of girls.

1132
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,680
For example,

1133
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,360
what would be the first thing you'd say to greet them?

1134
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,120
What would it be?

1135
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:17,960
I'm really not good at it.

1136
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,000
If you ask him, I really can't do it.

1137
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,280
No, if I were too good at it, it wouldn't be fun.

1138
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,360
No.

1139
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,120
Ruilong

1140
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,120
Like an "old cadre"

1141
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:40,800
He really puts his hands behind his back

1142
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,840
He really looks like he's inspecting work

1143
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,320
You know?

1144
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,480
Hello

1145
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,800
Hello, Ruilong

1146
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,160
I've been waiting here with Teacher Fang for a long time

1147
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,440
Dumplings

1148
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,600
We're planning to cook dumplings

1149
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,440
Let's cook some dumplings to eat

1150
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,480
Basically, we're just being lazy

1151
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,280
Anyway, there's no one else here

1152
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,320
Yeah, it's so strange today

1153
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,800
Why is it all guys?

1154
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,600
They still don't know the girls have left

1155
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,320
Yeah

1156
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,120
Ruilong

1157
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,440
Did you notice

1158
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,280
On our first floor

1159
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,880
Maybe someone new will move in tonight

1160
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,080
I saw that room's door was open

1161
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,320
And there was a key inside

1162
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,760
Teacher Jiao knows everything

1163
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:21,160
Seriously

1164
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,440
Pays attention to everything

1165
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,880
It must be a guy

1166
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,240
Hello

1167
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:36,800
Chen

1168
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,520
Why does it feel like today

1169
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,600
everyone came back so late?

1170
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,240
Have you eaten?

1171
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,000
No

1172
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:40,640
Just you guys?

1173
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,560
It's only us here

1174
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,040
Tonight it's just the guys

1175
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,760
We're cooking for the guys

1176
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,760
Tonight it's only the guys

1177
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,480
Yes

1178
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,400
Guess why

1179
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:47,840
Why?

1180
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,520
You're so smart

1181
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,000
Take a guess

1182
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,040
You should be able to guess

1183
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,240
I don't know

1184
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,080
A new guy is coming today

1185
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:56,760
Today

1186
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,000
Really?

1187
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,400
And the girls will go pick him up

1188
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,600
Five girls picking up one guy

1189
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,760
We never get that kind of treatment

1190
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,840
So should we still make spicy hot pot?

1191
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,400
No

1192
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:07,960
No

1193
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,920
We'll just boil dumplings

1194
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,080
Or I can cook for you

1195
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,520
Let's eat something nice

1196
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,120
Just us

1197
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:26,440
Have a big meal.

1198
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,600
You should treat yourself better.

1199
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,040
Eat it all.

1200
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,720
Go pick up the guy.

1201
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,120
Go pick up the guy.

1202
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,320
Pick up.

1203
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,480
There's something.

1204
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,360
Okay, I'll pick him up.

1205
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,840
It's rare for me to come home this early.

1206
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,400
And it turns out it's just a guy.

1207
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,160
What's wrong?

1208
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,080
Isn't that good?

1209
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:44,760
Is a guy not good?

1210
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:45,840
That's what I thought too.

1211
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,520
It seems like you're not happy about it.

1212
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:48,880
Isn't this pretty good?

1213
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:49,440
No, it's not.

1214
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,480
I'll go fry an egg first.

1215
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,640
This is for the sixth guy.

1216
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,320
I saved a fried egg.

1217
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,400
You've already prepared it.

1218
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,040
I specially fried a runny egg.

1219
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,560
Because it's not fully cooked.

1220
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,560
Because it's not fully cooked.

1221
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,080
It's already prepared.

1222
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,080
So cold.

1223
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,400
At least you didn't save vinegar for him.

1224
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,040
There's already a lot of jealousy here.

1225
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:25,920
Because it's not fully cooked.

1226
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,520
It's already prepared.

1227
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,600
Why don't you give him a raw egg?

1228
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,800
It's too raw to eat.

1229
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,560
You're so cunning.

1230
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:40,960
I promise it's edible.

1231
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,120
It's that kind of soft-boiled egg.

1232
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:45,960
Not fully cooked.

1233
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:47,520
Why does it feel just like me?

1234
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,400
Exactly the same feeling.

1235
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,320
You're like that too.

1236
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,600
When will they be back?

1237
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,080
I don't know.

1238
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,480
Did they go out to eat?

1239
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,760
Maybe there's a delicious dinner.

1240
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:00,680
Alright.

1241
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,200
Chen.

1242
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,360
That's pretty good.

1243
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,160
That "hmph" expressed what all five of us feel.

1244
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:05,480
Say "hmph."

1245
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,080
What he made looks pretty tasty.

1246
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,280
Cheers.

1247
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:12,840
Cheers.

1248
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,440
We're missing one for Yu Xing.

1249
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,920
Let him make up for it later.

1250
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:23,880
Do you think two guys will come?

1251
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,480
At most, one more.

1252
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,920
There should only be one.

1253
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,520
Two coming wouldn't be strange.

1254
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,800
Just fry two undercooked eggs.

1255
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,080
What time is it?

1256
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,000
Why aren't they back yet?

1257
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,640
Who are you talking about?

1258
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:45,200
Them.

1259
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,000
Them.

1260
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:47,880
Them or just her?

1261
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:49,360
Lanlan.

1262
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,520
They'll definitely come back together, right?

1263
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:53,880
Not necessarily.

1264
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,640
I think they might be late.

1265
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,200
Because they have to wait for everyone to arrive.

1266
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,080
Then in a bit, we'll just

1267
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,280
lock the door to the living area.

1268
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,040
These guys

1269
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,120
are so bad.

1270
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:11,840
So bad, we...

1271
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,920
Are we counting on you tonight?

1272
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,560
Help me introduce everyone.

1273
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,320
No problem.

1274
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,120
Say something nice.

1275
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,880
No problem.

1276
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,400
The cabin is really fun.

1277
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,320
There's actually something fun on the second floor.

1278
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:29,520
It has a slide.

1279
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,880
A slide.

1280
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:31,960
We've all tried it.

1281
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,840
You should show us today.

1282
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:34,800
Show us.

1283
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:35,600
Then the eleven of us will stand in a row and watch.

1284
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,520
Then the eleven of us will stand in a row and watch.

1285
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,160
Open the door on the first floor.

1286
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,280
Just slide right out.

1287
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,400
Make a dazzling entrance.

1288
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,520
Make a dazzling entrance.

1289
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
A loud bang in the sky.

1290
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,280
I really envy him for this.

1291
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:51,920
He can handle anything.

1292
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:52,920
His reactions.

1293
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:53,960
So impressive.

1294
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,360
Then let's hurry back.

1295
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,480
Go back and introduce yourself.

1296
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:56,840
Okay.

1297
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,600
Listen to our Herry (Liu Zihan).

1298
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,560
Herry (Liu Zihan).

1299
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,000
I feel like I'm about to forget

1300
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,400
the name Zihan.

1301
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:07,360
Going home.

1302
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,480
I'm already looking forward to it.

1303
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,000
Let's go.

1304
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:11,480
Eat and head out.

1305
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,400
What do you think of the new guy?

1306
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:19,960
How is he?

1307
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,040
Like him, definitely like him.

1308
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,640
What I fear most is when the atmosphere suddenly changes

1309
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,640
How should I put it

1310
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:32,520
I just feel like

1311
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,520
Maybe if

1312
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,080
he didn't know Lanlan

1313
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,480
it would give us a certain feeling

1314
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,960
but after he got to know Lanlan

1315
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,320
the way they communicate

1316
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,600
and our feelings

1317
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,120
would be different

1318
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:45,760
Really

1319
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,480
it might

1320
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:49,960
be a bit different

1321
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:51,200
Yeah

1322
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,560
I'm guessing

1323
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,160
maybe the girls would feel

1324
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,680
there's a bit of a subtle vibe

1325
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:56,320
Yeah

1326
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,120
It's not really good

1327
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,880
to get to know too much more

1328
00:49:58,880 --> 00:49:59,880
Later on

1329
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:00,840
the girls actually

1330
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,280
stopped asking questions

1331
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:02,880
But I think before Lanlan

1332
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:03,600
showed up

1333
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,200
I felt

1334
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,280
the girls were actually

1335
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,360
quite proactive with him

1336
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:06,960
Yeah

1337
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,280
The atmosphere was really different

1338
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,160
So when you're on a blind date

1339
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,000
don't bring your

1340
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:11,960
close girlfriends or buddies

1341
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:13,520
Yeah

1342
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:14,880
That's true

1343
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,440
I really didn't expect that.

1344
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:19,680
You truly didn't know.

1345
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:20,200
I was going to come here.

1346
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:21,680
What do you think?

1347
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,920
Did my expression just now look like I knew?

1348
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,560
I honestly didn't know either.

1349
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,560
Can we make it more formal tonight?

1350
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,280
Okay.

1351
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,920
I'll give you a grand introduction to everyone.

1352
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,280
If you two don't say anything, they'll guess.

1353
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,280
Do you know each other?

1354
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,960
There's nothing to hide.

1355
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:39,720
We'll definitely burst out laughing.

1356
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:40,760
We'll definitely burst out laughing.

1357
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:43,520
This is so much fun.

1358
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:45,800
This is so much fun.

1359
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:49,560
Here they come.

1360
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,360
Someone from their group is working out.

1361
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:00,920
Who?

1362
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,640
Is that Yu Xing?

1363
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:06,720
Let's go take a look.

1364
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:10,920
Yu Xing.

1365
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:11,560
Hello.

1366
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,480
Yu Xing.

1367
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:14,120
Hello.

1368
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,360
Are you the only one working out?

1369
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,480
Why did you come back so late?

1370
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:20,480
Yi Fan and Yu Hang.

1371
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,160
Pay attention to them.

1372
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,400
Okay.

1373
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,360
I'm watching them, keeping an eye on them.

1374
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,760
Did you come back at the usual time today?

1375
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,720
Yes, they're eating upstairs.

1376
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,520
Just a few of you?

1377
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,640
Yeah, just a few of us guys.

1378
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:32,040
No.

1379
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:33,640
Nothing.

1380
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,520
They said there seems to be a new guy.

1381
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,520
But no one has seen him.

1382
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:36,960
Here they come.

1383
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:37,480
Here they come.

1384
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:38,520
Here they come.

1385
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:39,680
Here they come.

1386
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:43,760
Then I want to...

1387
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,360
Those two...

1388
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,840
They have such a strong presence.

1389
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,560
Suddenly it feels...

1390
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,760
So intimidating.

1391
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,320
Why does getting out of the car feel like shooting a commercial?

1392
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,120
Oh no, I already...

1393
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:14,840
Have a story in my head.

1394
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:15,800
Really.

1395
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:16,480
Both are strong.

1396
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:31,080
So tall.

1397
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,480
Is he 1.91 or 1.92 meters tall?

1398
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,040
What is he doing?

1399
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,040
He's standing on tiptoe.

1400
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:49,320
Hello

1401
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:50,520
How should I address you?

1402
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,280
Hello

1403
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:53,120
Hello

1404
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:56,400
How should I address you?

1405
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,120
Jin Yuxing

1406
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:57,400
Jin Yuxing

1407
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:58,040
Liu Zihan

1408
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,520
Such a strong handshake.

1409
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:03,880
Very energetic.

1410
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:04,600
Liu Zihan.

1411
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:05,840
Liu Zihan.

1412
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:06,440
Nice to meet you.

1413
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:08,960
Nice to meet you.

1414
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,360
I'll grab my luggage.

1415
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:10,800
Okay.

1416
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,120
You guys go up first.

1417
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:14,920
I'll be right there.

1418
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:15,360
Alright.

1419
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,240
Zihan has a strong presence.

1420
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,160
Yeah, if I were that tall,

1421
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:22,520
my perspective would be different too.

1422
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,880
That aura would definitely be something.

1423
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,320
Let's go.

1424
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,120
Should we go to the sleeping area first,

1425
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,160
or the living area?

1426
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,240
Why don't you put your luggage down first?

1427
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:34,800
Sure.

1428
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,040
It's so nice to have someone I know here.

1429
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:41,440
I want to change into slippers before heading over.

1430
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:43,680
This is where we usually

1431
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,640
hang out and chat.

1432
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:46,720
It's pretty nice.

1433
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:47,800
Really nice.

1434
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:48,320
And then,

1435
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,640
inside there is the accommodation area.

1436
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,680
In here,

1437
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,480
are two girls who have already moved in.

1438
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,800
And in the middle,

1439
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,960
are Xiao Jiao and Rui Long.

1440
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,040
And this is my room.

1441
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:58,880
And this one is empty.

1442
00:53:58,880 --> 00:53:59,960
It's a room for a guy.

1443
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,760
We usually hang out here on the second floor too.

1444
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,240
And over there,

1445
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,360
there might be some simple

1446
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:07,480
food you can make.

1447
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,160
Keeps glancing at her

1448
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,240
But Le Chen

1449
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,240
Hasn't come back yet, right?

1450
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,920
It seems all the guys are over there

1451
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,360
Should we just go over there?

1452
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,400
Say hello

1453
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:22,520
Sure

1454
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:23,800
I'll put my bag

1455
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:24,960
Here

1456
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:25,560
Put it on the sofa first

1457
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,800
Instinctively still looks at Chi Chi

1458
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,480
Really, keeps staring at her

1459
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,400
Keeps staring

1460
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,320
You can slide on this

1461
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,440
Do you want to try it?

1462
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,440
You can slide down

1463
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,680
You can slide down

1464
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,160
Come on

1465
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,640
Come on, give it a try

1466
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,200
Just do it

1467
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,760
That's nice, very confident

1468
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,560
He's too tall, he can't fit

1469
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,400
One male guest

1470
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,560
He's sliding down now

1471
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:58,280
Making a dazzling entrance

1472
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:58,880
Making a dazzling entrance

1473
00:54:58,880 --> 00:54:59,640
Making a dazzling entrance

1474
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:09,960
He really has a great personality

1475
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:10,720
Yes

1476
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:10,920
Really

1477
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,120
Really

1478
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,440
You made a lot of noise sliding down

1479
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,400
Let's go

1480
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,880
This scene

1481
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,600
This tall guy

1482
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:37,280
Thank you

1483
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,600
Is anyone here?

1484
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:44,320
It smells so good.

1485
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:45,400
It really smells great.

1486
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,600
Are you here?

1487
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,600
I hear something.

1488
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:51,520
You're back.

1489
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,160
Hello, everyone.

1490
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,320
Hello, everyone.

1491
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,560
You came back so late.

1492
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,680
Did you go...

1493
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,320
...to meet a new friend?

1494
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,240
Has he arrived?

1495
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:06,760
Yes, the new friend is here.

1496
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:10,520
He's here.

1497
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,040
Hello, everyone.

1498
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:14,720
Hello.

1499
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:18,560
Hello, everyone.

1500
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,320
Hello, everyone.

1501
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,920
That height is pretty intimidating.

1502
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,800
Dr. Fang's smile disappears.

1503
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,600
So tall.

1504
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,520
One meter ninety-two.

1505
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:37,400
One meter ninety-two.

1506
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,720
Let me introduce.

1507
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,200
You wanted me to come.

1508
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,960
Dr. Fang said whoever he calls should come.

1509
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:49,200
How did just having a meal...

1510
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,080
What's going on?

1511
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,280
So, is a guy's awkwardness...

1512
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,600
...crossing his arms like this?

1513
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,120
Let me introduce myself, Liu Zihan.

1514
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:07,920
Fang Yijiong.

1515
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:08,560
Fang.

1516
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:10,800
Fang Yijiong.

1517
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,360
Fang Yijiong, Liu Zihan, nice to meet you.

1518
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,160
Hello.

1519
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:15,160
How should I address you?

1520
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:15,760
Liu Zihan.

1521
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:16,520
Liu Zihan

1522
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:17,520
Wang Lechen

1523
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,200
Lechen

1524
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:18,960
Okay

1525
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,280
I've heard a lot about you

1526
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:21,080
I've heard a lot about you

1527
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,440
Because we were saying you are

1528
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,600
a chef who's really good at cooking

1529
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:24,240
Teasing me again

1530
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,280
Hello

1531
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:25,600
How should I address you?

1532
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,200
So handsome, so tall

1533
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,000
No

1534
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:27,920
Jiao Zhiheng

1535
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:28,480
Jiao Zhiheng

1536
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,440
Yes, just call me Xiao Jiao

1537
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:30,440
Xiao Jiao, okay

1538
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:30,960
Have you eaten?

1539
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:31,720
I have

1540
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:32,360
I have

1541
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,160
Are you full?

1542
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,040
It's a bit subtle

1543
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:40,960
We even fried an egg for you

1544
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,240
We guessed you would come

1545
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,360
We specially fried an egg for you

1546
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,760
I'll take this.

1547
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,320
Then I'll accept it, thank you.

1548
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,760
Should we heat it up for a bit?

1549
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:58,080
No need.

1550
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:58,760
Can you eat it as it is?

1551
00:57:58,760 --> 00:57:59,240
Yes, that's fine.

1552
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,080
Feels like that "poison apple."

1553
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,120
This guy seems pretty generous.

1554
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,200
Tastes good.

1555
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,320
Who cooked today?

1556
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,360
All lined up, you know?

1557
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,480
That sentence has a lot of meaning.

1558
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:24,800
Who cooked today?

1559
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:25,960
Who cooked today?

1560
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,120
That's right.

1561
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:28,840
Who cooked today?

1562
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:33,960
The chef.

1563
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:37,640
Spicy hot pot.

1564
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:38,320
We all cooked.

1565
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:41,480
That's impressive.

1566
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:42,320
This is really delicious.

1567
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:42,880
This is really delicious.

1568
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:43,880
Duo Duo is really supportive.

1569
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:44,880
Le Chen's turn.

1570
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:45,480
Yes.

1571
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:49,920
Thinking about how attentive Teacher Le Chen is,

1572
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,200
he must have set aside

1573
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,720
a separate portion for us, right?

1574
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:53,960
Eat yours quickly.

1575
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:57,320
I think

1576
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,560
those two are really something.

1577
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,680
You could say you picked the right dish.

1578
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:01,680
Keep eating.

1579
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,520
I think you should hurry.

1580
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,640
Here it comes.

1581
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,000
Eat yours quickly.

1582
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:15,720
So tasty.

1583
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:16,600
It's a bit salty, isn't it?

1584
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,520
No, it's just like my mom makes.

1585
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:19,840
Exactly the same.

1586
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:29,680
I still don't know.

1587
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:30,880
What do you all do?

1588
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:38,960
I work as an auditor at a watch company.

1589
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:41,440
Ophthalmologist.

1590
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:41,920
Ophthalmologist.

1591
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,240
No wonder your eyes are so bright.

1592
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,440
No wonder your eyes are so bright.

1593
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:52,200
Thank you.

1594
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,640
You really know how to talk.

1595
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:01,400
Brother Herry (Liu Zihan)

1596
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,040
Actually, you didn't have to answer.

1597
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,560
No, it's just that everyone just arrived and...

1598
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:06,920
...getting to know each other.

1599
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:07,600
Right.

1600
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:11,680
What about you?

1601
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:14,040
I work at an environmental protection company now.

1602
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:15,880
Yes, in business operations.

1603
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:19,760
Where are you from?

1604
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:21,080
Hebei.

1605
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:21,680
Hebei.

1606
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:22,040
Yes.

1607
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,560
We have a lot of projects in Hebei.

1608
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:30,800
Over in Xiong'an.

1609
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:31,440
Yes, in Xiong'an.

1610
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:32,200
We're based in Xiong'an.

1611
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:32,920
There are many projects.

1612
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:34,960
So what do you do now?

1613
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,600
I work in the sports industry.

1614
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:44,840
You definitely look like someone in sports, bro.

1615
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:45,560
But...

1616
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:45,960
I have to look up to you.

1617
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:47,520
You're tall too.

1618
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:48,960
You're really impressive.

1619
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,080
You even have to look up.

1620
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,240
I have to look...

1621
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,360
...up at the stars now.

1622
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:03,680
I'm not the tallest anymore.

1623
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,320
The record has been broken.

1624
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:09,680
This one.

1625
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:10,640
The most handsome.

1626
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:11,240
Yeah, the most handsome.

1627
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:15,800
The tallest.

1628
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:18,720
The most hardworking.

1629
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,240
Brother Jiao who washes the dishes.

1630
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:21,600
Brother Jiao always finds work to do.

1631
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:23,880
No.

1632
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:25,360
The oldest.

1633
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,200
You two are about the same.

1634
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:31,920
About the same.

1635
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:32,800
Yeah, we're about the same.

1636
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:33,640
I was also born in 1995.

1637
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:36,080
I'm getting nervous.

1638
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:38,120
Did you go over there to take a look?

1639
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:38,680
No, I didn't.

1640
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:39,600
Let's go.

1641
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:40,080
Take a look.

1642
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,040
Take your time eating.

1643
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,240
You've been here for over a week too, right?

1644
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,120
Yeah, we went to the island first.

1645
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:52,320
Wait, why are you leaving so quickly?

1646
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:54,280
You haven't finished washing yet, right?

1647
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:00,840
Dr. Fang came back.

1648
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:04,680
He hasn't seen Brother Jiao yet.

1649
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:05,160
And he left.

1650
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:07,640
Then wait for Brother Jiao.

1651
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:10,080
It's fine.

1652
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:11,320
Let's go together.

1653
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:12,040
Okay.

1654
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:19,560
You go first.

1655
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:23,640
This is the cabin.

1656
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:24,640
This is where you sleep.

1657
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:25,040
I just arrived.

1658
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:26,440
I just slid down from here.

1659
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,280
You've already been here, right?

1660
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:28,800
Yes.

1661
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,120
Did you look at the room?

1662
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:32,800
I took a quick look.

1663
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,200
I didn't look closely.

1664
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:35,680
Do you have the key?

1665
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:36,480
The key.

1666
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:38,440
The door downstairs is open.

1667
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,320
There's a key on the table.

1668
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:43,520
So cool.

1669
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,160
Can't take my eyes off right now.

1670
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:47,000
Really cool.

1671
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:48,840
They're all cool.

1672
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,040
He is...

1673
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:50,640
Mixed race.

1674
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:51,280
I'm mixed race.

1675
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,160
No wonder.

1676
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:53,560
Switzerland, Guangzhou.

1677
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:55,520
He's Swiss mixed.

1678
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:56,920
The door is already open for you.

1679
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,640
And I think the key is inside too.

1680
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:01,440
Is that right?

1681
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:02,320
It's so big here.

1682
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:04,480
This room is huge.

1683
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:06,720
This room is really nice.

1684
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:08,040
This bed looks...

1685
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:09,480
Pretty big.

1686
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:10,920
But actually it feels...

1687
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:11,680
Not that big.

1688
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,560
A single room would suit you better.

1689
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:15,160
With your height.

1690
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,560
Otherwise, it might be uncomfortable.

1691
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,080
You can lie diagonally.

1692
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:22,840
It should be just right.

1693
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:23,440
Tilted.

1694
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:24,920
Just right.

1695
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:26,840
Being with the guys.

1696
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,160
Compared to being with the girls.

1697
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:29,000
It's different.

1698
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:30,760
A bit more relaxed.

1699
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:32,040
Not bad.

1700
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:36,560
This is our Zihan.

1701
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:38,560
It's her first time interacting with the guys.

1702
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:40,960
Zihan seems quite relaxed.

1703
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:43,320
The guys seem a bit prickly.

1704
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,680
Their hair is kind of standing up.

1705
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:46,200
Some are standing on tiptoe.

1706
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,280
Some are crossing their arms.

1707
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,960
But I think Dr. Fang is pretty cute.

1708
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:51,160
But I think Dr. Fang is pretty cute.

1709
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,800
Not sure about Dr. Fang's perspective.

1710
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:56,560
Lanlan and Zihan are friends.

1711
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:57,040
Right.

1712
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:58,120
So when he came up, what he saw

1713
01:03:58,120 --> 01:03:59,560
was that they had already exchanged

1714
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:01,160
things like their birth years.

1715
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:02,760
Then Zihan asked Lanlan

1716
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,040
to introduce everyone for her.

1717
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,440
He found this part a bit strange.

1718
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:06,240
It felt fast-forwarded.

1719
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,040
So he was very defensive.

1720
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:08,440
Right.

1721
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:09,160
Then he came back.

1722
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:09,960
I feel like

1723
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:11,960
even though he was waiting for Jiao,

1724
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:13,080
I think he still intentionally

1725
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:14,280
wanted to

1726
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:14,840
interact with Lanlan

1727
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:15,560
and confirm things.

1728
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,080
I bought a few very small ice creams.

1729
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,400
Bought a few extremely small ice creams.

1730
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:29,760
Very small ice creams.

1731
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:30,760
Twenty grams.

1732
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:31,560
Where is it?

1733
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:32,600
It's under there.

1734
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,920
It feels like Lanlan and Dr. Fang's

1735
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:35,800
interactions are a bit more.

1736
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:41,800
The three of them are pretty subtle too.

1737
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:42,440
Yeah.

1738
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:46,480
Put it there.

1739
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:48,320
I think it suits you better.

1740
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:48,880
I feel like every time you

1741
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,080
you only eat a little bit.

1742
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:51,000
Thank you.

1743
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:01,720
You can tell Xiao Jiao is holding it in.

1744
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,040
Washing really hard.

1745
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,240
When you just came in,

1746
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:26,480
I thought you put on blush.

1747
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:27,320
Jiao.

1748
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:27,960
Me?

1749
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,560
Because your face is so red.

1750
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:32,800
I'm a bit short of oxygen.

1751
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:34,600
He's definitely not short of oxygen.

1752
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:35,600
He still cares a lot.

1753
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:36,720
Of course.

1754
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,000
I believe all guys

1755
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:38,840
can understand this.

1756
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:39,480
Yeah.

1757
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:40,240
I think girls can too.

1758
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,920
If I were in the same situation,

1759
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,320
I would feel bad too.

1760
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:47,880
So when you first came,

1761
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:49,480
you must have felt a bit out of place.

1762
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:53,160
It was okay.

1763
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:58,400
Weini.

1764
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:06,560
Is here.

1765
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:08,400
There's also a kitchen here.

1766
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:16,280
Did anyone tell you to?

1767
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:17,240
You're on the first floor, right?

1768
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:19,080
Yeah, I just went there.

1769
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:19,960
There's a big bed.

1770
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:26,920
He really has a strong presence.

1771
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:29,040
Even when he walks normally, it feels like he's inspecting the place.

1772
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:30,000
Because he's tall.

1773
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:31,520
His whole aura is impressive.

1774
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:33,720
This room and that room—

1775
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:34,720
What's the difference?

1776
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:37,800
Logically speaking,

1777
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,200
people on the first floor should eat here.

1778
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:43,520
Those on the second floor eat over there.

1779
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:44,440
The first floor doesn't have

1780
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:45,240
a place to cook.

1781
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,640
No, this is the cooking area for the first floor.

1782
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:55,920
What time did you get back?

1783
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:56,960
I was the last one to come back.

1784
01:06:59,240 --> 01:06:59,720
The last one?

1785
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:00,760
And you still cooked?

1786
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:03,720
Has this grown white mold?

1787
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:09,240
I don't think so.

1788
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:09,880
It has.

1789
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:11,080
Then you have to throw it away.

1790
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:15,760
So you all guessed it early on.

1791
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,320
None of the girls are here today.

1792
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:18,120
No, I didn't know.

1793
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:19,000
I was the last to come back.

1794
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,440
They only told me then.

1795
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:22,440
Then I happily

1796
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:23,760
started making my

1797
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:25,560
spicy hot pot.

1798
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:27,920
Really?

1799
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,520
Really?

1800
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,240
And I still caught you.

1801
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:36,520
I didn't expect you'd come back so soon.

1802
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:44,600
They seem comfortable together.

1803
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:46,320
That's the impression I got. Really?

1804
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:47,560
Jue'er

1805
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:52,520
I still managed to catch up.

1806
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,120
She looks a bit awkward.

1807
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:58,160
Turns around
