1
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,300
So this is the observation room.

2
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:29,780
Let me take a look.

3
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,060
Not bad.

4
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:38,940
Let's check over there.

5
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:39,740
This reminds me of

6
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,940
that rooftop cabin from season seven.

7
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:41,420
Yeah.

8
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,140
Alright, there's nothing inside.

9
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,180
Let me check this out.

10
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,340
Dog-walking log.

11
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,860
Are there small animals this season?

12
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:50,820
Looks like it.

13
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,980
Interesting.

14
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,220
Let's take a look over here.

15
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,620
Apartment, cabin.

16
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,940
Gym, movie room.

17
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,220
This season is really diverse.

18
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,260
Park.

19
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,100
Secret area in the park.

20
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,380
It's a great place to walk dogs.

21
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,060
Walking dogs with someone you like.

22
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,020
And chatting at the same time.

23
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,180
Each person with a dog.

24
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,180
Isn't this...

25
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,380
Who could it be?

26
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,700
Long time no see.

27
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:15,780
How is it? How's the tour?

28
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,900
We noticed that this season

29
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,220
has some really fun places.

30
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,820
For example, this looks a lot like

31
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,820
the light-up button.

32
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,580
Don't you think so?

33
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,540
Then go press it.

34
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,300
Does anything happen?

35
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:27,980
It can't be pressed.

36
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,620
Everyone who lit up, go over there and press it.

37
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,580
Come on, TOMO (Zhang Hao), give it a try.

38
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,380
Let me think, I think I used my left hand.

39
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,260
Left hand.

40
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,460
Back then, it was all about rainbows.

41
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,780
There were rainbow lights everywhere.

42
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,780
They just burst out.

43
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,620
You two are even more romantic.

44
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,820
You pressed it together as a pair.

45
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,820
Anyway, it's really different from our season.

46
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,340
But they also have these island elements.

47
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,740
Like the watchtower.

48
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,500
And the windmill.

49
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:51,980
It's pretty cool.

50
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,140
Let's sit down first.

51
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,100
Back to our familiar seats again.

52
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,020
Familiar yet strange.

53
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,420
Hello.

54
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:04,380
Hello.

55
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,140
Welcome.

56
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,380
I am

57
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,220
Hou Zhuocheng from the "Zhuoqing" duo.

58
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,300
Hello, everyone.

59
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,460
I'm Yang Ruqing.

60
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,740
Welcome.

61
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,860
Welcome, Hou Zhuocheng.

62
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,980
Welcome, Yang Ruqing.

63
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,380
So sweet.

64
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,740
Hello, everyone.

65
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,460
I'm Sun Leyan from the "Yuyan" duo.

66
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,740
I'm Oscar.

67
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,820
Welcome.

68
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,660
Hello, everyone. I'm Li Dinghao.

69
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,820
I'm Tomo (Zhang Hao).

70
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,900
Tomo (Zhang Hao) and I are a

71
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,580
"TO Hao" duo.

72
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,260
A new (duo).

73
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,700
As a new duo,

74
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,500
we're joining everyone.

75
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,780
Welcome.

76
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,740
So why is Tomo (Zhang Hao)

77
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,460
here alone today?

78
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,100
What about Qiqi (Wang Qi)?

79
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,700
Qiqi (Wang Qi) has to work.

80
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,580
She couldn't make it.

81
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,620
But

82
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,220
she's on my watch face.

83
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,420
She'll be watching along with me.

84
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,540
So today, there are three of us

85
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,580
sitting on this sofa.

86
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,260
I heard that today

87
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,460
the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai story

88
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,460
has a very unique beginning.

89
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,220
And throughout the show,

90
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,260
we'll play a few mini-games.

91
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,820
The winner of each round

92
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,020
will get a "sweetness" sticker.

93
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,140
The team with the most stickers

94
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,660
will win a mysterious grand prize.

95
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,660
How big is it?

96
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,820
Without further ado,

97
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,620
let's watch the new season's

98
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,060
heartwarming stories together.

99
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,380
That's so cool!

100
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,740
Huaniao Island.

101
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,100
I've been there.

102
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:33,660
We've been there before.

103
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,500
I know.

104
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,300
They can play this.

105
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,540
You really like it, I know.

106
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,500
I really like it.

107
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,980
It's pretty comfortable here.

108
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,300
It kind of gives me a sense of déjà vu.

109
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,780
Like during our island trip back then.

110
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,300
That kind of feeling.

111
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,980
Yeah.

112
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,860
The village entrance, it's right here.

113
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,500
It brings back a flood of memories.

114
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,100
We've all walked here.

115
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,140
You guys have been to this place before?

116
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:05,620
Yeah.

117
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,260
We went there for a trip after the show.

118
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,740
So why did you decide

119
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,980
to go to this island back then?

120
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,500
Because the island has a visitor limit.

121
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:12,820
Yeah.

122
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,620
There are very few people.

123
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:13,900
Yeah.

124
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,740
There’s a daily limit on boarding the boat.

125
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,140
Yeah.

126
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,220
They control the number of visitors.

127
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,300
So you get that

128
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,500
feeling of having your own world.

129
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,220
Yeah.

130
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,380
There are especially few people on this island.

131
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:23,900
It's especially beautiful.

132
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,380
Here he comes.

133
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,100
Jin Yuxing.

134
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,540
A devoted lover.

135
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,460
He has a mullet.

136
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,860
It actually looks pretty cool.

137
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,020
But what's he holding in his hand?

138
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,300
It should be a

139
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,060
Looks like some kind of invitation card.

140
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,460
Here he comes.

141
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,020
Yeah, an invitation card.

142
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,460
Wang Jue.

143
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,220
I see someone.

144
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,340
This is their first meeting.

145
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,300
Meeting for the first time.

146
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,260
First encounter.

147
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,100
He seems very nervous.

148
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,460
The guy seems very...

149
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,060
The guy is a bit reserved.

150
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:19,500
Yeah.

151
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,140
Right?

152
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,580
Doesn't really match his hairstyle.

153
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,740
This kind of hairstyle is usually for...

154
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,900
The wild type.

155
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,900
Someone who greets you right away.

156
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,220
A bit more proactive.

157
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:29,860
Yeah.

158
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,580
That's quite a contrast.

159
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,060
Love it.

160
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,220
They both seem tall.

161
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,700
Both the guy and the girl are tall.

162
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,260
Both of them are a bit...

163
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,900
Restless, can't sit still.

164
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,060
Classic move.

165
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,420
He poured her tea right away.

166
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,020
The girl doesn't dare to sit down.

167
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,620
She doesn't know whether to sit or stand.

168
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,620
Who will start the conversation first?

169
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,740
What "haisheng"?

170
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,460
Sea cucumber.

171
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,580
Sea cucumber.

172
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,020
Front and back nasal sounds.

173
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,020
Just like me

174
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:23,780
Actually

175
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,300
Actually, when I first came to the cabin

176
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,540
and met everyone for the first time

177
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,460
I forgot to introduce myself

178
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,860
There were comments above saying

179
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,980
"This girl has been sitting here for a while"

180
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,220
"Why hasn't she said her name yet?"

181
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,100
Honestly, it was because I was too nervous

182
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,660
Way too nervous

183
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,620
So I just forgot

184
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,420
Like this girl, Wang Jue

185
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,180
She only had one male guest across from her

186
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,060
Maybe she's also a bit introverted

187
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,500
But at that time, I

188
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,980
met all the guys

189
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,900
All the guys were still

190
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,820
There were people who kept the atmosphere lively

191
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,460
Like him

192
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,100
He fell for me at first sight

193
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,900
The second male guest

194
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,620
Is he a college student?

195
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,580
He has that youthful college guy vibe

196
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,580
Yeah

197
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,740
Wang Lechen

198
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,980
Friendship-type lover

199
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,220
I'm a friendship-type lover

200
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:22,860
Me too

201
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,260
Among us here

202
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,420
How many friendship-type lovers are there?

203
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,340
You too?

204
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,580
Me

205
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,860
What were you thinking about during those three seconds?

206
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,340
I...

207
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,300
Sorry.

208
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,060
I...

209
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,900
So what about the rest of you? What type are you?

210
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,820
What am I?

211
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,780
A selfless lover.

212
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,420
I'm a selfless lover.

213
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:43,940
Then you two are a perfect match.

214
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,420
I'm also a selfless lover.

215
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,300
You're a selfless lover too?

216
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,140
Then we're the same.

217
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,380
So it's a friendship lover plus a selfless lover.

218
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,020
Right.

219
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,700
You'll never guess what I am.

220
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,740
I'm a passionate lover.

221
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,140
That proves you have a side we can't see.

222
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,020
That side.

223
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:01,380
Yeah.

224
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,660
When I took the test the first time,

225
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,980
I thought maybe it was a mistake.

226
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,980
So I took it a second time.

227
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,300
And I even deliberately chose a few

228
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,340
different options.

229
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,460
But the result was still the same.

230
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,740
Still a passionate lover.

231
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,820
Don't you think so?

232
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,020
I think

233
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,140
the name it uses

234
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,100
feels a bit too intense for me.

235
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,940
But its description

236
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,500
is accurate.

237
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,500
Yeah.

238
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,100
See, this test helped you discover

239
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,420
a side of yourself that no one knew about.

240
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,100
A second personality.

241
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,540
Passionate Li Dinghao.

242
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,060
Alright.

243
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,580
Let's take a look at the friendship lover.

244
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,820
Brother Xing (Jin Yuxing)

245
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,620
Actually, it feels great.

246
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,060
Brother Hou (Hou Zhuocheng)

247
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,700
It's awesome.

248
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,500
What is a "Sima-nan"?

249
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,380
What does "Sima-nan" mean?

250
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,740
What does "Sima-nan" refer to?

251
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,140
I think it's used to describe a guy

252
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,500
who is extremely handsome.

253
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,460
Like, full of youthful energy.

254
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,300
Just like in a comic.

255
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,020
Like an anime character.

256
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:09,180
That kind of vibe.

257
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,100
"Sima-nan"

258
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,580
It's like he was "torn" out of a comic.

259
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,260
Like a handsome guy who walked straight out of a comic.

260
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:17,580
Got it.

261
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,140
Understood instantly.

262
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:18,940
I get it.

263
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,140
Directly "torn" out of a comic.

264
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:20,860
Here I come.

265
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,620
I'm a "Sima-nan".

266
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,660
That's what it means.

267
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,220
Okay.

268
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,620
I think if a girl says this,

269
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,220
she must be really

270
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,940
praising his looks a lot.

271
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,180
It's a sign of being attracted.

272
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,220
A new female guest.

273
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,700
Ke Ailin

274
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,740
All the names sound so nice.

275
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,660
Ke Ailin

276
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,100
This is how the female lead always makes her entrance.

277
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,380
She has to twist her ankle first.

278
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,500
He said

279
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,460
this girl seems very cheerful.

280
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,340
Very sunny and bright.

281
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,140
Duo Duo (Ke Ailin)

282
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:07,980
is an extrovert.

283
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,700
Actually,

284
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,340
when people first start dating,

285
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,700
the guy usually sits across from the girl.

286
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,620
But now, are you sitting next to each other?

287
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,140
We all sit on the same side.

288
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,020
We basically always sit next to each other.

289
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,620
Yeah.

290
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,140
Yeah, I feel like we've gotten closer.

291
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:21,820
After becoming a couple,

292
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,780
we usually sit on the same side.

293
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,060
Yeah, me too.

294
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,580
Really?

295
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,140
Yes.

296
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,180
Yes.

297
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,060
She said her too.

298
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,620
The third (female guest).

299
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,380
They seem so familiar with each other.

300
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,100
Yeah.

301
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,860
Right, I feel like they—

302
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,940
Actually, the atmosphere is really nice.

303
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,780
Yeah.

304
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,340
It's really great.

305
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,700
I feel like their personalities here—

306
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,540
Maybe that's the reason.

307
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,580
I feel like they're having such a good conversation.

308
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,580
Yeah.

309
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,980
They give off a cool vibe.

310
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,020
Very sharp.

311
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,340
How did this car get up here?

312
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,700
Shut up.

313
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,060
Shut up.

314
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,220
That's not right.

315
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,820
The other side.

316
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,860
This is the other side.

317
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,620
So they're split into two sides as well.

318
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:30,340
Yeah.

319
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,580
It's this bay.

320
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,260
And then another one.

321
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,020
There's another bay.

322
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,180
This design—

323
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,380
Is just like back in our time.

324
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,140
It's the same.

325
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,500
It's divided into two sides.

326
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,140
Some people will—

327
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,380
Meet here first.

328
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,060
And then another group—

329
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,940
Will meet over there.

330
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,980
But actually—

331
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:44,780
The right person—

332
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,060
No matter when you meet them—

333
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:50,940
Just like Oscar and Sun Leyan.

334
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,620
I can't even get a word in now.

335
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,100
Are you guys eating?

336
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,540
Not for now.

337
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:02,980
Thanks.

338
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,260
So cool.

339
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,260
Ruilong

340
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,180
Yes

341
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,780
Is he mixed-race?

342
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,500
I feel like he looks a bit mixed-race.

343
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,900
Don't tell me it's again

344
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,740
Kazakhstan

345
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:31,900
He

346
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,580
can't open it

347
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,420
can't open the bottle cap

348
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,260
No way

349
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,820
That's awkward

350
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,220
He opened it

351
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,620
Tactical drinking

352
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,380
Watching him drink

353
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,740
Is it good?

354
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,500
Is it good?

355
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,300
I feel like the girls aren't nervous

356
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,380
The guys are nervous

357
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:48,700
Yeah

358
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,220
I noticed those two really like to laugh

359
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:51,860
They're always laughing

360
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,340
It's mainly because they're awkward

361
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,220
They laugh when they're awkward

362
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,340
Yeah, they laugh when they're awkward

363
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,260
He was born in Switzerland.

364
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,580
He seems a bit shy.

365
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,660
Here comes another guest.

366
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,980
Fang Yijiong.

367
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,020
Is he a finance guy?

368
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,300
This feels very...

369
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,980
...professional, like a workplace vibe.

370
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,780
Feels like they're about to discuss a contract.

371
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,740
Yeah.

372
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,660
That's right.

373
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,740
It's like he came in wearing business attire.

374
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,820
Like he just came from a meeting at work.

375
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,660
He's drinking again.

376
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,700
He's at it again.

377
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,740
He seems really shy.

378
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,580
He seems very reserved.

379
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,220
But Lanlan (Xu Rulan)...

380
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,940
...has actually been observing them the whole time.

381
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,180
She's always...

382
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,220
...looking straight into their eyes.

383
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,100
And smiling.

384
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,820
Lanlan (Xu Rulan) isn't nervous at all.

385
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,940
She hasn't even taken a sip of water.

386
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,540
You're really...

387
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,700
You're really handsome.

388
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:52,860
Tomo (Zhang Hao).

389
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,100
You're really handsome.

390
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,500
I really am handsome.

391
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,620
Thank you.

392
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,140
You too.

393
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,220
Likewise.

394
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,700
Flat shoes.

395
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,300
Wang Yifan.

396
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,980
Responsible partner.

397
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,820
Such a straight guy.

398
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,060
There's already some tension.

399
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,380
(Maybe) this is actually an inside joke.

400
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,660
A sudden joke out of nowhere.

401
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,860
The fifth (guest)

402
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,220
Newcomer

403
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,220
Quite refreshing

404
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,540
Gives a strong impression

405
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,580
Lanlan (Xu Rulan) is so tall

406
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,900
Did everyone notice?

407
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,660
One meter seventy

408
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:45,580
Yes

409
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,620
Looks like Daqi (Cheng Jingqi)

410
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,420
From this angle

411
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:51,780
Really looks alike

412
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,140
A little bit

413
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,420
Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng)

414
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,660
It's so hard to remember names

415
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,220
I think Ruilong probably

416
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:03,900
might

417
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,780
Ruilong is the most

418
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,980
has the hardest time remembering

419
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,140
Yeah

420
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,820
At first, I also tried

421
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,660
to remember everyone in the house's

422
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,020
maybe age, school

423
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,180
or job and such

424
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,020
but I might not remember

425
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,380
But later I realized

426
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,540
after spending two or three days together

427
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,380
those professions or

428
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,100
labels from the tests aren't important anymore

429
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,340
Yeah

430
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:20,860
What's important is

431
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,500
the feelings I have when spending time with you

432
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,260
I think the atmosphere on both sides

433
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,220
is pretty good.

434
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,220
Some of the guests

435
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,700
actually already have

436
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,780
a basic understanding of each other.

437
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,260
Actually, I think this time

438
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,100
there's a change.

439
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:36,780
It's that when someone arrives,

440
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,300
maybe on an island,

441
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:38,940
everyone has a lot of

442
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,540
new things to experience.

443
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,380
For us,

444
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,900
before, we might have just

445
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,060
had a meal

446
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,620
or gone straight into the cabin.

447
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,140
There weren't that many new

448
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,060
outside stimuli.

449
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:48,700
Yes.

450
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,820
This might make new people

451
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,020
lack topics to talk about.

452
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,060
So it becomes more important

453
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,420
whether there's someone talkative

454
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,660
to take the lead in conversations.

455
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,180
And just now, they were also talking about

456
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,260
traveling.

457
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,300
Has the "Zhuo-Qing" couple traveled anywhere recently?

458
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,420
Previously,

459
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,940
when we went to Jiuhua Mountain,

460
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,860
we also climbed to a very high peak.

461
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,100
We had a lot of feelings about it.

462
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:07,860
It made us feel that

463
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,340
life is about having someone to walk with.

464
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,860
It's best if you move at the same pace.

465
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,060
Then you can reach the top together.

466
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:13,980
Don't go too fast alone,

467
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,660
or have to wait for someone else.

468
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,300
I think hiking is actually

469
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,460
a really good

470
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,020
activity for couples to do while traveling.

471
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,620
I’ve written that down.

472
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:22,620
Okay.

473
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,020
Adding hiking to the travel list.

474
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,300
Alright.

475
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,420
Yes, when we were hiking,

476
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,740
because we hiked for two days,

477
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,740
we were already exhausted after the first day.

478
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,940
Our legs were really sore.

479
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,460
Hou-ge (Hou Zhuocheng) said

480
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,620
Hou-ge (Hou Zhuocheng) said

481
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,940
if I got too tired, he would carry me up the mountain.

482
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,580
Climbing up was already exhausting,

483
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,660
and carrying someone else makes it even harder.

484
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,140
But he still carried me up.

485
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:52,300
It was a really long stairway to heaven.

486
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,380
So romantic.

487
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:00,380
Okay.

488
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:00,900
So let's

489
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,900
also review

490
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,660
the

491
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,420
travel quiz we did.

492
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,420
Let's also share

493
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,420
our answers.

494
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,940
For this one, I chose option B.

495
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:09,420
Option B.

496
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:09,940
Why?

497
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,500
Because I think, like

498
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,540
Yang just said,

499
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,300
actually, a trip can

500
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,060
test a person's character.

501
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:16,300
Right.

502
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,260
And during a trip,

503
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,100
there are actually many

504
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,140
natural topics

505
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,540
that allow everyone to

506
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,660
get involved.

507
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,260
Yes.

508
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,100
Actually, we just look at

509
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,620
which season is less busy,

510
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,700
then we make arrangements,

511
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,700
and then see where we can go.

512
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,460
I was just about to say that too.

513
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,500
It doesn't necessarily have to be

514
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,260
on a special anniversary.

515
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:33,660
Right.

516
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,300
Actually, in daily life,

517
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,100
you can do it anytime.

518
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:35,420
Yes.

519
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,100
Start our trip.

520
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:36,860
That's right.

521
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,780
There are no restrictions.

522
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,060
Both of us chose B (option).

523
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:42,660
We both picked B (option).

524
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,180
We also chose B (option).

525
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,740
Because that's just how we are.

526
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,020
Maybe when we go somewhere,

527
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,180
we just want to relax.

528
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:48,580
Yeah.

529
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,500
When the two of us go somewhere,

530
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,220
it's mainly to unwind.

531
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,340
And maybe

532
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:52,780
one day,

533
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,860
we've already planned the trip,

534
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,180
but the next morning we realize

535
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:55,780
I'm really too tired today.

536
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,340
Too tired, don't want to go.

537
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,740
We'd just cancel the plan.

538
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,380
I support that.

539
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,020
I'm the same way.

540
00:17:59,020 --> 00:17:59,660
That's just like us.

541
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,140
Us too.

542
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,060
When you're out having fun, you should treat yourself well.

543
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:06,900
At the time, I said this.

544
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,700
All four of these make me angry.

545
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,700
What I want to say is,

546
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,980
these are all the same level of anger.

547
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,460
I chose option B.

548
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,460
Why?

549
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,060
I didn't choose B because

550
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:16,980
Qiqi (Wang Qi) has this situation.

551
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,980
I might also be on my phone the whole time.

552
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,060
She would say the same about me.

553
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,780
When you do this,

554
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,580
you should also consider the other person's feelings.

555
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,060
If, during the whole trip,

556
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,220
she prepares everything,

557
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,500
and you only care about yourself,

558
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,100
that's not really okay.

559
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:29,660
Right.

560
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,860
When I see options C and D,

561
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,820
at least I can communicate with the other person.

562
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,540
He wants to spend money,

563
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,300
or maybe he wants to get the best value.

564
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,060
Or maybe it's his previous spending habits.

565
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,500
As for option D, it means not recognizing the effort.

566
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,500
Then we can talk about it.

567
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,660
What did you contribute?

568
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,180
What did I contribute?

569
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,180
What kind of effort do you expect?

570
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,540
I think all of these can be discussed.

571
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,580
But option B just shuts down

572
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,100
the window for communication.

573
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,660
So I think option B is more serious.

574
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,380
Well said.

575
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,660
If I were on Huaniao Island in this situation,

576
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,420
I would buy a boat ticket and leave that very day.

577
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:56,780
Me too.

578
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,860
I’d check the latest boat schedule.

579
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,620
To see when the last one is.

580
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,100
I’d immediately buy a plane ticket to go back.

581
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,100
No need to waste any time.

582
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:02,940
To sum up,

583
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,260
maybe everyone thinks option B

584
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,620
is the one most likely to make you angry.

585
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,460
There’s no need to continue with option B.

586
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,580
You could still continue.

587
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,980
That would be way too forgiving.

588
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,020
We’re about to start

589
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,740
our first mini-game of the day.

590
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,700
Love’s Camera.

591
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:20,820
Each pair

592
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,900
will quickly memorize

593
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,540
and recreate a couple’s photo pose.

594
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,060
They’ll compete on accuracy and teamwork.

595
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,140
In the end, we’ll select

596
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,420
the sweetest pair.

597
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,700
Already standing up.

598
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,620
Then please.

599
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,180
Since you’re all already standing.

600
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:38,740
Come on.

601
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,420
Since everyone’s standing.

602
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,460
The two brothers.

603
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,380
They’re already standing.

604
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,700
Let’s go first.

605
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,300
We’ll go first.

606
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:44,900
It’s fine.

607
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,540
Come on.

608
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,180
We’ll go first.

609
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,220
Our "TO豪" team.

610
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:47,940
We’ll show you how it’s done.

611
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:48,580
Okay.

612
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:49,420
Okay.

613
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,060
So cute.

614
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,700
Has it started?

615
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,420
I already...

616
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:55,860
...started.

617
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,500
Come on.

618
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,380
Did you remember it?

619
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,300
So hard.

620
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,220
Which one is it?

621
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,420
That was too fast.

622
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,060
Do we watch all of it?

623
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:04,980
So fast.

624
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,060
What?

625
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,500
The game is already over.

626
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,180
It ended before it even started.

627
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:11,820
You have to remember all of them.

628
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,580
Let's do it again.

629
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,060
You remember the first three.

630
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:15,660
I'll remember the last three.

631
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,460
Okay.

632
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,140
Okay.

633
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,580
They're all different.

634
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,180
Right.

635
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,500
This is a memory competition.

636
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,580
A contest.

637
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,020
Alright.

638
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,020
Okay.

639
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:30,740
Finished.

640
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,100
Come on, first move.

641
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:36,940
Second.

642
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,100
What am I?

643
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,260
Just do it like me.

644
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,940
The third one is

645
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:46,980
making a heart gesture.

646
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,260
Like this.

647
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:50,740
Right.

648
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,740
Fourth, you—

649
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:52,940
I punch you.

650
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,940
You fly away.

651
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,220
The fifth one is

652
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:00,740
holding one foot.

653
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,580
And then this hand goes like this.

654
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:01,980
Right.

655
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:02,980
And then I am...

656
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,860
That's all, right?

657
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:07,660
Five moves.

658
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,060
I think the second one was wrong.

659
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,340
On my side,

660
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,620
because the moves were different.

661
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,380
You got four points correct.

662
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,780
That's still pretty high.

663
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,580
Yeah.

664
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,060
You only got one wrong.

665
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,380
But I think you imitated really well.

666
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:21,940
Yeah.

667
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,500
How about you guys do all the imitating next?

668
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,060
No.

669
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,140
Our team has already finished the task.

670
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:27,620
Yeah.

671
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,100
Is that okay?

672
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:28,660
It's your turn.

673
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,500
You guys go ahead.

674
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:31,460
Then let's go.

675
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,220
Come on, let's go.

676
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:32,900
Alright.

677
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,380
Good luck!

678
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:35,780
Come on.

679
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,580
Watch and remember.

680
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,540
So sweet.

681
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,460
Theirs is really hard.

682
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,700
The real textbook is here.

683
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:49,860
Okay, let's go.

684
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,460
Foot.

685
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,220
Lift your foot.

686
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,060
Foot.

687
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:00,460
Peace sign.

688
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,060
Okay, face.

689
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,460
The fourth one, kiss.

690
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,700
Give a hug.

691
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,580
Iconic scene.

692
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,060
Here, flowers.

693
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:27,900
Bring the flowers.

694
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,020
Thank you.

695
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,620
Recreating the iconic scene.

696
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:39,900
Perfect answer.

697
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,860
Full marks.

698
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,060
Now the pressure's on us.

699
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,420
Two.

700
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,620
Okay.

701
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,540
I forgot the first one.

702
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:04,980
I really forgot.

703
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,700
It's over.

704
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,180
Like this.

705
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:07,780
Okay.

706
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:08,700
Is it like this?

707
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:09,860
Okay, come on.

708
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,220
One.

709
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,220
Okay, the second one.

710
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:17,980
Let's change the second one.

711
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,620
Because of the dress.

712
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,020
True.

713
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:19,780
We'll adjust it.

714
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,580
I'll turn sideways.

715
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,260
Turn sideways.

716
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,340
Three, two, one.

717
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,300
What is this?

718
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,260
Is this an added move?

719
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,500
The third one.

720
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,300
The third one is this.

721
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:37,660
Yes.

722
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,260
It should be this one.

723
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:38,580
Yes.

724
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,580
It's this one.

725
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,900
What is it?

726
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,500
I don't know.

727
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,220
It's that one.

728
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,020
Then I do this.

729
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,020
Isn't this the first one?

730
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:46,700
The third one.

731
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,140
Really?

732
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,460
Then what is the first one?

733
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,860
It's just a veil.

734
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:50,300
A veil.

735
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,100
Yes, the one with the veil.

736
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,220
So it's like this.

737
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:52,980
Just like this.

738
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,980
It's just that they didn't actually kiss.

739
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,220
But...

740
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,300
Yes.

741
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,740
Okay, the fourth one.

742
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,420
The fourth one is...

743
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:01,860
For the fourth one, I do it like this.

744
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:02,740
Yes.

745
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:12,260
Okay

746
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,260
The fifth one

747
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,340
It's this side

748
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:14,900
Where? That one

749
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,020
This side, the right side

750
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,420
Come

751
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:19,860
Take this

752
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,780
Okay

753
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:21,900
Come

754
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,420
Right

755
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,460
At that time, it was still a kind of

756
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,740
state where I didn't dare to touch it

757
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,260
Three, two, one

758
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,180
Perfect score

759
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:36,980
Perfect score

760
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,980
I think in terms of sweetness,

761
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,100
it must be

762
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,620
the "Yuyan" team that wins.

763
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,060
Yes.

764
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,340
It's just too sweet.

765
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,900
We got one question wrong, right?

766
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,540
Yes.

767
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,780
Let's hand out the stickers.

768
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,500
Thank you all for your recognition.

769
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,060
Thank you, everyone.

770
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,740
Thank you for recognizing our creativity.

771
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,020
Thank you.

772
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,340
Tomo (Zhang Hao)

773
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,820
The moves we did,

774
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,540
you all can do them.

775
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,500
But the moves you did,

776
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,420
he and I can't do them.

777
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,100
What if we could?

778
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:09,860
What if we actually could?

779
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,260
There's no "what if."

780
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,180
Right?

781
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:13,740
She (Wang Qi) said yes.

782
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,940
The two of us just recreated it.

783
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,500
But you two went beyond that.

784
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,820
Seriously, your sweetness

785
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,100
is even sweeter than the reference picture.

786
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,020
So in the end,

787
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,420
newcomers are still better than the veterans.

788
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,420
Then go find a newcomer.

789
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,260
No.

790
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,500
Don't say that.

791
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,820
That's not what he meant.
