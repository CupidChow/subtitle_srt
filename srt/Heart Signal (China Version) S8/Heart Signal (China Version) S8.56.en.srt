1
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,000
What are we doing today?

2
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Today?

3
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,840
Take a guess.

4
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,720
I think we’re doing something sporty today.

5
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,000
How did you know?

6
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,160
That’s all I know though.

7
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:53,960
Horse riding?

8
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,320
Nope.

9
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,360
I have no idea either.

10
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,960
You don’t know?

11
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,840
I don’t believe you.

12
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,440
Hanging upside down in the sky.

13
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,920
A poem.

14
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,040
What English songs have you been listening to lately?

15
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,080
I listen to a lot of English songs.

16
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,280
I have a playlist full of English songs.

17
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,040
All the songs in my playlist are in English.

18
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,040
Yeah, but I’m the type who just listens to the melody.

19
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,520
And then—

20
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,320
I can never remember the song names.

21
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,840
What do you want to listen to?

22
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,320
What do you want to hear?

23
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,400
So I get to pick a song?

24
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,400
Are you a human jukebox or something?

25
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,320
You are.

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,400
Pick one I know.

27
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,080
Pick one you know.

28
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,160
You start.

29
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,120
Maybe I really can sing it.

30
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,000
Wait a sec.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,360
Let me search my “jukebox” first.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,720
Pause right here.

33
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,360
Now’s when I need you.

34
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,640
I’ll hold onto this feeling.

35
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,680
Don’t let it slip away from you.

36
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,280
Is it “let it…” what?

37
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,400
I forgot.

38
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,120
This innocence is so charming.

39
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,240
I’ll hold onto this feeling.

40
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,800
Don’t let it slip away from you.

41
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,560
No, I want to play a song.

42
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,720
Go ahead, you pick.

43
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,200
It’s up to you.

44
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,440
The big responsibility is yours.

45
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,880
Alright.

46
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,240
What do you want to hear?

47
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,640
I want to listen to—

48
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,280
Listen—

49
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,840
Let’s play what you want first.

50
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,040
Then play what I want.

51
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,040
First, play the one you think—

52
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,160
fits the vibe right now.

53
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,400
The song you most want to hear.

54
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,960
So, what should we play?

55
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,960
Do you want something upbeat or—

56
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,160
Just pick based on the mood.

57
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,800
Why do you keep copying me?

58
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,840
What’s wrong?

59
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,680
Back at you.

60
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,360
You really have no opinions of your own.

61
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,920
Hurry up, what do you want to hear?

62
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,240
Let’s start with “Flowers.”

63
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,160
“Flowers.”

64
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,560
I think the intro is really nice.

65
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,840
Aren’t you supposed to be an extrovert?

66
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,760
Why are you acting so introverted?

67
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,160
I can’t sing this one either.

68
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,520
If you pick one I know, I’ll sing.

69
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,560
Then you pick— which ones can you sing?

70
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,160
You’re on the vibe team today, okay?

71
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,800
Alright, I’m on the vibe team.

72
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,560
We all have our roles.

73
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,760
Everyone does their part.

74
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,040
Which team are you on?

75
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,840
I’m on the driving team.

76
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,480
You’re on the driving team.

77
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,480
I’m on the driving team.

78
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,760
Have you ever tried flying a plane yourself?

79
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,720
No.

80
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,560
I want to give it a try.

81
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,360
I remember that.

82
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,240
I think they have it at the general airport.

83
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,480
You want to go?

84
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,520
But the experience is pretty short.

85
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,000
It’s over in about ten minutes.

86
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,320
Just a dozen minutes.

87
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,080
Basically, you take off and land right away.

88
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,760
Yeah.

89
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,040
I have friends learning to fly.

90
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,000
They specifically go to

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,400
Xinjiang to learn flying.

92
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,480
There are flight schools here in Xinjiang.

93
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,080
I want to go to that place.

94
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,920
What’s it called?

95
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,800
Guozigou.

96
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,000
Qingshui River.

97
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,160
Yeah.

98
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,680
There are mountains and grasslands.

99
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,920
I saw it this morning.

100
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,160
Saw it this morning.

101
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,400
Yeah, this morning.

102
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,360
Looking at Xinjiang travel guides.

103
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,920
When I travel,

104
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,400
I really don’t like making plans.

105
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,960
I usually just follow someone else’s plan.

106
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,880
I just tag along.

107
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,640
So you just follow that person.

108
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,640
So you don’t have

109
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,040
It’s impossible to visit every place.

110
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,160
Just go wherever they think is fun.

111
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,160
If I make a plan,

112
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,240
I’ll want to go everywhere on it.

113
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,240
But if I miss a spot,

114
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,160
I’ll feel really regretful.

115
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,280
You’d feel regretful.

116
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:35,560
Yeah.

117
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,400
If I really want to go,

118
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,360
But maybe that day,

119
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,200
It’s either too much traffic,

120
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,200
Or something else comes up.

121
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,160
I’ll just feel regretful.

122
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,600
After working so hard on the plan.

123
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,520
How do you even have that mindset?

124
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,360
Isn’t that a good mindset?

125
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,200
It’s actually pretty good.

126
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,600
No, I want to make plans.

127
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,440
But I don’t care if I go or not.

128
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,080
Then you’re just

129
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,400
Making things complicated for yourself.

130
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,160
So when you go,

131
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,960
Do you follow your plan

132
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,080
and visit every single place?

133
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,840
No, that’s why I never make plans.

134
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,080
Never make plans.

135
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,200
And you’re judging me?

136
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,960
Did you bring your camera?

137
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,640
But I’m not good at taking photos.

138
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,840
I’ve never used a disposable film camera.

139
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,320
It’s really fun.

140
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,440
Just use it in bright sunlight during the day.

141
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,240
Just snap a shot anywhere.

142
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,120
It always looks good.

143
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:15,800
Film photos

144
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,520
look great in sunlight.

145
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,480
If you use the flash,

146
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,520
and shoot up close,

147
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,320
it has a special vibe.

148
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,360
Up close, it makes my face look super oily.

149
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,680
We’re here.

150
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,960
Arrived!

151
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,640
No idea how far this via ferrata goes.

152
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,680
How far can we go?

153
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,080
Hello, coach.

154
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,680
Welcome to Kalajun Via Ferrata.

155
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,480
Hello.

156
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,200
Hi.

157
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,200
Come over here.

158
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,160
This is our via ferrata and zipline area.

159
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,000
Let’s start putting on the gear.

160
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,080
Then get ready for the activity.

161
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,880
Okay.

162
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,680
Here are two sets of gear.

163
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,320
When you’re facing forward,

164
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,040
Put your left and right foot in.

165
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,480
Just pull it up like pants.

166
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,000
Lift this part up and you’re good.

167
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,120
So just put it on, right?

168
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,800
Yeah.

169
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,360
Then step into that.

170
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:08,960
Right foot too.

171
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,480
Right.

172
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,480
Then pull this up.

173
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,680
I have to make sure you’re safe.

174
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,880
What if I can’t hold you?

175
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,760
Then hold on tighter.

176
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,200
Leg strap

177
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,520
This one

178
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,080
Pull my pants down a bit here

179
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,600
Pull it down, right?

180
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,160
Yeah

181
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,920
Okay

182
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,800
Good thing I'm wearing shorts

183
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,280
Alright, that's about right

184
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,760
Push your hair back

185
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,960
Alright

186
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,720
Okay, you're good

187
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,320
You can put on your own gear now

188
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,000
Okay

189
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,680
I'll put mine on first

190
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,520
I'm here for revenge

191
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,280
Don't

192
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,640
Wearing long sleeves and pants is a smart choice

193
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,720
All covered up, I predicted this

194
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,640
Seems a bit chilly outside

195
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,280
What's in your pocket?

196
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,080
Why is it so stuffed?

197
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,560
Snacks

198
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,720
Sneaking snacks

199
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,840
Nice

200
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,480
Turn to the right

201
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,360
Ready?

202
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,000
Master

203
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,360
Stop chanting

204
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,640
Come on, let's get ready to go in

205
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,160
Can I push her away?

206
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,000
Sure, push after I clip in

207
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,560
Can I push without clipping in?

208
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,760
Can I push without clipping in?

209
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,600
See you in court

210
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,840
If I survive

211
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:23,960
Receiving point

212
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,880
Starting point ready

213
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,200
Go ahead, give her a push

214
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,080
Just push

215
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,920
Go for it

216
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,800
Go for it

217
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,520
Okay

218
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,720
I'm about to fly over

219
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,840
Such a big impact

220
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,080
I'm a bit heavy

221
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,960
You don't have to say that out loud, bro

222
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:14,960
Not heavy

223
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,480
All set?

224
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,360
Let's go

225
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,760
Successfully finished today's

226
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,600
last activity

227
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,040
They must be jealous

228
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,040
Who else gets to have this much excitement?

229
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,320
Who else gets to be like us?

230
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,000
Jerk

231
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Jerk

232
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,760
Can you do it or not?

233
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,440
I can

234
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,680
Locking up again

235
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,760
Try not locking for once

236
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,040
You're always scheming to mess with me

237
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,640
So good.

238
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,520
We're back.

239
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,840
Treat me to barbecue tonight.

240
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,280
Let's go.

241
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,240
Campfire dinner.

242
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,960
Do you know where we're going tomorrow?

243
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,160
Where do you want to go? Make a wish.

244
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,320
I wish to go to the grasslands.

245
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,080
You want to go to the grasslands?

246
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,400
Yeah.

247
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,160
You want to ride a horse?

248
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:10,920
I want to.

249
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,840
You want to film a transition shot?

250
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,200
I didn't get the transition shot today.

251
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,200
Such a pity.

252
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,600
Sure.

253
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,880
Polaroid film.

254
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,080
I only have one left.

255
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,240
Didn't bring enough.

256
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,200
I'll save it for you.

257
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,760
Take a look.

258
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,280
You're still the prettiest.

259
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,360
You're still the prettiest.

260
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,360
You're absolutely stunning.

261
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,160
Of course.

262
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,600
Three essentials for portraits.

263
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,440
That's what I have.

264
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,560
The photographer's not that great.

265
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,480
The model's good though.

266
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,000
Who are you dissing?

267
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,680
The model's good.

268
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,760
These two photos really don't look like me.

269
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,080
Don't you think so?

270
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,840
Let me see.

271
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,000
Totally doesn't look like me.

272
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,560
Yeah, kind of doesn't.

273
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,280
Right?

274
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,560
Maybe it's the angle.

275
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:50,840
This one looks like you.

276
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,640
Some people...

277
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,560
...change their hearts.

278
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,280
This one looks like you.

279
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,280
Some people...

280
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:55,760
...change their hearts.

281
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,920
What do you mean, change their hearts?

282
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,880
I want to see the photos.

283
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,360
See how my skills are.

284
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,440
Should be fine.

285
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,520
All taken with my phone, right?

286
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,480
I took a few myself.

287
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,440
Why are there so many selfies?

288
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,600
Just snapped them casually.

289
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,440
Don't they look good?

290
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,560
They look good.

291
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,160
I need to study them carefully.

292
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,960
It's still so unbelievable.

293
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,120
What's so unbelievable?

294
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,000
How did we end up here?

295
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,480
How did we end up in Xinjiang?

296
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,000
Such a surreal day.

297
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,960
Turns out my heart is dark.

298
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,080
Don't diss me.

299
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,720
I didn't diss you.

300
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,120
Don't secretly roast me in your mind.

301
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,760
Well, I did roast you.

302
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,600
Tomorrow.

303
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,000
Hope it's sunny.

304
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,640
Depends on your mood.

305
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,960
If I'm in a good mood, it's sunny.

306
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,800
Even the weather listens to your mood.

307
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,400
Anywhere you want to go tomorrow?

308
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,240
I'll make a wish for you.

309
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,760
My wishes are pretty effective.

310
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,520
Tomorrow.

311
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,080
Let's go wherever you want.

312
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,960
If we don't get this transition shot,

313
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,600
we probably can't leave Xinjiang.

314
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,760
That's a deal.

315
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,080
You have to help me edit the video too.

316
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,200
I have to help you edit the video too?

317
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,920
Yep.

318
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,680
Alright.

319
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,040
You're scratching your head.

320
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,600
Is it that complicated?

321
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,200
All the pressure's on you.

322
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,160
It's tough being a guy.

323
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,480
I get it.

324
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,120
Why are you staring at me?

325
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,360
Not saying a word.

326
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,360
I'm a bit dazed.

327
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm a bit dazed.

328
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,840
Driving for two hours made me spaced out.

329
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,640
No, driving's fine.

330
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,320
I don't think driving is tiring.

331
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,160
Go back and get a good sleep.

332
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,840
As long as someone's chatting, it's not tiring.

333
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,160
This is a hand-pulled feast.

334
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,400
So how do you eat this dish?

335
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,440
Why is this naan so hard?

336
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,640
I want to eat some naan.

337
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,560
Break off a piece for me.

338
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,040
Can my appetite really handle this much?

339
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,680
This piece of chicken is huge.

340
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,920
How am I supposed to bite into this?

341
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,080
This one's small, and so is this one.

342
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,600
Thanks.

343
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,600
I'm full.

344
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,720
Really?

345
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,360
You seem to be slowing down.

346
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,480
I think you're full.

347
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,880
You caught me.

348
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,400
So every time you think I eat a lot,

349
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,920
it's actually because you eat too fast, okay?

350
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,360
I really eat fast.

351
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,280
Eating fast doesn't seem to be good.

352
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,120
It's bad for digestion.

353
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,720
Like eating while watching something.

354
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,960
When I'm on my phone while eating.

355
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,480
I finish eating before the show even starts.

356
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,040
Just now.

357
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,760
Just started.

358
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,280
The opening credits aren't even over.

359
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,200
And I'm already done eating.

360
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,200
In your memory now,

361
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,240
are there any special moments in your life

362
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,520
important moments?

363
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,560
Important moments.

364
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,560
When I was little,

365
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,080
I guess I was pretty brave.

366
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,000
I was braver as a kid.

367
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,880
Yeah.

368
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,560
Seems true.

369
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,480
Your childhood personality

370
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,960
can be totally different from now.

371
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,400
Am I not brave now?

372
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,240
Brave.

373
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,800
Half-hearted.

374
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,760
Way too brave.

375
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,440
When you guys were kids,

376
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,120
did your school subscribe to magazines?

377
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,760
I usually read

378
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,920
YiLin and Reader.

379
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,080
Our school used to get

380
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,080
Middle Schoolers' World.

381
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,640
Yeah, we had that too.

382
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,720
I was on the cover once.

383
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,240
I saw the sign-up info back then.

384
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,280
I just went for it without thinking.

385
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,240
I feel like I've always been pretty bold.

386
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,240
If I want to do something, I just do it.

387
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,840
That was your own idea, right?

388
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:03,760
Yeah.

389
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,880
I just saw it.

390
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,520
You subscribed to Middle Schoolers' World in elementary school?

391
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,520
No, in middle school.

392
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,440
When I was in eighth grade.

393
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,920
You were in eighth grade?

394
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,960
Bro, by then

395
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,560
I was already in college.

396
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,120
I had already graduated college.

397
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,520
Next time, you can

398
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,360
show me that cover.

399
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,240
No way.

400
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,760
Why not?

401
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,440
It's ugly.

402
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,520
They picked a really ugly one.

403
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,960
The internet

404
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,760
is full of memories.

405
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,560
All the internet dirt is

406
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,560
I’ll definitely look for it.

407
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,440
Is there a digital version?

408
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,560
What year were you in eighth grade?

409
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,360
Don’t ask.

410
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,560
Eight years ago.

411
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,240
Right?

412
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,760
Are you really coughing or faking it?

413
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,680
It’s the spice.

414
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,040
Back in elementary school,

415
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,040
I was pretty much like that too.

416
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,480
Super brave.

417
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,560
You were super brave as a kid.

418
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,120
Elementary school.

419
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,240
Really?

420
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,040
Whenever there was an event at school,

421
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,360
I’d always join.

422
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,440
Yeah.

423
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,640
I wanted to be the best at everything.

424
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,680
The science festival had lots of activities, right?

425
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,440
I wanted to do them all.

426
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,320
And be the best at it.

427
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,040
Always aiming for the top.

428
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,440
And then

429
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,560
The most embarrassing part was

430
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,880
when I went up to get my award,

431
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,920
and ran down,

432
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,480
I tripped.

433
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,920
I fell.

434
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,320
In front of the whole school.

435
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,760
I fell.

436
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,560
You’re hilarious.

437
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:22,920
Well,

438
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,920
the way I fell was really

439
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,520
funny.

440
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,640
I was running fast,

441
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,920
turned a corner,

442
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,480
You were pretty bold back then.

443
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,480
You went up and did a drift.

444
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,960
This “dark history”

445
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,560
is stuck in my mind.

446
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,520
Let’s go, let’s head back.

447
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:41,960
Sure.

448
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,160
Let’s look forward to tomorrow’s wishes.

449
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,160
Come on.

450
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:50,680
Let’s go.

451
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,960
Have you ever been to Nanxun?

452
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,800
Never.

453
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:55,760
You have?

454
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,320
I’m the only one here who hasn’t.

455
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,480
That’s great.

456
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,320
Three tour guides with different perspectives.

457
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,080
Plus, we have two photographers.

458
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,400
True.

459
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,200
They’re all proven photographers.

460
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,560
Proven to not be that good, though.

461
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,360
Really?

462
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,000
You’re being modest.

463
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,480
Excuse me, could we get a fork?

464
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,960
And another fork and a knife, please.

465
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,640
Thank you.

466
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,560
I said in the car today, if you didn’t come,

467
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,280
I’d go to Hangzhou to find you.

468
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,760
I’d definitely come.

469
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,080
I’d pick you up.

470
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,440
Or drag you over.

471
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,760
Then you all should just come to Hangzhou.

472
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,720
I vaguely remember you

473
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,520
living somewhere,

474
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,440
so I’d just go to that district to find you.

475
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,680
If I find you, I won’t be the only one.

476
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,480
Wang Jue would come too.

477
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,560
That’s great.

478
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,720
Did you just take a taxi here?

479
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,000
What happened to your hand?

480
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,280
I was cutting fruit today

481
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,200
and got distracted.

482
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,960
I cut my finger.

483
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,120
Were you distracted thinking about me?

484
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,400
Of course.

485
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,120
What else could it be?

486
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,880
Then tonight, we should really

487
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,640
have a good chat.

488
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,000
Sure.

489
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,840
Thanks.

490
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,760
Just scoop it.

491
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,280
Here.

492
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,400
Thanks.

493
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,320
Thank you.

494
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,080
You’re welcome.

495
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,080
Eat more.

496
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:32,920
Thanks.

497
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,200
What's this red thing?

498
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:39,960
Cherry tomato.

499
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,000
Thanks.

500
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,640
You're welcome.

501
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,360
Is that meat tasty?

502
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,240
Fork.

503
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:03,800
Okay.

504
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,400
Let's go.

505
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,360
They have tiramisu here you can order.

506
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,600
I'll go get some.

507
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,280
Let's go together.

508
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,040
I think there will be some snacks here.

509
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,000
There's a litter of tiny kittens.

510
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,440
Just born.

511
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,240
They're super tiny, yeah.

512
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,560
That one is really fierce.

513
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,600
That one.

514
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,840
That's the mom.

515
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,840
This one.

516
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,880
This kind, blue-golden shaded.

517
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,040
It's got a bit of blue.

518
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,320
The others are all golden shaded.

519
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,200
That one should be

520
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,040
golden point.

521
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,200
Brother Jiao, look at that one.

522
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,200
The one up there.

523
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,240
It's sleeping so peacefully.

524
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,040
That state of mind is enviable.

525
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,760
I wish I could sleep like that at night.

526
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,640
Let's sit for a bit.

527
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,560
So cute.

528
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,600
I really like how it

529
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,600
seems so curious about the world.

530
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,880
It's already exploring the world at this age.

531
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,480
I just think

532
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,680
if you can always keep

533
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,560
a certain level of

534
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,400
curiosity about the world,

535
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,200
that would be great.

536
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,560
If we didn't have work the next day,

537
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,200
just sitting outside until evening

538
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,120
would be so relaxing.

539
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:33,920
Yeah.

540
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,040
It'd be even better if it didn't rain.

541
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,600
Right, no rain would be perfect.

542
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,280
Or I think

543
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,600
if the rain comes and goes,

544
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,640
that's nice too.

545
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,560
I think the grilled sausages should be ready.

546
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,560
Hello.

547
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,760
Excuse me, how much longer will it take?

548
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,920
Five to ten minutes.

549
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,680
Five to ten minutes.

550
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,440
Okay, thank you.

551
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,080
Some need to be fried.

552
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:50,720
Alright.

553
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,320
Thanks.

554
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,120
Let's go get the sausages first.

555
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,400
Since it's five to ten minutes, let's grab them first.

556
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:54,920
Let's go.

557
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,440
Yeah.

558
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,320
Hi.

559
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,240
Is the order we just placed ready?

560
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,680
We're waiting for you.

561
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,000
Otherwise, it'll get cold and won't taste good.

562
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,560
So you're waiting for us?

563
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:03,920
Okay.

564
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,200
Do you eat cilantro and chili?

565
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,880
This tofu.

566
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,360
Yes, I do.

567
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,320
We eat everything.

568
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,320
Add extra cilantro too.

569
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,280
Right.

570
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,480
Why don't you sit inside?

571
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,160
Sure.

572
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:13,640
Okay.

573
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,760
Alright, let's sit inside.

574
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:15,920
Let's go.

575
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,800
There are so many things hanging here.

576
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,480
Little handmade crafts.

577
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,720
I'll bring it over to you.

578
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,440
Done.

579
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,320
All set.

580
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,080
Alright, let's go together.

581
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:29,640
Let's go, all together.

582
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,200
Here.

583
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:30,880
Let me carry this.

584
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,600
Careful, it's hot.

585
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,200
Okay.

586
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,880
Thank you.

587
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:36,680
Let's go.

588
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,600
Actually, the two of us

589
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,160
haven't spent much time together.

590
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:42,920
From the start,

591
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,440
the first and second day,

592
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,920
we went to Huaniao Island.

593
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,840
Then we split up between the first and second floor.

594
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,480
We didn't even sit together at the dinner.

595
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,400
Our seats at the dinner

596
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,720
barely let us talk at all.

597
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,920
Yeah, Wang Jue was sitting between us.

598
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,440
Wang Jue would say,

599
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,320
"Guess it's my fault!"

600
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,920
Hello, is our food ready?

601
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,040
Great, thank you.

602
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,560
Let's head out.

603
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,240
They've probably been waiting for a while.

604
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,160
I bet it's been almost an hour.

605
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,400
They probably think we left.

606
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,160
They really think we're eating at that place.

607
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,720
And bringing food back for them after.

608
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,680
Yeah, we could say that.

609
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,000
They should be inside.

610
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,800
Sorry for the wait.

611
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,600
Sorry.

612
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,680
We bought a bit too much.

613
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,280
Here are the stir-fried dishes and ribs.

614
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,960
Suddenly, I really regret it.

615
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,240
I just ate a lot of cat ear snacks.

616
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,040
Seriously.

617
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,240
Put them together, I want to take a photo.

618
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:40,520
Okay.

619
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,360
These are such wonderful memories.

620
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,440
Let's ask someone else to take our picture.

621
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,000
Alright.

622
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,360
Come on.

623
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,560
Come on.

624
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,600
No more smiling.

625
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,360
Come on.

626
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,120
Three.

627
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:52,920
Two.

628
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,720
One.

629
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,800
Okay, let's take another one.

630
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,920
I'll hold up a tangyuan.

631
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,440
Okay.

632
00:22:59,440 --> 00:22:59,960
Let's take another one.

633
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,640
One more.

634
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,480
Another one.

635
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,160
One more.

636
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,800
Girls always worry there aren't enough photo options.

637
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,960
Gotta have a higher margin for error.

638
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,560
Okay.

639
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,240
Three.

640
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:09,840
Two.

641
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,560
One.

642
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,200
Thank you.

643
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:14,760
Thanks.

644
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,760
Time to dig in.

645
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,560
It's my first time eating yellow sesame tangyuan.

646
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,240
Really?

647
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,320
I've never had yellow tangyuan before.

648
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:27,960
Me neither.

649
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:28,960
Same here.

650
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,160
They're always white.

651
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,320
Have you ever tried that black stinky tofu?

652
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,640
Yeah, I have.

653
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,640
I like eating stinky stuff.

654
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,320
You think this isn't stinky enough?

655
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,960
Want me to smoke it for you?

656
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,880
Use that banana and red dates.

657
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:50,840
Smoke it a bit.

658
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,400
The two of us,

659
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,840
are just super funny.

660
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,400
We keep saying,

661
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,440
Should we eat this?

662
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,120
No idea.

663
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,160
Should we eat this?

664
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,520
No clue.

665
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,560
And in the end, we just said,

666
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,280
It's fine.

667
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,360
If you two don't eat, we will.

668
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,240
This one.

669
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:04,680
These two.

670
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,720
We've been worried about them for ages.

671
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,040
Well, you already bought them.

672
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,080
It's all food anyway.

673
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,400
Are the three of us

674
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,200
friendship-type lovers?

675
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:14,920
I am.

676
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,840
We're friendship-type lovers.

677
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:21,960
Don't mention me.

678
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,880
Don't bring me up.

679
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,080
Don't mention me.

680
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,840
Don't bring me up.

681
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,680
Just leave it at that.

682
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,120
No need to say more.

683
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,360
Dr. Fang, I know yours.

684
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,960
Dr. Fang, I know yours.

685
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,320
Can you not say that?

686
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,280
It's hard to forget.

687
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:43,960
But you insist on saying it.

688
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,560
You just have to say it.

689
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,200
You just have to say it.

690
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,520
Brother Jiao has the highest laugh threshold.

691
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,280
He really doesn't laugh easily.

692
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:55,600
Yeah.

693
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,200
He's honestly a really serious person.

694
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,480
I think in our little house,

695
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,240
who's the most serious?

696
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:02,880
Do you guys know?

697
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,920
When we're talking,

698
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,000
Me.

699
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,160
Eat more tangyuan.

700
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,560
He actually

701
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,360
"chews over" what others say.

702
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,840
Then he seriously thinks it over and over.

703
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:19,760
Jin Yuxing.

704
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,400
Jin Yuxing.

705
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:20,960
Jin Yuxing.

706
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,320
Yeah.

707
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:21,840
Jin Yuxing.

708
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,920
At the dinner, I sat next to him.

709
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,600
I really noticed

710
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,320
Jin Yuxing is

711
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:25,920
someone who listens to others

712
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,560
very carefully.

713
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,520
Yeah, that's right.

714
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,680
I want to eat.

715
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,520
Which one do you want?

716
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,320
I'm fine with any.

717
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:34,880
You pick first.

718
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,480
Spoon.

719
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:39,720
This one.

720
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,280
Okay.

721
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,160
Then this one's fine too.

722
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
It's pretty tasty.

723
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,240
I haven't had ice cream in ages.

724
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,040
It tastes like the kind I had as a kid.

725
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,560
That classic ice cream vibe.

726
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,520
I used to love eating it when I was little.

727
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,560
I really liked that kind.

728
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,160
The "three-flavor cup."

729
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,680
I loved the "three-flavor cup."

730
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,800
And those "little snowman" ones.

731
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,200
Yeah.

732
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,640
I really liked them.

733
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,160
I have to say,

734
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,960
I don't like "Green Tongue" popsicles.

735
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,360
Me neither, I don't like them.

736
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,960
I'm not into green stuff like that.

737
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,880
I actually like "Green Tongue."

738
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,200
I think the texture is great.

739
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,000
Even though it doesn't have much flavor.

740
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,480
But the texture is nice.

741
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,960
Then you probably like

742
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,640
mung beans,

743
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,040
mung bean cakes,

744
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,480
and popsicles.

745
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,360
Yeah.

746
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,320
Yeah, especially mung bean cakes.

747
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:20,920
Those, I...

748
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,960
I think those are alright.

749
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,080
Mung bean cakes are pretty good.

750
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,560
When I was a kid, I loved the red bean ones.

751
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,320
And also those...

752
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,360
The ones with two sections, and then...

753
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:29,960
crushed ice pops.

754
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,960
Those ice pops, I just...

755
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,120
I really didn't like them either.

756
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:32,720
You didn't like them?

757
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,440
I'm not into fruity or colorful stuff.

758
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,320
I think chocolate should just be

759
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,440
dark.

760
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,040
Yeah.

761
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,320
What about you, Brother Jiao?

762
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,360
I kind of forgot.

763
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,640
(Brother Jiao says) You tagged me?

764
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,160
He wasn't part of this conversation.

765
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,840
Left the group chat.

766
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,840
I guess I just didn't eat that much.

767
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,240
When I was a kid,

768
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,240
I especially liked

769
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,960
saving the best ice cream for last.

770
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,120
I'm the opposite.

771
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,640
When I eat, whether it's food or ice cream,

772
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,640
I always eat the best part first.

773
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:01,720
Me too.

774
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,240
I like to eat the best stuff first.

775
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,320
Because when you're the hungriest,

776
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,280
you should eat the tastiest thing.

777
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:06,760
Then I'm just like you.

778
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,680
I save the good stuff for last.

779
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,440
And then...

780
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,240
someone else ends up eating it.

781
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:10,720
Yeah.

782
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,240
Exactly.

783
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,760
That's not okay.

784
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,560
Other kids would come over

785
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,320
and end up eating your stuff.

786
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,240
That can't be allowed.

787
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,520
I'm done eating.

788
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,320
I'm so full.

789
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,040
Did you two gain any weight?

790
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:26,800
Lost weight.

791
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,440
I think both of them look slimmer.

792
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,960
Probably lost a few pounds.

793
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,760
That's great.

794
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,520
So jealous.

795
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,120
That's awesome.

796
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:32,400
Jealous.

797
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,600
The two of us have great digestion.

798
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,320
Seriously.

799
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,040
Actually, I

800
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,640
used to have trouble digesting and absorbing food.

801
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,600
But being here every day,

802
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,960
the food is just too good.

803
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,440
Even if you can't absorb it, you have to.

804
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,800
There's delicious food every day.

805
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:44,760
And then there's Jin Yuxing,

806
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,200
he always brings back snacks.

807
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,080
Dr. Fang

808
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,040
also brought a bunch of food.

809
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,080
You brought a ton of snacks too.

810
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:49,720
Wang Yifan

811
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,800
On the first or second day,

812
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,640
she started bringing food too.

813
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,160
Yeah.

814
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:53,960
Let's go.

815
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,920
Let's go.

816
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,440
Time to sleep.

817
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,240
Getting ready to eat like crazy.

818
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,640
I'm already hungry.

819
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,000
I'm starving.

820
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,080
They always talked about the one in Beijing

821
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:15,720
The wildlife park is super fun

822
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,840
But I’ve never been

823
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,600
It’s too far

824
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,720
I haven’t even been to the Shanghai Wildlife Park

825
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,240
Which district is it in

826
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,360
Is it in Pudong

827
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,320
I don’t remember

828
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,120
But I think it’s

829
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,720
In the opposite direction from the Shanghai Zoo

830
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,040
Because I’ve only been to the Shanghai Zoo

831
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,920
Chimelong is fun

832
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,040
The one in Guangzhou

833
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,640
Do you like dipping fries in ketchup

834
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,760
I have to dip them

835
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,960
I don’t like ketchup

836
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,320
I always eat them plain

837
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:45,960
“Plain flavor gang”

838
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,000
So you want to

839
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,680
You want to experience that

840
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,760
Oil, salt, and potato starch

841
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,040
That original mix

842
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,440
When you eat fries

843
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,200
You make it feel Michelin-level, huh

844
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,600
What about potato chips

845
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,440
Do you prefer plain chips or

846
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,240
I like lime flavor

847
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,040
Lime flavor

848
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,600
I really love chips

849
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,240
I love all potato products

850
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,960
Mashed potatoes

851
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:15,960
Love them

852
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,920
I’ve even tried making them myself

853
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,040
How did it turn out

854
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,280
Pretty close, I guess

855
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:22,880
You could say

856
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,960
Looks like you really know your cooking

857
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,760
You’ve done your research

858
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,200
Right

859
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,360
I have a coworker who always

860
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,000
Uses me as an example and interrupts me

861
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,280
Do you laugh easily

862
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,000
If it hits my spot, I laugh at anything

863
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,440
Very easily

864
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,760
What usually makes you laugh

865
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,960
You can’t really explain it

866
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,040
I can’t describe it

867
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,400
I’m really curious

868
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,720
When you first met us

869
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,680
Did you think

870
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,720
What kind of person am I
