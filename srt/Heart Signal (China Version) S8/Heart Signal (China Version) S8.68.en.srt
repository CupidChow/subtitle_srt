1
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,000
Let's go out today

2
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,240
and explore the old town.

3
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:47,800
Sure.

4
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:48,920
Is that okay?

5
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,920
This is sweeter than a donut.

6
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,440
Turn.

7
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,560
Those two...

8
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,880
This is even sweeter than a donut.

9
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,240
Here they come.

10
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,160
I'm so excited.

11
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,160
It's the final moment.

12
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,680
So beautiful.

13
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,720
You're like my

14
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,160
afterimage.

15
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,320
Maybe all of you

16
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,720
is already imprinted on my retina.

17
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,680
I also want

18
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,160
right now

19
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,040
to step into your real life

20
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,160
and get to know

21
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,400
more sides of you.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,640
Then let's create more

23
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,120
shared memories together.

24
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,000
Xu Rulan

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,520
I'm here.

26
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,480
I like you.

27
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,520
Will you be my girlfriend?

28
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,320
That's so sincere.

29
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,760
I like you.

30
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,240
I truly do.

31
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,440
You deserve it.

32
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,640
If I don't try to walk

33
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,600
through these mountains and rivers with you,

34
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,680
turning them into memories for us,

35
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,240
it would be my biggest regret.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,320
That really touched me.

37
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:14,920
Well said.

38
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,560
What will these two do?

39
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,560
I'm so nervous.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,480
The biggest mystery this season.

41
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,480
It's here.

42
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,440
Who is it?

43
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,840
The biggest mystery this season.

44
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,040
Hello?

45
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:18,880
Hello?

46
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,240
Hello?

47
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,520
What do you mean?

48
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,600
Do you need to guess who I am?

49
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,040
No need.

50
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,920
Friends,

51
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,720
when I first met you,

52
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,640
you said you were sincere.

53
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,720
I thought,

54
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,280
who says they're sincere

55
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,720
right from the start?

56
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,160
So my guard

57
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,520
went up immediately.

58
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,760
Too honest.

59
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,160
Yeah.

60
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,040
And then,

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,720
after getting closer to you,

62
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,080
I realized

63
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,840
you're actually very gentle.

64
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,760
And so thoughtful.

65
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,640
You supported me so well.

66
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,040
Compared to you,

67
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,520
I'm the more careless one.

68
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,680
But

69
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,720
I want you to believe

70
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,640
I'm also sincere

71
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,160
and responsible for my own heart.

72
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,880
Someone who is true to their heart.

73
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,120
I have to stand up to watch this.

74
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,400
Even if our go-kart speeds

75
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,840
aren't the same,

76
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,200
we've reached the finish line.

77
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,520
It's also a new beginning.

78
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,800
So on the road ahead,

79
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,160
will you ride in the same car with me?

80
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,640
Will you ride in the same car with me?

81
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,000
Yes.

82
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,720
Yes.

83
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,720
No problem.

84
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,400
Look at him.

85
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,280
He did it.

86
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,520
This is just...

87
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,640
Then I'll wait for you at Heart Island.

88
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,920
Heart Island

89
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,200
Okay, no problem.

90
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,800
See you soon.

91
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,280
See you soon.

92
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,840
Zihan finally breathes a sigh of relief.

93
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,200
Let's go, buddy.

94
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,640
Go! Zihan starts running.

95
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,280
So happy.

96
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,280
So fast.

97
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:07,920
He's kind of like

98
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,080
winning coins in a game.

99
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,640
So much joy.

100
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,160
Can't stop smiling.

101
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,920
Heart Island

102
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,920
It's not easy.

103
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You look beautiful today.

104
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,360
Actually, you look beautiful every day.

105
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,080
Thank you.

106
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,480
Such a big bear.

107
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,240
Big Bear.

108
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,200
Wait, let me catch my breath.

109
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,800
Did you run here?

110
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,560
Wait.

111
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,280
I actually want one too.

112
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,560
Congratulations.

113
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,440
It's just...

114
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,160
Finally,

115
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,000
you've finished all the levels.

116
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,960
You've reached

117
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,080
this final moment.

118
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,200
This is your prize.

119
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,720
Thank you.

120
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:28,800
Thank you.

121
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,880
From the mystery person,

122
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,000
it's an extension of our park date.

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,800
This is the final level.

124
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,640
It's me, yes.

125
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,520
So, as usual,

126
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,600
there's still a card.

127
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,040
I want you to see it.

128
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,320
Actually,

129
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,960
it's also

130
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,720
today's

131
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,960
three

132
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,760
of your best qualities.

133
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,320
Three strengths.

134
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,880
I think the last one especially

135
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:54,720
Look.

136
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,160
Yeah.

137
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,840
What do you think?

138
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,920
You mean I have courage?

139
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,200
We both have courage.

140
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,080
That's what I meant.

141
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,320
And then,

142
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,400
this flower

143
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,320
actually

144
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,000
I think pink

145
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,480
roses

146
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,560
actually represent

147
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,880
undying love.

148
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,440
Undying love.

149
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,640
Right, and then the second prize

150
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,440
is actually

151
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,080
a big

152
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,680
Golden Retriever plush

153
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,120
because you said you like big dogs

154
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,840
and

155
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,800
I think this kind of big dog

156
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,760
really can give you a sense of security

157
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,760
From now on, I'll be your "Big Bear"

158
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,440
I think Golden Retrievers are really

159
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,320
caring

160
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,320
And if there's a chance

161
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,000
if

162
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,400
when you

163
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,320
miss me, you can

164
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:05,800
if I'm not around

165
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,480
you can hug it

166
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,440
Yeah

167
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,720
Let's just

168
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,920
put this here for now

169
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,760
It's really huge

170
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,560
Big means more comfort

171
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,440
Right?

172
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,080
Can you hold the flowers for me?

173
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,880
Sure

174
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,520
I

175
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,240
I also brought you some gifts

176
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,680
First, a bag of these

177
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,040
And I wrote you a letter

178
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,800
And I wrote you a letter

179
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,520
You can open it first

180
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,160
Read it now

181
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,280
If you don't mind

182
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,320
I can read it to you

183
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,480
That would be great

184
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,680
Go ahead

185
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,120
I'll start now

186
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,400
Go ahead

187
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,720
Hello, Liu Zihan

188
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:58,720
Hello

189
00:09:59,640 --> 00:09:59,960
Why does this feel like

190
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,560
wedding vows?

191
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,080
Actually, our story began with

192
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,160
"He must have picked randomly"

193
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,280
(the special invitation)

194
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,560
I'm someone who

195
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,800
never believes good things will happen

196
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,840
always worries too much

197
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,680
always stays skeptical

198
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,600
Because I always think

199
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,680
predicting everything in advance

200
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,040
is the only way I feel safe

201
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,880
In life

202
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,600
I'm used to being cautious

203
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,040
always on alert

204
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,480
and stubbornly believe

205
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,480
this is the best way to protect myself

206
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,240
Later, I realized

207
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,960
I was actually shutting myself off

208
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,680
But come on, I'm

209
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,320
such an adventurous person

210
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,640
Yeah

211
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,520
So

212
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,680
I started trying to

213
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,160
install a video doorbell

214
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,320
watching closely

215
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,800
while taking steps forward

216
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,120
Please forgive my slow realizations

217
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,920
I've always said I want to find

218
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,520
someone who matches and complements me

219
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,720
When I realized we might

220
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,160
be similar people

221
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,040
I hesitated

222
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,520
because I thought like attracts like

223
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,520
and was afraid of clashing

224
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,360
But our biggest similarity is

225
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,520
we're both genuine and lively

226
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,720
That day, we talked about one wanting the snow mountains

227
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,200
and the other wanting the desert

228
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,600
You said you just want to be together

229
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,720
so we could find a place with both snow mountains

230
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,880
and deserts

231
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,080
I don't want either of us

232
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,600
to lose ourselves in this relationship

233
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,920
Thinking about it now

234
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,200
maybe that's what you meant by "evenly matched"

235
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,160
What I used to fear most

236
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,040
was singing and dancing in public

237
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,960
But that night at Qiandao Lake

238
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,000
I was the most relaxed and happy

239
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,800
I think it's because you were there

240
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,000
You gave me the confidence

241
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,400
to truly be myself

242
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,800
Sometimes I feel like you have

243
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,160
x-ray vision

244
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,080
When I'm conflicted

245
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,680
you instantly understand me

246
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,360
Even the questions I don't ask

247
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,400
you can answer them

248
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,160
so clearly

249
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,840
That spark is in all those

250
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,280
moments that bloom

251
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,520
in our determined journey together

252
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,120
It's what we've both hoped for

253
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,080
So I'm grateful for this journey

254
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,960
that led me to you

255
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,280
Thank you

256
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,400
I'm touched

257
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,520
There's one more letter

258
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,360
Thank you

259
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,960
You can open this one yourself

260
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:16,720
Okay

261
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,360
You're good at writing letters too

262
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:19,920
Am I?

263
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,800
She's really thoughtful

264
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,600
Should I read it out loud?

265
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,080
It's fine, you can read it

266
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,240
Some say

267
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,280
love and courage are

268
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,640
non-renewable resources

269
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,240
but I see them in you

270
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,080
in abundance

271
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,680
You said your youthful spirit

272
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,680
is slowly fading

273
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,240
But I

274
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,920
truly see

275
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,240
romance

276
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:01,800
cuteness

277
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,960
and your unique ideas

278
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,080
Park time (date)

279
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,680
Surprise after surprise

280
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,240
all prove

281
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,520
that day

282
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,040
you were shining

283
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,960
Your drive shows perfectly in you

284
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,080
Fried rice you made right away

285
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,920
Brown sugar that showed up the next day

286
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,320
was

287
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,640
the machine you figured out

288
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,320
So nice

289
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,720
Actions always speak louder than words

290
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,720
Bringing happiness to those around you

291
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,200
is a rare gift

292
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,960
I think we both have

293
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,920
three great qualities

294
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,520
Thank you

295
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,000
Me too

296
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,640
I've waited so long for this

297
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,400
And I also prepared one more thing.

298
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,840
There's another one.

299
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,640
Yeah.

300
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,720
A place with both snowy mountains
and deserts.

301
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,680
I found it.

302
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,280
And there are hot air balloons too.

303
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,320
This is so thoughtful.

304
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,600
Chichi is truly sincere.

305
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,400
This is a real

306
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,080
couple that could exist around us.

307
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,440
That's exactly how it feels.

308
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,760
We can ride a hot air balloon together.

309
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,480
Next time.

310
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,880
Sure.

311
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,080
Honestly, this one—

312
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,400
I feel like I want to keep it chilled.

313
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:41,880
Or even freeze it.

314
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,000
Frame it and treasure it forever.

315
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,360
Isn't it beautiful?

316
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,360
It's really beautiful.

317
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,720
Do you want to make a wish?

318
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,240
This time, I want you to make a wish.

319
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,640
This time, I want you to make a wish.

320
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,840
Chichi is the type who loves deeply.

321
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,040
Once she chooses you, she gives her all.

322
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,680
Okay.

323
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,400
We're here.

324
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,280
Let's put it here.

325
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,720
Then I'll place it at the highest peak.

326
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,600
Alright.

327
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,680
I've made my wish.

328
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,360
You make a wish.

329
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,880
That's awesome.

330
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,560
What's this?

331
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,360
I prepared this for you.

332
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,720
Three Universal Wish Cards.

333
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,800
Any wish you want.

334
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
You can wish for anything.

335
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,680
So cute.

336
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,440
So, what did you wish for just now?

337
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,120
You can use the first one.

338
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,560
My first wish is—

339
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,440
I hope we get the chance

340
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,920
to last for a long, long time.

341
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,640
Is that okay?

342
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,480
Yes.

343
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,520
"Help!"

344
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,920
Very good.

345
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,720
That's my first wish.

346
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,360
I'll think about the other two wishes.

347
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,480
Then you keep them.

348
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,360
Yeah, so I think—

349
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,920
So I think—

350
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,560
I want to ask you to be

351
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,320
the mystery person, which is me.

352
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,080
my girlfriend. Is that okay?

353
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,400
Yes.

354
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,200
Yes.

355
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,760
Yes.

356
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,560
That's so smooth.

357
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,080
Even your heights match.

358
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,440
So happy.

359
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,480
That's great.

360
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,720
Very good.

361
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,040
This couple is so romantic.

362
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,480
You know, that's true.

363
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,520
Isn't it really—

364
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,320
It's so real.

365
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:10,800
It's just so real.

366
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,640
This feels like something

367
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,080
that could happen around us.

368
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,200
Why is it so sweet?

369
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,120
Have you watched Marvel?

370
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:17,960
There's more to come.

371
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,080
There's more, it's not over.

372
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:19,400
There's more.

373
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,480
There's more to come, what's wrong?

374
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,720
Have you seen Marvel?

375
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,000
You know in Marvel movies,

376
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,400
after each chapter ends,

377
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,520
do you know what comes next?

378
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,840
What?

379
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,680
There are some Easter eggs.

380
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,120
Easter eggs.

381
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,080
So?

382
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,320
Would you like to go with me now

383
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,720
and open this

384
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,920
hidden level?

385
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,800
Really?

386
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:41,880
I do.

387
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,240
Let's go.

388
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,240
Because I did tell you before,

389
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,560
if you think fireworks fade quickly,

390
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,680
if you think fireworks fade quickly,

391
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,200
then let's set off enough at once.

392
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,640
Tonight, let's set off enough at once.

393
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,040
Really?

394
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,760
I'm so excited.

395
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,680
That's amazing.

396
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,600
Here it comes.

397
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,560
He runs so fast.

398
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,160
Set off enough.

399
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,520
It's so beautiful.

400
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,480
Don't they look like

401
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,680
characters in a game

402
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,080
after clearing a level?

403
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,680
Yeah.

404
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,600
So natural.

405
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,720
So pretty.

406
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,520
So romantic.

407
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,960
Is that okay?

408
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,000
Is that okay?

409
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,720
What's this?

410
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,480
That's so intense all at once.

411
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,120
He wants to kiss her.

412
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:57,920
Here it comes.

413
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:58,960
Is that okay?

414
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,320
Rewind, watch it again.

415
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,200
Slow it down to half speed.

416
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,280
Are you happy?

417
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,360
Of course.

418
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,400
They're truly a princess and prince.

419
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,240
From then on,

420
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,040
they lived happily ever after.

421
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,240
This couple is really "crazy."

422
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,880
They're totally "wild," for real.

423
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,760
So sweet.

424
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,000
Let's congratulate Zihan

425
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,240
and Chichi.

426
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,720
They've become a couple.

427
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,280
They're my favorites this season.

428
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,000
Now you understand.

429
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,960
Forgive my ignorance.

430
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,960
Forgive my ignorance.

431
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,880
Forgive my narrow view.

432
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,720
I'm still too young.

433
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,840
There's so much more in life

434
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,960
for me to experience and learn.

435
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,480
Yes.

436
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,520
I hope next season I can

437
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,520
become a better version of myself.

438
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,600
I'm so happy.

439
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,360
Because I think it

440
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,320
makes me feel

441
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,520
that true love is real.

442
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,000
It's real in real life, too.

443
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,800
It's not made up.

444
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,440
Nor is it just a beautiful wish.

445
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,240
It truly exists.

446
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,040
It's really happiness.

447
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,280
I feel so happy for them

448
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,280
after seeing this.

449
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,440
And we should believe

450
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,240
this kind of happiness

451
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,680
is something we deserve.

452
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,880
It will come for sure.

453
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,480
You have to believe

454
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,400
you're worthy and will find it.

455
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,040
It's real.

456
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,600
Just like when I chose Zihan

457
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,120
I said the same thing.

458
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:18,480
How tangled up she was

459
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,320
shows how tangled up she was.

460
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,480
It means Zihan had a big impact on her.

461
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,960
Actually, I don't think she hesitated.

462
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,080
It's not about making up her mind.

463
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,000
It's just that many girls

464
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,720
because she's so young,

465
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,840
before meeting him,

466
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,600
she didn't know

467
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,720
what kind of person she liked.

468
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,040
And when Chichi confessed just now,

469
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,680
when Chichi confessed just now,

470
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,200
Do you remember?

471
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,440
She said every time

472
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,760
you can hold up my emotions.

473
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,440
Every question I have,

474
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,720
you always have an answer.

475
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,920
When she said that,

476
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,000
I felt

477
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,680
this girl

478
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,880
has fallen for this boy.

479
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,520
She was moved.

480
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:44,880
She was moved.

481
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,720
Yes, they're a great match.

482
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,800
And congrats to Chichi for meeting

483
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,840
the kind of boy

484
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,840
she truly likes.

485
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,160
Best wishes to you, too.

486
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,320
Best wishes to you, too.

487
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:56,840
Thank you.

488
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,560
She found in Zihan

489
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,440
what she truly wanted.

490
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,360
She saw what she wanted.

491
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,440
And there's someone who can

492
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,600
no matter how upset you get,

493
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,400
he can always calm you down.

494
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,440
I think meeting someone like that

495
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,480
is really rare.

496
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,000
I think

497
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,800
it's worth giving it a try.

498
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,920
Maybe it'll turn out even better.

499
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,800
After taking a step forward,

500
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,240
she saw

501
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,200
the most beautiful fireworks.

502
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,760
It's always when

503
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,760
you're just not

504
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,880
emotionally stable

505
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,480
or your state

506
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,320
isn't stable enough,

507
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,480
after meeting him,

508
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,280
he can always make you

509
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,240
feel calm.

510
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,160
The moment he hugged her,

511
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,320
I was really touched.

512
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,520
So many thoughts

513
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,600
about what Zihan did for her

514
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,160
came to mind.

515
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,720
It really moved me.

516
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,640
Yes.

517
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,200
I think we should

518
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,120
watch it too, okay?

519
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,560
Because Chichi also called

520
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,000
Yuxing on the phone.

521
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,640
Let's see their final

522
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,080
Yes.

523
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,760
what they said on the call.

524
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,200
What was the content?

525
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,800
This is Chichi.

526
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,320
I thought

527
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,000
I wouldn't get the call.

528
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,440
He hasn't realized yet.

529
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,520
Thank you.

530
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,920
For helping me look back

531
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,600
on our whole journey in the house.

532
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,560
Thank you for the cake.

533
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,360
Thank you for the racket.

534
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,280
And for experiencing bungee jumping with me.

535
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,280
But what I really want to say

536
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,880
started from our first meeting.

537
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,920
From the dinner,

538
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:38,040
I was so curious about you.

539
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,000
But later, because of that curiosity,

540
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,560
I got a bit stuck.

541
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,880
I was kind of trapped in it.

542
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,640
Maybe our pace wasn't the same.

543
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,400
We couldn't have deep conversations.

544
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,280
Maybe that's

545
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,840
where we didn't quite match.

546
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,360
But I think both of us

547
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,960
are very brave.

548
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,560
So I think

549
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,680
we don't really have regrets.

550
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,240
We did everything we wanted.

551
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,680
And then

552
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,640
just

553
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:11,920
just

554
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,480
I hope in your future life

555
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,400
you can find

556
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,600
the right person.

557
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,520
Okay.

558
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,160
So

559
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,000
So

560
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,640
So basically,

561
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,560
I wish you a wonderful life

562
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,600
outside the house.

563
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,880
Okay, thank you.

564
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,280
It's fine, you hang up first.

565
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,360
I'll hang up then, bye.

566
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,640
Okay, bye.

567
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,640
It's fine.

568
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,400
You said some things

569
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,600
just can't be made up for.

570
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,240
That's true.

571
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,600
If you miss it, it's really gone.

572
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,240
Timing really matters.

573
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,200
Timing is truly important.

574
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:38,880
Honestly,

575
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,400
most of the time,

576
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,320
you're at the wrong time

577
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,040
doing the right thing.

578
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:42,720
It's also a mistake.

579
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,600
Some things just can't be helped.

580
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,040
Once missed, it can't be made up for.

581
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,480
I want to share from another angle

582
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,480
with all our viewers.

583
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,360
Let me share a thought.

584
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,440
That is,

585
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,560
don't take Heart Island

586
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,400
for granted.

587
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,920
And don't underestimate disappointment's impact.

588
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,360
Sometimes, repeated disappointment

589
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,360
can really affect

590
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,920
the choices we make.

591
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,880
It's still

592
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,480
something we should all take seriously.

593
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,200
I think Yuxing

594
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,480
through this journey

595
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,160
will truly understand

596
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,520
this kind of

597
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,640
pain of regret.

598
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,640
Because for him,

599
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,560
it's not just that he

600
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,920
feels sorry about it,

601
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,640
feels regretful,

602
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,800
but we feel

603
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,400
the same way too.

604
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,680
I also hope that

605
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,640
in each of our

606
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,440
lives,

607
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,320
we can better seize

608
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,160
our own

609
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,000
opportunities.

610
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,800
Because every chance

611
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,040
is truly precious.

612
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:36,880
So here,

613
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,720
we wish Yuxing

614
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,520
a wonderful life outside the house.

615
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,680
May he find

616
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,840
the one who moves his heart.

617
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,640
Best wishes to Yuxing.

618
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,720
Everyone,

619
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,520
the long-awaited

620
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,960
"Trial Romance Trip"

621
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,000
is about to reach

622
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,280
its final confession.

623
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:55,640
So, will our

624
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,440
Lechen and Xiaoyuan

625
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,800
become a couple?

626
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,280
Let's find out now!

627
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,560
Come on.

628
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,240
So beautiful.

629
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,080
It's gorgeous.

630
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,480
So vast.

631
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,680
Alpaca.

632
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,160
So cute.

633
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,440
This scene is stunning.

634
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,960
Here they come.

635
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,520
The two on the "Trial Romance Trip" will face each other

636
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,120
and confess their feelings.

637
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,960
Then make their final decision.

638
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,720
If they choose to be a couple now,

639
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,520
they'll exchange their balloons.

640
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,280
If they decide not to be a couple,

641
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,000
they'll release their balloons.

642
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,520
So lovely.

643
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,280
"Idol drama."

644
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,200
It's just like

645
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,520
so romantic.

646
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,920
This scene is truly beautiful.

647
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,000
Really.

648
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,520
So pretty.

649
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,160
So pretty—Luyuan looks amazing.

650
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,440
I got this for you—

651
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,560
a sunflower.

652
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,600
Thank you.

653
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,840
It's beautiful.

654
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,240
Well,

655
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,560
I'll go first.

656
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,520
I'm so nervous.

657
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:08,120
Honestly, I feel so dazed right now.

658
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,080
And super nervous.

659
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,640
On my way here,

660
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,440
I saw the distant Tianshan mountains,

661
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,720
the grasslands,

662
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,880
and the herds.

663
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,680
It really is

664
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,440
like these two horses fit the scene.

665
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,280
Then,

666
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,560
I saw

667
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,240
the green divider in the highway rails.

668
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,160
It really looks like

669
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,440
an old film reel.

670
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,320
It links all the past scenes together.

671
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,880
It quickly

672
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,640
flashes through my mind again and again.

673
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,640
Scenes of us together

674
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,360
really passed through

675
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,760
my nerves when we first met.

676
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,120
Hello.

677
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,680
Hi.

678
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,360
Have you been here long?

679
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,360
Not really.

680
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,720
The first time we

681
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,880
talked in the kitchen,

682
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,840
I was so happy.

683
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,880
And the first time you asked me to walk the dog,

684
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,480
I was really happy then.

685
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,280
Hello.

686
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,960
Hi.

687
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,160
Can you cook shrimp?

688
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,000
Do you want to walk the dog?

689
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,240
Sure.

690
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,200
Its legs are short, and you still tease it.

691
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,920
Careful, it might "sue" you.

692
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:10,760
"Sue" me?

693
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,000
I study law—"sue" me?

694
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,840
Honestly, since our first dog walk,

695
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,080
I already

696
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,400
started noticing you.

697
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,320
Then, our later kitchen talks,

698
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,760
when you told me about your family,

699
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,440
at that moment,

700
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,400
my first reaction was

701
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,960
I felt a bit sorry for you.

702
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,960
I felt very

703
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,200
I felt very

704
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,080
it's really hard to

705
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,360
talk about such deep topics with someone.

706
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,040
But at that moment,

707
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,720
we truly understood each other.

708
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,520
There was a silent connection between us.

709
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,600
I accepted it when I was very young.

710
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,240
Because when I was a child,

711
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,760
I often couldn't see my mom.

712
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,440
I used to cry alone under the covers.

713
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,520
My dad didn't know either.

714
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,000
Honestly, the moment that moved me most

715
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,360
was truly when you gave me a gift.

716
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,560
And when you invited me to ride the little train.

717
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,320
Our conversation at that time

718
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,840
made me see even more

719
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,880
deep inside your heart,

720
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,000
how calm you are,

721
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,640
while holding some things back.

722
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,240
It touched me again.

723
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,520
I also saw you

724
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,160
sometimes feeling lost,

725
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,280
in your eyes.

726
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,880
I saw even more of you,

727
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,400
your inner strength,

728
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,440
your determination,

729
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,240
and your courage.

730
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,200
I brought this for you.

731
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,320
What is this?

732
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,720
The one from Peking University (badge).

733
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,240
The one from Peking University (badge).

734
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,360
Who opened my mailbox after all?

735
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,960
I'll give you both cards.

736
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,840
Both cards for me?

737
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,160
There will always be someone who sees through you,

738
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,320
the vulnerability behind your strong face.

739
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,920
And you always ask me

740
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,840
if I feel pressured by you.

741
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,600
Honestly, there's no pressure.

742
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,240
What I worry about more

743
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,240
is that when you do these things,

744
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,480
do you feel drained inside?

745
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,840
Or maybe you

746
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,280
didn't get the result you wanted.

747
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,440
You might feel unhappy.

748
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:48,920
But...

749
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,560
That moment of excitement was sincere.

750
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,040
That moment of excitement was sincere.

751
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,640
This sentence

752
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,320
was so sweet.

753
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,800
It made me happy.

754
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,240
Please forgive me for not being good with words.

755
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,440
I'm really nervous.

756
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,120
I'm really nervous.

757
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,880
So cute.

758
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,080
Sometimes I overthink a lot.

759
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:15,760
And then...

760
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,520
The courage to do what I know I shouldn't,

761
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,080
is something I truly learned from you.

762
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,960
It's the biggest change I've seen in myself.

763
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,320
Finally,

764
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,520
I'm so grateful to have met you along the way.

765
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,880
To have gotten to know you.

766
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,720
To be able to

767
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:50,960
see your tears,

768
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,320
and see your happiness.

769
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,480
This...

770
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,560
It's starting.

771
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,440
Wang Lechen.

772
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:27,440
I know you must remember this question.

773
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,920
Has the person who moved your heart changed today?

774
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,960
This is the question I drew at the dinner.

775
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,600
It's also the question you asked me in the cabin.

776
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,200
This question is actually very simple.

777
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,760
I could have answered it without thinking

778
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,200
my answer.

779
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,040
How did you just tie yourself to me?

780
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,320
What if today I fall for

781
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,760
someone possessive, what then?

782
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,640
Fine, then I'm out.

783
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:12,240
Then maybe today I'll fall for you.

784
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,480
What about "Ten Years"?

785
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,600
I like it.

786
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,360
Ever since "Ten Years" on Heart Island,

787
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,320
every night,

788
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,000
the name Wang Lechen

789
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,720
has appeared

790
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,640
in the text box of my heart-fluttering message.

791
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,000
I know I'm

792
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,320
a very impatient person.

793
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,880
Sometimes I

794
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:55,000
am eager to see an answer.

795
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,800
Or I hope

796
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,680
to see your attitude.

797
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,040
So sometimes I

798
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,520
blame you in my heart

799
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,360
for not

800
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,240
giving me

801
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,920
a passionate response.

802
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,600
Why didn't you give me

803
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,840
a clear reply?

804
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,360
But slowly,

805
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:25,200
I calmed down

806
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,600
and felt things more deeply.

807
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,800
I gradually noticed your responses.

808
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,640
For example,

809
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,440
I

810
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,240
wanted to eat something the day before,

811
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,400
so you made shredded chicken for me the next day.

812
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,720
Like the braised rice you made for me.

813
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,000
For example,

814
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,760
I don't like spicy food,

815
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:57,440
so you made duck tongue without chili for me.

816
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:05,600
And even when you were late for work,

817
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,640
you still made breakfast for me.

818
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,440
The sticky notes you wrote.

819
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,240
You're so early.

820
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,880
You were the second to come back.

821
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:14,840
So is it time to start

822
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:15,920
making shredded chicken?

823
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:16,960
Sure.

824
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,040
Hello.

825
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,800
I happened to bring fish.

826
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,040
What kind of fish?

827
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,280
Bass.

828
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:24,720
Just a little is enough for me.

829
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,840
I don't need that much.

830
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,600
Kids are growing, eat more.

831
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,560
You're feeding me like a pig.

832
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:44,840
And the plant you brought me after work.

833
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,480
The little lamb you gave me on our date.

834
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,720
When you pressed flowers,

835
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,920
you pressed my favorite sunflower.

836
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:56,640
And also,

837
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,840
to make up for my graduation regret,

838
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,960
you ordered a graduation gown for me.

839
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,840
You took graduation photos with me.

840
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,200
Most importantly,

841
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,000
on our first date,

842
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,720
you wrote down my name.

843
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:18,040
And you invited me

844
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,760
to start this

845
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,640
unforgettable

846
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,720
"trial romance journey."

847
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,800
Wang Lechen cried.

848
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,760
This is for you.

849
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,120
Really?

850
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:34,840
Really.

851
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,200
I advise you not to be a hedgehog anymore.

852
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,360
Little lamb.

853
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,240
Okay.

854
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,720
But on the first card,

855
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:42,840
I wrote your name right away.

856
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,080
Go somewhere where it doesn't rain.

857
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,120
I want to go somewhere it doesn't rain.

858
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,600
I want to go somewhere it doesn't rain.

859
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:58,400
So touching.

860
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,160
This moment.

861
00:45:59,160 --> 00:45:59,880
Really.

862
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,160
The graduation gown you prepared.

863
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,440
Don't cry.

864
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,000
Why are you so annoying?

865
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:17,160
I know you take things slow.

866
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,840
So I know what you've done

867
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,240
took a lot of courage.

868
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,520
Thank you for being brave.

869
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,280
Thank you for your honesty.

870
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,320
Thank you for coming closer to me.

871
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:40,720
You made me feel

872
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,000
something I haven't felt

873
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,200
in a long, long time—my heart flutter.

874
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,240
I think you're a very thoughtful person.

875
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,560
I think you're a very thoughtful person.

876
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:52,440
Someone who cares about you will care.

877
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,800
You're really shy.

878
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,720
Let me show you some speed and thrill.

879
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,080
Give us a direction, "Captain."

880
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:04,640
Straight ahead.

881
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,680
They're so happy.

882
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,880
I hope you can be happy.

883
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,000
Okay.

884
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,360
Come on, run!

885
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,120
No one has ever

886
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:24,360
remembered my regrets like this.

887
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,800
Happy graduation.

888
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:27,800
Thank you.

889
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:28,960
Thank you.

890
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,320
I really like you.

891
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,800
I really like you.

892
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,720
Me too.

893
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:49,760
The day before yesterday,

894
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,200
by the campfire,

895
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,360
I made a wish.

896
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,200
My wish wasn't

897
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,240
to go to the grasslands the next day.

898
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,960
What I hoped for

899
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:03,640
was for us

900
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,160
to have a good ending.

901
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,440
Yesterday, under the kite,

902
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,400
I made another wish.

903
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,840
My wish wasn't

904
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,640
for stronger wind.

905
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,440
My wish was

906
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:20,800
for both of us

907
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,920
to be a little braver.

908
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:38,640
Yesterday, you

909
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,760
asked me

910
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:44,000
if I'm someone

911
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,400
who expresses feelings

912
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,000
to others directly.

913
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,200
My answer is,

914
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,640
I am.

915
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,160
Wang Lechen,

916
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,920
I don't dislike you at all.

917
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,200
Wang Lechen,

918
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,520
I like you.

919
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,360
I like you.

920
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,240
My Wang Lechen.

921
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,280
This—

922
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,600
What?

923
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:05,560
It's

924
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,840
an invitation card

925
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,520
for a date after leaving the house.

926
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,440
I booked

927
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,360
the thing you've always dreamed of,

928
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,040
the one you wanted to do—

929
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,040
a helicopter.

930
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,520
What was your childhood dream?

931
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,280
Since high school, I wanted to be a pilot.

932
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,320
To be a pilot.

933
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,760
Just a dream.

934
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:36,920
Just a fantasy.

935
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,320
That's so cute.

936
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,360
I hope you can

937
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,560
have courage

938
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:00,720
and the drive

939
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,600
to do what you want to do.

940
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,800
I also hope

941
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,480
I can be with you

942
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,920
as you chase your dreams.

943
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,760
Alright.

944
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:35,880
Actually, I also

945
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,880
have another gift.

946
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:43,760
What is it?

947
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,360
I'm thinking.

948
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:48,160
I'll give it to you now.

949
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,280
He seems to have something for her.

950
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,240
What is it?

951
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,160
The thing that affected you most

952
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,480
was probably my coming-of-age ceremony.

953
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,520
There was a part

954
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,680
where

955
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,480
parents give their child

956
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,320
a gift for adulthood.

957
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,880
Back then, my dad and I

958
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,040
had a big argument.

959
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,800
Because we're so alike,

960
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,600
both of us

961
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:19,800
are the type

962
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:21,400
who are stubborn.

963
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:22,400
Neither of us wants to back down.

964
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,120
Yeah, the kind who won't give in.

965
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,560
How did you make up?

966
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,880
We just talked it out naturally.

967
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:32,440
Did you really open up?

968
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,040
Halfway.

969
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,440
I still remember.

970
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:40,600
Nice.

971
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,040
I'm back.

972
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,800
I'll get the blanket from the car.

973
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:48,800
Okay.

974
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:56,160
Hello?

975
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,440
Hello, Uncle.

976
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:58,760
Hello.

977
00:52:58,760 --> 00:52:59,120
Hello.

978
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:02,400
I'm the guy who contacted you.

979
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,040
Yes, my name is Wang Lechen.

980
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:05,520
Wang Lechen.

981
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,600
Yes, "Le" as in happy, "Chen" as in morning.

982
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,600
He's calling her dad.

983
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:15,320
Hello, Uncle.

984
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,440
Yes, I talked with Xiaoyuan before.

985
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,400
She said

986
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,000
her biggest regret was

987
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,080
at her eighteenth birthday ceremony,

988
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,840
maybe because of some reasons with you,

989
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:29,320
so she didn't

990
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:31,360
have a proper ceremony.

991
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:31,560
have a proper ceremony.

992
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:34,840
So I wanted to use this chance

993
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,560
to make up for those regrets.

994
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:39,400
Yes.

995
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,440
Okay, I'll write something for you.

996
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,920
You can show it to her later.

997
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:45,720
Yes.

998
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:46,440
Alright.

999
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,280
I'll get back to you later.

1000
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:09,560
Now,

1001
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:10,360
I might need to

1002
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,160
switch my role a bit.

1003
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,480
Listen.

1004
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,640
Dear daughter,

1005
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,560
Thinking back to your coming-of-age ceremony,

1006
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,640
Dad was watching from outside your school.

1007
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:33,880
I hope you don't dwell on it too much.

1008
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,360
If time could turn back,

1009
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:41,160
to your eighteenth birthday ceremony,

1010
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,840
and step into that meaningful moment,

1011
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,080
I would want to say to you:

1012
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:50,760
Xiaoyuan,

1013
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,280
my precious daughter,

1014
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,520
today you officially turn eighteen.

1015
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,040
Standing here,

1016
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:58,840
looking at you,

1017
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:00,520
my heart is filled

1018
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,680
with indescribable pride and joy,

1019
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:04,880
and a touch

1020
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,280
of the dizzying passage of time.

1021
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,360
You are truly heaven's

1022
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,280
most precious gift to me.

1023
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,360
Your smile,

1024
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,360
your stubbornness,

1025
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:29,440
your kindness,

1026
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,840
your unique way of thinking—

1027
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,400
all of these make up

1028
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,880
the one and only

1029
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,200
shining Xiaoyuan.

1030
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:43,240
So never doubt your worth.

1031
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:45,640
Your very existence

1032
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:47,280
deserves to be deeply loved.

1033
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,720
I hope

1034
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,840
you learn to truly accept yourself,

1035
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:53,840
to care for yourself,

1036
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:55,720
and listen to your inner voice.

1037
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:57,800
Only by loving yourself first

1038
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,360
can you better love others,

1039
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:09,360
and face the world with confidence.

1040
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,080
Go chase the dreams you want,

1041
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:12,960
become the person you wish to be.

1042
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:14,720
Happy adulthood,

1043
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:15,520
my Xiaoyuan.

1044
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,600
He will always love you.

1045
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:32,920
And

1046
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:33,560
there's one more thing.

1047
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:34,760
He kept it hidden for eighteen years.

1048
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,280
I think the first two words

1049
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,600
are something you need to hear.

1050
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,840
Nannan,

1051
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,720
that day you said you were going to school.

1052
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,840
I agreed right away,

1053
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:58,280
but turned and followed you like a detective.

1054
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,760
The third utility pole behind the sycamore tree

1055
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,880
was my lookout post.

1056
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,800
I saw you at the entrance, on the main road,

1057
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,000
crossing the crosswalk.

1058
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,400
My shoes sank into the mud,

1059
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,720
but I didn't dare pull them out.

1060
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,920
When you looked up

1061
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,200
to check the Sunflower Class sign,

1062
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:19,200
my throat

1063
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,600
suddenly felt tangled, like with a ball of yarn.

1064
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,120
Turns out,

1065
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:27,200
the first to learn to let go

1066
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,600
was a five-year-old little hero.

1067
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,680
Later, I always praised your sense of direction,

1068
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,840
but really, I was afraid you'd notice

1069
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,080
the water bottle swinging in your backpack's side pocket

1070
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,160
was your father's trembling heartbeat.

1071
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:46,840
This line—

1072
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:48,680
Now, seeing you

1073
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:50,600
brave enough to go anywhere,

1074
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,360
I feel

1075
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,400
you're still that kid holding a cup,

1076
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,320
declaring yourself a child of the sun,

1077
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:56,160
that little girl with yellow hair.

1078
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,560
What I'm truly proud of

1079
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:00,520
isn't your sense of direction,

1080
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:02,880
but that you taught your father early on

1081
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,720
what real courage is.

1082
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:05,760
What real courage is.

1083
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,080
Xiaoyuan, what I regret most

1084
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,080
is missing some key moments in your life

1085
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,640
because I was too busy with work,

1086
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,640
or thought I was doing what's best for you.

1087
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,600
I wasn't patient enough

1088
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,200
to listen to your worries

1089
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,960
and wild imaginations.

1090
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:36,640
For these regrets,

1091
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,160
Dad sincerely wants to say

1092
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:40,760
I'm sorry.

1093
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:53,640
Holding the kite string too tight

1094
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,000
only restricts its wings.

1095
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,760
Sometimes my protection and guidance

1096
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,400
may have become a restraint.

1097
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:02,120
Now I hope you can fly freely,

1098
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:04,440
in your own rhythm and way,

1099
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,560
and experience life.

1100
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:08,280
Dad will try his best to be

1101
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,400
the one behind you,

1102
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:10,400
applauding you,

1103
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,960
and supporting you from below.

1104
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,360
Your life is wonderful because it is yours,

1105
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:20,000
not a copy or continuation of anyone else's.

1106
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:38,200
Your dad truly loves you.

1107
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:41,960
What I have here is only

1108
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,280
a selection of a few things.

1109
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,200
He actually sent you so much more.

1110
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:49,320
I can send you the rest when I get back.

1111
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:55,960
Alright.

1112
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:12,960
That's nice.

1113
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:15,120
Thank you.

1114
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:15,600
You're welcome.

1115
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:16,680
Because I know this truly is

1116
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:17,400
your biggest regret.

1117
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,360
Actually,

1118
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:19,160
in the past,

1119
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:22,000
I also rarely

1120
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,240
communicated like this with my parents.

1121
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:24,160
So,

1122
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,720
I also gathered my courage that day.

1123
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:27,560
I feel

1124
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,560
it's like the rain I've been through

1125
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,400
shouldn't fall on you again.

1126
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,120
It really touched me.

1127
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:41,560
Honestly, I don't think

1128
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:42,320
what I've done

1129
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,480
can fully make up for your regrets.

1130
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,960
But I hope you know

1131
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:49,520
that

1132
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:50,800
those who truly care about you

1133
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:51,800
care about everything about you.

1134
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:52,520
I also hope you

1135
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,040
can truly understand yourself

1136
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,680
and love yourself well.

1137
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:22,200
Actually,

1138
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,040
what I like most

1139
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:27,880
is being by your side

1140
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:29,520
when we're together.

1141
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:30,720
That feeling—

1142
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:33,920
I think it's comfortable.

1143
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:34,720
It's not mixed

1144
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:36,800
with many outside factors.

1145
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:39,720
The end of the cabin

1146
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,760
isn't really the end of everything.

1147
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:43,880
The cabin was

1148
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,440
just the beginning.

1149
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,120
Its end is truly the start.

1150
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:54,960
So we are

1151
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:57,560
a new beginning.

1152
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,240
Yeah, I think the time in the house

1153
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,800
was a chance for us

1154
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:14,240
to truly get to know each other.

1155
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:18,560
I think it's purer than in real life,

1156
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:19,600
when you try to know someone

1157
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:20,160
or meet someone new.

1158
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,080
It's just more genuine.

1159
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:22,160
And more straightforward.

1160
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,240
It also feels much deeper.

1161
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:31,400
Honestly, it's because my feelings

1162
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:32,640
Honestly, it's because my feelings

1163
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,600
are a bit complicated.

1164
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:35,480
I also think

1165
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:36,360
only when both people

1166
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:39,120
have become their best selves

1167
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:45,480
can they move forward with confidence.

1168
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,600
Why does it feel a little...

1169
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:51,840
What do you mean?

1170
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,600
I know

1171
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:07,840
you think a lot.

1172
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:08,920
You have concerns,

1173
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,160
and you overthink things.

1174
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,800
It's only been

1175
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,160
just over twenty days together.

1176
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,760
I can't really know

1177
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,320
the whole you yet.

1178
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:26,640
Maybe after the house ends,

1179
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:29,360
maybe after the house ends,

1180
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:30,560
we need more time together.

1181
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:40,560
I know

1182
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:41,840
in the future we'll have

1183
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:43,640
a lot to face.

1184
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,200
But that's okay.

1185
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,400
I'll slow down.

1186
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:53,080
What I hope for more

1187
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:54,680
is that we both can

1188
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:55,800
in the days ahead

1189
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:57,560
in the time to come,

1190
01:03:58,480 --> 01:03:59,880
first,

1191
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,320
get to know each other better.

1192
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:04,360
Really understand everything about each other.

1193
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,320
And get along even better.

1194
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:09,880
So...

1195
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:15,200
What?

1196
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,040
No way.

1197
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:20,320
I think we have a long road ahead.

1198
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:22,080
There's no need to rush.

1199
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:26,360
We don't have to decide now.

1200
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:46,600
But...

1201
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,000
Please forgive me.

1202
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:53,800
Because I still...

1203
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:58,680
I really...

1204
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:10,640
Why do I need to forgive you?

1205
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:11,840
You said it well.

1206
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:24,880
I'm not blaming you.

1207
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:26,480
No need to forgive you.

1208
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:45,280
It's fine, just scold me.

1209
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,440
So let's wait until

1210
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:04,520
we truly see each other,

1211
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:05,840
then we'll exchange balloons.

1212
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:24,760
But...

1213
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:27,680
Are we letting the balloons go today?

1214
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:31,680
It's up to you.

1215
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:35,240
I will

1216
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,160
follow your pace.

1217
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,320
Come on, let's release them together.

1218
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:49,680
This isn't the end.

1219
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:50,720
Okay.

1220
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:52,880
So it's a pity

1221
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:55,720
they chose not to be a couple.

1222
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:19,160
This isn't the end.

1223
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,880
Why isn't it flying?

1224
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,960
Why isn't it flying?

1225
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,000
It doesn't want to fly.

1226
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:39,760
It's not light enough.

1227
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:41,080
Let's go.

1228
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,040
The balloons are telling their story.

1229
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:50,880
My love for you is so deep.

1230
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:53,880
My love for you is so deep.

1231
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,640
Why am I the only one floating up so easily?

1232
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:03,080
Try cutting the string.

1233
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:04,400
The balloon says, "I don't want to."

1234
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:05,640
The balloon says, "I disagree."

1235
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:19,320
It finally started to float.

1236
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:24,760
It sank again.

1237
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,600
Your balloon will stay there.

1238
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:30,280
Let it stay.

1239
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:41,960
Here, put this on first.

1240
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:50,480
It's warm.

1241
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:55,040
Really, what a shame.

1242
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,960
Such a pity.

1243
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:58,640
This is real.

1244
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:17,960
Darn it, I'll go get it back.

1245
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:35,040
This makes me want to cry. Why?

1246
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:03,240
It's just such a pity.

1247
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,080
Our Lechen and Xiaoyuan

1248
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:07,080
at this moment

1249
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:09,880
chose

1250
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:11,560
not to become a couple.

1251
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:16,640
But it's still beautiful.

1252
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,320
I've never seen this kind of

1253
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:18,560
Yeah.

1254
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:19,280
ending.

1255
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:20,600
I was feeling sad just now,

1256
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:21,560
but after watching the end,

1257
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:23,000
when they walked away hand in hand,

1258
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:23,680
I felt

1259
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:25,600
it was beautiful too.

1260
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,680
I think it's really nice.

1261
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:28,240
They're not—

1262
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:30,080
They talked about long distance a few days ago.

1263
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:31,720
I think that matters a lot.

1264
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:33,080
Yeah.

1265
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:34,200
Both of them might be

1266
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:34,840
worried about that.

1267
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,880
Think about it, one works

1268
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,400
and the other goes to school.

1269
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:41,600
They probably need to plan

1270
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:42,360
how things might look.

1271
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:43,440
And see if the two of them

1272
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,480
can get used to each other's

1273
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:46,240
pace.

1274
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:47,080
Yeah.

1275
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:48,360
But of course, I think

1276
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:49,440
they definitely like each other.

1277
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:50,600
I believe no one here is clueless.

1278
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:51,960
It's totally obvious.

1279
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:53,880
Love is beautiful.

1280
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:56,680
But there are so many real-life things

1281
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:58,120
that can't be helped.

1282
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:58,920
Really can't be helped.

1283
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,560
This is actually the hardest kind.

1284
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:03,640
Yeah, this is the most painful.

1285
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:04,280
You just can't

1286
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:05,840
solve the problems together.

1287
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:09,560
I think both of them

1288
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:10,440
are very sincere

1289
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:12,920
and cherish this relationship.

1290
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:14,600
From dating

1291
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:16,240
to truly becoming close,

1292
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:18,680
they need to make a commitment.

1293
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:20,800
But right now,

1294
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:21,000
right now,

1295
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,640
since Lechen

1296
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:24,000
has already started working,

1297
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:24,680
the challenges he sees ahead

1298
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:26,440
the challenges he sees ahead

1299
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:27,040
are more.

1300
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:29,920
He feels more difficulties

1301
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:31,600
and worries.

1302
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:32,520
So maybe that's why

1303
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:34,440
he's less ready than Xiaoyuan

1304
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:36,080
at this moment.

1305
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:37,640
Yeah.

1306
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:39,360
So for someone with more experience,

1307
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:40,520
to be brave again

1308
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:41,120
it's actually

1309
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:41,800
even harder.

1310
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:43,560
It's not easy.

1311
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:46,800
Every stage

1312
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,560
has its own beauty.

1313
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:49,520
Yeah.

1314
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:50,920
And its own worries.

1315
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:51,480
Yeah.

1316
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:52,440
Suddenly it feels like

1317
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:54,240
love has

1318
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:55,560
many different stages.

1319
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:57,760
This is one of them.

1320
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:00,800
Just now, during that

1321
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:03,160
process, I really empathized.

1322
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:04,920
That Xiaoyuan,

1323
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:07,520
from when he helped her

1324
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:09,800
with her issues with her dad

1325
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:11,680
about her coming-of-age ceremony,

1326
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:12,320
I think

1327
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:13,160
if I were a girl,

1328
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:14,840
I'd keep feeling moved

1329
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,400
like I've met the right person.

1330
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:19,040
Did I meet someone

1331
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:20,040
who can make me happy

1332
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:20,920
and truly blessed?

1333
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:21,920
And in the end,

1334
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:23,440
he didn't give

1335
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,320
the balloon,

1336
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:24,760
I

1337
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:25,920
think I'd be disappointed.

1338
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:27,760
Just—

1339
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:34,880
Because what I feel is

1340
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:36,840
Xiaoyuan is truly ready.

1341
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:39,360
Xiaoyuan always bravely speaks up first.

1342
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,840
She is the first to share her feelings for him.

1343
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,360
When her courage reaches its peak,

1344
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:44,800
You said, after we calm down,

1345
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:45,720
Maybe after I calm down,

1346
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:46,880
that courage fades away.

1347
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:50,280
Some things, once gone, are gone.

1348
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:51,360
Yes.

1349
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:53,200
I think

1350
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:54,800
feelings aren't rational.

1351
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:56,960
They're impulsive.

1352
01:12:59,160 --> 01:12:59,960
I understand.

1353
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:01,560
I think what you said is right.

1354
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:03,880
Because Luyuan also said,

1355
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:06,560
"I hope we can both be braver."

1356
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:07,200
Yes.

1357
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:09,200
He was actually saying it to himself.

1358
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:09,640
Yes.

1359
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:12,560
If you look at Luyuan,

1360
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:12,960
he truly has

1361
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:13,960
so many wonderful qualities.

1362
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:16,560
Lechen also hopes

1363
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:18,760
her decision will be understood.

1364
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:19,760
She said,

1365
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:20,440
"You don't need

1366
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:21,400
to say sorry to me."

1367
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:22,320
"You did nothing wrong."

1368
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:24,440
Even at this moment,

1369
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:25,720
she keeps giving him strength.

1370
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:26,800
I think this is also

1371
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,080
how both of them

1372
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:29,520
in their own ways

1373
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,840
are adding more

1374
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:34,360
energy to this relationship.

1375
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:37,520
Dear Cupids,

1376
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:39,280
we've worked hard all season.

1377
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:40,320
In this round of reasoning,

1378
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,200
we didn't win any raw stones.

1379
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:43,440
So the correct answer

1380
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:44,720
should be only two couples.

1381
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:46,240
Right, who would've thought?

1382
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,320
We didn't consider this pair.

1383
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,240
We didn't pay attention to Xiaoyuan and Lechen.

1384
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:51,080
No.

1385
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:52,080
I hope they can

1386
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,840
in their future lives

1387
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:55,360
after leaving the house,

1388
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:55,880
get to know each other

1389
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:56,320
even more.

1390
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:57,640
Even more.

1391
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:59,040
Spend more time together.

1392
01:13:59,040 --> 01:13:59,600
And also have

1393
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:00,760
more companionship.

1394
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:02,080
And more possibilities.

1395
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:03,320
Yes.

1396
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:04,120
To be continued.

1397
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:04,760
That's the feeling.

1398
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:06,160
To be continued.

1399
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:08,240
Okay.

1400
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:09,600
At this point, all our

1401
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:10,560
Heartfelt confessions

1402
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:11,640
are complete.

1403
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:12,960
The couples who got together,

1404
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,000
I wish them

1405
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,280
a sweet life outside the house

1406
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:17,800
that continues to be sweet.

1407
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:19,200
I hope they can also

1408
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:20,840
in their time together

1409
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:21,360
have more

1410
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:22,600
wonderful things happen.

1411
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,720
I also hope everyone

1412
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:27,120
throughout this season

1413
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:28,080
Master Kong Jasmine Tea "Heart Signal"

1414
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:29,440
Season Eight

1415
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:31,240
has gained something for themselves.

1416
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:34,240
I want to give everyone

1417
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:35,800
and to each person,

1418
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,680
the one who lights up your life does exist.

1419
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:39,960
When the spotlight shines,

1420
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:41,360
that person will be standing there.

1421
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:43,160
Thank you, Hani.

1422
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:45,880
Although Season Eight is over,

1423
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:47,240
but what does that mean?

1424
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:48,880
It means there will surely be

1425
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:49,840
a Season Nine.

1426
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,400
Sign up for Season Nine, everyone!

1427
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,160
It might not be me.

1428
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:54,920
But you can look forward to seeing me there.

1429
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:55,560
Yes.

1430
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:57,160
I can tell you really want to fall in love.

1431
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,120
I really do.

1432
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:01,880
So...

1433
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:04,680
Let's just look forward to season nine,
that's it.

1434
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:05,640
I think so, right?

1435
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:06,520
Okay.

1436
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:08,360
I prepared some gifts.

1437
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:09,640
You brought gifts?

1438
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:10,400
What?

1439
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:11,520
For everyone.

1440
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:13,120
This is really impressive.

1441
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:14,760
Impressive.

1442
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:17,040
Doing this kind of thing.

1443
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:17,840
Pick one.

1444
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:18,760
It's a mystery box.

1445
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:19,640
I wrote cards.

1446
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:20,560
Thank you, Xu Ge, really.

1447
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,520
This needs no words.

1448
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:23,800
That's true.

1449
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:27,000
One gesture says it all.

1450
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:30,480
I try to find more of my strengths
every day.

1451
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,240
I'm good at this.

1452
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:33,520
I'm good at this.

1453
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:34,840
No, I think on the show,

1454
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:35,840
there's a line I really like.

1455
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,080
So I wanted to share it with everyone.

1456
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,160
Thank you.

1457
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:39,360
Find three every day.

1458
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:40,440
Three? Only three?

1459
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:43,080
Three hundred would be too much.

1460
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:44,760
What's yours?

1461
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:46,400
Mine is "brave people".

1462
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,400
Enjoy the world first.

1463
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:48,720
That's me too.

1464
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:49,760
A line I really like.

1465
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:51,760
Keep being a brave person.

1466
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:57,280
I think sharing your feelings
with someone who understands

1467
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:58,400
understands you.

1468
01:15:58,400 --> 01:15:59,200
We all understand.

1469
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:01,440
I think it fits me well.

1470
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:02,480
I need to work hard

1471
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:05,120
to get closer to that.

1472
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:05,640
Yeah.

1473
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,040
That's pretty cool.

1474
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:08,440
I want to share mine.

1475
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:09,440
Love is a

1476
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,240
Love is a

1477
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:12,600
skill anyone can learn.

1478
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:15,680
This skill brings us happiness.

1479
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:18,680
I feel Xu Ge's confidence in love.

1480
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:21,200
Because he learned it,

1481
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:23,600
he can say it so surely

1482
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:25,400
and write this line.

1483
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:26,800
I felt it.

1484
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:27,960
That's wonderful.

1485
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:30,800
Mine is a short one.

1486
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:33,080
Be kinder to yourself.

1487
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:34,760
That's important.

1488
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:35,360
Very important.

1489
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:36,160
Very important.

1490
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:37,560
Why do you say that, bro?

1491
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:38,800
I feel like you used to

1492
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:39,800
struggle a lot inside.

1493
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:42,160
You went abroad so young.

1494
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:43,640
I think the pressure you faced

1495
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:45,720
is beyond what we can imagine.

1496
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:48,120
So now, at my age,

1497
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:49,320
looking back,

1498
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:50,680
I really want to tell

1499
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:51,800
my younger self

1500
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:53,640
to be kinder to myself.

1501
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:56,640
Thank you.

1502
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:00,800
It feels like inside us

1503
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:02,320
there are always two little voices.

1504
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:02,960
One says,

1505
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:05,160
go for it, love, take risks.

1506
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:08,120
When you're young, be fearless.

1507
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:09,840
Or what will you remember
when you're old?

1508
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:11,160
Actually, Hani,

1509
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:12,760
I really like you.

1510
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:13,640
Because I

1511
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:14,560
think on the show,

1512
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,600
your innocence and cuteness

1513
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:17,440
I think that

1514
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:18,920
really affects us.

1515
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:19,920
All of us.

1516
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,360
Okay, don't do this.

1517
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,600
I'm really about to lose it.

1518
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:25,520
Thank you all.

1519
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:28,960
You all light up my life too.

1520
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:29,920
Thank you so much.

1521
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:31,320
I rarely meet a group

1522
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:31,960
that gives me

1523
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:33,000
a sense of security.

1524
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:33,960
But you are.

1525
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,120
Say no more.

1526
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:40,040
Thank you, Hani.

1527
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:40,400
I really want to

1528
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:41,240
thank the production team.

1529
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:42,720
For finding so many

1530
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:43,720
wonderful people this season.

1531
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:45,240
Feels just like friends.

1532
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:47,680
I just like everyone.

1533
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:50,120
And thank you, Xu Ge.

1534
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:52,160
Thank you, Xu Ge, for your thoughtfulness.

1535
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:56,600
For me,

1536
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,120
what makes me happy is

1537
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:01,040
every midsummer and early autumn

1538
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:03,800
is when I feel most at peace.

1539
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:04,960
That's because I know

1540
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:06,520
I have all of you.

1541
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:07,400
I have Heart Island.

1542
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:08,080
I have each other.

1543
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:08,720
It means I have a

1544
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:09,760
home right here.

1545
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:11,920
If you let me

1546
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,040
make a wish,

1547
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:14,000
I'd like to ask

1548
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,640
when the Northeast season is coming.

1549
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:17,040
Honestly,

1550
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:19,000
since season two,

1551
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,800
I've been waiting for the Northeast season.

1552
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:21,280
It's coming soon.

1553
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:22,760
I hope everyone

1554
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:23,280
can

1555
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:23,800
pay more attention

1556
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:24,560
to the Northeast season, okay?

1557
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:25,640
I'll make a little wish too.

1558
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:26,120
Okay.

1559
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:28,440
When jasmine blooms, it's the signal of love.

1560
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:29,240
This show is sponsored by

1561
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:32,360
Kang Shifu Jasmine Tea, floral and fresh.

1562
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:33,240
as the title sponsor.

1563
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:35,240
Every Thursday at twelve o'clock,

1564
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:36,280
we have extra reality show episodes.

1565
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:37,920
Unlock more Heart Island clues.

1566
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:39,800
Go to Tencent Video Caocangdi

1567
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:42,680
to get Heart Island merch with one click.

1568
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:43,920
Finally,

1569
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,320
thank you all again

1570
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:46,160
for being with us

1571
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:46,720
through this

1572
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:47,800
wonderful summer.

1573
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:48,760
Thank you, everyone.

1574
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:49,960
Thanks.

1575
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:53,680
Alright, so at this point,

1576
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:54,440
everyone must

1577
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:55,520
think it's over.

1578
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:56,640
But I want to ask you all,

1579
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,160
have you watched Marvel?

1580
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:01,680
There's an Easter egg.

1581
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:03,160
At this point in Marvel,

1582
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:04,680
there's always an Easter egg.

1583
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:06,000
So soon,

1584
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,200
we'll meet our housemates again.

1585
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:08,560
we'll meet our housemates again.

1586
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:09,400
After leaving the house,

1587
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:10,800
how have things progressed for them?

1588
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:11,760
how have things progressed for them?

1589
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:14,560
Let's hurry and join them.

1590
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:16,440
Midsummer never ends.

1591
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:17,960
Heart Island never stops.

1592
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:18,800
Dear viewers,

1593
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,760
see you in season nine.

1594
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:22,080
Goodbye.

1595
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:22,720
Thank you.

1596
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:24,440
A wonderful summer

1597
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:25,400
has ended.

1598
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:27,040
A romantic autumn begins.

1599
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:40,600
Where should I sit?

1600
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:46,440
Left or right?

1601
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:47,960
I'll sit to your left.

1602
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:48,880
I'll sit here.

1603
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:55,920
Anyway, no matter what,

1604
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:57,080
I want to show my right side.

1605
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:15,040
But if I talk to you,

1606
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:16,840
I'll have to show my left side.

1607
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:18,000
Right.

1608
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,200
So maybe I should sit there.

1609
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:21,480
Makes sense.

1610
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,360
Makes sense.

1611
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:25,400
Well,

1612
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:25,920
You sit.

1613
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:26,560
Switch.

1614
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:27,560
Right.

1615
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:34,040
That's better.

1616
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:35,880
Put this up here.

1617
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:43,560
Two lovebirds are here.

1618
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:44,280
What is there to talk about?

1619
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:45,120
Am I pretty?

1620
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:45,720
Pretty.

1621
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:47,600
You look truly beautiful today.

1622
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:48,440
Really?

1623
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:56,920
Are you nervous?

1624
01:20:58,320 --> 01:20:59,160
I'm okay now.

1625
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:01,280
But a little bit.

1626
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:03,440
It's a bit hard to speak clearly.

1627
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:05,320
I think

1628
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:06,280
is there a hair here?

1629
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:16,800
I feel like my voice isn't warmed up.

1630
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:20,960
Then just speak a bit softer.

1631
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:22,800
Don't crack your voice.

1632
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,160
I feel like my first word will crack.

1633
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:34,440
Here you are.

1634
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:35,520
Nice to see you again, Haitao.

1635
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:36,800
We meet again.

1636
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:37,400
Haitao.

1637
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:37,960
Hello.

1638
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:38,720
Hello.

1639
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:39,120
Hello.

1640
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:39,880
Hello.

1641
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:41,520
Dr. Fang.

1642
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:42,520
Xu is here.

1643
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:43,160
Xu.

1644
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:44,360
Hello.

1645
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:44,880
Hello.

1646
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:49,800
Awesome.

1647
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:50,360
Hello.

1648
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:51,240
I really like you all.

1649
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:52,480
Let's sit.

1650
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:53,000
Sit and chat.

1651
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:55,000
Where are you from?

1652
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:55,640
Shanghai.

1653
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:57,400
We came together.

1654
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:00,720
Yes.

1655
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:02,760
We took the same flight.

1656
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:05,040
Saw some spoilers.

1657
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:07,640
Dr. Fang is still shy.

1658
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:08,600
Very much.

1659
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:10,040
So why no glasses today?

1660
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:11,360
You look great in glasses.

1661
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:12,320
Really?

1662
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:13,440
In the end.

1663
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:15,480
Those glasses from confession night.

1664
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:16,400
They really suit him.

1665
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:17,720
I picked those.

1666
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:19,600
The square ones.

1667
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:20,760
Yes, the square ones.

1668
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,360
Do you miss that time?

1669
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:23,920
Of course.

1670
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:24,760
Every time an episode airs,

1671
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:25,440
when I watch it,

1672
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:26,680
I really feel nostalgic.

1673
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:28,840
Do you watch alone or

1674
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:29,600
together?

1675
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:33,360
I...

1676
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:36,560
That's a valuable question.

1677
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:39,120
I usually watch at work first,

1678
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:40,000
during lunch break.

1679
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,680
I watch the silent version alone.

1680
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:43,840
Then at dinner,

1681
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,920
I watch the full version with him.

1682
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:48,400
There's a private and a shared version.

1683
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:49,200
Yes.

1684
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:51,640
He's a bit nervous.

1685
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:52,520
It's okay.

1686
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:54,200
It's fine, let's relax first.

1687
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:56,120
Take a sip of Master Kong Jasmine Tea.

1688
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:03,880
See, I even brought one for you.

1689
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:06,280
Guess I was extra.

1690
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:07,240
So thoughtful.

1691
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:08,760
Thank you.

1692
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:10,520
Come on.

1693
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:11,920
Cheers!

1694
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:14,320
Jasmine blooms—it's the Heart Signal.

1695
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:20,000
Full of familiar jasmine aroma.

1696
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Sweet and refreshing.

1697
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:21,520
Feels like

1698
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:23,520
I'm back in the cabin days.

1699
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,720
From meeting to getting closer,

1700
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:27,000
then to the final confession.

1701
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,640
Master Kong Jasmine Tea

1702
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,840
feels so connected to us.

1703
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,720
Actually, from the first card pick,

1704
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:33,400
I saw it next to

1705
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:34,480
Master Kong Jasmine Tea.

1706
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:35,880
I kind of knew who it was.

1707
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:37,080
It had to be her.

1708
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:39,920
I even said,

1709
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:41,080
wherever you go in the future,

1710
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:42,400
when you see Master Kong Jasmine Tea,

1711
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,200
it'll feel different.

1712
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:44,720
Yes.

1713
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:46,040
Feels like a token of love.

1714
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:47,120
Yes, a love token.

1715
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:48,520
Your own sweet memories.

1716
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:49,240
We all get it.

1717
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:54,680
Why did you come to Changsha before?

1718
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:55,360
Was it for this show?

1719
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:55,720
No.

1720
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:56,040
Just for fun.

1721
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:57,640
What did you eat?

1722
01:23:57,640 --> 01:23:58,200
We had lots of local specialties.

1723
01:23:58,200 --> 01:23:59,800
Spicy shrimp, crayfish.

1724
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:01,760
When will you make crayfish again?

1725
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:04,840
I'll make it when I get back.

1726
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:05,400
Okay.

1727
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:08,040
Hello.

1728
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:09,160
Hello.

1729
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:11,040
Hello.

1730
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:11,440
Hello.

1731
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:11,840
Hello.

1732
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:14,960
Hello.

1733
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:16,520
Hello.

1734
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:17,800
Hello.

1735
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:18,560
Hello.

1736
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,040
Hello.

1737
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:19,640
Hello.

1738
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:19,920
Hello.

1739
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:20,120
Hello.

1740
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:20,240
Hello.

1741
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:20,400
Hello.

1742
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:22,680
Absolutely stunning.

1743
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:23,360
Hello.

1744
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:25,400
Hello.

1745
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:26,760
Hello, Lanlan.

1746
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:27,600
Hello.

1747
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:29,520
Finally met you.

1748
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:29,960
So beautiful.

1749
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:32,040
Let's sit anywhere.

1750
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:32,760
We can all sit wherever.

1751
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:34,160
Sit wherever you like.

1752
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:37,520
Such a tall one.

1753
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:38,640
Who?

1754
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:39,680
Just one head apart.

1755
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:40,320
Came right over.

1756
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:40,520
Came right over.

1757
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:41,840
Hello.

1758
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:43,000
Hello.

1759
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:44,840
Hello, everyone. Hello, teachers.

1760
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:45,560
Hello, teachers.

1761
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:46,880
Hello, everyone.

1762
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:48,080
Hello, teachers.

1763
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:49,160
Hello, everyone. Hello, teachers.

1764
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:49,960
Come in.

1765
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:51,400
Please come inside.

1766
01:24:59,480 --> 01:24:59,920
Hello.

1767
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:00,640
Hello, Ruilong.

1768
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:01,320
Hello, sister.

1769
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:05,040
Brother.

1770
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:09,240
Why did everyone go over there?

1771
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:12,400
What does that mean?

1772
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:18,360
Hani

1773
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:22,960
You're so brave.

1774
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,320
Hani, you're beautiful.

1775
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:27,480
I really like you.

1776
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:28,480
Thank you.

1777
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Let's do one more.

1778
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:30,440
Hani

1779
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:32,960
I just watched today

1780
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:34,880
your "critical hit" video.

1781
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:35,560
Did you know?

1782
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:37,040
We screamed.

1783
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:38,000
Really?

1784
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:38,760
"Romance drama"

1785
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:39,440
How about this?

1786
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:41,000
They sit in the middle, we sit on the side.

1787
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,160
Zihan, do you want to sit next to me?

1788
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:44,320
Then I'll sit next to you.

1789
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,000
Okay.

1790
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:45,600
Is that alright?

1791
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,240
How is it?

1792
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:48,000
It's fine.

1793
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Have you been busy lately?

1794
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:49,800
Been busy lately.

1795
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:50,200
Busy.

1796
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:50,840
Busy.

1797
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:51,800
Come on, take a seat.

1798
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:52,400
Take a seat.

1799
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:54,400
Take a seat.

1800
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,080
Whatever's comfortable.

1801
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:56,760
You really are

1802
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:58,160
I see so many things in you

1803
01:25:58,160 --> 01:25:59,560
that I lack myself.

1804
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:01,840
Really.

1805
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:03,120
You're amazing.

1806
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:04,600
Really, you're incredible.

1807
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:05,440
Stop, I'll cry if you keep going.

1808
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:06,360
Then I won't look pretty.

1809
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:08,880
I like you so much.

1810
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:11,120
Hani, give me a hug.

1811
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:15,480
Don't be nervous.

1812
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:17,240
Hello, Dr. Fang.

1813
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:18,160
Hello.

1814
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:19,680
It's an honor to meet you.

1815
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:21,520
What? Didn't we meet outside?

1816
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:31,120
Hello, Xu Ge.

1817
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:32,360
Hello.

1818
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:35,640
I want to sit with Xu Ge too.

1819
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:39,760
I really like you.

1820
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,160
Sure.

1821
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:41,840
Of course.

1822
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:43,760
Thank you.

1823
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:44,560
You're handsome too.

1824
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:46,960
I really like your comments.

1825
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:47,760
Really?

1826
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:48,560
Yeah.

1827
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:50,080
When I watch you,

1828
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:51,200
I really feel something.

1829
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:52,040
Because I think usually

1830
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:53,520
I'm kind of like you sometimes.

1831
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:54,320
Really?

1832
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:56,000
I'm also the slow type.

1833
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,200
And I don't dare

1834
01:26:58,040 --> 01:26:59,400
When I watch you sometimes,

1835
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:01,720
I get anxious for you.

1836
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:03,840
Yeah, when I see myself like that,

1837
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:05,600
I get anxious too.

1838
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:06,360
Right?

1839
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:12,000
Thank you.

1840
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:14,640
Everyone's seated.

1841
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:15,400
Everyone's seated.

1842
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:15,960
That's great.

1843
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:16,920
Our big family

1844
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:18,320
is all here.

1845
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:26,360
Welcome, everyone.

1846
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:29,160
Alright.

1847
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:29,680
So I heard

1848
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:30,680
after leaving the house,

1849
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:33,360
everyone had many wonderful weekends.

1850
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:35,480
After work, we go eat together.

1851
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:36,360
We hang out on weekends too.

1852
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:37,680
Actually, we've

1853
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:39,960
gotten to know each other better.

1854
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:41,720
It's been pretty happy lately.

1855
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:44,080
But now, as a couple,

1856
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:45,560
what stage are you at?

1857
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:46,320
When you hug,

1858
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:47,520
it's definitely more natural

1859
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:48,360
than on confession night.

1860
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:49,320
Yeah.

1861
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:51,800
Of these ten things,

1862
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:52,320
which do you think

1863
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,160
is the most ordinary?

1864
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:55,000
Watching a movie.

1865
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:56,320
Watched at home.

1866
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:58,040
At home.

1867
01:27:58,040 --> 01:27:58,680
Yes.

1868
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:02,480
When did you last meet?

1869
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:03,520
Did you eat together?

1870
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:04,280
Many times.

1871
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:05,360
What did you eat?

1872
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:06,440
What did you talk about?

1873
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:08,200
How could I tell you what we talked about?

1874
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:11,080
Not telling me?

1875
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:11,960
They want to know.

1876
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:14,920
Weekend time together was wonderful.

1877
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:16,400
Please keep watching

1878
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:17,920
"Heartwarming Weekend."

1879
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,440
Welcome back to Signal Apartment.

1880
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:23,480
Not bad performance.

1881
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:25,640
How cute is this?

1882
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:28,520
What do you mean?

1883
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:29,400
What do you mean?

1884
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:30,520
Why so possessive?

1885
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:38,760
Raise your hand if you want one more.

1886
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:41,200
Let's go take some photos.

1887
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:44,760
Impressive.

1888
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:47,560
Today's outfit fits the theme perfectly.

1889
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,040
Yuxing said about today—

1890
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:51,000
I have to win this time.

1891
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:52,480
Don't lose to the "Special Forces" team.

1892
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:54,040
Please listen to the question.

1893
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:54,840
Grab it!

1894
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:56,080
I think that's correct.

1895
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:57,680
Duoduo gets one more point.

1896
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:00,000
Check in on them.

1897
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:00,800
Relationship status.

1898
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:03,360
So what does he call you?

1899
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:04,320
Lanlan Princess.

1900
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:09,240
How often do you two meet?

1901
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:10,320
More than fifteen times.

1902
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:12,760
That many?

1903
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,120
If I don't reply for a while,

1904
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:15,840
he sends me tons of messages.

1905
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:16,480
Explaining.

1906
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:18,000
Honeymoon phase.

1907
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:18,880
It's like two islands.

1908
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:19,800
If they want to merge,

1909
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:21,560
they need to blend together.

1910
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:23,240
Honestly, I'm curious

1911
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:25,000
about Xiaoyuan and Lechen's progress.

1912
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,360
Our progress too.

1913
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:31,400
I definitely have a lot of concerns.

1914
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:33,960
I feel it's not deep enough.

1915
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:35,160
It's getting a bit heated.

1916
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:38,520
This kind of adjustment is necessary.

1917
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:41,600
First, find the source of his fear.

1918
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:42,760
"Lan Jie."

1919
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:44,400
From now on, I'll call her "Lan Jie."

1920
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:47,680
When he wears a shirt,

1921
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:48,520
I always feel my heart flutter.

1922
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,240
He's super clingy.

1923
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:51,920
The type who hangs on you.

1924
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:53,400
She's adorable every day.

1925
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:55,960
Like a cute little bunny every day.

1926
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:58,040
What?

1927
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:01,320
I hope things get better between us.

1928
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:02,440
I'm listening to Faye Wong's song.

1929
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:03,440
You should listen.

1930
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:05,520
I'll still go by what

1931
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:06,800
makes both of us comfortable.

1932
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:07,840
That's how I'll interact.

1933
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:11,360
Two saplings growing together,

1934
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:12,720
sharing sunlight, warmth, and rain.

1935
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:15,040
Twisting together or growing upward.

1936
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:15,800
In the end,

1937
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:18,280
they'll become taller, stronger trees.

1938
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:19,720
I think this is called

1939
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:20,800
the courage of love.

1940
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:22,000
We can create so many

1941
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,320
wonderful memories together.

1942
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:25,920
Eat a bit more.

1943
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,000
Talk a bit more.

1944
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:27,960
Spend more time together.

1945
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:29,280
Heartbeat Cupid

1946
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:30,320
has prepared for everyone

1947
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:31,600
a trip to Lijiang, Yunnan.

1948
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:33,120
You can have a great time.

1949
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:35,840
It's so beautiful here.

1950
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:37,240
Absolutely stunning.

1951
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:43,120
Driving so fast.

1952
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:45,600
Slow down.

1953
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:47,120
Racing, huh?

1954
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:49,200
Whose car is this?

1955
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:51,080
Water.

1956
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:56,120
Turn around.

1957
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:57,840
So cool.

1958
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:02,120
Is it pretty?

1959
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:02,800
What do you think?

1960
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:04,760
Pretty ugly, right?

1961
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:05,760
Very cute.

1962
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:07,480
Looks great.

1963
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:08,440
Take one more shot.

1964
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:10,560
I look gorgeous.

1965
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:12,560
My least mentionable strength.

1966
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:16,560
So happy.

1967
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:20,240
Look at the mountains over there.

1968
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:25,600
Darn it, I messed up.

1969
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:30,760
Sunlight between my fingers.

1970
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:39,320
See you next weekend.

1971
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:24,200
What are those two yellow things?

1972
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:25,640
Maybe the AC made it cold.

1973
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:29,200
Who wants shrimp peeling service?

1974
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:30,800
Me.
