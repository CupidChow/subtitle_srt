1
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,800
What kind of interaction makes you feel comfortable?

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,680
What is it like?

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,320
We can be silent,

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,200
or talk nonstop,

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,600
or just chat about anything.

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,840
And nobody needs to

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,000
force themselves

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,520
just to

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,600
find topics to talk about,

10
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,680
or try to fit a certain vibe.

11
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,000
What I really mean is,

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,200
some things you did in the cabin,

13
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:29,960
like your actions,

14
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,960
for example,

15
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,080
those little notes about being allergic to romance,

16
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,440
what’s up with that?

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,600
Is that really you?

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,560
Would you do that in real life?

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,000
Yeah.

20
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,680
Okay.

21
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,360
Then maybe I’ll just double down.

22
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,040
What are you planning?

23
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,720
Have you ever had

24
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,040
the urge to persist in doing something despite knowing it's impossible?

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,800
Persisting even when you know it’s impossible.

26
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,160
I think I look forward more to

27
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,600
something lasting,

28
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,040
the kind that’s

29
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,440
stable,

30
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,120
stable and long-term.

31
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,760
Whether it’s

32
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,800
calm or passionate, it’s fine.

33
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,120
But

34
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,040
I need to see

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,080
some hope in it.

36
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,480
Right?

37
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,120
Yeah.

38
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,480
That’s nice.

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,680
Really nice.

40
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,880
I won’t settle in any relationship.

41
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,280
Settling is

42
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,920
irresponsible to both sides.

43
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,280
Honestly,

44
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,680
because I haven’t met

45
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,560
many suitable people,

46
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,840
I’ve just stayed

47
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,760
single.

48
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,480
It’s not easy.

49
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,880
Really not easy.

50
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,920
I really need to learn

51
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,320
a lot of your strengths.

52
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,080
There are many things I lack.

53
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,360
Do you ever feel the process is too painful

54
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,760
and end up backing off?

55
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,400
Honestly, yes.

56
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,600
Sometimes I convince myself

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,240
and make excuses.

58
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,480
I tell myself,

59
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,960
why not give it a try?

60
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:10,920
Right?

61
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,080
It’s just that

62
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,760
sometimes

63
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,000
I have to talk myself into it.

64
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,520
After you try these things,

65
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,760
it’s okay to fail.

66
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,240
It really is okay.

67
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,480
Worst case, you just go back to square one.

68
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,000
So the experience and journey matter most.

69
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,840
But you can’t say that for sure.

70
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,680
The result still matters.

71
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,240
Now you think the result is important?

72
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,440
That’s not what you said before.

73
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,000
The result.

74
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,760
You—

75
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,600
You’ve worked so hard,

76
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,560
but didn’t give me a result.

77
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,200
Then I—

78
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,520
Then I’d definitely be upset.

79
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,600
Of course you’d be upset.

80
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,320
Then I’ll try again.

81
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,440
What happens when you’re upset?

82
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,600
If I’m upset, I’ll try again.

83
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,400
I refuse to believe I can’t get that result.

84
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,520
So stubborn.

85
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,200
What are you like when you're in your worst mood?

86
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,680
At my worst,

87
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,840
you won't see it right now.

88
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,040
I'm looking forward to the future.

89
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,360
Emotions.

90
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,200
When I go out,

91
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,240
my emotions get unstable.

92
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,400
I really want to see everyone's different sides.

93
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,480
When emotions are at their most unstable,

94
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,640
or when they just explode,

95
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,560
I don't really show my emotions

96
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,600
in a very outward way.

97
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,880
Because I always feel

98
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,040
if I let my emotions out,

99
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,080
it will affect others.

100
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,040
I really don't want

101
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,440
others to be affected by me.

102
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,320
Don't call yourself a hedgehog anymore.

103
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,160
Call yourself a shell.

104
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,360
Or maybe an oyster.

105
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,000
You're making me clam up.

106
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,200
Only when it's cooked does it open up.

107
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,480
Even when I'm familiar,

108
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,800
I might not open up.

109
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,000
Honestly, hearing you say this makes me feel bad.

110
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,200
It really does.

111
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,680
I think a lot of people

112
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,120
go through things like this.

113
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,680
So it's because

114
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,000
after experiencing these things,

115
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,760
it makes all of us

116
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,040
I think it's a kind of defense mechanism.

117
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,600
It gets really strong.

118
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,720
So I think people like

119
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,440
you guys,

120
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,880
like you and Brother Jiao,

121
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,600
and others,

122
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,760
you all have this

123
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,160
very firm

124
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,560
way of doing things.

125
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,720
I really admire that.

126
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,840
Because I don't know why,

127
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,920
I feel like I've lost that drive.

128
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,880
I don't have that motivation.

129
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,920
Then maybe you just don't want it that much.

130
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,080
to get that thing.

131
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:25,760
No.

132
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:26,880
I do want it.

133
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,840
So you really want it.

134
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,560
I think I'm just too shy to express it.

135
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,760
Shy big guy.

136
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,440
Looking back on your journey,

137
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,760
do you think you're doing okay now?

138
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,520
In the cabin,

139
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,240
it's pretty good.

140
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,880
So far, so good.

141
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,760
I'm still looking forward to

142
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,240
the day when the cabin ends.

143
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,720
When everyone can

144
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,120
really open up.

145
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,560
I have so much I want to say.

146
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,120
It's so hard holding it all in.

147
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,720
What do you mainly want to ask?

148
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,880
Just all the things that happened in the cabin.

149
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,080
How everyone feels about it.

150
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,440
And then...

151
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:12,960
Yeah.

152
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,640
Stuff like that, right?

153
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,600
There's a lot more, just take your time.

154
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,040
Let's go. Maybe we should head back for today.

155
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,600
Okay.

156
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,280
I haven't read at all.

157
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,560
If you were going to an amusement park,

158
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,480
would you prefer just two people

159
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,320
or a bigger group?

160
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,440
It doesn't matter.

161
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,600
Even with more people, it's still just two hanging out together.

162
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:46,960
You'd talk.

163
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,840
Of course.

164
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,960
Learn more.

165
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,080
Go back and sleep.

166
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,840
It's really strange.

167
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,760
Why do your photos

168
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,280
always turn out so photogenic?

169
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,280
Really?

170
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,560
Look, that photo is really photogenic.

171
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,200
It's in my pocket.

172
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:11,720
Take it back.

173
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,600
Yeah.

174
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,600
You took it.

175
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,400
Why did you take it back?

176
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,440
Weren't you giving it to me?

177
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,360
If you gave it to me, can't I keep it?

178
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,920
I thought it was for sticking there.

179
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,040
You keep it.

180
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,960
It's fine, I—

181
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,440
I brought that camera.

182
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,320
We can take pictures later.

183
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,080
We can take pictures together then.

184
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,200
I've already gained weight.

185
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,520
Where?

186
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,240
Don't you think when you first met me

187
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,360
I was super skinny back then?

188
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,800
Handsome.

189
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,120
Thanks.

190
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,520
Unattainable love.

191
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,240
So confident.

192
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,400
Let's go cycling then.

193
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,320
Ride, let's go.

194
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,000
Let's go.

195
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,280
Cycling feels pretty nice.

196
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,040
Right?

197
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,360
It's not hot, so we won't sweat.

198
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,000
There's quite a breeze.

199
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,480
Feels like we're just entering a midsummer night.

200
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,560
The weather is so nice.

201
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,640
Dr. Fang.

202
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,840
What are you two doing?

203
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,080
You—

204
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,520
What are you doing?

205
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,160
You just got back.

206
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,320
How did you come back together?

207
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,200
What are you doing?

208
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,640
Can't we have a little "date" together?

209
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,640
Why do you two want to—

210
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,680
Where are you two going?

211
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,360
Where to?

212
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,720
Just circling around.

213
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,040
When are you planning to come back?

214
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,160
We'll be back soon, let's go.

215
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,000
Okay.

216
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,440
Dr. Fang suddenly got energetic.

217
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,760
There were two people inside just now.

218
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,240
Yeah.

219
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,680
So the park—

220
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,560
It's obvious who's in the park.

221
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,240
Right?

222
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,000
Eat, eat.

223
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,480
No idea.

224
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,200
Who is this?

225
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,840
And who is this?

226
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,960
Who?

227
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,440
Eat, eat.

228
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,000
Lanlan.

229
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,040
Yifan.

230
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,120
Yifan.

231
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,640
Hello, everyone.

232
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,320
You came back so late, Yifan.

233
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,560
Are you the only one in the car?

234
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,600
Let's go.

235
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,880
You came back together.

236
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:15,680
Yeah.

237
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,400
Let's go.

238
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:19,720
I'm going for it.

239
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,400
I feel like you suddenly got excited.

240
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,040
Give a shout.

241
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm heading out first.

242
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,160
Let's go.

243
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,400
We're back.

244
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,160
We're back.

245
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,800
Let's go, let's head up too.

246
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,160
We've got some braised snacks here, help yourselves.

247
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,920
So spicy.

248
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,800
So spicy.

249
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,760
Duoduo is really supportive.

250
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,240
It's super spicy but really tasty.

251
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,480
So intense.

252
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,640
Not spicy.

253
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,320
Not spicy.

254
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,160
You underestimated Wang Jue.

255
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,240
They've been making it for a long time.

256
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,520
If you all find this spicy,

257
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,120
I really want you to try this.

258
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,800
I've had this before.

259
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,800
It's super spicy.

260
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,960
How about putting this beef jerky in?

261
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,120
Put it in.

262
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,160
Give it to Ruilong.

263
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,080
Give it to Ruilong.

264
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,920
You.

265
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,720
You're a good buddy too.

266
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,160
I noticed

267
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,600
You're a good buddy too.

268
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,640
Yuxing.

269
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,360
I'm stuffed.

270
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,120
So spicy.

271
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,120
That cracked me up.

272
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,720
Let's put watermelon and Hami melon in.

273
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,200
Tell Ruilong this is our new creation.

274
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,000
That fruit mix.

275
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,600
What's this?

276
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,000
What's this big thing?

277
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,920
Lychee.

278
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,240
King lychee.

279
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,320
Such a huge lychee.

280
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,840
Super big and super tasty.

281
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:57,800
Then I'll have one.

282
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,120
Give me one.

283
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,720
I'll eat one.

284
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,000
Thanks.

285
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,400
Your hair doesn't look as good as it did yesterday.

286
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,160
You think so too, right?

287
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,560
Yeah.

288
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,440
But your glasses look better today than yesterday.

289
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,640
Took the advice—square frames.

290
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,400
You should try them next time.

291
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,040
Do gold or silver suit you better?

292
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,040
I have silver ones.

293
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,400
I think silver.

294
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,440
I have silver.

295
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,920
Square ones.

296
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,520
Don't you think

297
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,640
he looks better in square glasses than round ones?

298
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,200
I agree.

299
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,960
The gold-rimmed glasses suit him now.

300
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,320
Let me try them on.

301
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,200
Here, try them.

302
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,800
No.

303
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,160
Let him try.

304
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,360
Take a look.

305
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,000
You'll get marks if you wear them.

306
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,360
These square ones might not suit me.

307
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,440
Let me see.

308
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,360
Not bad.

309
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,400
Take a look.

310
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,120
I think it looks a bit odd.

311
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,120
It's fine.

312
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,880
I think guys should just

313
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,240
"weld" their glasses to their faces.

314
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,720
Suddenly feel ten points smarter.

315
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,240
Right.

316
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,200
Yu Xing, look at the camera.

317
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,920
Three, two, one.

318
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,400
That's a forced smile.

319
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,320
You can tell it's a bit awkward now.

320
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,080
Yi Fan, watch your expression. Come on.

321
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,600
Looks good.

322
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,600
Dr. Fang, pay attention.

323
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,960
Please watch your facial expression.

324
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,320
Three, two, one.

325
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,800
You two don't have to be so

326
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,920
I mean, sitting so stiffly.

327
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,240
Want me to take the photo for you?

328
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:34,560
Sure.

329
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,840
We took quite a few photos yesterday.

330
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,640
We can take one together.

331
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,000
Or maybe the guys can take a photo of us girls.

332
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,400
Sounds good.

333
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:39,720
Is that okay?

334
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,080
Dr. Fang, show us how it's done.

335
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,000
I'll show you.

336
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,640
Come on.

337
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,400
Yi Fan, come over.

338
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:43,800
Come here.

339
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,240
This is Dr. Fang's

340
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,120
future required course.

341
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,240
Three, two, one.

342
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,160
Looks good.

343
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,840
Nice.

344
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,760
Planning to check what's in the fridge.

345
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,520
What can we make with that?

346
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,840
Fried eggs are pretty simple.

347
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,480
I was thinking of making fried eggs too.

348
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,320
You can make noodles.

349
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,440
What kind of noodles?

350
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,320
Um...

351
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,720
Scallion oil noodles.

352
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,480
I don't know how.

353
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,960
I'll make eggs, you do the noodles.

354
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,280
Okay.

355
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,400
Then...

356
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,120
That's easy.

357
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,360
What else do we usually make for breakfast?

358
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,640
Porridge, then egg pancakes.

359
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,000
Egg rolls.

360
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,800
Fried eggs.

361
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:36,920
Noodles.

362
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,640
Then let's make

363
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,960
fried eggs and noodles.

364
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,320
Just these two.

365
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,640
Sounds good.

366
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,840
For breakfast, I'll also stir-fry

367
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,240
a dish.

368
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,240
Stir-fry a dish.

369
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,680
You stir-fry a dish.

370
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,880
Should we also make some rice?

371
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,520
No, I'll just make tomato and egg stir-fry.

372
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,680
Haven't you always wanted to make it?

373
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,000
I won't compete with you.

374
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,080
I'll make one for you.

375
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,240
The kind without sugar.

376
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,880
What time are you getting up?

377
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:12,840
Nine o'clock, I guess.

378
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,200
Then don't forget to do it.

379
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:16,720
Okay.

380
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,880
You don't eat carrots.

381
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,960
Not a big fan.

382
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,000
Then maybe skip them.

383
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,480
I was thinking of having some.

384
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,160
Maybe some ice cream.

385
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,120
Your stomach probably can't handle ice cream.

386
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,040
Yeah, it still hurts a bit.

387
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,640
Honestly.

388
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,120
Here, eat this too.

389
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,720
Is that okay?

390
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,160
Sure.

391
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,160
Definitely.

392
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,160
Why did you bring the goose over?

393
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,040
This was the one I liked first.

394
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,080
But the one you just wore

395
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,720
really does look like

396
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,440
a crayfish.

397
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,320
Really?

398
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,880
Why is everyone back so late today?

399
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,040
You two came back pretty late too.

400
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,800
I was pretty worried about you guys.

401
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,280
What did everyone go off to do?

402
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,280
Except for the two at the park,

403
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,440
the other three

404
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,720
were unusually late.

405
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,520
So what were you worried I was doing?

406
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,040
But since Yifan wasn't back either, I wasn't worried.

407
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,240
So you thought we were together.

408
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,520
Yeah, I thought you two were together.

409
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,200
What if Yifan came back?

410
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,680
If Yifan came back, you would also

411
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,640
probably be fine.

412
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,840
Or maybe just say

413
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,280
you had something to do.

414
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,360
Hello.

415
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,400
Is anyone over there?

416
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:46,840
No one.

417
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:47,960
Nobody's back yet.

418
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,960
We're the first and second.

419
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,360
Just the two of us.

420
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,080
So what should we do?

421
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,080
Have you eaten?

422
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,000
I have.

423
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,120
I haven't.

424
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,080
Let's see what's to eat.

425
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,480
You look beautiful today.

426
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,200
Thanks.

427
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,760
Princess, please open the door.

428
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,360
Okay.

429
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,240
What's there to eat?

430
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,280
There are cherry tomatoes you picked.

431
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,440
And cherry tomatoes we picked.

432
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,920
Eggs and dumplings.

433
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,720
And zongzi.

434
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:24,800
Okay.

435
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:26,960
Let’s boil two eggs.

436
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,160
Sure.

437
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,640
I’ll keep you company for a while.

438
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,320
Sounds good.

439
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,040
How have you been lately?

440
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,680
Me?

441
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,280
Same as always.

442
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,760
So from the very beginning,

443
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,760
did you understand

444
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,160
your own feelings?

445
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,760
At first sight, the very first glance?

446
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,600
I didn’t really notice at first.

447
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,240
But I did the next day.

448
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,920
Then I realized, and it’s been the same ever since.

449
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,040
What do you find most attractive about him?

450
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,800
What is it?

451
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,280
The thing that attracts me most

452
00:15:59,280 --> 00:15:59,760
I’m really curious.

453
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,280
He’s attentive.

454
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,760
I really like attentive people.

455
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,600
Someone who pays attention to little things.

456
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,480
Even things we just mention casually,

457
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,520
like things we say offhand,

458
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,880
he remembers them.

459
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,000
He remembers for a long time.

460
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,840
Like cooking, for example.

461
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,480
And other details in daily life.

462
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,600
We’re really similar.

463
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Including our upbringing.

464
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,400
And even now,

465
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,600
the way we look at things,

466
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,800
and how we handle things are very alike.

467
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,320
Actually, I hope to find

468
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,120
someone quite similar,

469
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,120
but with a little bit of difference.

470
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,720
So his appearance

471
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,120
is also your type, right?

472
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,440
From the very beginning.

473
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,080
Saying it like that makes me sound so shallow.

474
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,160
But it’s true.

475
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,400
I’m totally shipping it.

476
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,040
That’s really important, okay?

477
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,800
It is important.

478
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,240
It’s not shallow.

479
00:16:59,240 --> 00:16:59,920
Alright.

480
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,240
It’s a first impression choice.

481
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:02,520
It’s a first impression choice.

482
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,560
Let’s go.

483
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,040
This is for you.

484
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,920
Thanks, what is it?

485
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:26,800
Guess.

486
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,520
Let me see.

487
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,840
A neck pillow for sleeping while traveling.

488
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:36,840
Yes.

489
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,920
It’s for sleeping in the car.

490
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,560
Yeah, it’s pretty small.

491
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,920
That’s so practical.

492
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,880
It’s really compact.

493
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,880
Yeah, I think it’s easy to carry.

494
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,840
Very portable.

495
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,720
Let me take a look.

496
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,800
This is its packaging.

497
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,240
Yes.

498
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,240
It’s really cute and tiny.

499
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:01,760
Yes.

500
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,200
Thank you.

501
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,760
Do you want to build with blocks?

502
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,560
Sure.

503
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,480
Do whatever you like.

504
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:19,720
Wait a second.

505
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,400
I want to build my own style.

506
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,480
Build your own style.

507
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,600
Do you build blocks at home by yourself?

508
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,560
I have.

509
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,160
Really?

510
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:29,920
It’s

511
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,640
nicely arranged.

512
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,040
Yeah.

513
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,000
And also,

514
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,920
Village Chief.

515
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,560
What’s the Village Chief’s name in Pleasant Goat?

516
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,280
Slow Goat.

517
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,720
The grass on the chief’s head.

518
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,840
What’s up?

519
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,640
Excuse me?

520
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,720
We still need to make two more.

521
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,080
You do it.

522
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,040
I’m tired.

523
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,600
Super fast.

524
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,160
What about you? Did you do anything today?

525
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,120
I moved today.

526
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,760
I moved today.

527
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,400
Moving?

528
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,040
So how long is your daily commute now?

529
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,960
It used to be twelve minutes.

530
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,560
Twelve minutes commute.

531
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,200
Just a twelve-minute walk.

532
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,560
And now you moved to a place that takes

533
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,680
maybe an hour.

534
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,520
Thirty minutes.

535
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,080
Thirty minutes.

536
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,040
Walking to work every day.

537
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,320
Done.

538
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,880
Looks like there’s only one left.

539
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,840
Maybe it’s not the right piece.

540
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,720
It should be.

541
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,760
Because none of the others have this.

542
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,960
Because they’re all the same.

543
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,520
See?

544
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,720
Smart.

545
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,880
We’re just smart.

546
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,760
Exactly.

547
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,640
Are you super smart or just a little smart?

548
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,360
What do you think?

549
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,320
You’re super smart.

550
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:55,880
Thanks.

551
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,720
Go, super smart!

552
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,720
It can even close.

553
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,480
How are you so smart?

554
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,000
My tools have upgraded.

555
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,640
Should we take the whole thing up?

556
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,440
We can get the ice maker later.

557
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Let’s take that up first.

558
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,120
Take it up.

559
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:19,880
This one.

560
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,200
You look sporty today.

561
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,360
Sporty?

562
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,720
What are you planning to do today?

563
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,240
You look like you’re going biking.

564
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:28,880
Biking.

565
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,680
Biking in the rain?

566
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:32,760
My eye.

567
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,120
What’s wrong?

568
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,560
Did a mosquito get in?

569
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,320
Did a mosquito get in?

570
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,360
Could it be a bug?

571
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,960
No, I don’t see anything.

572
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,560
Do you want to look up?

573
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,360
Seems like nothing’s there.

574
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:44,880
Nothing.

575
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,000
Do you want to work out?

576
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,840
I actually already worked out today.

577
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,080
You worked out, right.

578
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,320
Are you always this quiet?

579
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:07,960
Do you think that I

580
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,120
have been getting quieter lately?

581
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,520
Yeah, say something!

582
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,560
Aren't you working right now?

583
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,840
Does me talking bother you?

584
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:16,600
No, not at all.

585
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,040
You being too quiet actually distracts me more.

586
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,000
Let me think of a question.

587
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,560
Are you the clingy type in a relationship,

588
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,680
or

589
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,320
do you prefer both people

590
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,920
to have their own space?

591
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,880
I actually really need

592
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,120
someone to be my emotional anchor.

593
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,280
What do you mean by emotional?

594
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,880
Like, in your mind,

595
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,960
you're always thinking about that person,

596
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,080
and you know

597
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,880
they're thinking about you too.

598
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,960
That kind of stable relationship

599
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,360
Got it.

600
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,080
It makes you feel more grounded.

601
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:01,800
It helps you

602
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,080
feel more motivated to do things.

603
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:05,880
I see.

604
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,360
So when you're feeling really down,

605
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,560
when you're really upset,

606
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,560
do you prefer to be alone or...

607
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:19,760
This really depends.

608
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,200
There are two situations.

609
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,360
One is when I

610
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:21,880
well,

611
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,720
for example, if I mess up,

612
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,200
right?

613
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,840
then I might ask someone for help.

614
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,240
I’d ask, “What should I do about this?”

615
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,840
But if

616
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,960
it’s really a breakup situation,

617
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,560
or something with those emotions,

618
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,280
I’d rather be alone at first.

619
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,680
Then I’d

620
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,600
try to sort things out myself.

621
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,480
What if it’s not a breakup?

622
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,040
Just an argument between both sides.

623
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,840
Would you comfort first,

624
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,000
or solve the problem first?

625
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,400
What does that smile mean?

626
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,320
I’d probably choose to calm down first.

627
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,200
The other person might need to calm down too.

628
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,680
Some problems really

629
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,600
aren’t

630
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,720
something you can fix right away.

631
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:09,760
Yeah.

632
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,280
Some issues

633
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,160
might be

634
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,640
like landmines you planted before,

635
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,320
or

636
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,960
could involve future problems.

637
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,520
Right?

638
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,760
So these things,

639
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,360
if you can’t solve them right now,

640
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:20,960
you just

641
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,880
need both people to calm down and think.

642
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,280
I feel like when you’re with someone privately,

643
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,960
and when you’re with everyone,

644
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,080
you’re like two different people.

645
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:33,880
How so?

646
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,880
The contrast is huge.

647
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,480
What contrast?

648
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,080
Like, when you’re with everyone,

649
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,520
you’re really

650
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:41,760
cheerful,

651
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,760
lively and energetic.

652
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,560
But maybe

653
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,160
when there are fewer people,

654
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,240
like just two people together,

655
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,120
you’re more

656
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:51,680
calm,

657
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,320
careful and gentle.

658
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,920
I wouldn’t go as far as calling it “calm.”

659
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,240
I wouldn’t go as far as calling it “calm.”

660
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:56,960
Pretty much.

661
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,920
Just a big contrast.

662
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,160
Yeah.

663
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,680
So when I came back from Beijing and gave you

664
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,080
that thing,

665
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,320
what was your first reaction?

666
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,320
Like, your first

667
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,520
feeling or mood?

668
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,200
What did you think when you saw me?

669
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,040
Unbelievable.

670
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,320
Surprised.

671
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,520
But you,

672
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,760
what you showed

673
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,840
was it the same as what you felt inside?

674
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,960
I was really surprised and touched.

675
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,600
Very moved.

676
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,040
I didn’t feel

677
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,360
because it matched what you thought.

678
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,560
It’s like my words

679
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,160
could actually be heard by someone.

680
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,080
That was my genuine feeling at the time.

681
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,480
But you said

682
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,640
you don’t want others to

683
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,680
do things like that for you.

684
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,880
Do you get what I mean or not?

685
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:52,960
No.

686
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,880
I really don’t get it.

687
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,760
Can you be a bit clearer?

688
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,760
People are complicated creatures.

689
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,360
Please don’t oversimplify

690
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,240
and generalize, okay?

691
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,480
Alright.

692
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,760
Though I still don’t get what you mean.

693
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,680
It’s fine, you’ll get it eventually.

694
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:08,960
Okay.

695
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,760
It’s your homework.

696
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,000
Go think about it on your own.

697
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,120
Otherwise, what are you even studying here?

698
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,560
Observing Wang Lechen’s diary.

699
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,800
I’ll write you a thesis.

700
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,360
Thanks.
