00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,760
Hello

2
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,320
Lanlan

3
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,200
Yeah

4
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:02,880
Lanlan

5
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,680
Hello

6
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,320
Hello

7
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,080
Have you eaten?

8
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,400
Have you eaten?

9
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:15,920
I had a little

10
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:17,920
I had a little

11
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,880
So you're not hungry now, right?

12
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,840
I'm not hungry now

13
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,240
What are you guys doing?

14
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:20,760
Do you want to go out for a walk?

15
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,760
Sure, let me put something away first

16
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,760
Okay, take your time

17
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,840
Hello

18
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,520
Hello

19
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,720
How long have you been here?

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,320
I just got here.

21
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,520
Let's go.

22
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,160
You all already ate, right?

23
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,040
Yeah, we all ate.

24
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,160
So Sister Jiajia is

25
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,320
your mom's friend.

26
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,280
But my relationship with her

27
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,360
We're really close.

28
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,960
There's no generation gap between us, yeah.

29
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,080
How did you manage that?

30
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,000
Well, first, I think she's

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,160
very open-minded.

32
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,160
She's progressive.

33
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,520
We have lots of common topics.

34
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,120
And then

35
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:49,960
she's given me

36
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,480
a lot of help and encouragement.

37
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,080
So

38
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,600
I think it's fate.

39
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,440
We've known each other for almost ten years.

40
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,480
So with her,

41
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,040
I can totally open up.

42
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,560
I tell her everything.

43
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,520
I share it all with her.

44
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,240
Yeah.

45
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,760
But Sister Jiajia really seems

46
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,680
like that kind of person,

47
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,880
like a teacher.

48
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,360
She's very detail-oriented, right?

49
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,920
Yeah, I think she's pretty detailed.

50
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,440
She stumped me yesterday.

51
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,880
Because you keep giving everyone

52
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,880
Because you keep giving everyone

53
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,400
perfect answers.

54
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,760
Everyone wants to hear perfect answers.

55
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,680
I saw her yesterday

56
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,880
kept praising you.

57
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,440
She really likes you.

58
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,400
She said you're thorough and thoughtful.

59
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,480
Maybe she likes Mao Xue Wang.

60
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,520
Mao Xue Wang really is delicious.

61
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,360
Thanks.

62
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,760
How many times have you made it?

63
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,680
This is my first time.

64
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,680
You're so talented!

65
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:47,800
Seriously.

66
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,760
Let's go.

67
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,640
You're so impatient.

68
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:07,960
Let's go.

69
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,960
I'm dying of thirst.

70
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,320
Let's go.

71
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,960
I'm sweating all over.

72
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,520
You're wearing too much.

73
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,480
It's so hot.

74
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,640
Let me take it off for you.

75
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,120
Done.

76
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,640
I'll go to the kitchen and pour some water.

77
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,120
What are you doing?

78
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,160
Why are you sitting here?

79
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,280
No one's here, so I'm sitting here.

80
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,680
Who did you go walk the dog with?

81
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,920
I went with Xiaoyuan.

82
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,080
Why are you sitting here alone?

83
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:53,920
I have a task.

84
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,880
No one's here.

85
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,040
Then you don't need to sit here.

86
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,400
I'm boiling something.

87
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,560
Are you okay?

88
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,120
I'm fine, I'm really just boiling water.

89
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,960
Is it boiling yet?

90
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,560
The thing is,

91
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,040
this water is too slow.

92
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,320
Did both of them poop?

93
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,360
Just peed.

94
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,040
Okay.

95
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,440
How do you check?

96
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,640
How many are left?

97
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,560
This spot

98
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,480
is empty.

99
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,520
How do I take this photo?

100
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,160
Done.

101
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,120
Do I press this to take it?

102
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,240
You need to twist it out.

103
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,120
Yeah, and then...

104
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,520
Then press this to shoot.

105
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,160
Right.

106
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,920
Is there one here?

107
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,160
Yeah, it has one.

108
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,840
Darn it, it's so ugly.

109
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,920
Let's look forward to it.

110
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,520
What is it?

111
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,480
What are you guys talking about?

112
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,120
Dr. Fang is here.

113
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,480
Didn't you see him just now?

114
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,080
No, I didn't.

115
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,400
You're here alone.

116
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,920
What are you doing by yourself?

117
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,400
I made dumplings over there, want some?

118
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,360
Yeah, we have dumplings over there.

119
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,000
No.

120
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,920
They have dumplings over there.

121
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,720
I've already eaten.

122
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,920
How many did you eat?

123
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,800
I made them.

124
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:30,960
I made them.

125
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,280
You're not eating?

126
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,200
I am, I am.

127
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,920
Hurry up and eat.

128
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,760
Did you make them or did you make them?

129
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,400
We made them together.

130
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,280
We made them together.

131
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,240
Alright.

132
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,560
This one doesn't work.

133
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,640
It won't show up.

134
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,440
How come it won't show up?

135
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,720
Maybe it's the film.

136
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,240
It's broken.

137
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,160
No, film isn't like this.

138
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,880
Then why didn't the photo come out?

139
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,960
No idea.

140
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,000
Maybe your skills aren't good enough.

141
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,880
Is it tasty?

142
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,960
I haven't tried it yet.

143
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,880
It's good.

144
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,280
Great, that's good.

145
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,760
Let's go, you two come out.

146
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,040
Let's go.

147
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,720
So tired.

148
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,960
Can't take the photo.

149
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,800
If the last one shows up,

150
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,760
this one will show up too.

151
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,840
If that one doesn't show up,

152
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,800
this one probably won't either.

153
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,280
It can't be broken, right?

154
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,080
Did I bother you two?

155
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,000
No.

156
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,840
You're just eating eggs tonight?

157
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,080
I really already ate.

158
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,360
Boil some for a late-night snack.

159
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,720
Dr. Fang, let me play a song for you.

160
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,880
How are you feeling now?

161
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,880
You can play the piano?

162
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,080
So, what should we play?

163
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,760
"Mariage d'Amour."

164
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,160
Which one is "Do"?

165
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,240
This one is "Do."

166
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,680
This is the standard one.

167
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,840
This one too.

168
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,000
No, this is the high "Do."

169
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,400
What do you want to play?

170
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,560
I don't know, just messing around.

171
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,320
Got it.

172
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,040
Really?

173
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,240
Got it.

174
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:44,920
Got it.

175
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,720
It takes time for it to show up.

176
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,280
Look, this photo turned out great.

177
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,520
Where?

178
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,200
You two look so "sweet."

179
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,400
Way too "sweet."

180
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,200
Wait, am I in this?

181
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,400
Yeah, you're in it.

182
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,840
Where's the focus in this photo?

183
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,320
Isn't that your head in the back?

184
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,200
Mark that Dr. Fang is in the back.

185
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,960
Such a good shot.

186
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,240
It's pretty good.

187
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,160
The focus is clear.

188
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,120
It's so chubby.

189
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,320
We should be able to take photos now.

190
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,080
Can you get a shot?

191
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,280
It should work.

192
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,080
Take another one for me.

193
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,640
Here, one for you.

194
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,400
Nico, can you still take pictures?

195
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,200
Come here.

196
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,080
Yeah.

197
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,240
Right here.

198
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,440
Okay, three, two, one.

199
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,240
Your smile looks so forced.

200
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,080
Is my hair messy?

201
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,400
I want a photo too.

202
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,600
Take one for me.

203
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,600
Sure.

204
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,120
Just sit here, yeah.

205
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,880
Okay.

206
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,800
I'll squat next to it.

207
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,960
Come over.

208
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,280
Shouldn't we shoot vertically?

209
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,120
Shouldn't we shoot vertically?

210
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,920
Done.

211
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,640
Great teamwork.

212
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,640
Dr. Fang.

213
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,520
Does it look good?

214
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,880
It looks good.

215
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,040
This one looks good too.

216
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,280
My skills aren't bad.

217
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,600
This angle you picked is killer.

218
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,400
Please, I'm begging you.

219
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,600
Then take another one.

220
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,280
Take one more.

221
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,840
You know how to frame a shot.

222
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,080
You're shooting from below, right?

223
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,840
Who takes photos from below?

224
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,280
This one actually looks pretty good.

225
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:34,840
Yeah, it's pretty good.

226
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,640
Really, it's nice.

227
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,800
See?

228
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,200
The crowd has sharp eyes.

229
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,600
This one's for you.

230
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,200
The main focus is the dog.

231
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:40,800
Even though the shot isn't great,

232
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,800
you look pretty good in it.

233
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,600
Alright, one more, come on.

234
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,520
Me and Dr. Fang.

235
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,440
How should we sit?

236
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,040
I'm about to fall over.

237
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,160
Okay, three, two, one.

238
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,880
Are you sure we both fit in the shot?

239
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,960
Feels like only my hair is in it.

240
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,640
That's it.

241
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,320
Darn it.

242
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,400
Dr. Fang, guess we're not meant to be in a photo together.

243
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,320
Maybe next time.

244
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,000
There'll be another chance.

245
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,520
We'll do it next time.

246
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,320
How could it be gone?

247
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,320
It must be used up.

248
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,680
Now it's completely empty.

249
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,040
I can go back tomorrow.

250
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,040
And bring my film camera.

251
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,320
Sounds good.

252
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,600
This book is everywhere.

253
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,760
But I only found it after coming to the cabin.

254
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,040
That's when I learned about this book.

255
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,280
You didn't know before?

256
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,040
"The Answer to Heartbeats"

257
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,080
No, I didn't.

258
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,160
Aren't you the "King of Games"?

259
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,400
This is my first time hearing about it.

260
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,920
But I've never seen anything like this.

261
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,800
"The Answer to Heartbeats"

262
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,080
Ask a question.

263
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,080
I'll ask you.

264
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,800
But with this,

265
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,520
You can ask any question, right?

266
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,400
Like what?

267
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,200
For example,

268
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,480
Is Chichi a stubborn person?

269
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,880
I can answer you.

270
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,400
I can answer you.

271
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,480
I want to see you flip the page.

272
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,480
I'll flip it myself.

273
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,800
Face life head-on.

274
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,080
Especially when it gets tough.

275
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,760
So for this question,

276
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,680
Facing life means

277
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,120
you need to let go.

278
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,560
Let me face this question.

279
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,160
Yeah, let you face it.

280
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,000
Don't be stubborn.

281
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,600
When am I ever stubborn with my words?

282
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,400
Let me ask.

283
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,360
It's fine.

284
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,480
My friends all call me "the king of stubbornness."

285
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,000
Why are you so stubborn?

286
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,120
"The champion of hard-mouthed talk."

287
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,880
Why?

288
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,600
Because...

289
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,520
I have a mysterious confidence in some things.

290
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,520
(That's why I'm) "the champion of hard-mouthed talk."

291
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,600
Let me think about what I want to ask you.

292
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,520
Whoever thinks of a question first can ask.

293
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,120
You thought of something again.

294
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,560
Whenever you hesitate,

295
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,720
what are you thinking about?

296
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,000
What am I hesitating about?

297
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,440
But the problem is,

298
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,640
this question is so abstract.

299
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,680
(Let's switch to) the self-reflection part.

300
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,320
I'm making friends with time.

301
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,400
Do you get it?

302
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,400
Then I think it should be this.

303
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,680
This one should work too.

304
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,520
Fun and fascination are the start of a relationship.

305
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,000
You also need to build trust and a shared future.

306
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,520
That really suits you.

307
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,120
It fits.

308
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,280
Do you agree?

309
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,040
I agree.

310
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,720
I'll eat a little first.

311
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,840
You eat a little first.

312
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,960
Bro Jiao.

313
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,160
Yifan, what a coincidence!

314
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:42,720
Yeah.

315
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,320
You just got back?

316
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,160
Just got back.

317
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,120
No one's here.

318
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,120
Is everyone gone?

319
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,440
I brought some cake.

320
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,880
I bought cake today too.

321
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,400
This one probably needs to be taken away.

322
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,960
Okay, got it.

323
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,120
I'm going to put something down.

324
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:54,760
Sure.

325
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,560
Wait for me a moment.

326
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,080
How are you?

327
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,120
I feel...

328
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,160
Not much has changed.

329
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,000
That's it.

330
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,920
I'll put my stuff down first.

331
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,360
Wait for me a moment.

332
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,640
We can chat after you put your things down.

333
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,800
Okay.

334
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,840
Let me ask how you're doing first.

335
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,160
Because I think I'm doing okay.

336
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,960
Did you notice what I'm wearing today?

337
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,920
It looks familiar, right?

338
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,920
It's from before.

339
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,640
Today's outfit is the one from

340
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,760
the day of the (Shuangdao) exchange.

341
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,520
The exchange day.

342
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,080
Yeah.

343
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,280
Feels like it's been a long time.

344
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,000
Feels like ages.

345
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,920
I was saying that when I put it on today.

346
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,200
I said it feels

347
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,920
like suddenly

348
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,720
it’s like time looped for a moment.

349
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,360
That's a great way to put it.

350
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,360
If I answered your question from that day again today,

351
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,360
the one you asked me,

352
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:51,400
that question you asked me,

353
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,200
today,

354
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,240
starting today,

355
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,200
my self-control is at ten.

356
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,800
I'm back to my original self.

357
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,760
That's right.

358
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,080
That's the score I gave myself.

359
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,080
It should be my

360
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,840
mental stress relief state.

361
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,840
On the first day, it was ten.

362
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,360
Up to today,

363
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,200
it's probably six.

364
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,280
So now the pressure is higher.

365
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,720
Maybe my ability to relieve stress

366
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,800
isn't as strong as before.

367
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,560
Not as strong.

368
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,200
So now I might

369
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,880
need help from others.

370
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,120
Maybe I haven't changed yet.

371
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,440
Just these past few days,

372
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,240
you've had deep talks with her (Xu Rulan).

373
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,480
You talk deeply every day.

374
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,640
What do you think she's thinking?

375
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,480
Because after chatting with her,

376
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,160
I feel like we're similar people.

377
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,200
So in her situation,

378
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,320
she would

379
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,920
be in what kind of state?

380
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:39,960
Because everyone

381
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,400
probably thinks differently.

382
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,440
What I thought last night

383
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,360
is totally different from what I think today.

384
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,680
Maybe I still feel

385
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,440
that while you follow your heart,

386
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,200
like I just said,

387
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,560
I need to make sure I'm in a good state first.

388
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,400
Only when I'm stable

389
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,760
enough,

390
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,440
maybe

391
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,320
I can

392
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,640
connect better with others.

393
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,360
If I'm

394
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,160
not stable,

395
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,920
I might not be myself.

396
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,560
I might

397
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,400
change a lot.

398
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,080
So,

399
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,800
I agree.

400
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,040
I think that's right.

401
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,760
Let's go up together.

402
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,320
Here's a gift for you.

403
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,640
So cute!

404
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,320
Little Bernese Mountain Dog (plush toy).

405
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,440
Yeah, and then

406
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,600
actually,

407
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,320
I prepared it quite early.

408
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,160
Because last time you said

409
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:54,960
you said

410
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,040
you wanted to bring "Benben" too.

411
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,840
into this little cabin.

412
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,160
Yeah.

413
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:57,560
To play.

414
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,240
So I thought

415
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,640
since "Benben" can't come for now,

416
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,040
this one can keep you company instead.

417
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,960
And this is for "Benben".

418
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,960
Is this its dog tag?

419
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,360
Yeah, I had this tag custom-made.

420
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,480
The front has its name.

421
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,680
And I wrote a little message.

422
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,320
Translated, it means

423
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,920
"In a small world, happiness comes first."

424
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,960
Yeah, happiness comes first.

425
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,000
Right, happiness first.

426
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,040
On one hand, I think

427
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,080
for Benben,

428
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,600
a dog's world

429
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,760
is probably just that big.

430
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,840
So I hope Benben

431
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,080
can always be happy.

432
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,280
But on the other hand,

433
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,600
when I ordered this,

434
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,320
it was

435
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,800
after I shared some

436
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,800
negative feelings with you.

437
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,040
After those nights,

438
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,600
I had some thoughts.

439
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,160
And I also felt

440
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,680
everyone's world is different,

441
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,680
and everyone moves at their own pace.

442
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,080
So I think you can

443
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,600
just not worry too much about it.

444
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,160
And

445
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,960
being happy is important.

446
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,440
Yeah, I hope you can be like Benben,

447
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,200
and put happiness first.

448
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,360
Yeah, this is kind of

449
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,800
a little way to keep you company.

450
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,960
Happiness is most important.

451
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,120
Thank you.

452
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,920
Yeah, I think I can let go of a lot.

453
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:03,920
Okay.

454
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,520
Alright, I'll head down first.

455
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,120
You and Benben play for a bit.

456
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,920
Thanks.

457
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,520
I brought coconuts from Hainan today.

458
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,640
Coconuts from Hainan.

459
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,240
You went to Hainan?

460
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,640
Here, have one.

461
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,160
Thanks.

462
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,360
Zhiheng.

463
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,040
You.

464
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,080
I haven't gotten one yet, thanks.

465
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,280
So cool.

466
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,760
It's like being at the beach instantly.

467
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,200
Really.

468
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:36,880
You got one, right?

469
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,960
I drank mine over there.

470
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,280
Alright.

471
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,360
Who brought these?

472
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,880
You went on a business trip?

473
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,760
You went and came back the same day?

474
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,280
Went for a meeting.

475
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,360
What time did you get up?

476
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,160
Super early.

477
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,840
Boss Liu discussed deals worth hundreds of millions.

478
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,440
Just a few "small goals."

479
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,760
So aren't you really tired today?

480
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,520
Exhausted, I can't take it anymore.

481
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,400
Got even tanner.

482
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,480
Compared to you, anyone looks tanner.

483
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,720
You really know how to talk, Bro Zihan.

484
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,760
Ruilong.

485
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,400
Thanks for bringing the snacks.

486
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,880
I brought Swiss rolls today.

487
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,400
Do you know why I bought them?

488
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,520
I saw the slogan on it says

489
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,760
"Unstoppable Rui."

490
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,160
I thought this suits Ruilong perfectly.

491
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,160
I also bought mine because of the slogan.

492
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,960
"Good fortune shared."

493
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,760
Really? I saw the slogan says

494
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,560
"Unstoppable Rui."

495
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,320
It's actually referring to the college entrance exam.

496
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,440
And it just happens to say "Unstoppable Rui."

497
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,440
And it's also Ruilong's "Rui."

498
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,760
Thanks.

499
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,480
Let's have an "Unstoppable Rui."

500
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,280
Then go work out.

501
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,840
Was supposed to go to the gym.

502
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,120
Now we're eating instead.

503
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,400
Here to eat.

504
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,360
Want to join us for food?

505
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,120
Eating again.

506
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,440
There are Swiss rolls.

507
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,760
"Unstoppable Rui."

508
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:23,920
Are you hyperactive?

509
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,360
Are you hyperactive?

510
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,280
I'm getting a bit anxious.

511
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:26,920
To be honest,

512
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,400
I want to try it.

513
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:27,960
What are you doing right now?

514
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,560
Yeah, okay, I'll cut faster.

515
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,560
This big bag of snacks is...

516
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,800
I mean,

517
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,560
Everyone has...

518
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,080
How do we have so much food?

519
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,800
Today.

520
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,960
Which one? This snack?

521
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,760
You brought this.

522
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,120
Yeah.

523
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,280
Are we on a grade school field trip?

524
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,640
I even brought something for Ruilong.

525
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,640
Spicy peanuts.

526
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,960
Spicy peanuts.

527
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,200
Whenever I see spicy peanuts, I want to buy them.

528
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,040
Now it's already...

529
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,000
I see peanuts and immediately think of Ruilong.

530
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,640
I see chocolate and think of Ruilong too.

531
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,160
Yeah, chocolate also reminds me of Ruilong.

532
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,520
Alright, done.

533
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,640
Let's split it into a few plates.

534
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,480
Here.

535
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,520
Thank you.

536
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,440
I want some Swiss roll too.

537
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,760
Okay, put it here.

538
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:21,720
Thanks.

539
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,280
This is so tasty.

540
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,600
It's fine to eat with chopsticks too.

541
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,720
I'm washing dishes downstream from you.

542
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,480
I'll do it, just leave it here.

543
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,320
Just as I said that, I saw it.

544
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,720
Thanks.

545
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,000
Our teamwork is on point, I mean...

546
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,520
Thanks to Bro Zihan for washing the dishes.

547
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,920
Always saying one thing and meaning another, right?

548
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,640
If you want to try washing dishes,

549
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,520
you can do that too.

550
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,440
I don't want to.

551
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,600
Isn't she a bit sharp-tongued?

552
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,520
He wants to get to know me from your perspective.

553
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,400
You should experience it yourself.

554
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,680
Bro Zihan.

555
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,120
Describe me in three words.

556
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,320
Let him get to know me.

557
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,640
I'll describe you in three words.

558
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,400
He's already asking you.

559
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:35,600
He's already asking you.

560
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,400
Should I be serious?

561
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,880
Or just joke around?

562
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,680
Be serious.

563
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,680
If I'm serious, I can't answer tonight.

564
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,840
I need to go home and think about it.

565
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:44,840
Okay.

566
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,880
Why?

567
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,320
Then just joke.

568
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,240
Can you say it now?

569
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,880
Even joking, you can't just say anything.

570
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,240
I can only think of one word right now.

571
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,320
I can only think of one word right now.

572
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,920
Then say that one word first.

573
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,400
That word is...

574
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,480
I think you're a very...

575
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,320
wise girl.

576
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,920
Mainly wise.

577
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,480
I saw the look in his eyes.

578
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,960
Wise.

579
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,320
I've learned something new about you.

580
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,440
I'm pretty sharp-tongued.

581
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,040
I can tell.

582
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,440
Are you still gentle then?

583
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,880
Anyway, you're gentle in the cabin.

584
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,000
Let's go.

585
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,520
Let's go.

586
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,360
Are you worried

587
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,480
that I'm not a gentle person?

588
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,840
There's nothing to worry about.

589
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,080
Whatever you are is fine.

590
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,520
Really?

591
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,040
Really.

592
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,520
Then yesterday you said

593
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,800
about that question you answered,

594
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,040
do you remember?

595
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,360
You answered one,

596
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,440
saying that in a relationship,

597
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,520
what you can't stand the most is

598
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,480
trust.

599
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,840
Not trust.

600
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,280
Then what is it?

601
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,920
Boundaries.

602
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,480
But you answered

603
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,240
that what you value most is trust, right?

604
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,240
Not the most.

605
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,440
I think trust is the most important.

606
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,640
So if I happen to be

607
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,160
someone who finds it hard to trust others,

608
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:11,840
what should I do?

609
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,800
Just take it slow.

610
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,120
After spending more time together,

611
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:16,960
you'll get to know

612
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,720
what kind of person the other is.

613
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,640
Then trust will come.

614
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,120
Yeah.

615
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,200
Xiaofen,

616
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,040
the green strap still isn't showing.

617
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,800
The green strap still isn't showing.

618
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,960
Yeah, why can't it be hidden in the back?

619
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,240
If you're tying it, tie them together.

620
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,400
You tie it.

621
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,040
I have to hold it, or it'll fall.

622
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,760
Want me to help you tie it?

623
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,440
You do it.

624
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:48,920
Let me tie it for you.

625
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,480
Yeah, don't mess up the hairstyle.

626
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,600
Mainly,

627
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,160
Okay.

628
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,640
Okay.

629
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,040
As soon as I let go, it falls.

630
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,800
I haven't tied it yet.

631
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,040
Are you done tying it?

632
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,360
Not yet.

633
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,600
Then I'll start picking a template.

634
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,240
Sure, just like always.

635
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:08,920
Yeah.

636
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:09,880
Where's the person?

637
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,120
Can you step forward a bit?

638
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,120
What's this?

639
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,040
You're actually pretty nice.

640
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,480
It's all my fault, my fault.

641
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,840
Let's do it again.

642
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,280
You need to go up a bit.

643
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,400
Three.

644
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,960
Your photo got stuck.

645
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,560
No, why?

646
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,240
It's not—it's doing it again.

647
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,520
It's not letting us take the photo.

648
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,640
It's not letting me fulfill this wish.

649
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,520
Maybe we have to come every day.

650
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,480
Yeah, look, it's blurry again.

651
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,440
Why is it like this?

652
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,960
Yesterday, when you asked me to make a heart,

653
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,440
you canceled the heart.

654
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,400
Are you a sensitive and suspicious little boy?

655
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,440
Not suspicious, not at all.

656
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,760
Are you all like this?

657
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,520
Yeah, because I see everyone does this.

658
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,440
What else?

659
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,440
It's the last one.

660
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,760
Not ready.

661
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,720
It's okay, alright.

662
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,040
It's okay, alright.

663
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,960
Yeah, that's it.

664
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,160
Filter.

665
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,840
This one.

666
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,040
Why do I hear Jin Yuxing's voice?

667
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,560
They came to work out.

668
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,600
Really, go look it up.

669
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,960
"Hot nerd."

670
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,240
Only the last photo looks good.

671
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,840
The expressions in the other photos are all kind of awkward.

672
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:49,880
Are you even listening to me?

673
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,200
Are you listening to me?

674
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,600
Yeah, I am.

675
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,600
Hot nerd.

676
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,160
Right?

677
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,040
Yeah.

678
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:56,400
Hello.

679
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,360
Hi.

680
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,360
What are you doing?

681
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:00,960
I'm stretching.

682
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,680
I know this one, it's a full-body stretch.

683
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,120
I'm just stretching here.

684
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,480
You look a bit messy.

685
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,960
This is good, helps you relax.

686
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,200
While Yuxing is talking,

687
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,560
While Yuxing is talking,

688
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,960
he still hasn't changed his

689
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,440
position.

690
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,600
Like a worm.

691
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,480
A worm.

692
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,680
Let's sit for a bit.

693
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,760
Let's watch here for a while.

694
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,960
Isn't this a gecko?

695
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,200
At least call me

696
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,360
one of the Five Venoms, okay?

697
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,720
You all came to watch us.

698
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,400
See how you guys train.

699
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,000
Is it funny?

700
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,440
It's really funny.

701
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,280
But actually,

702
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,160
it needs a strong core.

703
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,000
Really?

704
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,280
Stop watching, let's go.

705
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,880
I'm speechless.

706
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,480
Do you feel like

707
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,720
you're used to life in the cabin now?

708
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,720
It's definitely different from outside.

709
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,880
But I'm slowly getting used to it.

710
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:27,920
Pretty quickly.

711
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,400
Very quickly.

712
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,120
Yeah, really fast.

713
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:29,760
Very fast.

714
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,800
The pace in the cabin is really fast.

715
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:32,840
The pace here is really fast.

716
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,400
Every day goes by so quickly.

717
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,400
Especially since we still have to work.

718
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,240
Like going to Hainan for a business trip, right?

719
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,880
This looks delicious.

720
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:48,560
Yeah.

721
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:52,720
This Japanese food

722
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,440
is really not in my

723
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,160
area of expertise.

724
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:54,640
Mainly,

725
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,000
so what is in your area?

726
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,200
Mostly homemade Chinese food.

727
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,200
A little better, I guess.

728
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,560
I like strong flavors.

729
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,080
Does Luosifen count as strong flavor?

730
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,920
Definitely.

731
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,360
So you like Luosifen too?

732
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,360
What about you?

733
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,360
I love Luosifen.

734
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,760
There's even Luosifen hotpot.

735
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,560
Did you know?

736
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,600
I don't think I've ever tried it.

737
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,280
I've seen it though.

738
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,800
We should try it sometime.

739
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,520
Do you feel like

740
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,040
you're getting bitten by mosquitoes here?

741
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,440
Look.

742
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,200
I'm actually pretty fair, right?

743
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,240
Yeah, you are.

744
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,520
But am I kind of dark?

745
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:32,760
You're not dark.

746
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,320
I'm really dark.

747
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,200
They say I'm super dark.

748
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:34,960
I said yeah.

749
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,800
I never use sunscreen.

750
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,640
Even when I go skiing

751
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,120
or hiking, I don't use it at all.

752
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,520
So they say that's why I'm so dark.

753
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,840
I said, look, I'm fair under my clothes.

754
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,240
It's all from being outside.

755
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,120
They say I should use sunscreen.

756
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,600
I don't like using sunscreen either.

757
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,720
I'm really dark too.

758
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,200
You're not dark.

759
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,560
Compared to me, you're definitely not dark.

760
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,000
Every day, I just

761
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,960
end up with bruises all over.

762
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,520
Why?

763
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,240
No idea.

764
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,680
Maybe I get hit while sleeping.

765
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,080
When you’re dreaming,

766
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,200
you’re sparring with someone.

767
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,720
Fighting every night.

768
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,160
Do you dream a lot?

769
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,000
I have tons of dreams.

770
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,120
My dreams are hard to describe.

771
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,720
They’re always really strange.

772
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,080
Maybe it’s because of what I think about during the day.

773
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,160
My thoughts are really wild and imaginative.

774
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,920
So at night, your dreams

775
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,560
are just like Alice in Wonderland.

776
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,680
Alice in Wonderland.

777
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,280
You have a princess dream inside.

778
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,040
It’s like

779
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,000
really sci-fi kind of stuff.

780
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,920
Like colonizing Mars every day.

781
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,920
And all sorts of things.

782
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,920
That sounds exciting.

783
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,480
There was a time before

784
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,480
when I made a rule for myself

785
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,880
to write down my dreams first thing after waking up.

786
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,320
What did you dream about?

787
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,080
Did you keep a record?

788
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,680
Maybe after getting up,

789
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,800
I’d already forgotten about it.

790
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,720
I’d forget to remember my dreams.

791
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,680
That’s how it is.

792
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,720
You even have to review them.

793
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,480
After getting up,

794
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,640
you can eat a date.

795
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,520
Are dates good for digestion?

796
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,880
Isn’t it “swallowing dates whole”?

797
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,680
What do you mean by “swallowing dates whole”?

798
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,960
Dates aren’t good for digestion.

799
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,200
Take a bite of a date, then a bite of banana.

800
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,240
The taste is really weird.

801
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,080
Really?

802
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:01,400
Seriously?

803
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,400
You guys should try it.

804
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,400
Want to have one?

805
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,320
I just had one.

806
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:05,920
Have another.

807
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:06,920
Maybe later.

808
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,840
Yeah, you take a bite first.

809
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,120
Then take another bite.

810
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,120
Which one first?

811
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:10,880
Either is fine.

812
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,240
Then eat a date.

813
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,520
Is there anything weird?

814
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,200
What does it taste like?

815
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,440
Hard to describe.

816
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,680
It’s really astringent and raw.

817
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,880
I want to try.

818
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,200
You guys don’t know about this?

819
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,200
I don’t know, never tried it.

820
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,000
I used to prank people with this.

821
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,760
I want to try.

822
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,120
Will you share half with me?

823
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:30,960
Sure.

824
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,400
Here you go.

825
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,560
It stinks.

826
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,120
Right?

827
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,240
That’s why

828
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,600
I prank people with it.

829
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,000
It’s so smelly.

830
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,480
Which one smells so bad?

831
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,920
Eating banana and date together.

832
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:49,600
No.

833
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,480
It tastes like air freshener.

834
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,840
Does it matter?

835
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,120
Don’t you think it’s amazing?

836
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,720
It is pretty amazing.

837
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,920
I want to try too.

838
00:31:59,080 --> 00:31:59,840
Go ahead and try.

839
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,920
No idea which genius bought bananas again.

840
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,720
And dates too.

841
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:03,880
Me.

842
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:04,960
But

843
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,280
These bananas were bought on open day.

844
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:06,840
These were bought today.

845
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,360
Okay.

846
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,680
After I tried it once,

847
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,160
I never wanted to try again.

848
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,840
It’s way too smelly.

849
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,640
Even worse than Houttuynia cordata.

850
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,080
Not that bad.

851
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,400
But I think Houttuynia cordata is okay.

852
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,720
How do two sweet things together

853
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,040
end up tasting like this?

854
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:28,720
Honestly,

855
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,080
Maybe in my next life.

856
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,080
Where should I sit?

857
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,120
Sit up there.

858
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,080
Alright.
