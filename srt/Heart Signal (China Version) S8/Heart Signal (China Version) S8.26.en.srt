1
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,840
Our Heart Signal apartment is about to welcome

2
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,520
an open house event.

3
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,280
a sports day.

4
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,760
The guys will invite their

5
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,920
bro squad to visit the Heart Signal apartment.

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,480
Do they have outside help?

7
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,040
So many people!

8
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,920
Today is so exciting!

9
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,080
One, two.

10
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,200
Here they come.

11
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,960
One, two.

12
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,360
Fighting for love.

13
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,440
The rivalry is intense.

14
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,640
Look.

15
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,840
They're getting closer as they jump, look!

16
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,240
Oh my.

17
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,200
One side is in sync, the other is a mess.

18
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,240
Why do I feel like Jue is a bit

19
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,680
so happy she's about to fly.

20
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:31,720
Tired, right?

21
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,120
Our Heart Signal apartment

22
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,320
is about to have a double-choice date.

23
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,240
Everyone gets two date invitation cards.

24
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,000
Two cards.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,560
If both give each other a card, it's a match.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,200
You pick me, I pick you.

27
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,440
Only then can they go.

28
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,640
That's intense too.

29
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,600
That's showing your hand.

30
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,080
Let’s go!

31
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,200
Then hurry, let’s go!

32
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,240
Go for it!

33
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:56,960
Here they come.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,320
I love watching this kind of thing.

35
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,240
It's so thrilling!

36
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,240
Is it over there?

37
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,360
I think so.

38
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,320
Feels like it.

39
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,440
This is

40
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,480
the sports day.

41
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,520
Who’s that?

42
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,000
This is

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,640
the special guest we invited?

44
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,760
Who’s that?

45
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:01,800
Here they come.

46
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,720
The car’s here, babe.

47
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,360
Babe.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,720
Do your best.

49
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,200
Just the two of us.

50
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,240
Let’s just not mess up.

51
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,800
That voice sounds familiar.

52
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,640
Is it a previous guest?

53
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,680
What?

54
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,800
It’s Haoyun (Zhang Jin).

55
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,920
Hello.

56
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,440
Really?

57
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:22,960
It’s Zeng Zeng.

58
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,160
Feels like old friends coming home.

59
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,240
That’s the best.

60
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,120
Yifan even fell over.

61
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,720
Why is Yifan’s standee still here?

62
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,240
That’s hilarious.

63
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,400
Yifan went to work.

64
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,120
Hi, everyone.

65
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,440
Hello, everyone.

66
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,560
Hi, everyone.

67
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,360
Hi, everyone.

68
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,640
We are from Heart Signal

69
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,400
Season 6.

70
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,880
the Jin Zhao team.

71
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,000
Hello.

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,720
Saw you guys online.

73
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,880
Congratulations on your wedding!

74
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,360
Thank you.

75
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,160
You saw it too?

76
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,440
Unlocked a new status.

77
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,600
Congrats!

78
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,720
Best wishes.

79
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,200
Happy wedding!

80
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,800
I saw it.

81
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,600
Just proposed.

82
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,800
Just said yes.

83
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,040
The key is “just now.”

84
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,600
Yeah.

85
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,880
I’m really happy for them.

86
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,840
So happy.

87
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,040
And seeing them

88
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,600
feels even more meaningful.

89
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,400
Yeah.

90
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,920
When did you guys

91
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,920
start to feel

92
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,560
you kind of knew

93
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,000
what you wanted?

94
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,880
Funny you ask.

95
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,320
The two of us

96
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,720
also during the sports day.

97
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,520
It was like

98
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,160
an open chance to interact.

99
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,040
That was actually our first time

100
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,960
I clearly got

101
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,320
a clear response from her.

102
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,480
It was at the sports day.

103
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,400
We were in the same group.

104
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
After some interaction,

105
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,840
we realized each other’s feelings.

106
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,720
And then

107
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:53,920
we felt

108
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,320
it was really nice.

109
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,840
I chose Haoyun

110
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,440
because I didn’t want her to pick someone else.

111
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,000
You can ship them live.

112
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:09,840
You guys.

113
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,280
How was it in the cabin before?

114
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,240
Pretty good.

115
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,120
Not bad.

116
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,800
So up to now,

117
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,680
do you have a crush?

118
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,600
That’s an important question.

119
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,320
Can you say?

120
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,440
Yes, of course.

121
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,080
Can you say?

122
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,400
Is there?

123
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:33,760
Yes.

124
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,840
Duoduo is brave.

125
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,400
Take a guess.

126
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,480
If you guess right, I’ll tell you.

127
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,280
This is hard to guess, right?

128
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:47,840
You can guess this.

129
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,440
Can you?

130
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,640
What about Xiao Yuan?

131
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,320
He has a direction.

132
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,000
Chichi.

133
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,800
Isn't that clear yet either.

134
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay.

135
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,800
Ambiguous.

136
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,800
We'll look for clues later, babe.

137
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,560
Let's get some drinks now.

138
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,440
Okay, let's go.

139
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,160
Let's go.

140
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,880
Over here.

141
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,800
We got you Master Kong Jasmine Tea.

142
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,040
This one is sugar-free.

143
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,400
We all love this flavor.

144
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,080
It's light and guilt-free.

145
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,760
The floral scent is so rich.

146
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,040
It's perfect for our sports day today.

147
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,960
We can relax a bit.

148
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,880
Yes, its tea flavor is super authentic.

149
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,440
It's the flavor you like.

150
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:31,960
Yes, that's right.

151
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,760
I really like this flavor.

152
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,960
I'm shipping them.

153
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,440
Let's have a toast.

154
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,120
Okay.

155
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,920
Let's do our best at the sports meet.

156
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,440
Welcome.

157
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,040
Let's go!

158
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,960
Thanks.

159
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,480
Are the guys here?

160
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,040
They're here.

161
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,600
Are there new friends?

162
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,320
Who?

163
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,160
Who is it?

164
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,520
The bro squad, I guess.

165
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,360
Two cars.

166
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,320
So many people.

167
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,960
Why two cars?

168
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,920
I've had so many competitions lately.

169
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,560
Don't worry. They must be events you're good at.

170
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,440
So many people.

171
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,440
Do they have backup?

172
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,160
So many.

173
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,360
A lot of people.

174
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,520
The one in the pink shirt is...

175
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,520
Is there an extra friend?

176
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,880
No way.

177
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,520
Is that a female guest?

178
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,480
Yes, that's a female guest.

179
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,520
Hello, everyone.

180
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,880
Hello, everyone.

181
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,840
My bros.

182
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,760
So many people.

183
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,320
Today is so exciting.

184
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,240
All I can say is...

185
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,480
this...

186
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,600
This is spectacular.

187
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,760
This will definitely bring out everyone's competitive side.

188
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,280
Hello, everyone.

189
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:41,800
We are...

190
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,240
from Heart Signal Season 6.

191
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,360
The "Jin-Zhao" couple.

192
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,560
Yes, and you can just call me Haoyun.

193
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,080
Right, and I'm Zeng Zeng.

194
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,800
Then let's first welcome...

195
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,040
the new friends everyone brought.

196
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,800
Okay, I'll start.

197
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,200
Let me introduce myself first.

198
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,120
My name is Liu Zihan.

199
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,840
This is my graduate school classmate and good friend,

200
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,640
Shen Ningxin.

201
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,440
We have a startup project...

202
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,600
that I'm working on with him.

203
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,280
This is my college classmate of six years.

204
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,840
In our first year of grad school,

205
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,800
I met him.

206
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,800
After graduation, we also...

207
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,840
work in the same city.

208
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,920
And we both work at a hospital.

209
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,400
Which department are you doctors in?

210
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,360
Usually,

211
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,680
we hang out every week.

212
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,520
We eat together.

213
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,000
So he's pretty much my best friend.

214
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,160
His name is Yu Xiangle.

215
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,880
I usually call him Le.

216
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,840
Le.

217
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
When he said I was his...

218
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,920
best friend,

219
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,920
I was actually a little touched.

220
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,160
I feel like he'd be a great wingman.

221
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,720
Of course.

222
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,280
He's definitely my best friend too.

223
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,800
So he didn't...

224
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,760
you two never talked about...

225
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,800
After all, he's a bit shy.

226
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,080
Right?

227
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Well,

228
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Little Jiao

229
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,600
Jiao Zhiheng

230
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,800
Yeah

231
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,120
Yesterday I used his name and

232
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:01,600
Sorry

233
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,800
No

234
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,040
Your Hao isn’t much better than others

235
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,840
I’ve known my friend for 26 years

236
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,120
Childhood friend

237
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,360
Does that count?

238
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,520
You can guess

239
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:15,960
Childhood friend

240
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:16,960
Nope

241
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,520
Kindergarten classmate

242
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,800
No

243
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,160
He wants Lanlan to answer

244
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,520
Real brothers

245
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:26,920
Cousins

246
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,360
Very close

247
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:27,880
Yeah

248
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,080
He’s my older cousin

249
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,160
His name is Jiao Yiwen

250
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,240
You can call him Big Jiao

251
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,200
Big Jiao

252
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,200
Big Jiao Bro

253
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,160
Little Jiao Bro

254
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,960
Hello everyone

255
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,880
This way it’s easier to remember

256
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,400
Yeah

257
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,520
Big Jiao, Little Jiao

258
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,880
With Little Jiao, from the moment you meet him

259
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,080
you can feel his enthusiasm

260
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,200
Yeah

261
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,040
And

262
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,240
he’s also caring

263
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,320
very considerate

264
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:51,960
Yeah

265
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,600
He really motivates everyone to do better

266
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,040
Yeah

267
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,120
Feels like after his friend arrived

268
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,320
he got a bit more shy

269
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:00,880
I think so too

270
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,240
He gets nervous when his friend is around

271
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,720
Even shyer than before

272
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,800
He really is

273
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,720
A friend I’ve known for twelve years

274
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,240
He studied sports

275
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,560
We’ve known each other since middle school

276
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,080
And we’ve always been close

277
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,840
We know each other inside out

278
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,400
He’s my last line of defense

279
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,360
That’s high praise

280
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,360
That’s a really high compliment

281
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:23,960
Yeah

282
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:25,560
This line

283
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,480
This line

284
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,600
is very meaningful

285
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,920
Maybe I haven't been feeling down lately.

286
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,000
No one reaches out to me anymore.

287
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,600
How would you introduce Le Chen to everyone?

288
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,800
Go easy on him.

289
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,680
Le Chen.

290
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,280
First, he's pretty good-looking.

291
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,400
Among my friends,

292
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,960
he's one of the more handsome ones.

293
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,440
And secondly,

294
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,800
he's simple and cute.

295
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:51,680
And then...

296
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,000
That's it.

297
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,720
That's it.

298
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,920
Go easy on him.

299
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,880
How about saying a bit more?

300
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,880
I can't think of anything else.

301
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,080
I can't think of anything else.

302
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,600
Because we're good friends.

303
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
Brotherhood is in the heart.

304
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,160
Yeah.

305
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,560
This is my friend Lin Pengfei.

306
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,240
Andrew (Lin Pengfei).

307
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,760
When I came to Shanghai,

308
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,360
he was the first good friend I met in my first week.

309
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,280
I usually hang out with him the most.

310
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,480
I don't know how to introduce you.

311
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,080
What should I do?

312
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,040
What should I do?

313
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,520
The most important thing is,

314
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,480
just don't embarrass Yiwu people.

315
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,280
Okay.

316
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,240
He's too abstract, hard to describe concretely.

317
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,320
Even friendship is abstract.

318
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,800
Yeah, friendship is abstract too.

319
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,800
This is my best friend.

320
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,200
We were classmates in middle school.

321
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,360
His name is Zheng Jishuai.

322
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,120
Yeah, I usually call him Jishuai or Ashuai.

323
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,480
Yeah.

324
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,800
We've known each other for almost fifteen years.

325
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,520
We can talk about anything.

326
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,360
Anything goes.

327
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,320
Yeah.

328
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,040
Even bank card passwords?

329
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,120
He hasn't asked me that, though.

330
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,040
How would you describe your friend?

331
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:02,840
"Unreliable."

332
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,160
"Unreliable."

333
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,640
This friend...

334
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,480
Right off the bat...

335
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,160
He often stands me up.

336
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,320
No way.

337
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,200
So I saved his contact as

338
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,120
"A pigeon."

339
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,080
I saw Yu Xing's expression.

340
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,640
Let me suggest a small direction.

341
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,880
Because today we're here

342
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,680
to

343
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,720
help your friend find true love.

344
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,280
I'm unreliable to you,

345
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,440
but reliable to others.

346
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,040
Good bro.

347
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,440
That's a high EQ answer.

348
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,200
That's the main point.

349
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,320
So how would your friend

350
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,640
introduce Yu Xing to female friends?

351
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,200
He's become much more mature these past two years.

352
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,040
Much more mature.

353
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,560
Yeah.

354
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,800
His family's business

355
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,360
needs him to manage it himself.

356
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,680
Yeah, his parents

357
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,520
have handed him the responsibility.

358
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,640
Yeah, he's taken on the responsibility.

359
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,920
So he's much more mature than before.

360
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,920
The unreliable things just said were about me.

361
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:12,920
Yeah.

362
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,240
Because between us bros,

363
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,160
it doesn't really matter.

364
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,880
Yeah, being bros is what counts.

365
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,840
We haven't introduced the girls yet.

366
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,520
Girls, please introduce yourselves to everyone.

367
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,120
I'm Chichi.

368
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,000
Chichi.

369
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,600
Chichi.

370
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,920
Chichi.

371
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,640
I'm Xiaoyuan.

372
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,080
Xiaoyuan.

373
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,040
Duoduo.

374
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,920
Lanlan.

375
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,840
I'm Wang Jue.

376
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,640
Wang Jue.

377
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,600
Chichi, Xiaoyuan, Duoduo, Lanlan, Wang Jue.

378
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,280
This round should be pretty exciting.

379
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,720
But I'm worried it might be too intense.

380
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,000
But the more rivalry, the better.

381
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,840
That's more fun to watch.

382
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,400
Looking forward to it.

383
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:05,920
Alright.

384
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,720
Next up, our first event.

385
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,520
It's called

386
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,160
Boy—

387
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,080
Boyfriend Power Challenge.

388
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,080
Guys and their friends compete in strength.

389
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,280
The first match

390
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,520
will be between Floor 801 and Floor 802.

391
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,040
They'll compete as two teams.

392
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,480
It's 801 versus 802.

393
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,120
The winners of this round

394
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,680
can invite girls to join their team

395
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,560
for the next round.

396
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,760
So everyone, do your best!

397
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,880
Give it everything you've got.

398
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,960
If not now, when will you fight for first?

399
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,800
I feel the urge to win kicking in.

400
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,920
Yeah.

401
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,960
Little Jiao is determined to win.

402
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,120
This will definitely spark everyone's competitiveness.

403
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,440
Alright, let's go.

404
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,560
Our warriors,

405
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,640
bro squad,

406
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,120
We've got this.

407
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,640
Nope.

408
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,120
With you, we're solid.

409
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,920
With Andrew, we're set.

410
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,440
Their team is really strong.

411
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,120
Yeah, and Ruilong's stamina is great too.

412
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,160
Should we discuss our strategy first?

413
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,200
How should we do this?

414
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,640
I think tug-of-war takes skill.

415
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,400
The last one is

416
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:20,960
the strongest one.

417
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,960
The heaviest, right?

418
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,960
Those with more weight, stand at the front.

419
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,840
That's just me.

420
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,920
You two can stand in front.

421
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,600
Okay.

422
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,640
Because the first gets pulled away.

423
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,360
Then it's over.

424
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,840
So professional.

425
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,280
Both sides have different strategies.

426
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,400
Let's split left and right.

427
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,240
Stand apart like this.

428
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:36,960
Come on.

429
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,360
Ready.

430
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,320
Let's go.

431
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,000
This is so fun to watch.

432
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,320
Which side do you think will win?

433
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,880
Or who do you want to win?

434
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,400
I'm rooting for this side.

435
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,560
Because this side is

436
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,160
the first floor.

437
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,520
I think so too.

438
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,600
A bit looser.

439
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,800
This side, I guess.

440
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
Looks stronger.

441
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,240
Well, in that case,

442
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,560
I'll pick this side.

443
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,480
Hold tight.

444
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,400
We're holding tight.

445
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,200
I think Ruilong's side will win.

446
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,320
They're taller and bigger.

447
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,120
I think Floor 802 has a chance.

448
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,160
I'm supporting Little Jiao.

449
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,760
Then I'll support Dr. Fang.

450
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,200
Watching this makes me want to join in.

451
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,000
They're all matched up, look.

452
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,080
Alright.

453
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,840
Is everyone ready?

454
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,000
Ready!

455
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:37,680
Alright.

456
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,200
Ready!

457
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,240
Okay.

458
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,960
Three

459
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,960
Two

460
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:53,880
One

461
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,200
One, two

462
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,320
Here we go

463
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:02,160
One, two

464
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,920
The rivalry is intense, babe

465
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,120
Look

466
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:08,920
One, two

467
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:12,760
So fierce?

468
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:23,160
One, two

469
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,880
Two, one

470
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,480
Two

471
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,080
One, two

472
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,080
Go for it!

473
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,760
It's a real fight

474
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,280
Stay calm

475
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:36,960
Don't move

476
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,360
One, two, three

477
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,360
One, two, three

478
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,600
See?

479
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,600
There's strategy

480
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,400
One, two

481
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,960
Floor 802 is so strong

482
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,240
Boyfriend power

483
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,040
One, two, three

484
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,320
Stay steady

485
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:05,760
One, two

486
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,320
Keep going!

487
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,200
So fierce

488
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,840
One, two

489
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,720
Careful

490
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,120
If you slip, it's over

491
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,280
Slip and you're really done

492
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,040
Go Little Jiao!

493
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,960
Little Jiao

494
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,320
One, two

495
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:34,960
Dr. Fang

496
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,400
Go for it!

497
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,240
One, two

498
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,640
Fighting for love

499
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,840
Almost there

500
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,200
So close

501
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,160
Sit back, stay steady, don't move

502
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,200
Little Jiao

503
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:52,560
No

504
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,840
Fell

505
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,720
This is so fun to watch

506
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,080
It's intense

507
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,840
I'm getting goosebumps watching this

508
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,320
Congrats to Floor 802 for winning

509
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,000
You guys are really strong

510
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,840
You two are so fierce

511
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,680
You guys are pretty tough

512
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,720
Look at these friends

513
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,200
One by one

514
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,160
They're like iron blocks

515
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,200
Come on, high five

516
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,840
Bro squad from Floor 802

517
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,560
You can invite the girls first

518
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,080
They said they're inviting the girls

519
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,480
Don't pick the wrong one

520
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,120
Let's go!

521
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,640
Aren't you choosing?

522
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,160
Okay, Dr. Fang

523
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,400
You can't invite by yourself

524
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,600
Only your friends can help invite

525
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,040
Raise your hand quickly

526
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,760
He still doesn't know who to pick

527
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,880
His friends are anxious

528
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,840
They're trying hard

529
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,080
I'll do it

530
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,640
Yu Xing's friend

531
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,040
Come on, which girl do you want to invite?

532
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,440
To join your team

533
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,520
Invite Lanlan

534
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,840
Didn't expect that

535
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,120
Invite Lanlan

536
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,680
Lanlan, okay

537
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,040
No need

538
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:46,800
It's fine

539
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,920
It's okay

540
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,520
Dr. Fang is super happy

541
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,240
True

542
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:52,560
What?

543
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,440
He helped Dr. Fang invite Lanlan

544
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,560
Anyway, she's on their team now

545
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,760
A lucky hit

546
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,760
Is he really that popular?

547
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,560
What?

548
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,360
I mean, is he really that sought-after?

549
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,840
His friends.

550
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,920
Little Jiao's friends asked if he's that popular.

551
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,280
These friends are so cute.

552
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,280
What should Teacher Jiao do?

553
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,400
Right now, Teacher Jiao and I are the most stressed.

554
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,280
I get it.

555
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,760
So we still have two more.

556
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,960
Who can be invited first.

557
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,520
You choose.

558
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,160
Me?

559
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:33,520
Yeah.

560
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,080
You pick.

561
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,640
Go ahead.

562
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,360
Choose.

563
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,080
Who?

564
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,080
Pick the one in blue.

565
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,320
Blue clothes?

566
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,400
Who is that?

567
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,800
Pick the one in blue.

568
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,440
Me.

569
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,360
Xiao Yuan.

570
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:47,920
That works.

571
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,680
Helped (invited).

572
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:49,760
Me.

573
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,680
Xiao Yuan.

574
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,320
Go.

575
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,880
Why did you invite this girl?

576
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,520
Her blue outfit looks nice.

577
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,480
He picked her because she looks good.

578
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,240
Her blue outfit looks nice.

579
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,240
So straightforward.

580
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,720
I like these friends.

581
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,400
Um...

582
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,000
I pick, right?

583
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,440
Who did he choose?

584
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,640
This is crucial.

585
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,520
Then Duoduo.

586
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,200
Then Duoduo.

587
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,360
Then Duoduo.

588
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:25,800
I'm going.

589
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,120
So happy.

590
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,120
Happy.

591
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,040
Where do I stand?

592
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,280
Where do I stand?

593
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:32,800
Here.

594
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,600
I'll stand here.

595
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,160
You're back again.

596
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,280
I'm back again.

597
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:42,920
Duoduo obviously is

598
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,680
pretty athletic.

599
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,280
That's right, she is.

600
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,960
That's the vibe these guys give.

601
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,920
But right now,

602
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,880
when they're making this decision,

603
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,800
he must think his reason makes sense.

604
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,360
Of course.

605
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,160
Okay.

606
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,600
Now, our bro squad from the 801st floor

607
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,160
can also go

608
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,960
help your friends invite someone.

609
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,720
Anyone want to invite first?

610
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,480
Zi Han.

611
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,200
Who?

612
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,320
Chi Chi.

613
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,200
Sure.

614
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,080
Chi Chi.

615
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,240
Chi Chi, go.

616
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,840
Who wants to make the next invitation?

617
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:25,680
Okay.

618
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,400
Wang Jue.

619
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:28,960
Thank you.

620
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,600
That works too.

621
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,160
Jue is with Longlong over there.

622
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:33,840
Jue is...

623
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,480
Yeah, with Ruilong.

624
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,120
Yes, that's a good choice.

625
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:36,960
Jiao's friend.

626
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,760
You can stand in for Jiao.

627
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,120
Invite Yifan.

628
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,840
No problem.

629
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,280
Yes, invite Yifan.

630
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,160
Invite Yifan.

631
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,280
Hold up the sign.

632
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,800
So cute!

633
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,360
Put it at the end.

634
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,800
Heavyweight player.

635
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,200
Next up, the game is called

636
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,200
"Face-to-Face Heartbeat."

637
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,840
What does that mean?

638
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,680
"Face-to-Face Heartbeat."

639
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,640
"Face-to-Face Heartbeat."

640
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,440
"Face-to-Face Heartbeat."

641
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,040
What does it mean?

642
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:08,760
What does it mean?

643
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,640
Babe, explain it for us.

644
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,320
Let's just do it together.

645
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,360
Come on.

646
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:12,800
Step out.

647
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,400
The rules are:

648
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,000
Boys and girls pair up.

649
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,880
Then jump rope face to face.

650
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,160
Timed for two minutes.

651
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,480
The team with the most jumps wins.

652
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,160
Will you feel

653
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,200
each other's heartbeat in those two minutes?

654
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,560
We'll do a demo.

655
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,040
Demo.

656
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:27,880
Like an old married couple.

657
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:28,960
Old married couple.

658
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,080
Sweet.

659
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,600
So sweet.

660
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,760
Let's do a demo.

661
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,120
I'll do this.

662
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,200
Like this.

663
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,200
Go ahead.

664
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,040
See what works.

665
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,840
They're really good together.

666
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,040
One, two, go!

667
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,520
One, two, go!

668
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,680
I'm shipping them!

669
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,320
So hard.

670
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,080
This is tough.

671
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,520
The rope is too short.

672
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:58,960
It's hard.

673
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,480
Darn it.

674
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,200
Here comes a big fail.

675
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,360
Okay, let's get closer.

676
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,680
This distance is tricky.

677
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,600
Don't step back.

678
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,400
Three, two, one.

679
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,360
So in sync!

680
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,360
So happy.

681
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,160
Amazing!

682
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,400
Done.

683
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,320
Done.

684
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,920
That's basically it.

685
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,480
Great job!

686
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,680
Okay, then...

687
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,720
You can discuss within your team.

688
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,720
How to pair up.

689
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,680
Decide who pairs with whom.

690
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,680
Dr. Fang is finally reassured.

691
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,480
Dr. Fang says,

692
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,920
That makes it easy.

693
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,480
Is this to pair with

694
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,400
someone from your own team?

695
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,680
Definitely with your own team.

696
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:11,920
This...

697
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,320
How will that side pair up?

698
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,560
Duoduo and Xiaoyuan.

699
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,160
Right.

700
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,800
They're all with Lechen, right.

701
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,280
What about Chenchen?

702
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,440
Another tough problem.

703
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,840
You have two minutes now.

704
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,960
Discuss within your team.

705
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,600
Mainly, it just feels a bit awkward.

706
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,480
Let's give it a try together.

707
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,400
Let's try it together.

708
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,960
But can you jump?

709
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,800
But...

710
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,880
You know how.

711
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,520
I'll swing the rope.

712
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,480
You're too tall, how can I swing it for you?

713
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,960
It's really hard to jump rope with him.

714
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,520
True.

715
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,440
Wait a sec.

716
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,560
Okay.

717
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,040
Sure.

718
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,840
They’re pretty good at jumping.

719
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,840
Yu Xing saw it.

720
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,440
Hurry, pick.

721
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,560
Come on, try it.

722
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,120
Quick!

723
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:58,800
I'll do it.

724
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,120
This one.

725
00:26:59,120 --> 00:26:59,440
Let me.

726
00:26:59,440 --> 00:26:59,720
This.

727
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,560
That's really how it is.

728
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,600
Xiao Yuan is brave.

729
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,480
No hesitation.

730
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:05,880
Yeah.

731
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,480
Very decisive.

732
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,560
Is this enough?

733
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,320
Come on, that's fine.

734
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,160
You didn't make it.

735
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,160
It's my fault.

736
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,040
Duoduo is still waiting for Le Chen to pick her.

737
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,920
Should be fine. Three, two, one.

738
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,720
One, two, three, four.

739
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,600
Okay.

740
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,520
Alright.

741
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:23,840
Eight.

742
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,240
Alright, that's it.

743
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,520
That's good.

744
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:28,920
Do you want to try?

745
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:29,720
Assist!

746
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,120
Come on.

747
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,800
Stand farther away, don't hit them.

748
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,280
I said jump at the start.

749
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,120
Jump!

750
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,960
When she's with Dr. Fang,

751
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,680
She gets that kind of

752
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,120
happy, shy vibe.

753
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:51,760
Hold on.

754
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,760
Your knees might bump.

755
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,200
A bit farther.

756
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,840
One, two, three, jump!

757
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,080
Little Jiao.

758
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,120
I'll take the rope and practice.

759
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,360
What's up with Zhiheng?

760
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,200
He's just there by himself.

761
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,120
This Little Jiao...

762
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,640
They're such a good match.

763
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,840
We're so sporty here.

764
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,440
Impressive!

765
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,480
Turns out, no.

766
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,600
Those not interested just focus on sports.

767
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,840
He can jump rope really well.

768
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:43,720
So good!

769
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:49,760
Nice.

770
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,120
Awesome!

771
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,760
Try again.

772
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,480
Come on, give it a try.

773
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:56,960
Let's try it.

774
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,640
Duoduo is taking the initiative too.

775
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,800
Feels like I keep hitting you.

776
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,000
Stand here.

777
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,080
Right.

778
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:03,920
Three, two, one.

779
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,320
Go!

780
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,840
See?

781
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:09,480
Come on.

782
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,520
Three, two, one, go!

783
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,040
One, two, three.

784
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:14,920
It's my fault.

785
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,800
It's not your fault.

786
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,240
You two can do it.

787
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,160
No, I'm just worried about hitting my knees.

788
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:17,800
Not you two.

789
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,920
Get a little closer.

790
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,920
Just jump with straight knees.

791
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,200
Don't bend your knees.

792
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,120
Just get a bit closer.

793
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,200
Two, three.

794
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,000
Not too far, just a bit closer.

795
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,120
Four.

796
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,960
Five.

797
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,800
Six.

798
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,560
Seven.

799
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,360
Eight.

800
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:28,960
Nine.

801
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,120
Ten.

802
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,560
Our order of appearance

803
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,760
What do you think?

804
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,280
You decide

805
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,560
What?

806
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,400
That's it

807
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,520
But I haven't practiced with Yuxing yet

808
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,880
Here we go

809
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,480
Then you jump that one

810
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,560
Who do you want to jump with?

811
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,160
I'm fine with anyone

812
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,240
Le Chen

813
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:11,920
Who do you think you work best with?

814
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,200
Who do you think you team up best with?

815
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,520
That's tough

816
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,880
This is really hard

817
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,240
Both of them want to jump with Chenchen

818
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:22,680
Yeah

819
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,240
I think we need to ensure our win rate

820
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,280
We need to ensure our win rate

821
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,840
You mean with me?

822
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,200
You mean with me?

823
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,480
Okay

824
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:42,840
Let's do that

825
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:43,760
Okay

826
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,120
Let's do that

827
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:44,800
Okay

828
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,560
Let's do that

829
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:46,920
Let's do that

830
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,360
Let's do that

831
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,000
Okay

832
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,760
Duoduo is really generous

833
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,120
Yeah

834
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,880
I really like her personality

835
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,240
I like Duoduo too

836
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,240
Alright, first group from the 801st floor

837
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:05,720
Please get ready

838
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,040
Go for it!

839
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,560
Don't be nervous

840
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,960
I'm not nervous

841
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,040
Are you nervous?

842
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,160
If we win, we'll have cilantro beef tonight

843
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,520
Did you buy it?

844
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,440
I can buy it

845
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:29,680
Alright

846
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,720
Okay, first group from the 802nd floor

847
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,680
First group from the 802nd floor, please get ready

848
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,480
Let's go

849
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,800
The strongest go first

850
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,440
Both teams jump at the same time

851
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,160
Yes

852
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,880
Yuxing still wants to jump?

853
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,080
Starting to show off

854
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:12,920
They're showing off now

855
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,400
They're so competitive

856
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,680
I think so too, very competitive

857
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,200
I think our team will definitely

858
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,080
Definitely win

859
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,720
Is everyone ready?

860
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,440
Ready

861
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:23,880
Three

862
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,440
Two

863
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:27,560
One

864
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:30,880
Start

865
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,360
Amazing

866
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,440
Those two are really strong

867
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,040
Emotionless "jump rope machines"

868
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,480
Ruilong likes them even more now

869
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,080
Go for it!

870
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:50,960
Impressive

871
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,080
Nineteen, twenty

872
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,640
Both sides have totally different strategies

873
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,560
Here, the guys are swinging the rope

874
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,400
Over there, the girls are swinging the rope

875
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,880
They're having the girls swing the rope

876
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,120
They're really doing the opposite

877
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:02,880
Don't be nervous

878
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:07,760
It's fine

879
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:09,520
Mine

880
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:11,840
Don't rush, yeah

881
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,360
Don't rush

882
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,080
Stay steady

883
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,760
Watch your feet

884
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,080
Don't be nervous

885
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,120
Zi Han keeps comforting Chichi

886
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,200
It's okay

887
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,600
Go for it!

888
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,520
One, two, go

889
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,560
They're getting closer as they jump, look

890
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,440
Yeah

891
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,880
They finished jumping.

892
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,200
They're getting better and better.

893
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:55,840
Fifty-one.

894
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,560
Fifty-two.

895
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,520
Fifty-three.

896
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,120
Fifty-four.

897
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,000
Fifty-five.

898
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,760
Fifty-six.

899
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,280
Fifty-seven.

900
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,240
You guys are amazing!

901
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,160
My bad.

902
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,080
How many have we done?

903
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:04,760
Twenty-one.

904
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,400
One, two, three, go!

905
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,720
One.

906
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,200
Two.

907
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:08,800
Three.

908
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,440
Four.

909
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,040
My fault.

910
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,320
It's okay, let's try again.

911
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,640
I got distracted.

912
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,520
My mistake again.

913
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,040
When one side syncs, the other gets messy.

914
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,800
Yuxing is facing the two of them.

915
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,360
Watching makes you feel more pressure.

916
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,760
You'll definitely get distracted.

917
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,400
My fault again.

918
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,600
It's fine.

919
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,080
Let's go again.

920
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,400
No worries.

921
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,160
I'm flustered.

922
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:27,520
Go!

923
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:28,680
One.

924
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,640
Two.

925
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,200
Three.

926
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:30,640
Four.

927
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,040
Yuxing's mind isn't on the jump rope contest anymore.

928
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:34,480
Sorry.

929
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,080
No.

930
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:35,480
Try again.

931
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,160
Lost my rhythm.

932
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,360
My feet got tangled too.

933
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,200
Sorry.

934
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:40,960
It's okay, come on.

935
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,120
One minute twenty seconds.

936
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,520
Forty seconds left, keep going!

937
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,120
No rush, let's take it slow.

938
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:46,840
Look, Duoduo's fine.

939
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,800
Try again, it's okay.

940
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,080
Why?

941
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,200
Twenty-five seconds left.

942
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,400
Keep it up!

943
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,080
One hundred!

944
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:55,600
Eighty-five.

945
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,440
Eighty-six.

946
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,160
Eighty-seven.

947
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,040
Eighty-eight.

948
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,400
Eighty-nine.

949
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,200
He's not in the mood to jump anymore.

950
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:05,720
Last ten seconds.

951
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,480
Ten seconds.

952
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,600
Come on, hurry!

953
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,440
Eight.

954
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,600
Seven.

955
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,240
Six.

956
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,200
Five.

957
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,280
Four.

958
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,240
Three.

959
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,240
Two.

960
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:14,600
One.

961
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,440
Stop.

962
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,240
Done.

963
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,280
Ninety-nine.

964
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,000
That's such a lucky number.

965
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:20,880
Awesome.

966
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,400
So cool.

967
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,080
Impressive.

968
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,080
Amazing, you guys are really good.

969
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:27,920
So tired.

970
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,720
It's fine.

971
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,160
So tired.

972
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,720
Let's check.

973
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,400
How many did you count?

974
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,560
Ninety.

975
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,040
Over ninety.

976
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,080
Ninety-five.

977
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:35,720
Ninety-eight.

978
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,120
What's the actual number?

979
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,120
The actual count is seventy-nine.

980
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,680
But this shows one hundred and eight.

981
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:42,880
Go by the rope.

982
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:43,960
801 turns.

983
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:44,960
Yes.

984
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,240
One hundred and eight.

985
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,000
802 turns, seventy-nine.

986
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,360
Not bad, pretty good.

987
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,160
Impressive.

988
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,400
Thank you, everyone.

989
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,560
Yuxing feels a bit down.

990
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,000
It's okay, it's fine.

991
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,240
I'll catch up for you.

992
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,440
It's okay, it's fine.

993
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:08,680
I'll catch up for you.

994
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,080
Hopefully.

995
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,640
Hopefully.

996
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,280
Lechen comforted Duoduo.

997
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:15,840
Swing slower.

998
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,000
I'll swing slower.

999
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,040
Alright, second group, get ready.

1000
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,240
Okay.

1001
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,680
Ruilong is here.

1002
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,240
Just us two.

1003
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,480
Relax a bit.

1004
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,200
He's so stiff.

1005
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,480
He's so stiff.

1006
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,280
He's super nervous.

1007
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,600
Not nervous at all.

1008
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,960
Relax a bit.

1009
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,400
Okay.

1010
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,640
Ready to blow the whistle.

1011
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,360
Take your positions.

1012
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,640
Get set.

1013
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,320
Slow down.

1014
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,200
Go.

1015
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,280
This pace is right.

1016
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,000
One, two.

1017
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

1018
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,680
So fast.

1019
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,720
Impressive.

1020
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,240
How are they so quick?

1021
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,520
Amazing.

1022
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,400
Seventeen, eighteen.

1023
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,360
Nineteen, twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two.

1024
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,200
Forget it, I can't keep counting.

1025
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,480
So fast.

1026
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,360
These two are awesome.

1027
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,040
They're really strong, look at them.

1028
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:20,960
So strong.

1029
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,520
What do they do, anyway?

1030
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,280
How can they jump sideways so fast?

1031
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,080
Let's jump faster then.

1032
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,200
This group practiced so well earlier.

1033
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,880
You couldn't tell.

1034
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,560
Her stance is unique.

1035
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,080
But they're actually standing very close.

1036
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:39,440
Yeah.

1037
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,600
Closer to the heart.

1038
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,560
Right.

1039
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,360
Makes the heart beat faster.

1040
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,480
So strong.

1041
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,440
Look at them.

1042
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,880
Why do I feel like Jue is a bit...

1043
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,600
So happy, like she's floating.

1044
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,320
Ruilong is so happy.

1045
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,440
But it's really joyful.

1046
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,800
Yeah, winning together.

1047
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,680
So impressive.

1048
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,120
Shoelace.

1049
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,160
Shoelace came undone.

1050
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,240
Let me tie my shoelace.

1051
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:06,920
They even...

1052
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,000
have time to tie their shoelaces.

1053
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,600
They even have time to tie their shoelaces.

1054
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,280
So cocky.

1055
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,200
We don't really need to count.

1056
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,600
You run first for a bit.

1057
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,200
I'll catch up later.

1058
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:21,880
Yeah.

1059
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,120
Super relaxed.

1060
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,920
Jump rope prince.

1061
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,480
They look great together.

1062
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,880
What do we do? They're pros.

1063
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,480
So sweet.

1064
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,120
Such great chemistry.

1065
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:43,840
We can do it.

1066
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,480
Jump slowly.

1067
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:45,920
Just don't stop.

1068
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,920
You helped us catch up, amazing!

1069
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,280
Mine.

1070
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,640
It's fine, let's go slower.

1071
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,520
Slower.

1072
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,160
Slower.

1073
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,160
One.

1074
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:00,840
It's okay.

1075
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,560
Get a bit closer.

1076
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,840
Look, she's right beside him.

1077
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,080
She's still encouraging him nonstop.

1078
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:09,680
Sorry.

1079
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,160
Is it my fault?

1080
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,240
I stepped on it.

1081
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,840
So much pressure.

1082
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,680
Not really.

1083
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,120
It's fine.

1084
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,880
She's really...

1085
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,680
generous.

1086
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,080
Yeah.

1087
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,960
I think generous girls are really...

1088
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,080
open and genuine.

1089
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,560
Wang Lechen, don't step back.

1090
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,520
Twenty seconds left.

1091
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,640
It's okay, try again.

1092
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,360
Not bad.

1093
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,560
Fifteen seconds left.

1094
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,200
Ten seconds.

1095
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,360
Nine seconds.

1096
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,280
Eight.

1097
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,240
Seven.

1098
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,240
Six.

1099
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,200
Five.

1100
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,160
Four.

1101
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,080
Three.

1102
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,040
Two.

1103
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:51,960
One.

1104
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,800
Time's up.

1105
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,040
They must have hit two hundred over there.

1106
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,480
I'm exhausted.

1107
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,720
So impressive.

1108
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,320
Nice.

1109
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,680
Really impressive.

1110
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,880
Both of them get distracted easily.

1111
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,240
Especially Duoduo.

1112
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,840
He even told you two to get closer.

1113
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,640
I'm more curious to know

1114
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,400
how many jumps Ruilong's team did.

1115
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,280
I want to know about Ruilong too.

1116
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,000
How many did they jump?

1117
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,320
Feels like almost double.

1118
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,000
Probably.

1119
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,440
One hundred and eight.

1120
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,000
They did one hundred and eight jumps.

1121
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,840
801st floor, Ruilong.

1122
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,240
How many? Eight hundred and one?

1123
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,520
801st floor.

1124
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,480
No, that's not it.

1125
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,760
801st floor, Ruilong.

1126
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,800
Wang Jue.

1127
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,040
Eight hundred and one is way too much.

1128
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,600
The result is one hundred ninety-seven.

1129
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,680
Almost double.

1130
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,280
Really almost two hundred.

1131
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,840
Sharp eye for talent.

1132
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,920
And he even tied his shoelace.

1133
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,240
One hundred ninety-seven.

1134
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,760
That's amazing.

1135
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,240
So impressive.

1136
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,160
Definitely impressive.

1137
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,040
Really impressive, never stopped.

1138
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:44,720
Definitely impressive.

1139
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,960
Ruilong is awesome.

1140
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,920
You're awesome too.

1141
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,520
I'm awesome.

1142
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,720
You're awesome too.

1143
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,080
Found the rhythm.

1144
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,800
The rhythm of two people.

1145
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,800
Got it.

1146
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,840
Really.

1147
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,960
That's what I meant.

1148
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,520
Alright, let's go.

1149
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,880
Third group.

1150
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,840
Okay, third group.

1151
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,680
802nd floor, you're up.

1152
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,360
So nervous.

1153
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,520
Okay, 801st floor.

1154
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,320
Teacher Jiao.

1155
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,960
Please step forward.

1156
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:14,960
Because just now Teacher Jiao

1157
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,440
chose Yifan.

1158
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,720
But Yifan isn't here today.

1159
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,760
So Teacher Jiao, you can invite

1160
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,320
any girl present here.

1161
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,880
to join you for this round.

1162
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,320
So, who do you want to invite?

1163
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,640
But that person is on stage.

1164
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,280
Right.

1165
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,800
What should I do?

1166
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,600
The person I want to invite is

1167
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,120
Lanlan.

1168
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,560
The person I want to invite is

1169
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,040
Lanlan.

1170
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,960
So direct.

1171
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:47,840
See?

1172
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,320
He said it.

1173
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:48,840
He said it out loud.

1174
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,640
Showing his cards.

1175
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,440
I've got goosebumps.

1176
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,320
That's bold.

1177
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,400
The person I want to invite is

1178
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,040
Lanlan.

1179
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,440
Awesome, I think you should just say it.

1180
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,400
You have to split in two.

1181
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,280
Getting anxious again.

1182
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,440
Uh-oh.

1183
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,200
That's not good.

1184
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,400
That's not good.

1185
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,840
Are three people jumping together?

1186
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,640
Can you three jump together?

1187
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,200
Can't fit.

1188
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,480
Shall we stick to this plan?

1189
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,120
Because their team did choose first.

1190
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:39,800
So,

1191
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,000
let them jump first.

1192
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:41,920
Then you guys jump.

1193
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,680
Sure, of course.

1194
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,560
Alright.

1195
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,960
Come on, Dr. Fang.

1196
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,240
Alright, Little Jiao.

1197
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,240
Three, two, one, go!

1198
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,960
Nice, great jumping.

1199
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,520
They're fast too.

1200
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,960
Keep it up!

1201
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,080
They're getting closer.

1202
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:20,520
Little Jiao.

1203
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:23,800
Go a bit slower.

1204
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,360
Okay.

1205
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,640
Dr. Fang's gaze is so determined.

1206
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,240
Dr. Fang's eyes are electrifying.

1207
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:44,880
Go for it!

1208
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,080
I think Little Jiao feels sad right now.

1209
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,320
So sad.

1210
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,040
He notices everything.

1211
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:54,760
All the little details.

1212
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,120
Ten seconds left.

1213
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,520
Keep going!

1214
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,680
Five.

1215
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,600
Four.

1216
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,520
Three.

1217
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,520
Two.

1218
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,040
One.

1219
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,040
Good job.

1220
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,920
One hundred twenty.

1221
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:14,760
One hundred twenty, impressive!

1222
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,680
One hundred twenty, that's right.

1223
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,520
Very accurate this time.

1224
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,760
Now let's see how they do.

1225
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:19,800
Thirsty?

1226
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:21,720
Want some water?

1227
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,840
No, I'm good.

1228
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,200
What were their first two scores?

1229
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:28,720
One hundred twenty.

1230
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,840
First two, and this time is one hundred twenty.

1231
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,200
One was seventy-something.

1232
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,080
It's about the total score.

1233
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,480
One hundred ninety.

1234
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,160
What were their first two scores?

1235
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,800
One hundred eight and seventy-nine.

1236
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,080
That's one hundred eighty-seven.

1237
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,000
Add this time's one hundred twenty, right?

1238
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,120
That makes three hundred.

1239
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,160
Three hundred seven.

1240
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,160
So precise.

1241
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,000
Still going.

1242
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,120
Calculating how much we need.

1243
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,000
Need to control the score.

1244
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,560
What's our total time again?

1245
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,360
Two minutes.

1246
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,600
We can

1247
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,520
rest for the first minute and thirty seconds,

1248
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,800
then jump twice.

1249
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,240
I really didn't expect that.

1250
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,400
Little Jiao.

1251
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,040
I picked the right person.

1252
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,960
Me too.

1253
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,760
I feel better now.

1254
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,800
Really.

1255
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,280
He calculated the total.

1256
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,480
The current score is

1257
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,400
Three hundred five

1258
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,680
versus three hundred seven.

1259
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,080
Right.

1260
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,160
He just needs to jump two more.

1261
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,600
So just jump in the last thirty seconds.

1262
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:21,720
I almost want to

1263
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:22,520
give him my money

1264
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,240
and let him manage it.

1265
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:26,200
We can

1266
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,960
rest for the first minute and thirty seconds,

1267
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,200
then jump twice.

1268
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,440
He impressed me again.

1269
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,480
Seriously cool.

1270
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,240
Yeah, for real.

1271
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,760
So romantic, Jiao!

1272
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,640
This is truly romantic.

1273
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,600
Yeah, just like a drama.

1274
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,200
Dr. Fang will be sad.

1275
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,200
You should learn from him.

1276
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,200
This friend would say,

1277
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:54,200
Thank you, everyone.

1278
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,400
I'll serve tea and water tonight.

1279
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,200
Alright, you're the man.

1280
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,760
Let's get ready.

1281
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,160
Go!

1282
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:07,280
Go!

1283
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,320
Break time.

1284
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,600
Just say when you want to jump.

1285
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
If you don't want to jump,

1286
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:21,880
we won't jump.

1287
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,320
Let's jump in the last thirty seconds.

1288
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:24,720
Okay.

1289
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,840
Zeng, remind us at the last thirty seconds.

1290
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,760
Zeng, give a thirty-second warning.

1291
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:30,680
Cool.

1292
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,960
What should we do?

1293
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,000
Look at this game.

1294
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,240
They really know how to play.

1295
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,280
Impressive.

1296
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,320
Is jumping rope important?

1297
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:38,920
Not really.

1298
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:46,200
Seriously.

1299
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,520
This is honestly...

1300
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,480
I got goosebumps.

1301
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,600
This vibe is really...

1302
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,440
well set.

1303
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,520
Everyone's shipping them!

1304
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,160
Yeah.

1305
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,440
It keeps beeping.

1306
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,440
I thought it was my watch.

1307
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,800
No, it's your heart.

1308
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:07,880
Duoduo would say,

1309
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:11,680
Alright.

1310
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,520
Your heart radar's about to explode, bro.

1311
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:18,920
Radar's about to blow, bro.

1312
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,400
Darn it, Dr. Fang.

1313
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,240
Disappointed.

1314
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,640
Hey, you guys should move a bit.

1315
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,280
There are mosquitoes.

1316
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:30,960
Okay.

1317
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,320
Move around, have some water.

1318
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:33,400
You can drink more water.

1319
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,840
There's still time to drink.

1320
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,320
Thanks.

1321
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:41,960
Alright, thirty seconds left.

1322
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,560
Let's start.

1323
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,000
Us.

1324
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,440
Main thing is if her hand will

1325
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,720
rest on Little Jiao's shoulder.

1326
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:50,480
Just chill.

1327
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:50,760
Okay.

1328
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,160
Come on.

1329
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,520
It's fine, she put both hands on your shoulders.

1330
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,920
This friend is really funny.

1331
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,440
Dr. Fang.

1332
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:10,440
Three.

1333
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:13,880
Two.

1334
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:16,920
One.

1335
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,120
Never saw that coming.

1336
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,640
Just two jumps to win.

1337
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,360
They're so in sync.

1338
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,240
They're a perfect match.

1339
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,880
Every jump they make feels like

1340
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,400
Jiao's

1341
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,600
love theme song.

1342
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,600
Love theme song.

1343
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,320
Well said.

1344
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,800
Five, four, three, two, one.

1345
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:14,680
Take another sip.

1346
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,560
Thank you.

1347
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,000
They're just amazing.

1348
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:20,880
They're so sweet.

1349
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:21,960
So sweet.

1350
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,440
Really sweet.

1351
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,400
This is just too sweet.

1352
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:32,920
That's enough.

1353
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,480
Thanks.

1354
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,800
This is even better than the wishing tree moment.

1355
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,720
I'm speechless.

1356
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,120
He pulled out all the big moves.

1357
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:51,000
I'm blown away, he's really bold.

1358
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,200
Did you notice?

1359
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,800
When someone stops overthinking,

1360
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,040
Yeah.

1361
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:55,640
They change.

1362
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:57,600
Right.

1363
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,720
That's so true.

1364
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,440
He was overthinking so much before, you couldn't tell.

1365
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:03,680
Now he's like this.

1366
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,160
He's grown.

1367
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,440
Yeah, now it's

1368
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:07,600
natural.

1369
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,520
Super natural.

1370
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:09,640
If it were me,

1371
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,080
I'd say pick someone else.

1372
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,840
But I didn't expect him to use

1373
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,320
this way to compete.

1374
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,200
So cool, so romantic.

1375
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,920
Take notes.

1376
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,280
How many times?

1377
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,680
I totally lost count.

1378
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,640
He's watching.

1379
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,240
Okay, their results.

1380
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,520
Are really impressive too.

1381
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:32,560
Seventeen.

1382
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,280
That's enough.

1383
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,840
Seventeen is actually pretty good.

1384
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,000
Nice, seventeen.

1385
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:39,360
Tired, right?

1386
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,120
Have some braised pork tonight.

1387
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:42,640
Sure.

1388
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,760
Alright, now for the three rounds'

1389
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,840
competition results, they're all out.

1390
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:49,960
Let me report everyone's scores.

1391
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,920
Floor 802's total is 307.

1392
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,480
The highest score is

1393
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,840
Dr. Fang's 120.

1394
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,280
Alright, so we

1395
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,160
Floor 801's total is 322.

1396
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,360
The highest score is

1397
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,000
Ruilong's 197.

1398
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,560
That's amazing.

1399
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,360
Ruilong said, I jumped so many times

1400
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:13,440
and you still stole the spotlight.

1401
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,560
But he's really close with Little Jiao.

1402
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:15,160
They're great friends.

1403
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:15,800
So I think he must be

1404
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,560
happy for his bro too.

1405
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:18,760
The highest score is

1406
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,400
Ruilong's 197.

1407
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,240
So impressive.

1408
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,360
And Wang Jue.

1409
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,720
As the top individual scorers.

1410
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,120
You both get

1411
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,600
a Heart Signal necklace as a prize.

1412
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,200
Did we have this before?

1413
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,680
Why didn't we get one?

1414
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:42,480
Why didn't we get one?

1415
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,320
Thank you, Teacher Zeng.

1416
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:58,680
This is a necklace.

1417
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:59,000
Yeah.

1418
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,160
Necklace, yes, all necklaces.

1419
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,520
Put it on him.

1420
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,320
She puts it on him.

1421
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,200
Ruilong.

1422
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:14,040
So sweet.

1423
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,760
My hands are so clumsy.

1424
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,160
Done.

1425
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,400
Thank you.

1426
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,240
They make a great pair.

1427
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:38,600
I've always thought a guy putting a necklace on a girl

1428
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,800
is super romantic.

1429
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,000
Thanks.

1430
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,640
No problem.

1431
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,200
Congrats to our winners, Floor 801.

1432
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,360
And congrats

1433
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,880
Ruilong and Wang Jue.

1434
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,120
Actually, those two are pretty good together.

1435
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:02,640
That works too.

1436
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,000
If they really make it,

1437
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:04,680
it would be great.

1438
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:05,080
Those two.

1439
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,040
You know Wang Jue,

1440
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:06,560
deep down,

1441
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,280
she's like a child.

1442
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,280
But she needs a shell

1443
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:09,680
to protect that part of herself.

1444
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:10,280
But actually,

1445
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,840
she can take off that shell

1446
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:12,640
when she's with Ruilong.

1447
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,080
She can let her guard down.

1448
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,040
Their interaction today was great.

1449
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,920
They were really in sync.

1450
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:18,720
And also,

1451
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:19,680
during the activity,

1452
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:20,960
they had their own

1453
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,480
little heart-fluttering reward.

1454
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:24,840
Yeah.

1455
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,360
This is actually

1456
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:27,400
a turning point,

1457
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,760
or maybe a new beginning.

1458
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,240
And then, our

1459
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,320
Zi Han and Chi Chi,

1460
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:33,320
at first, they also

1461
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,480
made a lot of mistakes.

1462
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:35,960
But Zi Han

1463
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,320
kept comforting Chi Chi.

1464
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,240
And the two of them gradually

1465
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,320
through this process,

1466
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:40,600
got more comfortable.

1467
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:41,320
It kept getting better.

1468
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,720
They slowly hit their stride.

1469
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,160
I think Yu Xing has it tough too.

1470
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:46,360
He really cares about Chi Chi.

1471
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:46,840
Yeah.

1472
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:49,040
Honestly, it's pretty obvious.

1473
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,240
I think Duoduo is really generous.

1474
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,560
It left a deep impression on me.

1475
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:53,680
She took the initiative to

1476
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,320
dance with someone else.

1477
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,080
But when Chen Chen

1478
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:56,640
was dancing,

1479
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,800
she still remembered

1480
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:58,480
to encourage him.

1481
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:59,240
I just think

1482
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,120
besides that,

1483
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:01,240
like you just said,

1484
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,520
Duoduo is generous,

1485
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,600
I clearly saw

1486
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:05,960
between Le Chen and Duoduo

1487
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,320
there were mutual signals.

1488
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,480
There's a detail I remember clearly.

1489
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,920
When Duoduo and her team

1490
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:11,840
fell behind,

1491
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:12,840
the next group right after

1492
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:14,960
was Le Chen and

1493
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:16,720
Lu Yuan's turn to jump.

1494
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,880
Then Le Chen

1495
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,360
walked over to Duoduo

1496
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,920
and told her, "It's okay."

1497
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,080
"I'll help you catch up."

1498
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:24,960
"It's fine, we can do it."

1499
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:25,760
"I'll catch up for you."

1500
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:27,440
"I'll catch up for you."

1501
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,080
That's how it feels to me.

1502
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,600
He wants to do the next round with Lu Yuan.

1503
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:34,960
He probably said that to Lu Yuan.

1504
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:35,960
We need to keep going.

1505
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,760
And while they were jumping,

1506
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:39,840
Duoduo was really concerned about him.

1507
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:41,960
He helped us catch up, so impressive.

1508
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:43,680
And then there was

1509
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,160
that moment with frequent mistakes.

1510
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:45,840
Duoduo encouraged him.

1511
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:46,880
It's okay, don't worry.

1512
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:47,520
Go slower.

1513
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:48,520
One.

1514
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:51,200
It's fine.

1515
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:52,920
Get a little closer.

1516
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,120
So they're a

1517
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:56,080
two-way signal.

1518
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,400
I think it's

1519
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,320
really obvious.

1520
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:01,560
Just now, we were

1521
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,800
talking about this process.

1522
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,760
Often, guys know they need to

1523
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,120
express themselves.

1524
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,040
How to

1525
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,760
just bravely say things.

1526
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:10,560
But because of Le Chen's personality,

1527
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:11,640
we can see that

1528
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,680
he actually wants to express himself.

1529
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,520
But he doesn't know how to say it.

1530
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,440
I hope he can

1531
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,760
grow a bit more in this area.

1532
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:20,080
Yeah.

1533
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,240
And then,

1534
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,360
the strongest group

1535
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,680
is definitely

1536
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,080
Dr. Fang and Little Jiao

1537
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,600
plus Lanlan's part.

1538
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,600
They really shined.

1539
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,240
I think it's the highlight so far.

1540
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,800
This moment is truly amazing.

1541
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:34,720
It's really unexpected.

1542
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,400
He's so thoughtful and attentive.

1543
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,600
He's smart.

1544
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,640
And sincere.

1545
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:40,560
And considerate.

1546
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,120
He has it all.

1547
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:43,320
He's just perfect.

1548
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,520
He did everything well.

1549
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,320
I believe Little Jiao is slowly

1550
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,960
finding a small place in her heart.

1551
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:50,800
A little spot.

1552
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,160
Little Jiao is the type

1553
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,320
who proves himself over time.

1554
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,320
I take it step by step.

1555
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,600
Don't give me a chance,

1556
00:55:58,600 --> 00:55:59,280
but if you do,

1557
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,640
I'll use my sincerity

1558
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,040
to win everyone over.

1559
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,240
It shows he's really strong now.

1560
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,840
He's leveled up on his own.

1561
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:06,600
Yeah, that's great.

1562
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,000
I'm curious what Dr. Fang will do next.

1563
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,800
Because these big moves in a row

1564
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,160
would leave anyone stunned.

1565
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,040
This round of the game

1566
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,960
we will reshuffle the teams.

1567
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:24,720
Teams will be reshuffled.

1568
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,120
So exciting!

1569
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,600
I think this will be pretty awesome.

1570
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,440
We'll split into three teams.

1571
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,600
Three teams.

1572
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,640
We'll invite the girls again.

1573
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,760
to join your own team.

1574
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,960
You get a chance to pick someone you like.

1575
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,920
The captains of these three teams

1576
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,000
will be the three guys

1577
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,560
who won on the 801st floor.

1578
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,080
Winning does give you an advantage.

1579
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:48,760
Finally, a chance to take the initiative.

1580
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:50,680
Each captain will invite

1581
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:51,840
one girl to join their team.

1582
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,320
You get to pick someone you like.

1583
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,880
Then the girl invites a guy to join.

1584
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,360
Finally, the captain invites

1585
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,640
the remaining girl to complete the team.

1586
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,000
Captains, please step forward.

1587
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,280
Teammates become rivals.

1588
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,480
Okay, so each team

1589
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,680
will have two guys and two girls.

1590
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:09,400
And

1591
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,600
because Yifan is working today,

1592
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,160
she couldn't be here.

1593
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,040
So one team will have only three members.

1594
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,680
So in this round,

1595
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:19,000
speed in picking teammates is crucial.

1596
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:20,720
So the guys need to

1597
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:21,720
be proactive.

1598
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:22,920
Alright, three

1599
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:26,480
two

1600
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:29,600
one

1601
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,440
I pick Lanlan.

1602
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
As soon as he finished speaking,

1603
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:34,680
Okay.

1604
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:35,160
Lanlan.

1605
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:39,960
Looking back and forth.

1606
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,280
That look is so mysterious.

1607
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:44,080
So happy!

1608
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:45,280
Chichi.

1609
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:46,760
Chichi.

1610
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:54,800
Alright, Ruilong.

1611
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,720
Now the tough choice is for Ruilong.

1612
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,160
He should pick Duoduo.

1613
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:01,760
Pick Wang Jue.

1614
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,240
Pick Wang Jue.

1615
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,080
Cool!

1616
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,640
This is what I wanted to see.

1617
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:09,880
Pick Wang Jue.

1618
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,120
Pick Wang Jue.

1619
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:12,480
Okay.

1620
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,760
Alright, veteran teammate.

1621
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:19,840
I want to ask first,

1622
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,400
why did you all

1623
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,920
choose them?

1624
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,800
I've always picked her.

1625
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,000
Yeah, we've noticed that too.

1626
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Even though we just got here,

1627
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:35,520
This is what you call an assist.

1628
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,640
Isn't this fate?

1629
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,040
That look is a bit different.

1630
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:46,920
So why did Ruilong pick Wang Jue?

1631
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,640
We work well together.

1632
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,160
We're going to win again.

1633
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:56,040
Because last round,

1634
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:56,440
it's true.

1635
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,240
You had great teamwork.

1636
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,160
Yeah, first place.

1637
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:59,280
Impressive!

1638
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,600
I think I'm the

1639
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:05,760
combined answer for those two.

1640
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:07,480
We have chemistry

1641
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,080
and always been

1642
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:10,280
very determined.

1643
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,280
Right.

1644
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,160
That's amazing.

1645
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,240
The two of them together

1646
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:21,200
both have it.

1647
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:22,240
So cool.

1648
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:23,920
Very strong.

1649
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,520
They really speak so well.

1650
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,040
Seriously.

1651
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,320
We should learn from how they talk.

1652
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:29,480
Respect.

1653
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,320
So for the second round,

1654
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,280
the girls

1655
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,080
will pick the guys.

1656
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,520
Next, it's time to pick the guys.

1657
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:39,920
So dramatic!

1658
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:49,440
Pick Yuxing.

1659
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:53,280
Chichi is awesome!

1660
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,440
So bold!

1661
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:57,160
Who do you want to pick?

1662
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,240
See, they're already looking at the sky.

1663
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,080
I choose Le Chen.

1664
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,440
Because we have two girls left.

1665
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:21,920
And then,

1666
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,840
You can each invite one of the girls.

1667
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:24,960
Make an invitation.

1668
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,080
But you have to be quick.

1669
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:28,000
Three, two, one.

1670
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:28,880
Go!

1671
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:29,960
Duo Duo.

1672
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:30,520
Come on.

1673
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,600
He chose Duo Duo.

1674
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,080
Lu Yuan.

1675
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:37,080
Okay.

1676
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:38,200
So,

1677
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,280
Everyone chose so decisively.

1678
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:46,680
This sports event is so entertaining.

1679
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:48,560
My brain hurts.

1680
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,920
So for this round,

1681
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:52,280
the new event is called

1682
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,000
Fun Badminton.

1683
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,360
Badminton.

1684
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:57,400
It's not quite like

1685
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,520
a regular badminton match.

1686
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,080
It's divided into three zones.

1687
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:00,920
Each team

1688
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:02,640
takes a zone and competes together.

1689
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:05,960
The first team to score eight points

1690
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:06,840
wins.

1691
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:08,080
The winning team

1692
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,320
will get a mystery prize.

1693
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:11,400
What could it be?

1694
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,360
Every team member

1695
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,040
must play in this round.

1696
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:15,280
No one can sit out.

1697
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:16,000
Right, no one sits out.

1698
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,040
Everyone has to play.

1699
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,200
Even hitting one ball counts.

1700
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:20,520
Who do you want to play with?

1701
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:22,560
I'm fine with anyone.

1702
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:23,800
You guys decide.

1703
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:28,720
Just let me play.

1704
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,320
I'll go play, right?

1705
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,760
Which side should I hit to?

1706
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,040
You can hit to any side.

1707
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:36,760
Any side is fine.

1708
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:37,600
Just hit wherever.

1709
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:39,840
You have to return the ball too, right?

1710
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:41,520
Or do you just need to stand on the court?

1711
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,280
Or just stand on the court?

1712
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:46,680
There are two options.

1713
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:49,080
Just spoil them.

1714
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,480
If they're different, you don't have to play.

1715
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:52,760
One says just hit anywhere.

1716
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:54,600
If friendship comes first, competition second,

1717
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:55,520
then everyone returns the ball.

1718
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:56,480
If competition comes first,

1719
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,160
then you return it alone.

1720
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,840
This friend is very strategic.

1721
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:05,920
What's your team's plan?

1722
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,080
Who goes first?

1723
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,120
Dr. Fang is stronger.

1724
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:09,440
Send the strongest first.

1725
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,080
Bro, you haven't shown yourself enough.

1726
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:14,120
Don't hold back next time.

1727
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:15,000
Okay, no problem.

1728
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,880
His friend is like a strategist.

1729
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:19,440
Yeah.

1730
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:20,520
Let's first

1731
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:21,720
score four points.

1732
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:23,480
You're already controlling the score, huh?

1733
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:25,360
Or you can score six points first.

1734
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:26,040
If you win by a lot,

1735
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:26,480
just do it like this.

1736
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:27,600
When you think you're playing well,

1737
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,000
if you can reach seven points,

1738
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,200
then you get seven points.

1739
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:31,960
You picked a great friend.

1740
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,480
Coach.

1741
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:34,400
He's been coaching from the sidelines.

1742
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:35,320
The brain.

1743
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:36,120
I'm a PE teacher.

1744
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,000
No wonder.

1745
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,800
So you get a PE teacher for sports day.

1746
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,440
And a music teacher for concerts.

1747
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,000
No, I came because we're close.

1748
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,280
Not because I'm a PE teacher.

1749
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:45,280
Alright.

1750
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:48,320
Okay, everyone.

1751
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:49,720
Let's get ready for the match.

1752
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,280
Next, Wang Jue serves.

1753
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,320
Dr. Fang smashes.

1754
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:01,760
Dr. Fang smashes.

1755
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:05,720
Awesome.

1756
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,480
Dr. Fang is going all out.

1757
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,560
Just showing off with every move, right?

1758
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:11,360
Yeah.

1759
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:14,920
Nice!

1760
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:18,880
Sorry.

1761
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:21,800
Looks like I don't even need to move.

1762
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:32,920
Dr. Fang is pretty impressive.

1763
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:34,480
Cool.

1764
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,440
Scores with every shot.

1765
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:54,440
He's really good at this.

1766
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,320
You do need someone at the back.

1767
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:00,120
Front and back positions.

1768
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,720
It's easier to receive at the back.

1769
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:03,360
Maybe my arms are a bit longer.

1770
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:04,400
Makes it a bit easier to catch.

1771
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,040
Such long arms.

1772
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:07,320
How long are your arms, teacher?

1773
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:08,520
This long.

1774
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:10,280
If you can't—

1775
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:11,720
Just say if you can't reach it.

1776
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:12,040
No.

1777
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:12,920
If you want to take my shot,

1778
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:13,680
Just say you’ll take it.

1779
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:14,200
I’ll let you.

1780
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:14,720
Not bad.

1781
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:15,160
Okay.

1782
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,680
Switch.

1783
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:20,560
Alright.

1784
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:22,120
Wang Jue and Ruilong are switching.

1785
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:23,400
You play to four points.

1786
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,400
We play to four points.

1787
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,920
You want to switch?

1788
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:26,960
Go for it!

1789
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,240
Right now, Zi Han’s team

1790
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,240
has already adjusted their lineup.

1791
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:30,720
Are you better at close shots

1792
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:31,560
or long shots?

1793
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,080
Actually, I’m better at long shots.

1794
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:34,680
Long shots.

1795
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:35,440
I’ll handle the close ones.

1796
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,040
I’ll take care of the close ones.

1797
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:42,520
We can start now.

1798
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:44,120
Dr. Fang.

1799
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:46,120
Your turn.

1800
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:47,160
Smash.

1801
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:48,200
Nice!

1802
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:50,960
A perfect smash.

1803
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:52,680
Smashed a shot.

1804
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:53,440
Great shot.

1805
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:56,160
Serve a high lob.

1806
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:58,280
Ai Lin starts the attack.

1807
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:00,200
That’s a high shot.

1808
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:01,760
Le Chen’s team scores a point.

1809
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:02,800
Nice shot.

1810
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:03,880
Cool.

1811
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:04,840
Good shot.

1812
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:09,960
Dr. Fang starts the attack.

1813
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,480
Hit Zi Han right in the heart.

1814
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,160
Switch.

1815
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:27,880
Okay.

1816
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:33,840
It’s over.

1817
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:36,040
A team already has seven points.

1818
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:38,560
Impressive.

1819
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,560
Try to aim for his side.

1820
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:46,200
Alright.

1821
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:48,640
Here it comes.

1822
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:55,240
It’s fine, go ahead.

1823
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:03,200
This round is over.

1824
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,920
Let’s congratulate the winners.

1825
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:08,560
Jiao Zhiheng, Ru Lan, and Dr. Fang.

1826
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:09,440
Awesome.

1827
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:10,240
Come on.

1828
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:12,680
All three together.

1829
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:15,920
It’s okay.

1830
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:18,320
No worries.

1831
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:19,000
It’s fine.

1832
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:19,760
So strong.

1833
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:21,160
Really strong.

1834
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,040
Can we play another round?

1835
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:23,880
Didn’t get enough.

1836
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:25,880
Alright, let’s congratulate

1837
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:28,040
the champion team of the fun badminton match.

1838
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:29,320
Cool.

1839
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:30,800
It’s all thanks to Dr. Fang, seriously.

1840
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:32,920
No, you two did great too.

1841
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,920
Your team will get a chance

1842
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:39,680
to enjoy a romantic dinner.

1843
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:41,480
This dinner

1844
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:44,320
is only for the four of you.

1845
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:49,640
Dinner is fine.

1846
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:51,360
Not sure if it’ll be romantic.

1847
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,320
This romantic dinner

1848
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,840
I really want to see it.

1849
01:06:58,120 --> 01:06:59,800
I think it’s totally worth it.

1850
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:00,360
Me too.

1851
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:01,000
Yeah.

1852
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:01,800
After a whole day of sports,

1853
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:02,760
it’s a nice reward.

1854
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,320
And there’s one more

1855
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:06,000
even bigger prize.

1856
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:11,280
Your team will get

1857
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,480
a room swap card.

1858
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,840
You can pick one member

1859
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:18,720
to have the chance

1860
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:20,160
to swap to another room.

1861
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,240
and live there.

1862
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:28,720
Looks like Jiao Zhiheng will move to the second floor.

1863
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,760
The right to use this room swap card

1864
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:34,280
will be decided by your group.

1865
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:38,480
Another chance has come.

1866
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:41,080
Will Dr. Fang and Little Jiao share a room?

1867
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:44,000
Studying each other every day.

1868
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Open your eyes and see each other.

1869
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Every time I open my eyes, it's you.

1870
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:48,400
Let's congratulate you first.

1871
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,680
for getting the room swap card.

1872
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:51,600
Thank you.

1873
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,080
Look how happy he is.

1874
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:58,680
Alright, today Master Kong

1875
01:07:58,680 --> 01:07:59,640
has brought for everyone

1876
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:01,000
a jasmine honey tea tower.

1877
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,440
To celebrate 2025

1878
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:03,280
Heart Signal Apartment

1879
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,120
Open Day's successful conclusion.

1880
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:10,600
The vibe is really great.

1881
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:16,640
Anyway, today we're just

1882
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,080
happy to be here as announcers

1883
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:19,800
and meet everyone.

1884
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,560
Including the bro squad.

1885
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:22,760
Awesome.

1886
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:24,360
Thanks to the bro squad for their help.

1887
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:24,880
We believe

1888
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,560
we'll hear good news from you all.

1889
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:27,920
Go for it!

1890
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:32,720
This sports event was a big success too.

1891
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:36,360
Alright.

1892
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:37,400
So here,

1893
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:38,880
let's thank Zeng Zeng

1894
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,400
and thank Good Luck.

1895
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:41,720
for bringing us

1896
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:43,480
such a wonderful sports event.

1897
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,040
Honestly, I'm looking forward to

1898
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:48,280
Little Jiao and Dr. Fang sharing a room.

1899
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:49,440
Isn't that exciting?

1900
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:49,680
Yeah.

1901
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:52,400
I'm even more excited for them to eat together.

1902
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:54,760
That romantic dinner.

1903
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:57,160
A romantic three-plus-one dinner.

1904
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:05,200
I haven't had this much fun in ages.

1905
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,000
Getting some exercise

1906
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,840
really boosts my dopamine.

1907
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:10,160
Yeah, that's our high-energy girl!

1908
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:11,240
Even though I slept so late last night,

1909
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:12,600
my eyes are still bright today.

1910
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,920
Of course, because I've been using this lately.

1911
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:16,640
Marubi Peptide Red Pen Eye Cream.

1912
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:18,320
What I love most is

1913
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:19,960
pressing the massage tip.

1914
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:20,960
It gives a microcurrent.

1915
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,360
It vibrates for a massage.

1916
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,120
It really vibrates.

1917
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:25,200
It feels cool and refreshing.

1918
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,880
Yeah, and it contains 25%

1919
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:29,040
high-concentration peptides.

1920
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,600
After using it, your eye area

1921
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:31,400
looks much brighter.

1922
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,880
I need to recharge too.

1923
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,360
I fall asleep as soon as I hit the pillow.

1924
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:40,960
You're back!

1925
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,440
You finally came back.

1926
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:44,160
Yifan is back.

1927
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:45,080
We were just talking about you.

1928
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:46,480
Talking about me?

1929
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:47,880
Have some more to eat.

1930
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:49,360
I've already eaten.

1931
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:50,160
What did you eat?

1932
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:51,320
I had Sichuan food.

1933
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:54,920
We burned so many calories today,

1934
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:56,080
like we cooked ten meals.

1935
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:58,480
So what did you do today?

1936
01:09:58,480 --> 01:09:59,400
Sports day.

1937
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:00,880
Sports day.

1938
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:02,200
We carried your

1939
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,160
cardboard cutout and ran with it.

1940
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,040
Seriously?

1941
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:06,800
And you know,

1942
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:07,680
your cutout is almost

1943
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:08,680
as tall as Lechen.

1944
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:10,280
I was like,

1945
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:10,760
it's so tall now!

1946
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:14,800
But

1947
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:17,000
we got Yifan

1948
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,160
Yifan

1949
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:19,560
We won you

1950
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:23,360
a chance for a big dinner.

1951
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:24,560
Because we won.

1952
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:26,560
What do you mean?

1953
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,360
Me, you, him,

1954
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:29,880
and Little Jiao, the four of us were a team.

1955
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:32,960
Our team only had three people.

1956
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:34,400
We won.

1957
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:35,880
So we'll get a big dinner.

1958
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,640
You also get a chance to switch rooms.

1959
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:39,600
Or change floors.

1960
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:40,000
Yeah.

1961
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,640
A chance to change floors.

1962
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:45,800
Do you want to switch?

1963
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,560
I can't decide.

1964
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:48,160
You can't decide?

1965
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:49,160
I'm just going along with it.

1966
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,440
You want to move down, right?

1967
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:52,920
You want to move down.

1968
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:54,200
Then go ahead.

1969
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:55,440
What's up, are we already

1970
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:56,200
doing this one by one now?

1971
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,520
Isn't it easy to figure out?

1972
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:04,720
So much information.

1973
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:05,880
It's overwhelming.

1974
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:09,960
Jiao, are you going to the second floor?

1975
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:11,440
No.

1976
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:13,400
Little Jiao will definitely switch.

1977
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:16,560
I don't mind.

1978
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:17,960
Go wherever you want.

1979
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:22,200
Why does that sound a bit bitter?

1980
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,360
It's bittersweet.

1981
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,760
Yeah, bittersweet.

1982
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:30,040
I'm so happy.

1983
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,000
Of course.

1984
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,360
How could we not be happy today?

1985
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:35,640
Okay.

1986
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,520
How could we not be happy today?

1987
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:43,400
Shall we go?

1988
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:45,560
Good night, Weini.

1989
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:46,920
See you tomorrow. Let's hang out then.

1990
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:48,960
Do you ever get the feeling

1991
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:49,920
I think the people around him

1992
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,120
all want to help him.

1993
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:53,160
Yeah.

1994
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:55,640
Today I feel

1995
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:57,120
Ruilong scored extra points with me.

1996
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:58,720
Ruilong is really adorable.

1997
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:01,280
So pure.

1998
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:03,280
At first, I just thought he

1999
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:04,360
he's kind of like

2000
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:05,480
Even though he's older than me,

2001
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:06,240
I feel like his

2002
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:08,280
mental age is

2003
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:09,600
very childlike.

2004
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,040
But actually, I think

2005
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,480
he's quite thoughtful.

2006
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:13,040
Really?

2007
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,320
Today, when they announced

2008
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:18,520
the jump rope results,

2009
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,520
Teacher Zeng said it wrong at first.

2010
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:21,080
He said

2011
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:22,480
Ruilong's team.

2012
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:26,880
Then he corrected it to Ruilong and Wang Jue.

2013
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:28,840
The total score for the 801st floor is

2014
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:30,000
322 points.

2015
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,080
The highest score is

2016
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,800
Ruilong's 197.

2017
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:34,160
And Wang Jue.

2018
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:39,880
This detail

2019
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:41,080
really touched me.

2020
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:42,520
Girls really love

2021
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:44,520
those sweet little details.

2022
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:45,800
That's amazing.

2023
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:49,200
He's great.

2024
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:53,480
And I think he's quite

2025
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,560
respectful to girls.

2026
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:57,360
A gentleman.

2027
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,560
Is your shoe untied?

2028
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,560
Better tie it up.

2029
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:08,240
What rhythm do you like for jumping?

2030
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:09,920
I'll try to match

2031
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:11,960
your speed.

2032
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:12,560
Okay.

2033
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:14,000
If you jump,

2034
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,560
You mean if I jump?

2035
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:16,760
I'll jump.

2036
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,400
This rope is really long.

2037
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:22,480
But you two are so in sync

2038
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:23,800
when jumping rope.

2039
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:25,280
I feel that too.

2040
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:26,880
Suddenly, the vibe just clicked.

2041
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,000
Did you guys practice before?

2042
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:28,840
Really good.

2043
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,240
We just practiced a bit.

2044
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:32,360
It went smoothly from the start.

2045
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:33,520
Seventeen.

2046
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:33,960
Eighteen.

2047
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:34,320
Nineteen.

2048
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:34,680
Twenty.

2049
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:35,080
Twenty-one.

2050
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:36,280
So fast!

2051
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:37,240
These two are awesome.

2052
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:39,000
She can even jump on one foot.

2053
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,560
Ruilong is so happy.

2054
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:52,880
I only jumped three over there.

2055
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:53,960
You guys did thirty.

2056
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:03,480
You rarely see Wang Jue talk this much.

2057
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,560
I'm starting to like their group.

2058
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:08,760
Ruilong knows everything.

2059
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:10,240
Among these people,

2060
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:11,560
several guests have gone.

2061
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:12,720
When there's a conversation,

2062
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:14,840
or when he talks about others,

2063
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:17,200
his insights are always spot on.

2064
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:18,000
He totally knows

2065
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,160
what's happening between everyone.

2066
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:22,800
He keeps it all in mind.

2067
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:23,800
So I think he himself

2068
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:25,120
is probably a really good

2069
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,320
and detail-oriented person.

2070
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:28,040
That's right.

2071
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:28,880
And I noticed

2072
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:29,920
Wang Jue is also very attentive.

2073
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:31,320
She notices a lot.

2074
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:32,600
She's very meticulous.

2075
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:33,000
Yeah.

2076
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:38,840
Hello.

2077
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:40,160
Hi, you're back.

2078
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:41,320
What are you doing?

2079
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:43,760
I'm looking at our photos from today.

2080
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,200
Sure.

2081
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:46,960
Huawei nova 14 series.

2082
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,560
Portraits look amazing.

2083
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:50,520
There's also an AI magic image move feature.

2084
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:52,880
You can edit more creative pictures.

2085
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:57,160
Make it smaller.

2086
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,880
Okay, copy one.

2087
01:14:58,880 --> 01:14:59,480
Put it here.

2088
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:00,560
Alright.

2089
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,920
Look, the coolest part is coming.

2090
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:04,200
One-click merge.

2091
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:07,120
Can I try?

2092
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:07,720
Sure.

2093
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:08,840
Here, you try it.

2094
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:19,400
Your phone's over there.

2095
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:26,400
Our Heart Signal apartment

2096
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,120
is about to have the second

2097
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:29,520
double-choice date.

2098
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:34,080
Everyone gets two date invitation cards.

2099
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:35,760
They're for two days of dates.

2100
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:39,880
If you exchange cards, the date is set.

2101
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:42,760
You can't repeat the same pair for both days.

2102
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,040
You have to choose each other.

2103
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,240
You pick me, I pick you.

2104
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:47,360
Only then can they go.

2105
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:49,000
One-sided doesn't work.

2106
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,320
That's showing your hand.

2107
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:51,360
So exciting!

2108
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:54,200
You have to pick two girls, right?

2109
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:54,880
Yeah.

2110
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:57,120
Two cards.

2111
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,480
You can interact with up to two people.

2112
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:02,160
It's our turn.

2113
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:03,400
Let's go!

2114
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:04,920
Go!

2115
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:06,160
So fast.

2116
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,000
Finally, a chance to take initiative.

2117
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,160
I love watching this.

2118
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:22,160
It's so thrilling.

2119
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:23,760
I'm looking forward to this the most.

2120
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:43,840
Write first or ask first?

2121
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:48,760
You say, "Please go on a date with me?"

2122
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:50,920
Aren't there two days?

2123
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:51,560
Yeah.

2124
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:53,320
You can pick the same person both days.

2125
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,400
I think that's fine.

2126
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:57,760
You can too.

2127
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:59,760
Give one card or both?

2128
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:02,240
I want to date twice, and I...

2129
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:03,840
Date the same person twice.

2130
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:04,840
I'm dreaming too big.

2131
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:05,800
See?

2132
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:06,680
He

2133
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:08,760
Not only is he not

2134
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:09,920
giving two cards to one person,

2135
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:10,920
he also hopes

2136
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:12,040
to date the same person twice.

2137
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:13,600
Someone dates him twice.

2138
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:16,920
You're such a "focus."

2139
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:36,920
Le Chen.

2140
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,440
I'm off, bro.

2141
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:40,960
Gone.

2142
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:42,480
Heading out.

2143
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:44,760
Aren't you going out?

2144
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,240
Wait, I need to write something.

2145
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:48,360
You might be a step behind.

2146
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:49,720
Then hurry up!

2147
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:51,240
Go!

2148
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:57,680
Oops, bumped into someone.

2149
01:17:58,680 --> 01:17:59,840
Should I wait for you?

2150
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:01,040
You can come up together.

2151
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:04,920
Both girls are really nice.

2152
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:07,640
You can come up together.

2153
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:12,480
All for you.

2154
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:13,160
Want to go on a date?

2155
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:21,480
Alright, next up,

2156
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:22,120
everyone,

2157
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:22,760
it's time again for

2158
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:23,840
our deduction round.

2159
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:25,920
This time, the deduction

2160
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:27,560
is an individual challenge.

2161
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:30,760
Please guess the results of their invitations.

2162
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:33,160
The results for the two people on the board—

2163
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:34,680
if you guess both correctly,

2164
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:35,680
you'll win

2165
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:38,080
a Heart Signal gem.

2166
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:45,080
I think this is a bit challenging.

2167
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:46,680
This seems a little too easy.

2168
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:54,440
This is so hard for me.

2169
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:56,480
Mine was way too easy.

2170
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:57,400
I’ve already finished.

2171
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:00,400
Everyone, you can reveal your boards now.

2172
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:03,680
Let’s start with

2173
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:05,120
Ma Boqian goes first.

2174
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:06,480
Jiao.

2175
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:07,240
I didn’t write two names.

2176
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:08,040
I only wrote one.

2177
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:09,600
Because both of his choices are too easy to guess.

2178
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:11,280
It’s definitely Lanlan.

2179
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:14,040
But I hope he invites Dr. Fang.

2180
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:16,480
I think that would be more interesting.

2181
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:18,200
This is a date invitation.

2182
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:19,320
If we talk tough,

2183
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:22,000
After the date, you can call your bros to chat.

2184
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,280
And I think

2185
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:27,600
No matter who Duoduo picks,

2186
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,000
Everyone knows it’s Lechen.

2187
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:29,920
But

2188
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:32,760
I’d like to see her interact with Liu Zihan.

2189
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:34,720
It’d be nice if they had some interaction.

2190
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:36,640
Clear.

2191
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,360
Next, Xu Ge.

2192
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:41,040
I saw that smiley face right away.

2193
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:42,680
I was even wondering which character that was.

2194
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:47,760
Yuxing will pick Chichi and Yifan.

2195
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:50,280
Lanlan will pick Jiao and Fang.

2196
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:53,200
My Zihan.

2197
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:54,360
I chose Chichi.

2198
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:54,880
I think Chichi

2199
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:55,680
is a good choice.

2200
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:56,400
Yeah.

2201
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,480
My second choice

2202
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:58,600
is Yifan.

2203
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:00,640
Because I really hope

2204
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:03,560
Yifan gets more chances to interact with others.

2205
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:04,560
Jue’er.

2206
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,560
First choice is Ruilong.

2207
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:08,240
I was a bit hesitant.

2208
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:10,440
But I still wrote Lechen’s name.

2209
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:11,680
Because I feel like

2210
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:13,960
since the rule is for two days,

2211
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:17,880
let’s just follow the rule and try.

2212
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:22,120
For me, Dr. Fang will only pick Lanlan.

2213
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,600
I don’t think he’ll pick anyone else.

2214
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:25,320
Unanimous approval.

2215
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:26,320
Everyone agrees.

2216
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:27,960
What if he invites Jiao?

2217
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:30,880
He won’t invite Jiao, no way.

2218
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,280
Chichi is a definite pick.

2219
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:37,680
It’s Yuxing.

2220
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:39,760
And Liu Zihan will too.

2221
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:40,520
There’ll be some interaction.

2222
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:41,480
That’s also easy.

2223
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:43,760
For mine,

2224
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:44,960
I think Lechen

2225
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:48,640
should be Duoduo and Luyuan.

2226
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:49,840
Yeah.

2227
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:51,000
And Yifan

2228
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,120
is kind of

2229
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:52,960
hard to predict.

2230
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,760
She wasn’t here during the sports event.

2231
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:56,960
So I think Yuxing should have

2232
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:58,160
And I thought maybe she

2233
01:20:58,160 --> 01:21:00,560
might think Ruilong isn’t clear either.

2234
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:01,560
I think it’s possible.

2235
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:02,840
To have such a date opportunity.

2236
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,800
For Ruilong, thinking rationally,

2237
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:07,920
it’s likely to be Wang Jue.

2238
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:09,000
Because they just worked together.

2239
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:09,800
It was a very

2240
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:10,840
coordinated sport.

2241
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:12,640
And Ruilong loves sports.

2242
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:14,560
But I still

2243
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:15,400
really like Duoduo

2244
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:17,560
and their chemistry together.

2245
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:19,520
They’re both “happy puppies.”

2246
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:20,720
So I still wrote Duoduo

2247
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:21,400
down as well.

2248
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:22,000
Just in case.

2249
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:24,000
And then Luyuan.

2250
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:24,960
That’s Lechen.

2251
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,280
Luyuan won’t pick anyone else.

2252
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:27,760
Right.

2253
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:29,480
Okay.

2254
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:31,400
Jasmine blooms, it’s the Heart Signal.

2255
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:32,360
Next, we move on to

2256
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:35,120
Master Kong Jasmine Tea’s Heartwarming Moment.

2257
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:37,520
What will our invitation results be?

2258
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:38,840
Everyone, let’s take a look.

2259
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,160
Aren’t you going out yet?

2260
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:45,880
Wait, I need to write something.

2261
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:47,640
You might be a step behind.

2262
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:49,000
Then hurry up!

2263
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:50,240
Let’s go!

2264
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:57,440
Dr. Fang is here.

2265
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:03,400
All the invitation cards are for you.

2266
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:04,800
All the invitation cards are for you.

2267
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:07,840
Look.

2268
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:09,280
I gave you all the invitation cards.

2269
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:12,280
I have something for you tomorrow.

2270
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:14,320
She has something for him tomorrow.

2271
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:15,640
You have something for me tomorrow.

2272
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:18,360
How about the day after tomorrow?

2273
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:20,600
Why, what are you doing tomorrow?

2274
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:21,480
Nothing.

2275
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:23,280
Tomorrow is too rushed.

2276
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:24,920
It's okay.

2277
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:26,880
Me.

2278
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:28,440
I want to give it to you tomorrow.

2279
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,480
I'm just worried Dr. Fang will ask something now.

2280
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:35,640
Would you give me both cards?

2281
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:37,080
If it were you, would you ask that?

2282
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:38,160
No, I wouldn't.

2283
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:40,920
I'd also hope she could explore more.

2284
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:45,800
This time it's my turn to give you a gift.

2285
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:50,480
This time it's my turn to give you a gift.

2286
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:56,480
Look forward to it.

2287
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:58,000
Good night.

2288
01:22:59,240 --> 01:22:59,600
Good night.

2289
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:05,640
So happy.

2290
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,920
Little Jiao would definitely give her both cards.

2291
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:24,920
I'm thinking about going now.

2292
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:26,200
But if I go now,

2293
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:29,320
My backup.

2294
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:31,440
My snack stash comes in handy.

2295
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:38,560
Spicy beef.

2296
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:40,000
Spicy beef.

2297
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:41,680
Spicy beef with a box of chocolate.

2298
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:44,280
I'm hilarious.

2299
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:48,000
Today's snacks.

2300
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:50,880
I'm off.

2301
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:51,400
Bro.

2302
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:53,560
Hurry up.

2303
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:57,760
Little Jiao running fast.

2304
01:23:57,920 --> 01:23:58,840
Go, Little Jiao!

2305
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:17,160
Hello.

2306
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:20,040
Hello.

2307
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:24,880
Thank you.

2308
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:25,840
You're welcome.

2309
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:27,440
That's just him.

2310
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:28,920
He's fallen in.

2311
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:30,400
He's fallen in.

2312
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:32,080
He's just like us.

2313
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:33,840
What we often want to see in life.

2314
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:34,520
That ray of light.

2315
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:40,280
Thank you.

2316
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:41,240
You're welcome.

2317
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:44,120
Happy.

2318
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:53,400
Dr. Fang.

2319
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:58,920
You just looked like a killer.

2320
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,320
I said you looked like a killer just now.

2321
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:02,640
Killer.

2322
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:02,920
It's fine.

2323
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:03,720
You look like a killer.

2324
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:04,320
It's fine.

2325
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:14,840
I think Dr. Fang guessed she'd give it.

2326
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:15,560
Little Jiao.

2327
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:16,400
Yeah.

2328
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:19,560
Just relax.

2329
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:23,000
It's no big deal.

2330
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:25,200
It's no big deal.

2331
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:40,360
Dr. Fang cares a lot.

2332
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:43,960
There's no secret at all.

2333
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:45,400
What secret?

2334
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:53,320
Who?

2335
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:54,800
Who's coming over?

2336
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:57,200
Who?

2337
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:01,480
Yifan came to find Yuxing.

2338
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:03,400
Hello.

2339
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:05,240
I'm leaving too.

2340
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:07,320
I won't bother you two.

2341
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:12,760
Okay.

2342
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:14,000
I got one first.

2343
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:16,920
Yeah, is this how it works?

2344
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:18,040
Then I will too.

2345
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:18,960
I haven't started yet.

2346
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:24,600
Gave you both.

2347
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:30,240
She gave him both.

2348
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:32,680
She didn't think about anyone else.

2349
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:34,000
Gave you both.

2350
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:36,440
Gave you both.

2351
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Did you write your name?

2352
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:40,760
I didn't.

2353
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:41,560
Then you should.

2354
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:44,440
You only write if you agree.

2355
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:45,280
I think Yuxing

2356
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:46,520
is likely to write Yifan.

2357
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:47,280
Definitely will.

2358
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:50,880
You only write if you agree.

2359
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:56,880
Will you write my name?

2360
01:26:58,440 --> 01:26:59,480
Will you write my name?

2361
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:01,600
Will you write my name?

2362
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:03,640
So brave.

2363
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:05,760
Chichi came too.

2364
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:11,920
She left.

2365
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:21,120
She came back.

2366
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:28,360
Hurry up.

2367
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,080
She went back.

2368
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:32,800
She should've gone in.

2369
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:33,240
You know what?

2370
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:33,720
Yeah.

2371
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:39,960
Chichi actually cares about Yuxing.

2372
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:40,720
Right.

2373
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:42,200
She was like that from the start.

2374
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:44,920
Will she write my name?

2375
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:58,200
Go ahead, just give it to him.

2376
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:09,080
Zi Han.

2377
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:10,880
Where are you going?

2378
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:12,720
Where are you going?

2379
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:14,120
No.

2380
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:15,480
I meant find a secret spot.

2381
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:16,000
No.

2382
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,120
There are no secrets now.

2383
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:19,040
There are no secrets now.

2384
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:20,720
Are you free tomorrow?

2385
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:27,080
My card.

2386
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:32,640
My first line.

2387
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:33,160
It's done.

2388
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:34,720
I got one too.

2389
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:36,240
But I still feel like

2390
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:38,080
Chichi likes Yuxing more.

2391
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:39,360
I think maybe

2392
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:40,400
there's a more secret spot.

2393
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:41,920
But there are no secrets.

2394
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:43,240
Upstairs, it's already

2395
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:44,280
just no secrets.

2396
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:45,000
No secrets anymore.

2397
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:49,880
Zi Han, so happy.

2398
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:51,080
I'm leaving.

2399
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:52,040
Bye, see you tomorrow.

2400
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:52,760
Bye.

2401
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:15,120
Still inviting people.

2402
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:24,120
Lanlan is me.

2403
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:24,680
Playing me.

2404
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:25,160
Next to me.

2405
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:31,000
Chichi is waiting here.

2406
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:32,240
Right at the door.

2407
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:36,880
Maybe people don't know this.

2408
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:40,200
Saw it.

2409
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:46,920
Yuxing is so awkward.

2410
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:53,120
I'll pretend I don't know.

2411
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:54,280
Okay.

2412
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:04,400
So awkward.

2413
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:13,280
So exciting.

2414
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:23,440
Interview's over.

2415
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:24,560
Interview's over.

2416
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:26,600
Feels like we're here for an interview.

2417
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:31,240
You gave it to him.

2418
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:32,440
I gave him both cards.

2419
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:37,080
Chichi won't give up, right?

2420
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:38,640
No, won't give up.

2421
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:39,920
Are you ready?

2422
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:41,520
Are you ready?

2423
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:42,120
I'm ready.

2424
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:43,960
I'm ready.

2425
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:46,480
This gesture.

2426
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:47,280
Feels like he's saying sorry.

2427
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:47,760
Please.

2428
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:48,520
Sorry.

2429
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:49,320
Please.

2430
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:50,680
And then?

2431
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:51,640
Then.

2432
01:30:58,800 --> 01:30:59,520
So nervous.

2433
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:06,000
Dr. Fang, maybe you should come out.

2434
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:07,840
I'll come out.

2435
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:14,360
He wanted her to go in so he could give it to her.

2436
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:14,840
Probably.

2437
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:19,800
Did you write it?

2438
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:20,920
I did.

2439
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:23,160
Chichi.

2440
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:24,920
Did you write it?

2441
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:26,800
No, I was worried you didn't write me.

2442
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:28,080
How could I not?

2443
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:31,520
I did.

2444
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:32,640
Alright.

2445
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:47,040
Chichi wrote it herself.

2446
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:47,520
Yeah.

2447
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:57,200
I think when it says "secret"

2448
01:31:57,200 --> 01:31:59,520
I think it can

2449
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:00,480
Not everyone.

2450
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:01,640
There are no secrets at all.

2451
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:03,720
Yeah, I think there's no secret at all.

2452
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:06,160
Let's leave it at that.

2453
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:07,600
Bye.

2454
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:08,120
Good night.

2455
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:08,800
Good night.

2456
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:10,160
Sweet dreams.

2457
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:13,320
Go in.

2458
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:20,960
So fast.

2459
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:29,320
That was so fast.

2460
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:30,000
I thought it would take

2461
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,480
maybe until tomorrow or late at night.

2462
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:33,640
before anything happened.

2463
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:35,200
Why is everyone so quick?

2464
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:35,800
Can I see it?

2465
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:36,840
No need.

2466
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:37,480
Everyone saw it.

2467
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:38,000
Yeah.

2468
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:38,400
Right.

2469
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:39,040
Everyone saw it.

2470
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:39,880
Yeah.

2471
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:43,000
Wasn't it supposed to be secret?

2472
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:43,520
Why is everyone

2473
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:45,160
so fast?

2474
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:47,400
I'm a bit confused.

2475
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:54,600
Why do I feel like

2476
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:56,520
Yuxing has been confused the whole time.

2477
01:32:57,160 --> 01:32:58,640
He's always a step behind.

2478
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:01,600
His friend is even funnier.

2479
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:02,400
Those two are really

2480
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:03,000
Yeah.

2481
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,040
Come up, Lanlan.

2482
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:06,120
But I think

2483
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:08,440
Wang Yifan must feel a bit

2484
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:12,880
upset.

2485
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:14,560
A little upset.

2486
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:17,120
No, but it's good she did that.

2487
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:17,840
If she hadn't done it,

2488
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:18,600
I guess

2489
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:20,720
Yuxing might not have chosen her.

2490
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:21,520
And she

2491
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:22,920
asked him right next to him,

2492
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:24,680
"Will you write my name?"

2493
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,080
Yifan is really brave.

2494
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:30,080
Xiaoyuan.

2495
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:33,960
Here he comes.

2496
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:42,040
He bumped into something.

2497
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:44,520
So fast.

2498
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:47,040
Should I wait for you?

2499
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:49,400
You can come up together.

2500
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:51,920
That's pretty bold.

2501
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:53,640
You can come up together.

2502
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:58,280
They said we could go up together.

2503
01:33:58,640 --> 01:33:59,120
Yeah.

2504
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:01,320
It's all very clear.

2505
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:03,920
You can come up together.

2506
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:06,240
So exciting.

2507
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:07,240
Those two are awesome.

2508
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:10,520
These girls are so brave.

2509
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,040
Did you notice the girls

2510
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:13,240
don't look at each other

2511
01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:14,000
with any hostility. None.

2512
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:14,560
Yeah.

2513
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:23,120
Darn it, Lechen.

2514
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:24,640
Lechen.

2515
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:28,280
Which room was it?

2516
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:35,160
Here comes the exciting part.

2517
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:47,200
Hello.

2518
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:49,680
Hi.

2519
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:51,520
Wanna go on a date?

2520
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:53,840
Everyone's so bold.

2521
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:56,040
Wanna go on a date?

2522
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:03,920
Polite distance.

2523
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:05,280
Wanna go on a date?

2524
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:07,360
Exchange.

2525
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:09,840
Just take it.

2526
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:10,440
Sure.

2527
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:13,320
Gave one.

2528
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:15,080
Okay.

2529
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:21,760
Wait, you have one more.

2530
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:23,120
It's all out in the open.

2531
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:26,280
So busy.

2532
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:33,720
I feel like Duoduo doesn't want to give it.

2533
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:35,320
This situation is uncomfortable.

2534
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:37,560
Yeah, will that be affected too?

2535
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:39,200
Duoduo won't.

2536
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:46,360
Wait a second.

2537
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:48,360
Why? Wasn't it supposed to be secret?

2538
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:52,560
Here they come.

2539
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:01,760
I'll come in and sit for a bit.

2540
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:05,560
This is so cool.

2541
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:07,360
This is really cool.

2542
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:08,920
I'll come in and sit for a bit.

2543
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:09,560
Nice, beautiful.

2544
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:17,840
I'll come in and sit for a bit.

2545
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:35,960
You finished writing so quickly.

2546
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:36,520
Yeah.

2547
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:40,120
Turns out you thought it all through.

2548
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:42,600
It's fine, I'll just ask.

2549
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:44,680
What's wrong?

2550
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:47,840
Because...

2551
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:50,240
I haven't decided about the second card.

2552
01:36:53,120 --> 01:36:54,240
You didn't write a second card?

2553
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:56,600
Right.

2554
01:36:58,200 --> 01:36:59,880
But that's not...

2555
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:01,680
You can just give one card.

2556
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:07,200
You're acting.

2557
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:11,320
I don't believe you don't know.

2558
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:12,280
I don't believe it.

2559
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:15,200
What happened? I didn't catch that.

2560
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:18,320
He said you can write the same name.

2561
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:20,880
I didn't write a second card.

2562
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:21,920
But I wrote the first one.

2563
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:27,800
Very decisive.

2564
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:28,960
I just...

2565
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:29,840
What's up?

2566
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:35,280
You decided so fast.

2567
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:37,880
So quick.

2568
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:39,120
Alright, okay.

2569
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:40,720
You really care.

2570
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:44,480
Okay.

2571
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:55,240
I was thinking to say...

2572
01:37:55,240 --> 01:37:56,840
Let's see what Teacher Lechen does.

2573
01:37:58,280 --> 01:37:59,320
What's the situation?

2574
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:01,440
Let me check.

2575
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:03,240
Should I write the name in person for the other card?

2576
01:38:08,680 --> 01:38:09,920
Depends on your choice.

2577
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:10,680
She didn't say that for herself.

2578
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:11,400
She wasn't talking to herself.

2579
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:12,160
She said it to the other side.

2580
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:13,920
She thinks exactly like I do.

2581
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:15,280
If it were me, I'd definitely say it.

2582
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:16,840
I'd be straightforward too.

2583
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:19,200
I hope you can be more clear.

2584
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:22,560
Should you write the name face to face?

2585
01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:26,960
She gave him a push too.

2586
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:28,600
She made it clear, you have to choose.

2587
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:29,600
I've been torn for a long time.

2588
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:32,760
The second card is for...

2589
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:33,640
One person's name.

2590
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:34,760
Or leave it blank.

2591
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:40,440
Because I feel like half the time has passed.

2592
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:42,200
I think every choice should be...

2593
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:44,600
Considered carefully.

2594
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:44,960
Yes.

2595
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:50,760
I was worried you'd feel pressured.

2596
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:51,960
That's why I only wrote one card.

2597
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:56,320
Don't worry too much about my feelings.

2598
01:38:58,240 --> 01:38:59,360
If you say so, that's fine.

2599
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:00,200
You're not afraid of pressure.

2600
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:02,640
Alright, that's fine.

2601
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:04,040
Do you like this move?

2602
01:39:04,040 --> 01:39:05,240
Okay.

2603
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:06,480
Sweet dreams, Teacher Lechen.

2604
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:10,800
Duoduo is disappointed.

2605
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:21,040
Feeling the pressure now.

2606
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:28,360
But right now, no one really knows.

2607
01:39:28,360 --> 01:39:30,120
Who Lechen will choose.

2608
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:31,680
Maybe he doesn't know yet either.

2609
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:33,040
It's still too soon.

2610
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Hello.

2611
01:39:57,640 --> 01:39:59,320
Hi.

2612
01:39:59,320 --> 01:40:00,920
I want to come in.

2613
01:40:00,920 --> 01:40:01,440
Go ahead.

2614
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:03,280
So clean.

2615
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:04,280
I thought about it.

2616
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:06,960
What do you mean?

2617
01:40:08,680 --> 01:40:10,560
I'm so nervous.

2618
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:14,080
I gave it some thought.

2619
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:15,960
I'll give you both cards.

2620
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:17,000
All for you.

2621
01:40:21,320 --> 01:40:22,360
So brave.

2622
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:23,880
Without hesitation.

2623
01:40:24,280 --> 01:40:25,000
Both cards for you.

2624
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:26,040
All for you.

2625
01:40:28,680 --> 01:40:29,480
Both cards for me?

2626
01:40:38,120 --> 01:40:39,360
I'm so happy.

2627
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:48,200
I went back and thought about it.

2628
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:49,520
I'll give you both cards.

2629
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:51,000
That's brave.

2630
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:02,960
Wrote the second card.

2631
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:05,360
She's pure too.

2632
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:10,360
So happy.

2633
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:22,480
I feel really

2634
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:26,480
unsure.

2635
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:27,640
It's hard for me to explain

2636
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:28,880
how I feel right now

2637
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:29,960
or what I'm thinking.

2638
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:35,360
Actually, yesterday I

2639
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:38,000
kind of

2640
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:43,000
forced myself to think calmly for a long time.

2641
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:45,600
He's about to speak.

2642
01:41:46,040 --> 01:41:48,840
What's the result?

2643
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:51,800
I can't tell you that.

2644
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:53,200
Really can't say?

2645
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:54,200
What are you thinking?

2646
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:56,840
No, it's just that I

2647
01:41:58,600 --> 01:42:00,200
have complicated thoughts.

2648
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:01,600
I don't even know what I'm thinking.

2649
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:06,640
Say it whenever you want.

2650
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:09,560
Okay.

2651
01:42:10,440 --> 01:42:11,280
Alright.

2652
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:13,520
I'm so happy.

2653
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:14,160
I'm leaving.

2654
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:17,560
Bye.

2655
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:30,480
He's starting to think.

2656
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:47,600
My heart keeps going up and down with them.

2657
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:49,560
These two girls

2658
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:50,320
came to

2659
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:51,400
Wang Lechen's room.

2660
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:52,520
Their interaction

2661
01:42:52,520 --> 01:42:53,840
from the guy's perspective

2662
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:55,560
is different between them.

2663
01:42:56,360 --> 01:42:58,160
I think the reason for this

2664
01:42:58,160 --> 01:43:00,960
is related to how they view Lechen.

2665
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:02,040
There's a big difference.

2666
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:03,440
Because Lu Yuan came in,

2667
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:04,160
she was completely

2668
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:05,600
expressing herself.

2669
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:07,280
Actually, for Lechen,

2670
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:08,720
I feel in her response to him,

2671
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:10,160
she has no expectations.

2672
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:12,800
She just thought it over and wrote a second card.

2673
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:14,280
But

2674
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:16,240
Duoduo, in this situation,

2675
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:17,680
is hoping for a reaction from Lechen.

2676
01:43:17,680 --> 01:43:19,240
Yes, she has expectations for Lechen.

2677
01:43:19,240 --> 01:43:19,840
Yes, their

2678
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,280
attitude toward this time

2679
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:22,040
this action

2680
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:24,320
and the feedback they get

2681
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:24,840
are different.

2682
01:43:24,840 --> 01:43:25,800
So that determines

2683
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:28,080
their final actions will be different.

2684
01:43:29,160 --> 01:43:29,720
So he (Lechen)

2685
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:30,520
should be able to

2686
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:31,880
clearly sense

2687
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:33,560
what his needs are

2688
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:35,840
or who he gets along with better.

2689
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:38,920
Lu Yuan gave him

2690
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:40,080
positive energy.

2691
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:41,680
So he started talking proactively.

2692
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:43,040
Yesterday, I thought about it for a long time.

2693
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:45,560
I think in daily life,

2694
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:47,240
especially when facing problems,

2695
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:49,280
when you want to communicate,

2696
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:50,640
you can try

2697
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:53,240
giving the other person more positive energy

2698
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:55,080
to open up the conversation.

2699
01:43:55,080 --> 01:43:55,560
Make the other person

2700
01:43:55,560 --> 01:43:56,960
willing to talk with you.

2701
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:58,480
I agree with that.

2702
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:00,280
So I'm looking forward to

2703
01:44:00,280 --> 01:44:02,240
what he'll say next time.

2704
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:02,680
Yeah.

2705
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:03,840
I hope he can

2706
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,200
follow his heart.

2707
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:06,200
I agree.

2708
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:29,200
It's okay, Duoduo.

2709
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:41,240
Here she comes.

2710
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:45,640
Hello.

2711
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:47,520
Here's your invitation card.

2712
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:48,320
Ruilong.

2713
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:53,360
Ruilong is awesome.

2714
01:44:58,320 --> 01:44:59,640
Okay.

2715
01:45:02,160 --> 01:45:03,480
Okay.

2716
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:07,320
Okay.

2717
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:10,640
Okay.

2718
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:14,480
Okay.

2719
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:16,320
He's hyping himself up.

2720
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:18,480
Go me! I'm the best!

2721
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:25,320
Okay.

2722
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:33,160
Okay.

2723
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:38,480
Maybe I should write something.

2724
01:45:43,200 --> 01:45:44,840
Go

2725
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:47,040
ahead

2726
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:50,720
and have some fun.

2727
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:54,040
His first choice is still Duoduo.

2728
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:02,040
Sure.

2729
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:03,720
Go, Ruilong!

2730
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:07,520
Someone should be here, right?

2731
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:12,480
Hello.

2732
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:13,280
Here’s a card for you (invitation card).

2733
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:16,680
First choice.

2734
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:20,160
Do you know how important it is for Ruilong to show up now?

2735
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:21,280
It’s really important.

2736
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:33,080
No more cards left.

2737
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:34,880
No, it’s like this.

2738
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:36,600
My second card is blank.

2739
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:37,480
Yeah.

2740
01:46:37,480 --> 01:46:39,320
And then...

2741
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:41,080
I wrote Lechen on my first card.

2742
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:41,320
Right.

2743
01:46:44,720 --> 01:46:46,520
She’s honest and straightforward.

2744
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,680
Just like we talked yesterday.

2745
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:51,360
After our chat yesterday,

2746
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:53,200
I personally feel that

2747
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:54,880
One thing I’m worried about

2748
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:55,640
is that

2749
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:57,560
what makes you comfortable

2750
01:46:57,560 --> 01:46:58,680
is because

2751
01:46:58,680 --> 01:47:01,680
of my social personality with everyone,

2752
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:03,120
or is it just me as a person?

2753
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:05,760
I don’t know if you get that.

2754
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:06,360
Yeah.

2755
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:07,200
She wants to make sure

2756
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:08,360
if you actually like me as a person.

2757
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:13,080
Being boyfriend and girlfriend

2758
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:14,400
isn’t the only goal.

2759
01:47:14,760 --> 01:47:15,600
Right.

2760
01:47:17,480 --> 01:47:18,480
Making good friends

2761
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:20,200
is also a great thing.

2762
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:24,200
I just want to hang out.

2763
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:26,800
That’s it.

2764
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:28,880
You want to hang out too.

2765
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:31,440
Just keep it chill.

2766
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:36,440
If you want to have fun,

2767
01:47:36,440 --> 01:47:37,920
I can join you.

2768
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:38,800
Okay.

2769
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:40,440
Let’s keep it relaxed then.

2770
01:47:40,440 --> 01:47:40,960
Yeah.

2771
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:42,520
I hope you enjoy yourself too.

2772
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:43,840
Right.

2773
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:51,320
Alright, anything else?

2774
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:53,520
Sure, that’s fine.

2775
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:02,080
She wrote this card too.

2776
01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:03,960
And she made it very clear.

2777
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:05,560
I really like her.

2778
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:35,160
Will you show me around Shanghai,

2779
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:37,080
or should I show you around Hangzhou?

2780
01:48:37,080 --> 01:48:39,520
Depends on where you want to go.

2781
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:40,680
Either is fine.

2782
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:42,040
Depends on the timing.

2783
01:48:42,040 --> 01:48:43,440
If I take you around Hangzhou,

2784
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:45,040
next time you can show me Shanghai.

2785
01:48:45,480 --> 01:48:46,080
Yeah.

2786
01:48:47,560 --> 01:48:48,680
Thanks.

2787
01:48:48,680 --> 01:48:49,680
I’m so happy.

2788
01:48:49,680 --> 01:48:50,960
No need to thank me.

2789
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:51,960
Let’s hang out together.

2790
01:48:54,720 --> 01:48:55,520
Good night.

2791
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:56,440
Good night.

2792
01:48:58,320 --> 01:48:59,360
Good night.

2793
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:36,840
Had a great time.

2794
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:38,200
It was relaxing.

2795
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:47,800
Sure.

2796
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:50,760
Okay.

2797
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:07,680
I can't.

2798
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:08,880
Quick, paper.

2799
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:15,840
I think if he

2800
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:17,320
really cares about Duoduo,

2801
01:50:17,320 --> 01:50:18,160
that's why he said it.

2802
01:50:18,160 --> 01:50:18,960
I just wanted to hang out.

2803
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:19,680
I think this part

2804
01:50:19,680 --> 01:50:20,720
can really hurt.

2805
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:26,560
Last time he explained

2806
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:27,880
when talking about himself,

2807
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:29,360
he said he's getting more cautious.

2808
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:31,240
Now, if I don't see a future,

2809
01:50:31,240 --> 01:50:32,680
I probably won't

2810
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:33,880
make a move.

2811
01:50:34,520 --> 01:50:36,520
I feel I'm getting more cautious.

2812
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:39,520
I think

2813
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:43,800
if it won't work, I won't even start.

2814
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:50,520
He definitely doesn't just want to hang out.

2815
01:50:51,720 --> 01:50:52,920
Because before he left,

2816
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:54,480
he hyped himself up.

2817
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:55,560
Yeah, he said "I can do it."

2818
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:57,680
When someone wants to hang out with another,

2819
01:50:57,680 --> 01:50:59,120
why hype themselves up?

2820
01:50:59,120 --> 01:51:00,040
If you just want to play,

2821
01:51:00,040 --> 01:51:01,160
He likes her.

2822
01:51:01,160 --> 01:51:02,680
But she said "just friends,"

2823
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:04,360
so he tries to find

2824
01:51:04,360 --> 01:51:06,000
a way that won't pressure her.

2825
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:09,200
That's why he said he just wants to hang out.

2826
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:11,760
Gentle as jade.

2827
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:12,800
Duoduo said that.

2828
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:13,960
He really is gentle as jade.

2829
01:51:15,720 --> 01:51:16,280
I just think

2830
01:51:16,280 --> 01:51:17,360
he's wonderful.

2831
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:19,160
It's the way he expresses himself

2832
01:51:19,160 --> 01:51:21,360
and his whole vibe.

2833
01:51:22,120 --> 01:51:23,640
When people see something beautiful,

2834
01:51:23,640 --> 01:51:26,120
they're touched.

2835
01:51:26,120 --> 01:51:27,320
I was moved right then.

2836
01:51:27,320 --> 01:51:28,680
That's exactly how I felt.

2837
01:51:35,320 --> 01:51:37,400
Hello.

2838
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:41,760
Hi.

2839
01:51:48,680 --> 01:51:49,440
Two.

2840
01:51:50,040 --> 01:51:50,800
Two.

2841
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:51,760
Yeah.

2842
01:51:56,600 --> 01:51:58,080
Awesome.

2843
01:51:58,640 --> 01:52:00,280
So great.

2844
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:03,080
This episode is wild.

2845
01:52:03,080 --> 01:52:03,920
This episode really

2846
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:05,360
is top-notch.

2847
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:06,760
Nice.

2848
01:52:06,760 --> 01:52:08,280
I like this outcome.

2849
01:52:09,200 --> 01:52:11,200
Why am I suddenly touched right now?

2850
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:12,960
Me too.

2851
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:13,720
I think

2852
01:52:18,160 --> 01:52:18,920
Two.

2853
01:52:18,920 --> 01:52:19,640
Yeah.

2854
01:52:23,480 --> 01:52:24,320
Ruilong deserves it.

2855
01:52:32,640 --> 01:52:33,280
Why am I now

2856
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:34,120
always getting moved?

2857
01:52:34,120 --> 01:52:34,520
Seriously.

2858
01:52:34,520 --> 01:52:35,160
What's wrong with me?

2859
01:52:35,160 --> 01:52:36,200
You deserve to be moved.

2860
01:52:36,200 --> 01:52:37,200
I thought every moment

2861
01:52:37,200 --> 01:52:38,640
was the most touching.

2862
01:52:38,640 --> 01:52:39,640
But he keeps

2863
01:52:39,640 --> 01:52:40,680
surprising you.

2864
01:52:47,160 --> 01:52:48,400
If possible,

2865
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:50,120
You seem to owe me one.

2866
01:52:53,200 --> 01:52:53,720
So cute.

2867
01:52:53,720 --> 01:52:54,720
Still remembers.

2868
01:52:58,400 --> 01:52:59,120
Alright.

2869
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:01,680
I want to write something.

2870
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:03,560
Yeah.

2871
01:53:03,560 --> 01:53:04,680
You need to write your name.

2872
01:53:04,680 --> 01:53:05,720
Write your name.

2873
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:11,840
So adorable.

2874
01:53:15,480 --> 01:53:16,360
I'm happy now.

2875
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:21,800
My Chinese isn't good.

2876
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:23,880
It's okay, I know it's mine.

2877
01:53:23,880 --> 01:53:25,000
I don't know about this.

2878
01:53:25,680 --> 01:53:27,760
I said my handwriting is bad.

2879
01:53:28,840 --> 01:53:29,800
Alright, thanks.

2880
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:32,600
Okay.

2881
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:37,200
Sure.

2882
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:39,360
Alright.

2883
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:40,240
Okay.

2884
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:43,680
Why do I feel

2885
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:45,040
Ruilong is always confused.

2886
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:51,920
Sure.

2887
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:53,480
Nice, Ruilong deserves it.

2888
01:53:53,480 --> 01:53:54,920
Worth it.

2889
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:56,600
I guessed both right.

2890
01:53:58,600 --> 01:53:59,400
Alright, then we

2891
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:00,480
The second round of invitations

2892
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:01,880
is now complete.

2893
01:54:01,880 --> 01:54:02,600
Everyone

2894
01:54:02,600 --> 01:54:03,920
in their own way

2895
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:05,240
to their crush

2896
01:54:05,240 --> 01:54:06,920
sent an invitation.

2897
01:54:06,920 --> 01:54:09,520
Next, we'll hand out the stones.

2898
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:13,200
Xu got it right.

2899
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:16,280
Mine was tough.

2900
01:54:16,280 --> 01:54:17,120
Good job.

2901
01:54:17,960 --> 01:54:19,080
It was challenging.

2902
01:54:19,080 --> 01:54:19,920
So what now?

2903
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:20,600
It's fine anyway.

2904
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:21,760
I should've been right.

2905
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:23,880
I'll give you mine.

2906
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:25,680
Give me one.

2907
01:54:25,680 --> 01:54:26,280
Thanks.

2908
01:54:26,280 --> 01:54:27,280
Okay.

2909
01:54:28,200 --> 01:54:29,080
We got it right.

2910
01:54:29,080 --> 01:54:29,720
Congrats.

2911
01:54:30,480 --> 01:54:30,880
Alright.

2912
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:31,720
So next,

2913
01:54:31,720 --> 01:54:33,280
it's our second date.

2914
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:35,200
For many people,

2915
01:54:35,200 --> 01:54:36,360
this is really important.

2916
01:54:36,360 --> 01:54:39,280
Who will seize the chance?

2917
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:41,280
And turn things around?

2918
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:42,800
Let's stay excited.

2919
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:45,160
Stay tuned for next week

2920
01:54:45,160 --> 01:54:48,240
for Heart Signal's second big date.

2921
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:51,080
Jasmine blooms, that's the signal of love.

2922
01:54:51,080 --> 01:54:51,720
This show is sponsored by

2923
01:54:51,720 --> 01:54:54,480
Master Kong Jasmine Tea, floral and fresh.

2924
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:55,280
Title sponsor.

2926
01:54:58,160 --> 01:54:59,720
Unlock more love clues.

01:54:59,720 --> 01:55:02,400
Watch Heart Signal with us Fridays and Saturdays at noon.

2928
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:04,320

See you next week for more Heart Signal.

2933
01:55:55,560 --> 01:55:57,960
The second big date at Heart Signal Apartment

2934
01:55:57,960 --> 01:55:58,680
It's here

2935
01:55:58,680 --> 01:56:00,400
I can't help but smile when I see you

2936
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:02,600
Do I look that funny?

2937
01:56:02,960 --> 01:56:03,720
Not funny

2938
01:56:03,720 --> 01:56:04,880
You're good-looking

2939
01:56:08,680 --> 01:56:10,200
Surfing now

2940
01:56:10,200 --> 01:56:13,280
Life needs a brave step forward

2941
01:56:15,320 --> 01:56:16,280
Like a family of three

2942
01:56:16,280 --> 01:56:16,800
Yeah

2943
01:56:18,120 --> 01:56:19,280
Welcome to my turf

2944
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:20,120
Have fun

2945
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:26,600
Today I fulfilled

2946
01:56:26,600 --> 01:56:28,480
a little dream I had

2947
01:56:37,080 --> 01:56:38,120
Falling together

2948
01:56:38,120 --> 01:56:39,320
Kind of romantic

2949
01:56:41,880 --> 01:56:43,080
My heart's racing

2950
01:56:43,680 --> 01:56:44,840
Finally came to the place

2951
01:56:44,840 --> 01:56:46,240
where you saw the view before

2952
01:56:46,840 --> 01:56:47,520
It's beautiful

2953
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:48,160
Thank you

2954
01:56:56,760 --> 01:56:57,280
So sweet

2955
01:56:57,280 --> 01:56:58,760
Princess carry in the air

2956
01:57:00,640 --> 01:57:02,440
I'm a strong person

2957
01:57:02,440 --> 01:57:04,160
Sometimes you don't have to be so strong

2958
01:57:04,160 --> 01:57:05,360
Then I'll come to you to cry next time

2959
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:07,840
I can't take it

2960
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:08,760
Takumi is going downhill

2961
01:57:09,320 --> 01:57:09,920
Okay

2962
01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:10,640
Takumi is going downhill

2963
01:57:10,640 --> 01:57:11,320
What does that mean?

2964
01:57:11,320 --> 01:57:12,560
Haven't seen Initial D?

2965
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:14,320
What's Initial D?

2966
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:16,200
Generation gap

2967
01:57:16,200 --> 01:57:17,960
I'll look it up tonight, alright

2968
01:57:21,480 --> 01:57:22,040
Be careful

2969
01:57:22,520 --> 01:57:24,840
It's hard to remember every single day

2970
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:27,520
Today I'm a happy kid

2971
01:57:29,080 --> 01:57:29,600
So sweet

2972
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:31,760
I don't think I've mentioned

2973
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:32,680
I love eating clams

2974
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:34,080
This is

2975
01:57:35,080 --> 01:57:35,880
fate

2976
01:57:39,560 --> 01:57:40,880
So straightforward

2977
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:44,760
Happy birthday to you

2978
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:46,120
Feels like the two of us

2979
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:47,760
are evenly matched

2980
01:57:51,800 --> 01:57:52,440
Every time you

2981
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:54,240
hit my trigger points

2982
01:57:54,240 --> 01:57:55,040
Smooth sailing

2983
01:57:55,040 --> 01:57:56,440
Everything goes well

2984
01:57:58,680 --> 01:58:00,080
Glad you like it

2985
01:58:00,080 --> 01:58:02,000
Today was really happy

2986
01:58:03,480 --> 01:58:04,080
Tired?

2987
01:58:04,080 --> 01:58:04,960
Yeah, I'm tired

2988
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:06,800
But happiness cancels it out

2989
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:13,360
This way it won't be greasy

2990
01:58:14,440 --> 01:58:16,000
I packed these two sausages

2991
01:58:16,440 --> 01:58:17,400
Safe travels

2992
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:19,160
How to get rid of red veins in your eyes?

2993
01:58:19,160 --> 01:58:20,640
Look at mine

2994
01:58:20,640 --> 01:58:21,720
So in winter

2995
01:58:21,720 --> 01:58:22,840
it's easier to find stars

2996
01:58:22,840 --> 01:58:24,800
We can go see Orion together then

2997
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:25,320
Sure

2998
01:58:25,320 --> 01:58:27,400
The guys' friends ask the girls

2999
01:58:27,400 --> 01:58:29,920
to ask a question you're curious about

3000
01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:32,120
The guy who interacts with you most

3001
01:58:32,120 --> 01:58:32,960
Is he my bro?

3002
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:40,320
This is flowing light

3003
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:41,640
So romantic

3004
01:58:41,640 --> 01:58:42,760
You need to pause in midair

3005
01:58:42,760 --> 01:58:43,600
That's your question

3006
01:58:45,240 --> 01:58:46,080
That's top intensity

3007
01:58:48,720 --> 01:58:49,960
Stop fighting, you guys

3008
01:58:54,960 --> 01:58:57,440
Your moves then and now look alike

3009
01:58:59,080 --> 01:59:00,560
Why is it called the Block Project Plan?

3010
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:02,320
Because

3011
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:05,160
I'm getting awkward too

3012
01:59:05,880 --> 01:59:07,360
Just didn't see myself earlier

3013
01:59:07,680 --> 01:59:09,000
Let's get moving

3014
01:59:09,120 --> 01:59:09,920
Reach a bit farther

3015
01:59:09,920 --> 01:59:10,600
Reach farther

3016
01:59:10,680 --> 01:59:11,920
No, that's not right

3017
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:14,160
This is our punishment
