1
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,800
Here you are again.

2
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,160
Bet you didn't expect this, everyone.

3
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,240
Hello, everyone.

4
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,200
We're back so soon.

5
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:43,960
It's still the two of us.

6
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,080
Did you "top up" your appearance?

7
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:45,760
I did "top up."

8
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,040
I spent a little money.

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:47,760
Let's sit down first.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,240
Why are there three seats?

11
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,440
Three seats.

12
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,360
So we have one more person today.

13
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,640
A mysterious new guest.

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,080
Guest.

15
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:54,560
A mysterious new guest.

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,440
Who is it?

17
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,520
Let's give a warm welcome to

18
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,040
Xu Rulan.

19
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,880
Lanlan, "Boss Lan."

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,640
Welcome.

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,840
Please have a seat.

22
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,720
Everyone, please sit.

23
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,280
Okay.

24
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:11,800
Thank you.

25
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,640
Thank you.

26
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,440
Long time no see.

27
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,000
Long time no see.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,800
Long time no see.

29
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,880
Long time no see.

30
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,320
How did everyone get so handsome?

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,400
Let's first

32
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,360
introduce ourselves.

33
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:22,720
Sure.

34
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,080
Hello, everyone.

35
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,120
I'm from Signal of the Heart

36
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,600
Season 8, Liu Zihan.

37
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,000
Hello, everyone.

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,680
I'm from Signal of the Heart

39
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,080
Season 8, Wang Lechen.

40
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,560
Hello, everyone.

41
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,560
I'm from Signal of the Heart

42
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,040
Season 8, Xu Rulan.

43
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,440
Welcome, welcome Xu Rulan.

44
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,280
How do you feel about

45
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,200
your performance on the show so far?

46
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,480
What are your

47
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,800
thoughts or opinions?

48
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,120
As for my performance,

49
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,360
maybe at first

50
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,840
I was a bit reserved.

51
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,760
Like covering my mouth when I laugh and so on.

52
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,880
Honestly, before this

53
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,600
I didn't even realize it myself.

54
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,120
Sorry.

55
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,680
Here we go again.

56
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,120
It's happening again.

57
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,480
It's okay.

58
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,480
Are you feeling nervous now?

59
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,280
So nervous.

60
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,120
Have some water.

61
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:57,920
No.

62
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,160
But I think

63
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,320
everyone's suggestions

64
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,280
I believe

65
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,200
we've all received them, yes.

66
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,240
Got them all.

67
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,400
What about you guys?

68
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,520
After watching, do you feel

69
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,160
You haven't appeared yet.

70
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,960
I haven't appeared yet.

71
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,480
Sorry.

72
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,400
I haven't appeared yet.

73
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,680
So, Lechen, how do you feel

74
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,280
about your performance on the show?

75
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,520
I don't want to talk about it.

76
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,000
It's just my mouth.

77
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,240
I don't want to say anymore.

78
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,840
There's still a lot I need to improve.

79
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,040
It's fine, it'll all get better.

80
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,360
So for our opening this time,

81
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,320
what game do we have?

82
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,480
Today's icebreaker game

83
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,480
is called "Guess the Noun Challenge."

84
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,520
Each guest will have

85
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,480
a name tag on their head.

86
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,280
During the game,

87
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,000
you can ask other guests questions

88
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,800
to get information related

89
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,920
to the name tag's content.

90
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,200
Guests will guess

91
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,480
what's on their own name tag.

92
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,160
If you can't guess it,

93
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,640
or if you're the last to guess,

94
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,920
you'll get a penalty.

95
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,320
I want to know what the penalty is.

96
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,320
I don't know yet, yeah.

97
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,880
We'll find out soon.

98
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,840
Okay.

99
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,280
You go first.

100
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:55,680
You go first.

101
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,320
You ask first.

102
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,480
Is it a solid?

103
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,000
Yes.

104
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,280
Is mine male or female?

105
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,560
Either one.

106
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,720
Either.

107
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,760
It has no gender.

108
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,640
Right, no gender.

109
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,680
Is mine something

110
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,520
that's in the house?

111
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,960
Is it an object?

112
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,840
No, it's not.

113
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,920
Yes.

114
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,040
It's an object, yes.

115
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,400
But it's not really an object.

116
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,600
It's a person.

117
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,080
How many questions have you asked?

118
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,640
That's your second question.

119
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,640
Your turn.

120
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,480
Is this in the sleeping area

121
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,400
or the living area?

122
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,240
Living area.

123
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:32,840
Living area.

124
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,360
Is mine food?

125
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,800
No.

126
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,240
Is mine a person?

127
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,280
Yes.

128
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,760
Great.

129
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,720
I already know.

130
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,120
Is mine

131
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,280
Is mine

132
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,960
meat or vegetable?

133
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,360
Meat.

134
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,120
Meat.

135
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,920
Meat, vegetable...

136
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,920
What else?

137
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,640
Seafood.

138
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,440
You pretty much know it now.

139
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,400
Is it seafood?

140
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,440
It's not seafood.

141
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,320
I said another one.

142
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,000
You told her again.

143
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,040
I got it.

144
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,080
That's how smart people do it.

145
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,240
Is it a pet?

146
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:13,760
No.

147
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,320
No.

148
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,760
Okay.

149
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,200
What exactly is mine?

150
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,920
Think about it.

151
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,680
Is it in the living area

152
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,520
or the sleeping area?

153
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,640
It's in the sleeping area.

154
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,560
Not just there.

155
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,440
You're doing this on purpose, right?

156
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,360
She said "not just there" again.

157
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:32,760
She's right.

158
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,680
I'm right.

159
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,360
I'm giving you a hint.

160
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,360
It's in the sleeping area for sure.

161
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,800
That's a big hint for you.

162
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,120
Thanks, I'll give you a hint later.

163
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,720
Okay.

164
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,800
Wang Lechen.

165
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,400
Mine is crayfish.

166
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:44,440
Mine is crayfish.

167
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,120
Defeated opponent, Wang Lechen.

168
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,200
Think about it again.

169
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,880
Ask yourself

170
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,320
another question.

171
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,400
Here's your chance.

172
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,720
I'll give you another hint.

173
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,440
When you used this thing,

174
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,400
you even posted a video.

175
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,160
It was pretty funny.

176
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,360
A video of you using this thing.

177
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,320
Yeah, that's right.

178
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,480
The voiceover

179
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,040
was really funny too.

180
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,240
Slide.

181
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,280
That's it.

182
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:09,920
Congrats.

183
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,000
Congrats.

184
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,920
Everyone, take it down and have a look.

185
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,800
Didn't lose too badly.

186
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,200
Didn't lose too badly.

187
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,320
So your punishment is

188
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,480
to imitate your own meme.

189
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:16,720
Okay.

190
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,040
What are you doing?

191
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,120
Are you cooking?

192
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,040
Alright, that's good.

193
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,600
Not bad.

194
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,640
My face is going to twitch soon.

195
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,120
That counts as a pass.

196
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,840
Then let's not waste any time.

197
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,600
Let's start watching.

198
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,440
Come on, let's begin.

199
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,000
Let's go.

200
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,080
Let's see who the first one is.

201
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,120
Handsome.

202
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,120
You're smiling so happily.

203
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,120
Aren't you?

204
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,320
You look so handsome today.

205
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,480
I'm shipping them.

206
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,680
I'm already shipping them.

207
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,480
So thoughtful, our Zihan.

208
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,680
It's getting a bit hot now.

209
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,480
I'm blushing.

210
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,240
Have some water.

211
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,160
Take a break.

212
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,360
You two got into that pool together.

213
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,440
Those little hands.

214
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,440
So cute.

215
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,320
This scene of you two

216
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,600
looks like a family of three.

217
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,360
A family of three?

218
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,240
So sweet.

219
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,360
I feel like the distance between you two

220
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,600
just got a lot closer.

221
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,720
One of you plays the funny guy,

222
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,320
and the other plays the straight man.

223
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,960
Yeah, one’s the joker, one’s the straight man.

224
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,840
It’s like you’re doing comedy sketches every day.

225
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,840
You’re pros at this.

226
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,720
That look in your eyes,

227
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,080
Did you realize it yourself at the time?

228
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,920
I didn’t know back then.

229
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,480
So it really was just

230
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,680
when you watch this,

231
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,400
it’s all subconscious behavior.

232
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,360
You improvised this on the spot.

233
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,920
You really made it up right then.

234
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,320
It’s all spontaneous.

235
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,640
I think

236
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,960
how would you two split it?

237
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,280
If it were you two,

238
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,840
I guess maybe

239
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,240
when you first start dating,

240
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,480
your partner would take up about sixty percent.

241
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,120
Socializing and alone time,

242
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,120
maybe twenty percent each.

243
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,000
Actually, this kind of socializing

244
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,800
is mostly time spent with friends.

245
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,600
Besides friends,

246
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,520
I think there’s also

247
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,480
in your regular work life,

248
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,040
socializing with colleagues.

249
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,960
But I think

250
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,600
when you just start

251
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,520
a new relationship,

252
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,360
you’ll want to spend most of your time

253
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,960
with your partner.

254
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:11,960
As for alone time,

255
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,600
since I also need

256
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,520
some time alone

257
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,720
to think things through.

258
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
I’m probably similar to you.

259
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,960
Maybe at first,

260
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,360
my partner takes up a huge part.

261
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,640
But later on,

262
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,720
once the relationship stabilizes,

263
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,760
alone time becomes about thirty percent.

264
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,680
Socializing might

265
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,720
be a bit less.

266
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,920
Or you socialize

267
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,400
together with your partner.

268
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,120
introvert (personality type)

269
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,200
introvert (personality type)

270
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,360
So are you an introvert?

271
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,760
Have you found that balance now?

272
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,760
Let’s watch the show.

273
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,520
Let’s watch the show.

274
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,400
You two are really in sync.

275
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,320
You’re like a family of four.

276
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,800
This must be your

277
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,320
So sweet.

278
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,520
first photo together, right?

279
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,320
There was one before.

280
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,120
During that mini date, right?

281
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,280
On my second visit before,

282
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:13,960
when I just arrived,

283
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,840
it felt a bit like daily life.

284
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,480
Why is that?

285
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,400
It just felt like a regular activity.

286
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,080
Yeah, super ordinary.

287
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,400
But there was still a spark.

288
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,200
It was really comfortable.

289
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,880
She’s the complete opposite of me in this.

290
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,400
I never celebrate my birthday.

291
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,080
Me neither.

292
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,480
Me neither.

293
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,400
I never do.

294
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,920
Are you both like this?

295
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,520
I am.

296
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,240
I need

297
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,920
positive feedback when I put in effort.

298
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,440
Otherwise, I feel like

299
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,600
I won’t have the courage to do things anymore.

300
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,240
But maybe there isn’t

301
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:13,640
that much positive feedback.

302
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,600
Just give me a bit of confidence to move forward.

303
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,520
That’s enough.

304
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,160
Actually, I just saw

305
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,200
you two mention a word—

306
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,360
well-matched opponents.

307
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,120
I think

308
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,840
when two people first meet,

309
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,000
having that feeling

310
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,440
is really important.

311
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,840
If you two

312
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,160
are obviously

313
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,560
not from the same world,

314
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,160
or totally on different wavelengths,

315
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,160
then between you,

316
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,520
it’s hard to feel that spark

317
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,680
or any chemistry or tension.

318
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,600
I think she wasn't satisfied with your answer

319
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,560
She wasn't happy with it

320
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,480
Yeah

321
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,840
So watching this part now

322
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,520
I really did say

323
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,440
some things and asked questions I shouldn't have

324
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,480
There were definitely

325
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,560
things I need to improve

326
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,200
What do you two think

327
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,600
about being on the same wavelength versus being complementary?

328
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,520
What's your take?

329
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,320
I think it's about agreeing on the basics but accepting differences

330
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,920
You two probably have

331
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,120
some similarities

332
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,720
So when you get to know each other

333
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,720
as you interact

334
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,440
you'll have lots to talk about

335
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,040
Having differences is actually good too

336
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,400
Because

337
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,120
while communicating

338
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,520
you'll spark new things

339
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,720
and see more

340
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,680
of the bigger world

341
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,920
I think that's important too

342
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,600
I totally agree

343
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,680
Absolutely agree

344
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,760
My main thought is

345
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,080
as long as in the big picture

346
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,000
your values are aligned

347
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,200
meaning you both agree

348
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,360
on what's good

349
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,160
and what's not

350
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,960
and move forward together

351
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,120
On this journey

352
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,440
a little friction is normal

353
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,160
But the main thing is

354
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,520
you're heading in the same direction

355
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,760
So do you think being a good match or working things out

356
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,560
is more important?

357
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,360
I think

358
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,200
being 100% compatible from the start

359
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,520
is very rare

360
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,440
All relationships

361
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,840
need some adjustment

362
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,720
You become a good match after working things out

363
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,880
Like if I'm 30%

364
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,760
and find someone who's 70%

365
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,840
it's hard to reach 100% together

366
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,760
We have to work together

367
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,360
to bridge that last 5%

368
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,000
by adjusting to each other

369
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,240
That's how you become a good match

370
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:05,920
True

371
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,880
Birthday cake?

372
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,840
Did you remember what she likes to eat?

373
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,720
Because honestly, I usually

374
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,600
don't really like sweets

375
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,920
But you'd eat them for her, right?

376
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,000
Sorry

377
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,120
It's okay

378
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,880
That's so addictive

379
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,800
Sometimes watching this kind of thing

380
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,520
really gives you

381
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,680
secondhand embarrassment

382
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,680
You know what I mean

383
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,480
Watching myself here

384
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,600
I'm actually blushing

385
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,400
It's fine, you're tan anyway

386
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,400
No one can tell you're blushing

387
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,440
I'm saying now

388
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,120
you two actually have

389
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,840
a good back-and-forth

390
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,400
A real exchange

391
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,240
You're well-matched opponents

392
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,520
A bit, yeah

393
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,000
He even gave her flowers in return

394
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,520
He gave them before

395
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,600
Yeah, the first time they met

396
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,560
Yifan brought him flowers

397
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,880
Yifan gave him flowers, right

398
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,240
Paper kite

399
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,480
That's pretty nice

400
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,640
I think Yifan probably just

401
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,680
wanted to see clearly

402
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,480
what was happening over there

403
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,880
Those two are so interesting

404
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,000
Yifan is so cute

405
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,240
That look

406
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,400
And I think

407
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,920
Yifan has a great personality too

408
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,720
Sometimes it's good for girls to take the initiative

409
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,720
It's really nice

410
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,440
Very confident

411
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,400
Yeah, very confident

412
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,480
Just expressing her thoughts

413
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,080
and showing what she likes

414
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,960
I think that's great

415
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,320
Very brave

416
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,240
Not conflicted at all

417
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,880
She knows what she wants

418
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,600
What are they doing?

419
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,720
Both hands.

420
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:02,880
The chatterbox is at it again.

421
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,720
That's nice.

422
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,200
What's their age difference?

423
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,760
Yuxing is nine...

424
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,480
Born in 1997.

425
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,240
Born in 1997, right?

426
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:26,880
1997.

427
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,480
Yifan was born in 2002, right?

428
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,120
2002.

429
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,600
Five years apart.

430
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,440
Do you think a five-year age gap

431
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,520
is a lot?

432
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,080
I think it's just right.

433
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:35,920
Pretty much.

434
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,400
Just right.

435
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,080
Well said.

436
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,680
The three of us were all born after '95.

437
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,800
We're basically the same age.

438
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,040
Same age, thanks.

439
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,240
He's not good at chatting.

440
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,520
Yuxing can't make conversation.

441
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,760
He's nervously drinking water.

442
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,560
Tactical water-drinking.

443
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,400
Who's that?

444
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,640
So handsome.

445
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,520
Motorbike.

446
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,080
After the ride, it rained.

447
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,560
And it poured.

448
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,680
It's like the rain was for you.

449
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,280
Weathering With You.

450
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,400
Weathering With You.

451
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,040
Actually, this activity

452
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,480
is pretty intimate.

453
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,880
You even helped her with the helmet.

454
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,040
So thoughtful.

455
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,160
The way you two interact

456
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,920
feels like an age-gap relationship.

457
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,080
Can't deny we're getting older.

458
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,400
It's got that brother-sister dynamic.

459
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,080
That kind of vibe.

460
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,040
Didn't expect that, Wang Lechen.

461
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,280
What's up?

462
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,080
You're really good with words.

463
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,080
Are you going to roast me?

464
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,160
I saved a cool one just for you.

465
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,640
Then I got soaked in the rain.

466
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,600
You weren't scared, right?

467
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,240
If you're scared, just hold me tight.

468
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,880
What if I'm scared?

469
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,760
Hold me tight.

470
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,840
If Xiaoyuan said "I'm scared" right now,

471
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,480
"I'm so scared."

472
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,440
When I'm leaning into a turn,

473
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,480
please hold me tight.

474
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,600
Don't get thrown off.

475
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,000
Nervous, starting to drink water.

476
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,640
Tactical water-drinking.

477
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,080
I'm so thirsty now.

478
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,720
Show it.

479
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,320
Show us.

480
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,240
Show it.

481
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,880
Fast and Furious.

482
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,760
I'm shipping them.

483
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,520
Did you realize at that moment

484
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,040
how close you two were?

485
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,160
And hugging so tightly?

486
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,440
When you took the turn, did you feel

487
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,800
the centrifugal force of love?

488
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,800
Only you could pull that off.

489
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,800
When will you take me for a ride?

490
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,720
When will you let Liu Zihan

491
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,120
sit on your back seat?

492
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:43,800
Is that okay?

493
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,480
Sure.

494
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,160
Can I drive?

495
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,840
There's so much tension.

496
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,000
We've never heard you mention it.

497
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,640
So they didn't believe you went driving?

498
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,240
That night,

499
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,320
you had to hide your skills.

500
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,800
Help!

501
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,480
When you see this part yourself,

502
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,040
what do you think?

503
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:35,880
Takumi,

504
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,400
you know,

505
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:36,800
she hasn't seen "Initial D."

506
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,200
I wanted to ask too.

507
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,320
You've never watched "Initial D"?

508
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,280
No.

509
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,800
The one with Jay Chou.

510
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,600
Then I kind of get it.

511
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,040
Here they're making flower specimens.

512
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,400
Pressed flowers.

513
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,080
This activity looks pretty fun.

514
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,400
I want to try it too.

515
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,240
The way you two interact

516
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,000
is actually like

517
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,720
teasing each other

518
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,840
with a flirty banter vibe

519
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,320
It's actually pretty relaxed

520
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,880
Yeah

521
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,960
I think Xiaoyuan is the kind of girl

522
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,720
who's really positive

523
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,000
and cheerful

524
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,480
Super cheerful

525
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,800
Yeah, she probably doesn't have

526
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,800
those sad moments like you do

527
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,240
She probably doesn't cry quietly to herself

528
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,600
Yeah, I'm too pessimistic sometimes

529
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,240
Yeah, I think in this aspect

530
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,360
you two are actually quite different

531
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,480
You say things like that

532
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,480
to protect yourself

533
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,160
like joking around

534
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,600
to hide your vulnerable side

535
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,440
Because every time you want to cry

536
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,960
you cheer yourself up and laugh

537
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,000
and then you don't want to cry anymore

538
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,240
Even when you're with others

539
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,040
you put up a shell

540
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,920
You're not really a chatterbox

541
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,080
Smiling is my shield

542
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:25,480
Picking at the cup

543
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,080
You can do it today too

544
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,000
There's a cup here

545
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,440
The cup's almost ruined from picking

546
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,160
What surprise did you prepare?

547
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,640
The little lamb is so cute

548
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,360
This really hits me

549
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,000
Really?

550
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I used to be

551
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,320
maybe just like Xiaoyuan

552
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,680
like a little hedgehog

553
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,760
with spikes

554
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,000
It's also a way to protect myself

555
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,280
If back then

556
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,040
someone could have told me

557
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,440
"Don't be a hedgehog anymore"

558
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:04,920
You can

559
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,600
show more of your softer side

560
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,280
in front of me

561
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,480
I think that's really healing

562
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,000
It really touches me

563
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,280
It would really move me

564
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,800
Ruilong

565
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,880
They're doing pottery

566
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,120
Ruilong is really funny

567
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,520
He's the comic relief

568
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,560
He asked the girls to help him tie it first

569
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,360
Ruilong is really like a kid

570
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,560
Ruilong is so pure

571
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,080
I feel like

572
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,640
he's really pure

573
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,240
So innocent

574
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,800
He still remembers

575
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,960
He pays a lot of attention to Duoduo

576
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,840
Ruilong is actually super attentive

577
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,280
He starts off as an observer

578
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,920
noticing lots of details

579
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,640
He's actually very clear about things inside

580
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,720
And when he's more certain

581
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,560
he might

582
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,680
take some action

583
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,480
Now he's starting to show his skills

584
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,560
He's got some real skills

585
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,960
He's talented

586
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,000
Compared to his appearance

587
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,440
it's a big contrast

588
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,520
Like last time when he did magic

589
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,560
He's got a lot of skills

590
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,640
I think that's pretty good

591
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,440
Yeah, the vibe here is starting to

592
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,600
feel a bit different from before

593
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,360
There's a bit of a vibe now

594
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,640
Come on

595
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,960
Cheers

596
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,600
Skiing

597
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,600
Skiing is great

598
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,120
Skiing is awesome

599
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,560
You have to learn to ski

600
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,720
I forgot

601
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,280
I really forgot

602
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,560
Teach me

603
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,480
It's not that there's no payback, the time just hasn't come yet

604
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,400
Xu Rulan

605
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,400
Careful, Wang Lechen

606
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,280
You still have another date coming up

607
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,200
Jiao Ge really knows how to give emotional support

608
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,120
Is this your first time skiing?

609
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,560
Definitely not

610
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,840
But I've always been a newbie

611
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,920
Maybe skied once or twice

612
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,520
This live demo is pretty

613
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,600
standard

614
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,240
Very standard

615
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,560
Showtime

616
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,640
Next time, I'm not going skiing with him.

617
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,280
Forget it, I can't keep up.

618
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,200
Jiao

619
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,680
He can even do flat tricks.

620
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,440
But Jiao is really good at skiing.

621
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,360
He definitely knows way more than I do.

622
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,360
Next time, I need him to teach me.

623
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,320
Then you should tell him,

624
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,360
"I don't know how, teach me."

625
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,600
Jiao, teach me, please.

626
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,040
The only thing I can't learn is your look.

627
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,600
Honestly, your interaction

628
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,760
is way better than ours.

629
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,200
And it also exposed

630
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,680
how uncoordinated I am.

631
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,680
Don't be nervous, Jiao.

632
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,560
Wishing you wealth!

633
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:01,800
How come you two

634
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,040
started shipping each other?

635
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,520
It hurts, I'm telling you.

636
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,360
This is real shipping.

637
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,440
Here we go, noting it down again.

638
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,440
Gotta note it down again.

639
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,480
I'm going after her.

640
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,360
I'm going after her.

641
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,200
Start noting.

642
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,360
Next time, bring matcha chocolate.

643
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,360
This is fate.

644
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,320
Next time, let's order clams.

645
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,640
Clams.

646
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,000
My face hurts from laughing.

647
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,120
He wants to play piano.

648
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:24,800
Piano?

649
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,160
That was my first thought too.

650
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:35,920
It's snowing.

651
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,360
Making snow.

652
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,720
Because it was midsummer then,

653
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,240
Basically, it means that

654
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,680
in the peak of June,

655
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,800
it suddenly snowed.

656
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,560
That was really thoughtful.

657
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,320
Definitely.

658
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,120
Back again.

659
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,600
The first date is over.

660
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,000
Did we freeze up?

661
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,600
You're really considerate.

662
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,080
Of course.

663
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,600
I just don't want others to feel awkward.

664
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,040
You're good at seizing opportunities.

665
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,120
As precise as a scalpel.

666
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,000
But actually, here,

667
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,240
you two really resonate with each other.

668
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,560
Because you both joined later.

669
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,160
It feels like you missed out on something.

670
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,560
Like time spent with everyone else.

671
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,920
So positive, bro.

672
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,920
Don't mess around.

673
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,040
What do you mean by "Is love unconditional?"

674
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,480
I... I want to.

675
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,120
You go ahead.

676
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,160
Come on, please answer.

677
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:36,560
I'm about to "judge" now.

678
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,600
Sharp commentary.

679
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,280
First of all, I think

680
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,000
this is way too early.

681
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,240
You two just started dating.

682
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,920
And then you started asking

683
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,960
And then you started asking

684
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,680
that our relationship

685
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,680
must be equal.

686
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,280
If I choose you firmly,

687
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,320
then you must choose me firmly too.

688
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,520
Isn't this a bit premature?

689
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,480
It really is too soon.

690
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,720
I think, for me personally,

691
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:59,520
I did come in a bit late.

692
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,040
And then,

693
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,720
I did get a bit anxious.

694
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,200
Also, I think

695
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,400
maybe your personality

696
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,160
is just very straightforward,

697
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,160
and a bit impatient.

698
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,880
Maybe emotions just piled up.

699
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,080
After reaching this stage,

700
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,880
you just said it out loud.

701
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,240
Still lacking some

702
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:13,840
thought.

703
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,480
Reflection.

704
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,200
Yeah, that's right.

705
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:15,640
I think your "judgment"

706
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,720
is totally fine.

707
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,520
Do you feel uncomfortable?

708
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,600
I think, in this part,

709
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,120
even I feel uncomfortable with the vibe.

710
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,880
I don't like this way of communicating.

711
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,640
All I can say is,

712
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,960
I think some of your questions

713
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,880
are too deep and serious.

714
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,440
Yeah, it might make the girl

715
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,080
overthink at this point.

716
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,600
She might wonder,

717
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,120
are you, from the start,

718
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,280
already demanding equality?

719
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,480
If I give you this much love,

720
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,680
you have to give me the same amount back.

721
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,520
But actually, every girl

722
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,880
wants to be loved unconditionally.

723
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,400
Of course.

724
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,080
Love, right?

725
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,080
It's impossible to say

726
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,280
we stick to this demand, and then

727
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,880
I start to

728
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,040
measure how much

729
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,920
emotion I should give you.

730
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,280
Actually, that night

731
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,560
I was thinking about this too.

732
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,080
I reflected on it that night.

733
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:24,880
So you think

734
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,520
love doesn't ask for anything in return, right?

735
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,640
I think

736
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,640
when you love her,

737
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,160
you must be unconditional.

738
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,320
No matter what, I love this person.

739
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,560
It's not just boys to girls.

740
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,960
I think girls feel the same about boys.

741
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,800
Because you love her,

742
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,760
you're willing to give for her.

743
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,080
Time and energy.

744
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:40,960
All these feelings.

745
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,920
But these aren't conditions.

746
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,040
It's mutual giving.

747
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:45,880
Yes.

748
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,680
Actually, I think now

749
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,880
when you like someone,

750
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,160
you just want to see her happy.

751
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,880
Not just

752
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,400
waiting for her to give you something back.

753
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,680
Whatever it is.

754
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,240
You're back.

755
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:02,960
You're back.

756
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,680
Why did your hairstyle change?

757
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,640
Why do you look different?

758
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,640
Why does it feel like a different person came back?

759
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,320
Did you race back here?

760
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,280
It starts here.

761
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,160
Now we're just guessing.

762
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,880
You don't trust me, I don't trust you.

763
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,840
The atmosphere is a bit subtle.

764
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,600
It's really hard to guess.

765
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,920
We're just making wild guesses now.

766
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,640
You definitely kept something hidden.

767
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,000
I just didn't expect it.

768
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,680
Actually, I think at this moment,

769
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,160
everyone's vibe should be pretty good.

770
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,240
Everyone is enjoying themselves.

771
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,960
They've already known each other for a while.

772
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,680
Everyone has relaxed now.

773
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,040
Everyone seems natural.

774
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,560
But we can definitely feel

775
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,120
that nice chemistry in between.

776
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,440
Yeah, that feeling of being together.

777
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,120
It's more comfortable and relaxed.

778
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:49,480
Yes.

779
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:49,920
That's right.

780
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,520
Of course, for me,

781
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,720
Now, from a third-person perspective,

782
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,280
and considering some things right now,

783
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:54,920
mentally,

784
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,560
you can see some big issues.

785
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,880
That's also what I've been

786
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,400
focusing on and need to

787
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,880
work through.

788
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:01,920
Work through some things.

789
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,800
Alright, so that's the first day's date.

790
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,200
Really looking forward to what happens next.

791
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,200
Let's look forward to it together.
