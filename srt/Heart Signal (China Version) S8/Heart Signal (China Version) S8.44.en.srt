1
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,360
Guys, we're back again.

2
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,080
Let's start with a quick

3
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,920
self-introduction.

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:25,520
Hello, everyone.

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,600
I'm from Heart Signal

6
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,200
Season 8, Wang Lechen.

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,120
Hello, everyone.

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,040
I'm from Heart Signal Season 8,

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,000
Jin Yuxing.

10
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,320
Hello, everyone.

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,880
I'm from Heart Signal Season 8,

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,960
Lu Yuan.

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,360
Hello, everyone.

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,760
I'm from Heart Signal Season 8,

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,560
Wang Jue.

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,360
Alright.

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,360
You all just saw

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,280
all the guys in the kitchen

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,440
busily

20
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,880
preparing some dishes for the friends and family.

21
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,720
Delicious food.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,320
Some heartwarming dishes.

23
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,040
Alright.

24
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:52,960
As for what comes next,

25
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,480
those of us who've attended the dinner

26
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,520
all know

27
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,720
how exciting it gets later.

28
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,280
Next, let's

29
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,240
look forward to it.

30
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,000
Or not look forward to it.

31
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,520
Sweating bullets.

32
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,720
Let's nervously

33
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,960
watch the second half.

34
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,280
Watching with our heads down.

35
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,280
It's so romantic.

36
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,360
Can't believe you said that.

37
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,960
I was holding a rice cooker at the time.

38
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,520
Then I went downstairs.

39
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,160
This table is really long.

40
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,080
Every corner of the table is

41
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,160
an awkward situation.

42
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,440
The tense moment has arrived.

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,640
Actually, every dinner

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,240
the most thrilling part

45
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:40,840
is the seat selection.

46
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,880
Choosing where to sit.

47
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,360
You all sat down so fast.

48
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,560
Really made it tough for the guys.

49
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,880
It had to be my bro Liu.

50
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,280
I think

51
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,320
Liu Zihan deserves applause.

52
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,280
I think

53
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,080
he's great at managing the scene.

54
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,000
Really knows how to handle things.

55
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,120
The other guys were sweating bullets.

56
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,720
Dr. Fang was so quick.

57
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,000
He took his seat right away.

58
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,040
Decisive, very decisive.

59
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,000
I noticed

60
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,160
the friends and family group

61
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,200
did their homework well.

62
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,000
No,

63
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,720
I asked Yifan at the time,

64
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,680
none of us

65
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,320
talked to our own relatives.

66
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,400
We all just observed on the spot.

67
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,800
Yeah, they were watching live.

68
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,000
Were you disappointed?

69
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,680
Not really.

70
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,720
Maybe we should add another seat in the middle.

71
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,440
Do you feel sitting on the side

72
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,440
makes you feel closer?

73
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,320
Or is sitting across from each other

74
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,720
more intimate?

75
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,520
Or quieter?

76
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,640
Yeah.

77
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,760
I meant the “closer” one.

78
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,800
I thought you meant “peace and quiet.”

79
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,200
Quiet.

80
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,280
Your thought process is so weird.

81
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,240
I was just thinking,

82
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,920
why are you asking this?

83
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,520
There’s a saying that

84
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,880
sitting across from each other

85
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,720
lets two people

86
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,520
keep eye contact the whole time,

87
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,480
which actually makes you feel closer.

88
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,240
It brings people

89
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,400
closer together.

90
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,480
Yeah, but sitting side by side

91
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,040
is definitely even more intimate.

92
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,520
But I think in the beginning,

93
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,520
sitting face to face is better.

94
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,800
Later, when things progress,

95
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,040
sitting side by side is better.

96
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,040
Yeah, it feels more interactive.

97
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,520
I’m so nervous.

98
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,320
It’s starting.

99
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,880
Darn it, it’s starting. Darn it.

100
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,000
These darn memories are coming back.

101
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,640
Thinking about that time now,

102
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,600
do you still get nervous?

103
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,440
I’m really nervous.

104
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,480
Can we pause?

105
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:46,960
So nervous.

106
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,840
I don’t want to watch anymore.

107
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,280
Me neither.

108
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:50,720
No.

109
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:51,640
It’s too nerve-wracking.

110
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:51,920
I think

111
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,200
do you think in this scene

112
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,320
the seating arrangement

113
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,720
would

114
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,240
Didn’t Teacher Haitao say

115
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,040
“I want to sit here”?

116
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,680
“I want to sit here.”

117
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,240
Don’t say it.

118
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,120
Can I watch this on my knees?

119
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,960
This is too intense.

120
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,360
No, absolutely not.

121
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,360
No.

122
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,600
Darn it, it’s even more awkward.

123
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,560
Can I mentally prepare myself first?

124
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,200
Then watch the next part.

125
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,960
I’m starting to sweat bullets.

126
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,200
Here it comes.

127
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,960
What’s wrong with you?

128
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,880
It’s too much.

129
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,960
Why don’t you sit here?

130
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,360
He just asked where it’s convenient to sit.

131
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,360
Sit between me and my mom.

132
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,200
Yeah, it’s convenient to sit here.

133
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,160
Why don’t you sit here?

134
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,440
Or I can switch with you.

135
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,920
Sure, Chef.

136
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,840
Make three dishes.

137
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,200
Have some water to calm your nerves.

138
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,120
Actually, I’m mainly worried

139
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,240
my cooking skills aren’t good enough.

140
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,200
Make a bit more.

141
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,680
Maybe the other person will like it.

142
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,000
Excuse me,

143
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,600
when you made these three dishes,

144
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,840
who were you thinking of?

145
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,760
You’re so “bad.”

146
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,880
I was thinking

147
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,840
about who would eat my food.

148
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,920
That’s exactly what Ruilong said.

149
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,080
What's wrong?

150
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,240
I didn't say anything.

151
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,000
Don't breathe right now.

152
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,960
I don't want to watch.

153
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,560
I don't want to watch anymore.

154
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,600
I didn't say anything.

155
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,560
Breathe again.

156
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm so nervous right now.

157
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,720
Did you eat the curry rice I made?

158
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,720
I didn't get to eat it.

159
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,120
I cooked a big pot.

160
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,200
You didn't eat it?

161
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,440
None of us got to eat it.

162
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,080
You guys were too far away.

163
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,560
Couldn't enjoy it, Xing.

164
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,160
Didn't dare move, not at all.

165
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,280
I could only eat the dishes across from me.

166
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,320
You were just busy eating.

167
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,160
No, I really didn't dare move.

168
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,880
You were just focused on the braised rice, right?

169
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,600
Haitao was always right next to me.

170
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,600
The curry I've had lately doesn't digest well, you know?

171
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,360
Stand up.

172
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,240
Afraid the seat would be gone soon.

173
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,480
Still eating.

174
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,560
Is curry really that good?

175
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,560
I think it's actually pretty good.

176
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,080
Still eating.

177
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:30,800
I'm starving.

178
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,320
Jin Yuxing.

179
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,560
I must've been too hungry then.

180
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,280
So hungry I got low blood sugar.

181
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,400
Can't hear anymore, right?

182
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,160
Dizzy.

183
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,480
Still walked over there.

184
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,480
How's this stir-fried pork with chili?

185
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,760
It should be pretty good too.

186
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,920
You're actually concerned about the taste of the food?

187
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,360
I can't really taste it.

188
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,920
You helped me figure it out.

189
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,800
Chef.

190
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,800
Let's start.

191
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,000
Xing, you're in trouble.

192
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,120
It's starting.

193
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,840
I remember you were

194
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,600
the one who answered the most questions back then.

195
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,040
Kept getting called on.

196
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,640
I didn't even dare pick up my chopsticks then.

197
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,400
Do you want to answer?

198
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,160
Do you want to answer?

199
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,520
Do you want to answer?

200
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,400
Every time you answer,

201
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,640
you stand up.

202
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,640
Sorry.

203
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,880
Don't clap.

204
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,920
I'll clap for you.

205
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,960
Why did you hit me?

206
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,400
Forgot to clap, well said.

207
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,000
That's a very accurate description.

208
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,520
So what do you think you're like?

209
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,680
What do you mean, what am I like?

210
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,760
Describe yourself in three words.

211
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,000
I think what he said is pretty accurate.

212
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,800
Jiao's hands are getting sweaty.

213
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,760
This question is pretty real.

214
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,240
Very direct.

215
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,000
Very direct.

216
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,360
Why does Dr. Fang seem

217
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,440
like he's drinking alone?

218
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,880
Actually, for Dr. Fang,

219
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,080
this is a sharp question.

220
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,400
He raised his hand.

221
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,000
Raise your hand.

222
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,960
The sense of crisis is here.

223
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,520
Why was I shipping the whole time?

224
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,720
Everyone was just watching the drama.

225
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,120
Such a good guy.

226
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,080
This answer really

227
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,480
moved everyone.

228
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,040
I was touched.

229
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,080
It's starting.

230
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,200
The exciting part.

231
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:26,880
That's brutal.

232
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:51,800
Right at this part.

233
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,520
I remember at the time

234
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,160
Yeah, it left a deep impression.

235
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,960
Answered really well.

236
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,640
And very sincere.

237
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,680
Finally, it's over.

238
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,200
This was the toughest part.

239
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,480
I'll ask a question.

240
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,560
I'll ask a question.

241
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,280
Their answers just now

242
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,320
It seems none of you have answered.

243
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:42,840
Is that right?

244
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,720
I did answer.

245
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,720
I didn't see it.

246
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,840
I've already answered.

247
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,120
So if you were asked

248
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,760
to answer again

249
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,560
this kind of question,

250
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,520
what would your answer be?

251
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,360
Which question?

252
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,040
About the current social pressure.

253
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,760
It's so intense.

254
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,000
When you

255
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,640
face some pressure,

256
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,760
how do you relieve stress?

257
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,240
You answer.

258
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,000
Actually, usually

259
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
when I'm under a lot of stress,

260
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,760
I choose to exercise.

261
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,280
I sweat a lot.

262
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,200
With exercise,

263
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,080
it produces dopamine

264
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,640
and endorphins.

265
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,000
At that time, I feel the stress

266
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,480
is greatly reduced.

267
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,480
I agree.

268
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,560
Second,

269
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,680
what kind of

270
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,960
romantic environment

271
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,680
do you hope for?

272
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,600
It's your turn.

273
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,560
I've already answered.

274
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,880
That was my question.

275
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,680
Why is it me again?

276
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:36,920
Alright.

277
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,360
Actually, what I hope for

278
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,200
in a relationship is

279
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,800
equality between both sides,

280
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,800
being able to communicate like friends,

281
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,240
and have open conversations.

282
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,320
But when

283
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,920
real problems arise,

284
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,000
or when facing serious

285
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,960
decisions in life,

286
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,760
I think both people

287
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,040
should be able to sit down

288
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,640
and communicate rationally.

289
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,560
The third question is,

290
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,120
what do you think is most important

291
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,120
in a long-term relationship?

292
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,200
You go.

293
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,960
I'd like to answer too.

294
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:12,960
You first.

295
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,320
Great!

296
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,040
I think in a long-term relationship,

297
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,840
a very important point

298
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,720
is mutual trust.

299
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,840
I think trust

300
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,960
is crucial in a relationship.

301
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,960
It's very important.

302
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,480
In a long-term relationship,

303
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,200
the two need to be in sync.

304
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,920
Also,

305
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,240
the third point is the most important:

306
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,120
goals.

307
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,760
We have a shared goal.

308
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,960
And together,

309
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,680
we work towards it.

310
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,400
I think these three points

311
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,160
are very important.

312
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,440
Alright, looking back just now

313
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,160
at the Q&A part of our dinner,

314
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,480
for us guys,

315
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,160
many questions were very realistic.

316
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,240
They really hit the mark.

317
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,080
Especially

318
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,360
when talking about long-distance relationships

319
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,840
or dealing with

320
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,520
colleagues who lack boundaries,

321
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,000
it definitely causes trouble.

322
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,880
Everyone was very honest.

323
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,200
We all shared our thoughts.

324
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,400
Yeah, this kind of Q&A interaction

325
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,720
really helps both sides

326
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,440
get to know each other quickly.

327
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,760
It also lets the friends and family

328
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,640
learn more about us.

329
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,040
Zi Han

330
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,640
is a very thoughtful person.

331
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,040
Feels like we're in Lanlan's emotional class.

332
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,360
You have no idea, last episode,

333
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,480
Liu Zihan and I

334
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,720
took so many notes.

335
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,440
Really?

336
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,960
All of them were from Lanlan.

337
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:13,800
Golden quotes.

338
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,640
Love lessons.

339
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,760
Just like that.

340
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,440
Smiling is Ruilong's shield.

341
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,160
Actually, the premise of this question is

342
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,320
reversed.

343
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,440
It's the opposite.

344
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,320
For example?

345
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,720
What he actually assumes

346
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,880
is not his own situation,

347
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,640
but the other person's situation.

348
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,240
The title "Little Train Driver"

349
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,120
now belongs to you.

350
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,560
I can't really be called the "Little Train Driver."

351
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,440
At most, I'm just a passenger.

352
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,920
What do you guys do in the room all day?

353
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,720
Doing push-ups,

354
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,120
playing badminton...

355
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,240
Yuxing.

356
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,040
I was really surprised at the time.

357
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,800
Did you know who was driving then?

358
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,520
Did you have a feeling

359
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,360
You probably had an idea.

360
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,240
But I didn't know

361
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,960
that I would be on the little train that day.

362
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,040
So you actually knew

363
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,280
who would be driving?

364
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,960
I probably did.

365
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,000
Just as nervous.

366
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,640
Did you feel any pressure at the time?

367
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,400
Yes, I did.

368
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,760
You walked so neatly.

369
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,440
Hello.

370
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,280
Because I was nervous.

371
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,600
It seemed like no one noticed that day.

372
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,000
Right?

373
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,800
She probably took it pretty late.

374
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,160
I think some things

375
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,200
are better cleared up directly.

376
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,880
Because I don't really like

377
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,000
being misunderstood by others.

378
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,800
Yeah, sometimes I just communicate directly.

379
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,720
It works better that way.

380
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,640
I do appreciate your approach.

381
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,640
I don't want to make things sound too final.

382
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,400
Otherwise,

383
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,080
it might make the other person feel sad.

384
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:21,800
That's true.

385
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,600
Accepting and rejecting

386
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,840
both take a lot of courage.

387
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,720
Yeah.

388
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,480
I think some things

389
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,640
should be made clear.

390
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,320
It's better that way.

391
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,720
Explaining it to her right then

392
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,280
was actually

393
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:32,880
a way for her

394
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,120
to move on more quickly

395
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,440
from the situation.

396
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,680
We've finished watching this part today.

397
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:47,040
It's been a month or two since it ended.

398
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,840
After leaving the house,

399
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,680
how do you all feel now?

400
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,960
When I first entered the house,

401
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,000
I didn't have any expectations.

402
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,800
So with that

403
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,520
low-expectation mindset,

404
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,320
every step after that

405
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,720
was a big surprise.

406
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,440
The people around me

407
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,800
brought me

408
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,640
different experiences.

409
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,440
They all made me happy.

410
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,520
Moved.

411
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,280
I even had a lot of feelings.

412
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,400
Today is my first time watching "Watching Heart Signal with You".

413
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,360
I can also see

414
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,000
what things

415
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,200
I didn't do so well.

416
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,720
If I had another chance,

417
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,080
Heart Signal Season 8 2.0

418
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,920
If I got another chance,

419
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,760
I might still

420
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,320
make the same choices.

421
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,440
Yeah, actually what Xiaoyuan said

422
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,840
I agree with.

423
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,480
I think it also means

424
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,720
I still have a lot of room

425
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,120
to improve myself.

426
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,600
To fix

427
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,400
my shortcomings.

428
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,000
I can learn from their

429
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,880
strengths and good qualities.

430
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,600
For me,

431
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,760
when I entered the house,

432
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,640
I was not used to a lot of things.

433
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,920
I was anxious.

434
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,840
I didn't know what to do.

435
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,800
I'm actually very grateful

436
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,680
for many moments back then

437
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,240
when I was being my true self.

438
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,920
I didn't leave any regrets.

439
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,520
That's right.

440
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,120
Alright, that's it for today's "Watching Heart Signal with You".

441
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,520
We're done here.

442
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,240
Aren't you going to say something?

443
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,520
Aren't you going to share your thoughts?

444
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,680
I've already shared in four episodes, bro.

445
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,200
We didn't hear it.

446
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,040
We didn't hear it.

447
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,440
True.

448
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,760
I've also been

449
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,080
deeply reflecting

450
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,880
on many of my own issues.

451
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,040
Including communication,

452
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,800
and how I express myself.

453
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,520
It's because

454
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,480
after seeing these problems,

455
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,360
you can become a better version of yourself.

456
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:44,000
If you have flaws, fix them; if not, keep improving.

457
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,640
It's really a process of self-analysis

458
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,080
and getting to know yourself better.

459
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:47,960
That's the process.

460
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,160
It was a wonderful summer.

461
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,040
Next is the Pitfall Challenge.

462
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,280
This is our so-called

463
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,240
wish bottle.

464
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,240
Everyone, pick a slip first.

465
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,200
It's a note left by last episode's guests.

466
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,280
Show it.

467
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,560
Open yours.

468
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,560
What did you get?

469
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,640
Hello.

470
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,200
Congrats on picking my card.

471
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,840
Now please post a set of

472
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,960
photos of yourself eating lemons

473
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,520
on your social media.

474
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,360
And remind everyone here

475
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,560
Yuxing.

476
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:19,960
I wrote this.

477
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,440
You wrote it?

478
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,200
Can I invite everyone

479
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,080
to eat lemons together?

480
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,440
Then the four of us

481
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,800
can we take a photo together?

482
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,120
Sure.

483
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,880
You have the right.

484
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,040
Yes.

485
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,600
Mine is—

486
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,160
Zihan wrote this one.

487
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,600
Chance to go skydiving together.

488
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,800
Take photos and post on Xiaohongshu.

489
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,680
Is this a reward?

490
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,240
His is a reward.

491
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,040
Whoever gets this paper

492
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,160
pulls the person next to them

493
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,720
and takes a selfie making the ugliest face.

494
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,960
Send it to me.

495
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:48,680
Lanlan.

496
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,680
Isn't that just the four of us?

497
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,960
Or you can make a silly face alone.

498
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,320
No way.

499
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,360
She said to pull the person next to you.

500
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,160
What did I get?

501
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,400
Chance to invite your friends

502
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,840
and mine too.

503
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,160
Let's all go diving together.

504
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,120
Jiao.

505
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,600
Thanks.

506
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,720
Come on.

507
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,160
Guys.

508
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,600
Let's just

509
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,360
Three, two, one.

510
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,400
Eat together.

511
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,720
Count down, three, two, one.

512
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,640
Why did you eat first?

513
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,920
No, do it again.

514
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,120
How about you do another one?

515
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,640
So sweet.

516
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,840
Saying nonsense with a straight face.

517
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,840
So sweet.

518
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,480
It's really sour.

519
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,000
Eat it.

520
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,600
Do I have to eat this too?

521
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,760
I don't have to eat it, right?

522
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,560
Chew for fifteen seconds.

523
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,560
I didn't write that.

524
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,760
Where did I write fifteen seconds?

525
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,280
I'm coming.

526
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,480
It's okay.

527
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,080
Honestly, it's not bad.

528
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,200
Impressive.

529
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,920
No ugly photos at all.

530
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,280
Because it's actually fine.

531
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:04,840
Try it.

532
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,960
Okay.

533
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,640
Wait, I'll eat again.

534
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,680
Why did you take it out again?

535
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,560
Taking it out is a bit much.

536
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,040
Eat again.

537
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,400
Next up is the Pitfall Challenge.

538
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,280
I can't even think of

539
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,160
any more tricks to play.

540
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:29,680
Be careful.

541
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,120
You might be the next to draw.

542
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,200
Not necessarily.

543
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,000
Dear friend,

544
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,080
congratulations on drawing this card.

545
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,720
Please accept my roller coaster challenge.

546
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,400
Record a video with me.

547
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,040
Jue,

548
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,080
congratulations on drawing this card.

549
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,480
Xiaoyuan's task is here.

550
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,080
Make a vlog about you coming to hang out with me.

551
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,120
A happy day video log.

552
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,400
And post it on social media.

553
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,000
Remember to remind me.

554
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,720
Congrats, you're about to unlock

555
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,200
a new life experience.

556
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,240
Now please eat

557
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,800
a date and a banana together.

558
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,000
Then share this new flavor

559
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,360
with the people around you.

560
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,960
Join Jue's roller coaster.

561
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,840
Bring Jin Yuxing and Lu Yuan,

562
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,680
and me,

563
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,840
or any other friends nearby.

564
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,040
Alright, so today we'll

565
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,560
wrap things up happily.

566
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,040
Let's take a group photo

567
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,360
with the instant camera, okay?

568
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,120
Watching Heart Signal with you, the excitement never ends.

569
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,800
See you next time.

570
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,320
Bye-bye.
