1
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,560
Surfing now.

2
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,640
Life needs that one brave step.

3
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,640
Just like a family of three.

4
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,160
Yeah.

5
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,000
Careful.

6
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,640
It's hard to remember every single day.

7
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,320
Today I'm a happy kid.

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,400
So sweet.

9
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,600
Welcome to my turf.

10
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,440
This is so fun.

11
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,920
Today I fulfilled

12
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,800
a little dream I always wanted.

13
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,280
So much fun.

14
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,200
So sweet.

15
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,680
A princess carry in the air.

16
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,360
I'm a strong person.

17
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,080
But sometimes you don't have to be so strong.

18
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,280
Then next time I'll come to you and cry.

19
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,760
I can't take it anymore.

20
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,000
I've never seen Initial D.

21
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,760
What's Initial D?

22
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,640
Generation gap.

23
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,080
I'll go home and do my homework tonight, okay?

24
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,280
I'm glad you like it.

25
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,200
Today was really happy.

26
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,280
I just want to smile when I see you.

27
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,480
Do I look that funny?

28
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,600
Not funny.

29
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,760
You're good-looking.

30
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,040
See, did I miss more times

31
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,440
or did you miss more times?

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,360
Sure.

33
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,800
How does it feel to lose?

34
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,080
Ride the mini-train with me.

35
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,760
We played it safe.

36
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,600
Every time you

37
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,400
hit the spot where I jump.

38
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,200
Smooth sailing.

39
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,600
Everything goes well.

40
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,720

80
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,960
It's another week.

81
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,480
I really feel like

82
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,920
after my first time here,

83
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,880
I couldn't sleep well.

84
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,600
I think there's an "occupational hazard" here.

85
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,560
I'm always thinking about him and her,

86
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,160
or him and her.

87
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,840
He loves her.

88
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,520
He loves her.

89
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,800
But she doesn't love him.

90
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,280
But he still loves her.

91
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,760
Last night I kept singing a song.

92
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,480
It's David Tao's "Love Me or Him."

93
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,440
So next,

94
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,720
let's do a quick recap.

95
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,160
Which moments

96
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,680
made us feel

97
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,480
truly unforgettable?

98
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,560
Jiao

99
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,280
made it snow in summer.

100
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,640
Like Dr. Fang

101
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,160
and our Lanlan,

102
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,560
the two of them

103
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,400
are already getting close.

104
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,160
I think

105
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:49,240
I think

106
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,360
the motorcycle scene

107
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,280
that moment

108
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:53,800
really was

109
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,520
just

110
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,120
stuck in our minds.

111
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,480
It replayed for at least three nights.

112
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,480
That was so romantic.

113
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,240
What about you?

114
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,680
For me, it's Lechen and

115
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,840
For me, it's Lechen and

116
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,360
Duoduo.

117
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,880
With Duoduo, I just feel

118
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,440
why worry about

119
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,840
things that

120
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,480
aren't even problems?

121
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,960
It's like they're trying to prevent arguments.

122
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,520
We might

123
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,800
never face those issues.

124
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,320
Why assume them in advance?

125
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,400
I think it's such a pity.

126
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,840
Their argument

127
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,000
made me feel like

128
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,440
maybe

129
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,320
having a crush

130
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,600
and being a good match might really be

131
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,440
two different things.

132
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,240
Yeah.

133
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,160
But with Chi Chi,

134
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,000
I think there's more suspense.

135
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,480
Chi Chi and Yu Xing,

136
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,120
and Chi Chi with Zihan,

137
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,560
their group seems

138
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,560
the least predictable.

139
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,640
It's the hardest to tell.

140
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,000
Last week's date

141
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,880
really was

142
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,280
like a roller coaster.

143
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,160
The whole date

144
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,760
process

145
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,440
had its ups and downs.

146
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,680
It felt like a real emotional ride.

147
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,800
This week's story

148
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,120
is about to begin.

149
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,840
Let's see what

150
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,560
Heartbeat Apartment

151
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,680
will bring

152
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,720
inspiring new stories.

153
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,960
Looking forward to it.

154
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,920
Are you making a soup?

155
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,280
Yeah, just a soup and that's it.

156
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,120
Are you following a recipe on the spot?

157
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,000
I never memorized any recipes.

158
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,880
I just cook based on what we have.

159
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,360
You're a natural talent.

160
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,000
Really?

161
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,360
Yeah.

162
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,120
You're putting pressure on me.

163
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,320
I'll make a stew later.

164
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,640
I'll stir-fry some green beans.

165
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,240
Alright.

166
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,640
Have you ever ridden the mini-train?

167
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,600
No.

168
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,720
How about we go check it out now?

169
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,000
Chi Chi.

170
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,200
Hi.

171
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,480
Hello.

172
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,520
Did you just get back?

173
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,240
Yeah.

174
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:40,880
Them.

175
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,600
Us, them.

176
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,880
Herry is cooking.

177
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,880
He made Mapo Tofu again.

178
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,440
Smells so good.

179
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,800
Did you eat yet?

180
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,400
No.

181
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:48,920
You haven't?

182
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,680
Did you guys eat?

183
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,120
Not yet.

184
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,720
No.

185
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,680
Then let's go first.

186
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,840
So you came down to

187
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,960
welcome you.

188
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,440
That's really great.

189
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,720
You can open the kitchen door over there now.

190
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,800
Can I open it?

191
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,160
Yes, you can.

192
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,000
Who came back?

193
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,240
Take a guess.

194
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,200
Chi Chi.

195
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,400
Did you hear that?

196
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,120
I didn't hear.

197
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,840
Is it Chi Chi?

198
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,200
Yeah.

199
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,680
Chi Chi.

200
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,560
What's up?

201
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,160
Look at that expression.

202
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,560
Did they open the door over there?

203
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,640
Yeah, it's open.

204
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,360
I want to learn how to make egg rolls.

205
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,600
Okay.

206
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,440
We're making Tom Yum soup.

207
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,200
I want some.

208
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,080
No problem.

209
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,920
I want some.

210
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,640
No problem.

211
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,240
It'll be ready soon.

212
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,280
What?

213
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,640
Then I'll go cook over there.

214
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,600
Feels like the vibe is a bit off.

215
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,480
Seems like the mood from last time in the car is still here.

216
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,360
You guys have nothing to eat tonight.

217
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,040
We'll send some food over from our side.

218
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,280
No way, we really have nothing.

219
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,160
There's no one on your side now.

220
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,720
Really?

221
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,400
Yeah.

222
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,280
I just opened it, didn't I?

223
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,480
Yeah, just opened the door.

224
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,720
Yeah, you're the first to open it over there, babe.

225
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,160
Here comes someone useless.

226
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,880
No need to look back.

227
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,760
No.

228
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,480
Can you chop vegetables?

229
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,680
I can.

230
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,840
Then you can

231
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,480
Just

232
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,280
go over there and cut this into

233
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,000
Strips, right?

234
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,880
Put it in the soup.

235
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,440
Half for each person.

236
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,280
Cut into strips.

237
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:34,840
Yeah.

238
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,880
Just

239
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,160
Because the cutting board here

240
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:38,720
Or never mind.

241
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,120
I'll cut this first.

242
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,160
Then do the other thing.

243
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,840
It's fine, I can go cut it over there too.

244
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,320
It's okay.

245
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,520
I'll cut this first.

246
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,840
I can slice the salmon.

247
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,400
Let me do it.

248
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,120
Thick slices—do you prefer thick or thin?

249
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,120
Thick.

250
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,880
Thick slices.

251
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,680
Alright, let's do that.

252
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,320
You went to work today.

253
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,160
How did you know?

254
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,320
You told me today.

255
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,200
Who told you?

256
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,280
You did.

257
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,160
I told you?

258
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,000
I’m going back to Yiwu today.

259
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,720
Yeah.

260
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,600
You forgot, didn’t you?

261
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,920
I said Tuesday or Wednesday back then.

262
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,080
No.

263
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,440
No, I clearly said the ninth.

264
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,240
Right.

265
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,720
Okay, so that’s it.

266
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,120
You remembered wrong.

267
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,440
No, I didn’t.

268
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,440
It’s my own schedule.

269
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,200
How could I get it wrong?

270
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,720
You’re kind of funny.

271
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,560
Their vibe is totally different.

272
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,120
So when did you get back?

273
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,920
I got back about fifteen minutes before you.

274
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,800
Hi, everyone.

275
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,520
Ruilong’s here.

276
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,160
Hello.

277
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,840
You guys can...

278
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,640
What are you doing?

279
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:52,920
Salmon.

280
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,720
Salmon, yeah.

281
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,680
You can take it over.

282
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,120
Okay.

283
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:56,960
Seasoning.

284
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,840
Yes.

285
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,200
I’ll get it later.

286
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,160
Let me check how to make the omelette first.

287
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,960
Ruilong is making tamagoyaki again.

288
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,920
How many eggs do you usually use?

289
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,160
Three eggs.

290
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,840
Then beat them.

291
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,520
Whisk them.

292
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,400
What do you add next?

293
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,440
Your secret seasoning.

294
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,000
Right.

295
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,160
Hello.

296
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,640
You haven’t eaten yet?

297
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,080
No.

298
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,040
Not yet.

299
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,280
Perfect timing.

300
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,400
I brought fish too.

301
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,320
What kind?

302
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:35,840
Perch.

303
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,160
What do you mean?

304
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,080
Really? What else can you make?

305
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,360
I really want to order.

306
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,320
I don’t know.

307
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,080
You go first.

308
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,080
Let’s see what I can refuse.

309
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,080
Fish.

310
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,280
What kind?

311
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:48,720
Perch.

312
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,800
He noted it down.

313
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:53,800
How do you cook it?

314
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,280
That fish.

315
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,400
Steamed.

316
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,560
Raw.

317
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,120
Raw.

318
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,160
That works too.

319
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,440
You ordered the fish, you chop it.

320
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,120
I can’t.

321
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,480
Aren’t you good at helping out?

322
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:05,960
Alright.

323
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,600
I’ll chop it.

324
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,680
I thought you meant I’d cook it.

325
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,800
You don’t even need my help for this.

326
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,480
Don’t you wash things pretty well?

327
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,440
Then just watch from the side.

328
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:23,960
Cheer me on.

329
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,560
Go for it!

330
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,280
Sounds like a couple talking.

331
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,640
If it’s too hard, just steam the whole fish.

332
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,320
Steaming is fine too.

333
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:33,920
How do you want to cook it?

334
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,480
Braised.

335
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,080
Then just steam the whole fish.

336
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,160
I’ll get you a plate.

337
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,000
There’s one here.

338
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,200
There’s a big one over there.

339
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,480
Because it’s the middle part.

340
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,040
I’ve already peeled off the outside.

341
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,200
No, you need to peel this.

342
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,520
Show it to Lechen.

343
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,320
The inside looks a bit like the outside.

344
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,360
Just pick out the good parts.

345
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,000
Yeah, just pick out the good ones.

346
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,200
Can I give it a try?

347
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,160
Sure.

348
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,080
I’ll go over there.

349
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,080
Impressive.

350
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,160
You need to pay attention to this.

351
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,200
When it finishes rolling to the edge,

352
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,560
you can lift it up and wrap it in.

353
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,440
I know.

354
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,480
Right.

355
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,560
You can try it.

356
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,920
Then you can lift it up.

357
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,840
Hello, everyone.

358
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,200
Hi.

359
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,600
Smells so good.

360
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,560
What are we making?

361
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,240
We’re learning Rui Long’s egg rolls.

362
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,280
Do you want to try?

363
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,880
Rui Long’s mini class.

364
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,240
Egg roll.

365
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,480
Staring.

366
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,280
That look.

367
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,600
Very direct.

368
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,640
Xiao Yuan, do you want to try one?

369
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,720
I’ll give it a shot.

370
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,480
Go ahead.

371
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,360
Okay.

372
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,400
Put it in first.

373
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,640
Lift up the egg.

374
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,000
Lift the egg.

375
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,400
Lift this egg.

376
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,360
Yes, lift it.

377
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,720
So it can go underneath.

378
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,120
Got it.

379
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,640
Thank you, Teacher Rui.

380
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,920
Duo Duo is here.

381
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,360
Egg roll?

382
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,080
Yes.

383
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,040
Alright.

384
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,920
Next time, roll it in.

385
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,280
Okay.

386
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,400
Is Duo Duo watching Le Chen?

387
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,520
Yes.

388
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,720
This needs to be filled.

389
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,320
That’s right.

390
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,000
Yes.

391
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,400
Let me handle this.

392
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,000
Finish the last layer.

393
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,720
Okay.

394
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,720
This one’s done.

395
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,280
Wang Jue, go try it.

396
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,880
I’ll give it a try.

397
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,680
Yes, you try it.

398
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,880
Alright, I’ll try.

399
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,680
Next.

400
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,280
Let’s line up to try this.

401
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,520
How’s it going?

402
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,360
Still ended up in pieces.

403
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,360
Are you making braised or steamed?

404
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,360
Steamed.

405
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,200
Alright.

406
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,040
Did you try?

407
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,560
What?

408
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,240
This one.

409
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:08,960
No.

410
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,960
Let’s line up and try.

411
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,560
Braised is fine too.

412
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,240
Do you like braised?

413
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:15,920
I eat steamed.

414
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,520
Me.

415
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
No picking, just steamed.

416
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,320
No picking, it’s steamed.

417
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,360
You don’t know how to braise, right?

418
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,000
I do.

419
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,280
Steamed.

420
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:24,920
Steamed tastes good.

421
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,560
Are we eating together?

422
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,520
That works.

423
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,360
What are we making?

424
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,080
Green pepper fish head?

425
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,440
Sashimi.

426
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,880
Sashimi.

427
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,080
So good at hiding your skills.

428
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,080
Duo Duo still cares a lot.

429
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,720
Just like Duo Duo said before,

430
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,400
if you don’t

431
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,880
clearly say no to me,

432
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,800
I won’t let go.

433
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,120
That’s her personality.

434
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,360
It's ready, let's eat together.

435
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,960
Food tastes better when we eat together.

436
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,440
Yeah, it's tastier with more people.

437
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,000
Bring the rice over.

438
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,960
Should I carry the rice over?

439
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,760
Take this.

440
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,600
I'll carry this then.

441
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,240
It's hot.

442
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,680
It's a bit heavy.

443
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,480
Let's go over there.

444
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,640
Looks like they're almost done over there.

445
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,760
Put it in the middle.

446
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,560
Here.

447
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,560
Liu Zihan, teacher.

448
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,600
Piece of cake.

449
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,160
Your other three dishes

450
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,800
look a bit overshadowed now.

451
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,120
They're kind of losing their shine.

452
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,160
True.

453
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,680
Here.

454
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,480
Looks amazing.

455
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,080
I should really take photos with my phone every day.

456
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,720
Use a bowl for the soup.

457
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,080
Sure.

458
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,320
Hand it to me.

459
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,560
I'll give each of you a little.

460
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,720
Let me do it.

461
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,320
Uh...

462
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,160
You sit down.

463
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,760
Okay.

464
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,240
Let me do something.

465
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,320
Otherwise, I really have nothing to do.

466
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,240
Alright.

467
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,240
It's rare for me to cook.

468
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,400
Show some support.

469
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,640
That's true.

470
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,320
This...

471
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,280
I put my whole heart into this.

472
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,720
Used everything I had in the fridge.

473
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,080
Let the chef try it first.

474
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,160
Eat.

475
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,480
I want corn and luncheon meat.

476
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:30,920
Corn.

477
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,480
Sit here.

478
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,760
Sit way over on the edge.

479
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,240
I want to eat but I also don't.

480
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,200
Just a little rice.

481
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,480
Mixing Mapo tofu again.

482
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,840
Is the fish ready?

483
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,480
The fish is ready.

484
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,440
Time to add another dish.

485
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,240
This fish—

486
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,640
The grand finale is always the best.

487
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,320
It looks great.

488
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,600
Try it.

489
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,280
At this moment, Duoduo still doesn’t know

490
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,800
the bass was ordered by Lu Yuan.

491
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:19,880
It’s so delicious.

492
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,600
This is really my first time making bass.

493
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,160
Tastes good.

494
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,280
He made the fish for Lu Yuan.

495
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,960
The first time is always the tastiest.

496
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,320
This fish tastes like fish.

497
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:41,840
Right?

498
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,560
Very fresh.

499
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,040
Your compliment just now was so genuine.

500
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,240
Full of warmth, one hundred percent.

501
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,040
It’s not about saying it tastes good.

502
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,120
It’s like saying this chicken tastes like chicken.

503
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:53,920
Does this fish taste like fish?

504
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,800
Then this beef is pretty beefy too.

505
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,680
Nice, dinner and a comedy show.

506
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,080
Let’s go.

507
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,440
Their romantic dinner is a prize from the sports event.

508
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:09,880
Yeah.

509
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,200
Another rainy day walk, my favorite.

510
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,680
So you’re in a good mood today.

511
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,840
The air after the rain is so fresh.

512
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,640
Don’t you think?

513
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,640
Take a few more breaths.

514
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,760
Once we walk out this road,

515
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,880
outside should be

516
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,640
pretty nice too.

517
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,320
It’s quite close.

518
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:31,800
Yeah.

519
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,560
We’ll be there as soon as we step out.

520
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,760
They must be enjoying their meal.

521
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,280
Yeah.

522
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,040
This is so cute.

523
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,280
Nicole, who put that little clip on you?

524
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,440
Cute.

525
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,360
So cute.

526
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,160
Little strawberry.

527
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,640
The four of them are having so much fun.

528
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,400
They’re really enjoying the food.

529
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,480
Hello.

530
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,280
You four actually came back.

531
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:03,880
We’re full.

532
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,720
Full.

533
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,680
Why are there only three?

534
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,200
Where’s Jiao Ge?

535
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,320
He’s moving.

536
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,800
Moving.

537
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,560
Where’s Xiao Jiao moving to?

538
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,800
So let’s do this.

539
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,600
What’s this?

540
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,560
That’s the room swap card.

541
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,880
Room change privilege card.

542
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,440
I don’t want it.

543
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,760
My sleep quality won’t let me switch.

544
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,840
I need to be on the second floor.

545
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,120
Thanks.

546
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,120
So Xiao Jiao can move over.

547
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,920
Because they’re all on the second floor.

548
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,240
Xiao Jiao isn’t there.

549
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,520
Moving.

550
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,720
He’s coming to join you.

551
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,960
He’s joining you now.

552
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,640
Great roommate.

553
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,600
You’ve got a roommate now.

554
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,760
Ruilong, you’ll be living alone.

555
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,800
I’ll be living alone.

556
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,280
I want to go check on him.

557
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,560
Before he leaves,

558
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,480
The friendships in the house are really strong.

559
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,320
Back.

560
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,600
Ruilong.

561
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,400
How’s it going?

562
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:12,880
Let’s chat.

563
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,240
Maybe we should

564
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,520
have a final talk.

565
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,520
Chat a bit.

566
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,120
I’ve made up my mind today.

567
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,280
I’m purposely leaving some things behind.

568
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,080
Then I’ll come move a bit each day.

569
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,680
He’s so funny.

570
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,880
I’m really a bit reluctant.

571
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,920
Heard you’re moving.

572
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,680
Packing up.

573
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,080
So what’s that about?

574
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,800
It’s for you to pick a room, right?

575
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,560
Yeah.

576
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,800
Take your luggage up first.

577
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,200
Go check out your bed.

578
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,320
He’s helping him carry it.

579
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,400
You can take a look around.

580
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,360
He’s welcoming him.

581
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,280
Thank you.

582
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:55,960
Come on.

583
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,840
Welcome to your new home.

584
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,480
It’s all about fate, right?

585
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,560
The one from the dinner.

586
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,120
Did we meet too late, or just in time?

587
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,640
Didn’t expect that.

588
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,400
Really didn’t expect it.

589
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,920
How do you feel about this side?

590
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,640
At least now I understand how I feel.

591
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,440
Yeah, it really can only...

592
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,520
It’s just a feeling.

593
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,720
It really is.

594
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,480
You only realize after experiencing it.

595
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,120
Isn’t that a good thing for you?

596
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,840
I’m starting to feel something.

597
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,440
It should be Lu Yuan.

598
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,440
Lu Yuan.

599
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,480
That’s right.

600
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,120
Is he going to write today’s little card?

601
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,960
The little gift he gives every day.

602
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,640
Pure Love Warrior.

603
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,280
No.

604
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,040
You...

605
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,200
You can’t look at this.

606
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:01,920
That thing...

607
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,520
This is a remote control.

608
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,160
Remote for what?

609
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,720
It was that day...

610
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,640
A gift I prepared.

611
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,240
Yeah, that day.

612
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,360
Prepared one that day.

613
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,320
A gift for her.

614
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,000
During dinner.

615
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
It can be controlled remotely.

616
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,840
I set up a snow machine outside.

617
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,760
Making snow.

618
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,920
And it’s remote-controlled.

619
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,640
His expression.

620
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,480
He made a snow machine for her.

621
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:27,360
Yeah.

622
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,120
Park.

623
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,680
Outside the dining window.

624
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,680
Don’t laugh at me.

625
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,640
I’m not laughing, you’re just so romantic.

626
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,960
Alright, I need to hurry.

627
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:44,760
Are you giving it now?

628
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,760
Or later?

629
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,280
Now.

630
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:50,720
It’s close by.

631
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,680
The good thing is, he can give it first.

632
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,320
Hello.

633
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,320
I was just about to open the door.

634
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,480
I heard something outside.

635
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,800
Do you want to go out?

636
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,880
No, I’m just alone.

637
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,040
And you’re all in pairs.

638
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,320
I heard something outside and thought...

639
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:03,920
Yeah.

640
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,200
Now, on this floor,

641
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,080
everyone’s paired up.

642
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,640
This is for you.

643
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,640
Thank you.

644
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,160
I’m so happy.

645
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,520
Every night,

646
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,160
It’s mainly for her.

647
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,480
I give her snacks and stuff.

648
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,480
I worry she’s not eating enough.

649
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,880
I’ve learned something.

650
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,320
Learned a lot.

651
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,280
He really is...

652
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,560
It’s rare in this day and age.

653
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,440
Very uncommon.

654
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,440
Really rare.

655
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,400
To have such determination.

656
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,640
He’ll succeed at anything.

657
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,200
Yeah.

658
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,480
I’m coming in.

659
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,480
Okay.

660
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,600
I brought you Kang Shifu Jasmine Tea.

661
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,520
Low sugar.

662
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,800
Take a sip and relax.

663
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,360
Thanks.

664
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,800
I was just looking for something to drink.

665
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,840
Jasmine fragrance mixed with subtle tea aroma

666
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,880
Refreshing and soothing, really delicious

667
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,600
Take a sip

668
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,200
You instantly feel more relaxed

669
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,920
Let’s go work out in a bit

670
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,600
Soon

671
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,400
Okay

672
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,760
I want to check something

673
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,000
Check the wheel

674
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,000
Chi Chi’s

675
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,160
Chi Chi’s key was taken

676
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:18,680
Who?

677
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,520
It should be Zihan

678
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:20,840
Yeah

679
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,120
Zihan came back the earliest

680
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,640
Was it Zihan or

681
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,600
Yu Xing?

682
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,640
I think it’s Zihan

683
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,000
Because Zihan seems like

684
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,280
the type to do this

685
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,160
Right

686
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,680
By the way, let me ask

687
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,080
I found a secret

688
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,720
So it’s you, right?

689
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:42,840
So it must be Zihan

690
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,200
Yu Xing, did you see

691
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,600
who took the card?

692
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,040
I didn’t see

693
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,960
Yu Xing really seems clueless

694
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,200
What thing?

695
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:50,880
The key

696
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,480
What key?

697
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,320
It’s not him either

698
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,160
When?

699
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,520
Chi Chi’s key

700
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,440
You didn’t open it

701
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,240
And you don’t know who took it

702
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,080
This is so suspenseful

703
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,120
Who is it?

704
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,080
Probably Herry (Liu Zihan)

705
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,080
Who is it, really?

706
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,520
This is tough

707
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,600
I think it’s Zihan

708
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,400
I trust my first instinct

709
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,120
Herry (Liu Zihan)

710
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,480
I think it’s Yu Xing

711
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,400
Why, Xu Ge?

712
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,400
Why are you so sure it’s Yu Xing?

713
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,320
I don’t know, just a feeling

714
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,200
Just a hunch

715
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,760
It has to be Zihan

716
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,880
Because Yu Xing isn’t that proactive

717
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,640
If it’s Yu Xing

718
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,640
That would be a huge surprise

719
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,760
That would be wild

720
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,080
Here they come

721
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,000
They’re here

722
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,200
Time for the mini-train ride

723
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,560
Will I get lost?

724
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,880
I’m a bit scared I’ll get lost

725
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,760
Bye

726
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,240
Bye

727
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,160
Hurry up and go

728
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,040
I really want to know who it is

729
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,840
It should be Zihan

730
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,080
It must be Zihan

731
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,080
He still needs to make up for something

732
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,840
So you’re the one who took it

733
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,200
Who is it, really?

734
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,640
Who?

735
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,440
Herry (Liu Zihan)

736
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,080
It has to be him no matter what

737
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,640
I hope it’s him (Zihan)

738
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,400
Yu Xing

739
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,400
Please

740
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,400
Yu Xing

741
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,320
I want to applaud Yu Xing

742
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,320
He’s awesome

743
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,120
Chi Chi is about to go crazy with happiness

744
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,240
So you’re the one who took it

745
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,320
So happy

746
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,560
So you didn’t expect it was me, right?

747
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,840
I really didn’t expect that

748
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,760
Impressive

749
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,000
Happy

750
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,640
When did you

751
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,040
I took it when I got back today

752
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,160
Yeah, I grabbed it as soon as I got off the car

753
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,920
Great job, Yu Xing

754
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,520
Action!

755
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,760
It's really hard to imagine.

756
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,920
It's truly hard to imagine.

757
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,200
He actually managed to adjust his frequency like he said.

758
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,840
He said he wanted to make adjustments.

759
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,640
He wanted to speed up.

760
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,000
Or I think he

761
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,720
could sense Chi Chi's confusion.

762
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,040
Yeah.

763
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,720
So should I prepare anything?

764
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,480
Should I bring some water?

765
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:23,960
Do we need water?

766
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,720
Should I bring some water?

767
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,560
Maybe.

768
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,680
Is there anything else we might need?

769
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,080
There are quite a lot of mosquitoes over there.

770
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,160
There are a lot of mosquitoes.

771
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:29,960
Lots of mosquitoes.

772
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:30,960
Plenty of mosquitoes.

773
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,160
Should I give her something then?

774
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,480
I'll take a bottle of this for her first.

775
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:33,800
I'll bring her a bottle of this.

776
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,960
But she won't get bitten by mosquitoes.

777
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,720
I'll be the one getting bitten.

778
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,680
He's just too cute.

779
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,040
But very thoughtful.

780
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,680
Do you have a small bottle of that stuff?

781
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,680
That mosquito repellent.

782
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,040
Can I borrow it for a bit?

783
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,440
Yeah.

784
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,480
Let me borrow it first.

785
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,240
I'll bring it to spray for her.

786
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,480
Because I think

787
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,520
they all seemed to have it at first.

788
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,880
They deliberately kept everyone in the dark.

789
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,040
So I think I should

790
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,400
play along too.

791
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,520
So you got tricked.

792
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,160
Yeah, totally tricked.

793
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,520
Heartbeat mini-train.

794
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,320
This is really heart-fluttering.

795
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,960
Finally got to ride it.

796
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,080
I think Chi Chi can feel it too.

797
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,400
(Yu Xing) was very clear for the first time.

798
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,720
Yeah.

799
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,000
Happy.

800
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,200
Look how happy she is.

801
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,760
Just holding hands directly.

802
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,680
I really didn't expect it.

803
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,640
I truly didn't expect it.

804
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,880
You didn't show any sign today.

805
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,160
that could be noticed.

806
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,640
Really?

807
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:53,880
Yeah.

808
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,680
So it's

809
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,000
Is that a surprise?

810
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,920
Or

811
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,040
Or were you a bit startled?

812
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,400
It was quite a surprise.

813
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,120
I noticed it.

814
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,240
You can't hide the look in your eyes when you like someone.

815
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,200
It's true.

816
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,320
So caring.

817
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,880
Because I think what you said yesterday

818
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,000
wasn't really

819
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,680
a lot, right?

820
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,240
Not much.

821
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:20,800
Yeah.

822
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,840
I feel like

823
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,360
I didn't even get to know

824
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,920
one percent of you.

825
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,640
Yeah, I wasn't in a great state last night.

826
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,720
So I wanted to have this chance

827
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,160
to get to know you better.

828
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,200
Yu Xing is great.

829
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,000
I think you're a pretty calm person.

830
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,920
But then you said

831
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,760
you're not that calm.

832
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,760
You're actually intense.

833
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,600
I'm super intense.

834
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,200
But you didn't say why you're intense.

835
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,720
Then I asked you why.

836
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,520
And then you just

837
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,920
went silent, and

838
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,440
said, "I'm just intense."

839
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,840
You didn't give a reason.

840
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,360
You just didn't.

841
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,440
Just...

842
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,920
It's about energy, I guess.

843
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,560
Maybe I just

844
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,040
can do a lot in one day.

845
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,680
I don't know how intense you really are.

846
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,520
But

847
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,360
You're pretty stubborn.

848
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:15,960
Why?

849
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,280
How am I stubborn?

850
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,680
No, I'm just joking.

851
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,000
I just think you act tough sometimes.

852
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,720
Sometimes you're slow to realize things.

853
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,560
I'm so happy.

854
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,640
So who did you originally think

855
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,800
would open your Heartbeat Message?

856
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,560
I don't know.

857
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,560
Yu Xing has never asked so many questions before.

858
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,320
Yeah.

859
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,120
I only found out later.

860
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,040
I really want to

861
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,440
play badminton with you.

862
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,000
He's inviting you.

863
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,920
I haven't picked up a racket in two years.

864
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,840
Yeah, you can try it out.

865
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,680
See if the racket suits you.

866
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,920
I haven't put the grip tape on yet.

867
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,400
Do you know how to wrap grip tape?

868
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,480
I do.

869
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,040
Yeah.

870
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,000
That's impressive.

871
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,480
I'll do it for you.

872
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,160
I'll show you.

873
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,320
When I compliment you,

874
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,160
you get really happy.

875
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,720
Yeah.

876
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,040
Chi Chi is already

877
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,600
acting like a girl in love.

878
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,200
She's been smiling since she got in the car.

879
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,080
Smiling nonstop.

880
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,240
She’s kind of smitten.

881
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,960
I want to ask you something.

882
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,200
Can you still eat?

883
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,120
I'm asking.

884
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,560
No.

885
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,760
We have to find a court.

886
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,440
Is there going to be a next date?

887
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,640
Pick the badminton gym.

888
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,720
They're already planning the next date.

889
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,280
Sounds good.

890
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,320
What's wrong?

891
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,680
Nothing, I'm just looking at your questions.

892
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,040
My questions are pretty

893
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,520
basic.

894
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,360
Because

895
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,080
at first

896
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,160
I thought they were just early-stage questions.

897
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,640
Actually, I think I could change them a bit.

898
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,400
So what do you want to ask?

899
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,440
You can change them.

900
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,600
You can just ask me directly.

901
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,280
That look in your eyes

902
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,280
My first question is

903
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,080
If you divide your free time into ten parts

904
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,680
between socializing, being alone, and with your partner

905
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,200
how would you split those ten parts?

906
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,840
She also asked Herry (Liu Zihan)

907
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,600
She and Herry (Liu Zihan) are

908
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,440
exactly the same

909
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,840
Yeah, last time with Zihan

910
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,760
they talked about it

911
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,280
Let's see how he answers

912
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,480
I might

913
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,880
give

914
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,200
seven parts to my partner

915
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,960
Your partner gets seven parts?

916
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,280
I was just about to say

917
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,120
six would already be a win

918
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:39,760
but he said seven

919
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,600
even more

920
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,880
Your partner gets seven parts

921
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,000
two parts for socializing

922
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,280
Right

923
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,960
Two parts, and one part for being alone

924
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,920
One part for being alone

925
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,800
Whenever I have free time

926
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,320
Whenever I'm not busy

927
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,560
I just want to be with my partner

928
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,880
That feeling

929
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,080
That's pretty good.

930
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,760
Whenever I have free time,

931
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,240
Whenever I'm not busy,

932
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,440
I just want to be with the other person.

933
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,600
This feeling

934
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,720
is really nice.

935
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,280
When I'm socializing,

936
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,480
I actually want to bring

937
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,760
the other person

938
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,040
to meet my friends or family.

939
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,120
I think that would make me happier.

940
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,240
You're hiding your true self.

941
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,080
You,

942
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,040
I find him really cute now.

943
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,120
Seriously.

944
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,160
I really like him.

945
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,840
The second question is about your upbringing.

946
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,240
Your upbringing.

947
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:32,840
Yeah.

948
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,760
When I was little,

949
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,240
I spent more time at my grandma's place.

950
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,000
My parents were very busy.

951
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,400
They had lots of work calls.

952
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,160
Sometimes while talking to them,

953
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,200
they'd get a call

954
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,920
and forget what we were just talking about.

955
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,720
So,

956
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,840
I subconsciously thought

957
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,880
that being proactive in communication

958
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,800
or trying things on my own

959
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,680
would be ignored.

960
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,440
Yeah.

961
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,800
It was the same when I was little.

962
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,800
Were you raised by your parents?

963
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,200
Not really.

964
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,640
It was more my grandparents.

965
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,080
Maybe that's why I've been independent since childhood.

966
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,920
And then,

967
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,960
I kind of grew up free-range.

968
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,320
I feel like my sense of security is pretty weak.

969
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,960
Whether it's in close relationships

970
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,800
or in friendships,

971
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,120
I can see that.

972
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,720
He noticed it too.

973
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,720
Yeah, I really need

974
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,760
to be

975
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,320
affirmed.

976
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,480
Yeah.

977
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,640
I really need affirmation.

978
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,720
I need to be seen and accepted.

979
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,240
Chi Chi expresses her needs very clearly.

980
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,560
I think that's great.

981
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,520
I think you should just say it.

982
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,160
If you have issues in a relationship,

983
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,400
would you choose

984
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,720
I'm someone who faces problems head-on.

985
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,880
Would you choose direct communication?

986
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,360
Yes, I communicate directly.

987
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,560
I'm very straightforward.

988
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:58,920
That's really good.

989
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,320
Because my T value (rationality) is high,

990
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:01,720
I might

991
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,160
not be that emotional.

992
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,520
I'm more rational.

993
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,440
Yeah, I'm a problem-solver.

994
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,320
When a problem comes up,

995
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,200
I deal with it right away.

996
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,520
I think about solutions.

997
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,880
But I might overlook the other person's feelings.

998
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,680
That's just her personality.

999
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,320
Yeah.

1000
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,640
Actually, I think you even

1001
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,920
hide part of your emotions

1002
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,760
on purpose.

1003
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,320
Right?

1004
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,920
Maybe.

1005
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,840
I tend to suppress my emotions.

1006
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,240
Let me say again,

1007
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,400
I think I'm definitely more proactive than you.

1008
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,480
But today, I was the one who took the key.

1009
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,280
That's because every day

1010
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,720
I get off work really late.

1011
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:42,560
Yeah.

1012
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,200
You're just a bit

1013
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,800
more proactive than me.

1014
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,080
Why are you being picky now?

1015
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,560
This is just too sweet.

1016
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,000
I really enjoy chatting with others.

1017
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,920
If we get along,

1018
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,920
I tend to lose track of time.

1019
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,800
But I'm really happy tonight.

1020
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,040
I'm not sleepy at all right now.

1021
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:03,920
It's because

1022
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,520
you invited me.

1023
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,360
It's settled.

1024
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,720
These two are good to go.

1025
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,440
It's done.

1026
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,560
Should we stamp it?

1027
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,640
Stamp it.

1028
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,360
Yifan

1029
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,400
Have you ever ridden the mini-train?

1030
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,960
I did two nights ago.

1031
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,800
Zihan

1032
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,080
Zihan is asking Ruilong.

1033
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,000
Zihan is already venting by boxing.

1034
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,880
Why does this feel like a sad gym session?

1035
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,480
Channel frustration into motivation.

1036
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,520
Two are happy, two are upset.

1037
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,240
One is just watching the drama.

1038
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,760
Will he regret it?

1039
00:37:59,120 --> 00:37:59,920
Herry (Liu Zihan)

1040
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,560
Will he regret not going?

1041
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,200
Making that move.

1042
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,000
Because if you do it, others can't.

1043
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,840
No one else can do it again.

1044
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,480
There will definitely be some regret.

1045
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,280
I think he already

1046
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,040
feels a bit uneasy inside.

1047
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:08,840
Because last time (on the date)

1048
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,720
when the conversation ended,

1049
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,680
it wasn't that pleasant.

1050
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,960
He did write a letter though.

1051
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,360
Here.

1052
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,960
He must feel a bit

1053
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,040
hopeless now.

1054
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,200
And at this moment,

1055
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,720
she (Sun Hanqing) rode the mini-train again.

1056
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,200
That makes it even harder, I think.

1057
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,360
Yu Xing and Chi Chi

1058
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,200
seem to have

1059
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,440
a mutual effort in their relationship.

1060
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,240
Chi Chi also has

1061
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,680
a tough side.

1062
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,480
And Yu Xing noticed

1063
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,160
Yu Xing, inside,

1064
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:30,920
has an introverted side.

1065
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,480
He’s opening up for Chi Chi.

1066
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,440
Yu Xing finally

1067
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,520
gathered the courage to take that step.

1068
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,960
You’ll see them on the train

1069
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,720
teasing each other,

1070
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,680
acting playful.

1071
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,760
Yu Xing rarely shows this side to others.

1072
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,880
You’ll see it.

1073
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,120
So I’m really looking forward to those two.

1074
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,080
But I’m still a bit worried.

1075
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:49,760
Because before,

1076
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,880
every time Yu Xing interacts with Chi Chi,

1077
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,800
he’s always in a good state.

1078
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,320
His struggles come up

1079
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,360
when he’s with Yifan.

1080
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,080
Can he adjust his state

1081
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,040
and get back on track?

1082
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,200
A new day has begun.

1083
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,400
Looking forward to it.

1084
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,560
Dr. Fang

1085
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,200
Yifan

1086
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,200
Wang Jue is wearing glasses.

1087
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,320
She has that cool, elegant beauty.

1088
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,160
Hello.

1089
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,320
Hi.

1090
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,840
Le Chen

1091
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,320
What are you washing?

1092
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,720
Cucumber. Want some?

1093
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,480
Are you having this for breakfast?

1094
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,000
Come on, let’s see what else there is to eat.

1095
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,800
Okay.

1096
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,160
Finally woke up early enough to see someone.

1097
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,920
It's not that early.

1098
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,640
Today I’m a business person.

1099
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,640
A day to style my hair like an adult.

1100
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:37,880
What’s for breakfast?

1101
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,480
Whatever’s available.

1102
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,240
There’s noodles. Do you want some?

1103
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,440
Let’s cook noodles then.

1104
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,320
Sure.

1105
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,720
It’s been a long time since I

1106
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,560
got up to make breakfast.

1107
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,160
Just make something simple.

1108
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,640
Let’s eat cucumber together.

1109
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,440
Eating cucumber.

1110
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,560
Do you want your egg more cooked

1111
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,720
or less cooked?

1112
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,440
Half-cooked.

1113
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,040
Half-cooked.

1114
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,040
Like this?

1115
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,000
That’s a bit too raw.

1116
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,720
So you don’t want a runny yolk?

1117
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,480
I mean, it looks

1118
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,680
You’re picky.

1119
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,480
but it’s runny when you eat it.

1120
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,680
But it still looks

1121
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,240
Smells so good.

1122
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,240
This is what love looks like.

1123
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,560
Cooking breakfast for you.

1124
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,040
Those two really

1125
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:30,920
are a good match.

1126
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,120
It should be almost done.

1127
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,760
Almost done.

1128
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,960
Feels like it’s not enough.

1129
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,760
A little is enough for me.

1130
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,680
I don’t need much.

1131
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,080
That small bowl is enough for me.

1132
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:42,720
Don’t pretend.

1133
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,000
That’s not your usual appetite.

1134
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,400
It really is.

1135
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,680
No, it’s not.

1136
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,720
You’re still growing, eat more.

1137
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,320
Do you want one egg or two?

1138
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,240
One.

1139
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,160
Two.

1140
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:54,840
One.

1141
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,640
Really?

1142
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,280
You’re really feeding me like a pig.

1143
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,160
They look so happy.

1144
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,600
Thanks.

1145
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,840
These two are so nice to watch.

1146
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,360
This egg is good.

1147
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,320
Of course.

1148
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,840
What did you two talk about last night?

1149
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,640
What do you want to hear?

1150
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,920
Let’s hear it.

1151
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,760
Something interesting.

1152
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,960
One day, Jiao Zhiheng

1153
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,840
was chatting with me

1154
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,600
and suddenly asked,

1155
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,520
Chen,

1156
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,600
what if we both like the same person?

1157
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,400
What would you do?

1158
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:34,960
At that moment,

1159
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,880
What kind of reaction is that?

1160
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,400
Who?

1161
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,920
Who?

1162
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,040
He thought you

1163
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,520
liked Lanlan.

1164
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,680
No.

1165
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,120
He was just asking.

1166
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,680
You really can’t tell?

1167
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,480
How did you guys figure it out?

1168
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,800
It’s so obvious, man.

1169
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,440
He might as well

1170
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,160
write it on his forehead.

1171
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,480
See?

1172
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,360
He practically wants to write it on his face.

1173
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,240
Finished eating. It was delicious.

1174
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,040
All done.

1175
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,320
So we can head out together later.

1176
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:18,880
Sure.

1177
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,200
Date booked.

1178
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,400
If you put yourself in his shoes now,

1179
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,360
and you were Jiao Zhiheng,

1180
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,240
what would you do?

1181
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,200
Because when I went to talk to Jiao Ge,

1182
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,880
I told him I felt

1183
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,840
my situation was pretty similar to his.

1184
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:36,960
Why did you go to Jiao Ge?

1185
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,400
Just to talk to him

1186
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,160
about some recent confusion

1187
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,200
and a few things going on.

1188
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,160
So do you have any confusion lately?

1189
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,640
Will she say it out loud?

1190
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,280
If I have confusion,

1191
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,120
I can't tell you either.

1192
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,480
Why not?

1193
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,200
Do you want to hear it?

1194
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,040
Go ahead.

1195
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,200
The source of my confusion is you.

1196
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,440
How could I tell you that?

1197
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,000
She said it.

1198
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,680
She really said it.

1199
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,440
She's so brave.

1200
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,120
That's really heart-fluttering.

1201
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:06,960
You have to be this bold.

1202
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:07,480
Just say it.

1203
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,960
That's such a Lu Yuan way to express it.

1204
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,120
The source of my confusion is you.

1205
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,360
How could I tell you that?

1206
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,440
Compared to saying it on a date,

1207
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,160
this feels more natural.

1208
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,080
She feels really secure.

1209
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:19,440
That's why she can say it.

1210
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,680
That's why she can say it.

1211
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,560
Let's go.

1212
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,440
Okay.

1213
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,360
Let's head out.

1214
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,720
What do you do when you're alone?

1215
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:39,760
Read.

1216
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,680
Go to the gym.

1217
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:41,400
Watch movies.

1218
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,320
Binge shows.

1219
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,160
I thought I was the only one this boring.

1220
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,200
Turns out everyone is pretty boring.

1221
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,480
I need to be alone

1222
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,960
to recharge myself.

1223
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,000
I need to clear my mind.

1224
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,240
Feels like lately

1225
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,280
I've been talking the most.

1226
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,640
I've never talked this much before.

1227
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,920
Is this your talkative phase now

1228
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:01,960
or your quiet phase?

1229
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,560
I guess it's normal.

1230
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,640
Really?

1231
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,760
You're probably a bit more talkative than normal.

1232
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:07,720
Right now,

1233
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:08,720
I'm normal.

1234
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,720
I feel like finding topics is exhausting.

1235
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,120
Right?

1236
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,200
Yeah.

1237
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,800
If two people can really

1238
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,080
be comfortable together without talking,

1239
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,280
that's not easy.

1240
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,600
True.

1241
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:23,760
So those cards you have,

1242
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:24,760
Which cards?

1243
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,080
The two date cards.

1244
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:26,680
Yeah.

1245
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:27,960
Well...

1246
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,520
That's hard to say.

1247
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,200
Acting cute.

1248
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:35,560
Honestly, my first thought

1249
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,920
was to write your name twice.

1250
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,560
I really didn't expect it at the time.

1251
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:43,960
Didn't expect what?

1252
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,400
Didn't expect you to come so quickly.

1253
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,480
If I hadn't come quickly,

1254
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,280
I was afraid both cards would be gone.

1255
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,280
But honestly, for the first card,

1256
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,600
I wrote your name right away.

1257
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,680
I wrote your name on the first card.

1258
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,040
He's confirming it for her.

1259
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,960
But honestly, for the first card,

1260
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,160
I wrote your name right away.

1261
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,360
Openly expressing your feelings.

1262
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,040
That's really nice.

1263
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,800
He really moved her.

1264
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,120
Those two will definitely work out.

1265
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:17,680
Yeah.

1266
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,800
At that time, my

1267
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:20,400
guess was

1268
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,840
maybe you had two blank cards.

1269
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,320
Or you wrote down

1270
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,200
someone else's name first.

1271
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,200
Then left one card blank.

1272
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,000
And whoever came to you,

1273
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,800
you'd write their name.

1274
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,280
Why did you think I'd do that?

1275
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,280
Because I just couldn't figure it out.

1276
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,560
I couldn't tell from your previous

1277
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,800
actions.

1278
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,760
Yeah, I couldn't see it from your behavior.

1279
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,080
It made me feel a bit

1280
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,320
hard to read.

1281
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,440
Yeah, hard to read.

1282
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:46,480
Yeah, hard to read.

1283
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,920
There's a lot of uncertainty.

1284
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,400
It just made my mind feel messy.

1285
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,560
It just made my mind feel messy.

1286
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,640
I finally understand a little now.

1287
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:58,120
Finally got it.

1288
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:58,960
You just figured it out?

1289
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,600
You just got it.

1290
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,720
Little scatterbrain.

1291
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,440
So when I went to Jiao Ge,

1292
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,480
he comforted me.

1293
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,000
How did he comfort you?

1294
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,920
He said not to be too anxious.

1295
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,720
Were you really that anxious?

1296
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:16,280
Honestly,

1297
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,960
it wasn't that bad.

1298
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,120
But yesterday, when I talked to Jiao Ge,

1299
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:21,840
there was an important point.

1300
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:22,880
It's true that

1301
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,720
the end of the cabin is actually the real beginning.

1302
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:26,280
Yeah.

1303
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,400
Yeah.

1304
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,680
He's really thinking about the future.

1305
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:31,280
Alright.

1306
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:32,960
Alright.

1307
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,720
Do you still look forward to the mini-train ride?

1308
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,320
If you get it, then I will.

1309
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:43,560
Look at Chen Chen.

1310
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,160
His state with her now

1311
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,520
is actually quite different.

1312
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,840
He seems so relaxed.

1313
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:48,840
Very comfortable.

1314
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,800
He can't stop smiling.

1315
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,240
Watching this part,

1316
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,080
it feels like the two of them

1317
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,000
are giving each other

1318
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,040
energy, recharging each other.

1319
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:56,960
They're powering up together.

1320
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:57,920
It's so comfortable.

1321
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,280
Really comfortable, super cozy.

1322
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,400
When I see Chen Chen,

1323
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,680
he's actually a responsible guy.

1324
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:03,920
Even though before,

1325
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:04,440
he didn't really

1326
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,800
express himself much,

1327
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:06,880
he was always observing.

1328
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,200
And once Le Chen figures things out,

1329
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,120
he adjusts his signals

1330
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:11,600
really well.

1331
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,960
Very certain, very clear.

1332
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,120
We used to think

1333
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,600
Lu Yuan's signals were strong.

1334
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,840
But now, why does it feel right?

1335
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,920
It's because Le Chen is on the same wavelength.

1336
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,400
They're in sync.

1337
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,360
Their way of thinking is also similar.

1338
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,600
Both are pretty rational.

1339
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:25,480
In their ideas,

1340
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,280
and thought patterns,

1341
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,240
they match well.

1342
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,120
Yeah, that's so important.

1343
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:29,960
So next,

1344
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,360
in our little house,

1345
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,040
soon,

1346
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:32,800
we'll welcome

1347
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,840
our second

1348
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,640
Open Day.

1349
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,320
I heard there's a mysterious

1350
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,120
guest coming.

1351
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,320
I'm coming out.

1352
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:42,920
Really?

1353
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:43,920
You went?

1354
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,000
I joined.

1355
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
It wasn't just you, right?

1356
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,160
Not just you?

1357
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,120
You went too?

1358
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,080
Three of us.

1359
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:53,960
You went too?

1360
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:54,720
No.

1361
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,640
All three of you went.

1362
00:48:58,760 --> 00:48:59,760
Come on, let's see

1363
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,000
who came.

1364
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,480
What's with all these dishes?

1365
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,240
This is

1366
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,200
hot pot.

1367
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,760
Someone's showing off their skills.

1368
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,120
Everyone made dishes.

1369
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,440
We need to label them.

1370
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:29,240
So fancy.

1371
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,880
Why do the guys seem so talented?

1372
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,040
It's like a "Chef Competition."

1373
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:42,720
It feels like

1374
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,840
everyone's going all out today.

1375
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,560
Something big

1376
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,600
is about to happen.

1377
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,320
I'm really looking forward to this part.

1378
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,360
The mysterious guest.

1379
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,800
Who will the mysterious guest be?

1380
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,400
Who is it, really?

1381
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,960
Get your best dish ready.

1382
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,120
So what are you planning to do?

1383
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:12,680
Tomorrow.

1384
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:13,960
I might make spicy hot pot.

1385
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,320
What you made today was delicious.

1386
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,080
Why not make it again?

1387
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:18,960
Today’s dish is fine.

1388
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,360
Then maybe make two dishes?

1389
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,560
Yeah, make one more.

1390
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,760
Three dishes would work too.

1391
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,800
How many are you making?

1392
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,640
I was planning to make two dishes.

1393
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,440
One with cauliflower.

1394
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,480
One with stir-fried pork and peppers.

1395
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,000
They already have stir-fried pork and peppers.

1396
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:32,600
I know.

1397
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,200
But I still want to make it.

1398
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:34,600
Everyone’s trying to outdo each other.

1399
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,000
What are you using this water for?

1400
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,440
I want to make brown sugar water.

1401
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,840
Isn’t today for keeping warm?

1402
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,280
Le Chen, how many dishes are you making?

1403
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:42,320
Two.

1404
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,800
Everyone’s competing.

1405
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,360
Did they say what time?

1406
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,320
I don’t know.

1407
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,280
Then we’ll just have to cook faster.

1408
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,120
I’m pretty curious.

1409
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,120
Who’s coming today?

1410
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,200
Who actually came?

1411
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,000
Hurry up.

1412
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,760
Just skip straight to that part.

1413
00:50:58,760 --> 00:50:59,800
They’re here.

1414
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,200
Ma Boqian.

1415
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,920
What?

1416
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,040
Seems like it.

1417
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,600
Let’s go.

1418
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,960
This should be the one from earlier.

1419
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,800
Yo Sheep Ranch.

1420
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,320
Going again.

1421
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,520
I was really looking forward to it.

1422
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,080
Turns out...

1423
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:30,320
Xu Ge gave it.

1424
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:30,800
It’s too much.

1425
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:31,320
Now it feels like...

1426
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,160
We’re out.

1427
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:36,600
Deer.

1428
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,240
Sika deer.

1429
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:38,280
Horse.

1430
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,080
Calling a deer a horse.

1431
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,360
Alright, then that’s a horse.

1432
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:44,640
Horse.

1433
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,640
Ma Boqian, look at the deer!

1434
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:48,960
I want to go too.

1435
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,400
I’ve always wanted to go.

1436
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,640
They can just stroll around here.

1437
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:54,440
Yeah.

1438
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:55,000
Just walk around.

1439
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:55,880
Take a stroll.

1440
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,000
Chat a bit.

1441
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,040
Go for a run.

1442
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:58,560
Yeah.

1443
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:02,520
You and Shen Mengchen,

1444
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,240
do you like coming to parks like this?

1445
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,880
Shen doesn’t really like walking around.

1446
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:06,840
But I really love it.

1447
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,120
Whenever we’re together,

1448
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:09,920
she’ll walk with me.

1449
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,360
I’d love to live here.

1450
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,000
Right?

1451
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:15,320
Yeah.

1452
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,360
This is it.

1453
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:24,920
Let’s sit down.

1454
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:25,760
Let’s wait a bit.

1455
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,040
Why are there still people here?

1456
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,560
Actually, I’m pretty...

1457
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,120
worried about meeting the elders.

1458
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,080
Elders.

1459
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:35,320
No one’s older than him, right?

1460
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,200
Maybe family is coming today.

1461
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,000
I don’t think so.

1462
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,520
Actually, I’m pretty...

1463
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:44,840
worried about meeting the elders.

1464
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:46,520
Why?

1465
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,280
Because I’m the type

1466
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,440
who speaks bluntly but makes sense.

1467
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,040
That kind of person.

1468
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:50,880
You know?

1469
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
You’re afraid of saying

1470
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:53,680
too much,

1471
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:54,120
too little,

1472
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,240
too harsh or too light.

1473
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:55,880
Yeah.

1474
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,440
I can’t get the balance right.

1475
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,360
You know?

1476
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,120
So, may I ask,

1477
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,200
have you met elders before?

1478
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:01,680
Of course I have.

1479
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,320
They’re here.

1480
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,600
Who?

1481
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:11,880
Is it the moms?

1482
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:17,720
Really?

1483
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,000
Are they really the moms?

1484
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:20,280
The family and friends are here.

1485
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:23,680
Hello.

1486
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:24,720
Haitao.

1487
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:25,440
Hello.

1488
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,040
Welcome.

1489
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:27,320
Please come inside.

1490
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,040
The girls' family and friends.

1491
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:29,080
The girls' family and friends.

1492
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:29,400
There are moms, friends, and sisters.

1493
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,960
There are moms, friends, and sisters.

1494
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,160
There are moms, friends, and sisters.

1495
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,040
And me.

1496
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:35,640
I'm here for no reason.

1497
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:36,280
What's going on?

1498
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:39,560
Hello.

1499
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,360
Welcome, everyone.

1500
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:42,760
Sister.

1501
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,560
Mom.

1502
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,280
Lu Yuan's mom.

1503
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,280
Ai Lin's mom.

1504
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,560
Yifan's best friend.

1505
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,240
And actually, today, you see,

1506
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:50,440
And actually, today, you see,

1507
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:51,760
It's all moms and sisters here.

1508
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,080
No dads were invited.

1509
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:57,120
I think if dads came,

1510
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:57,840
their eyes would be

1511
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,080
full of "killer intent."

1512
00:53:59,080 --> 00:53:59,240
With dads, it's not just checking.

1513
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,360
With dads, it's not just checking.

1514
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:01,120
Everyone would be eliminated.

1515
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:02,240
Right.

1516
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,160
When moms come,

1517
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,200
their eyes are filled with joy.

1518
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,440
That's how I see it.

1519
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:09,640
Before coming, mom

1520
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:10,800
Did you talk to dad about this?

1521
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:11,760
Yes.

1522
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,320
He told me

1523
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:13,680
to take a good look.

1524
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,400
That's what he said.

1525
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,480
He asked why dad wasn't invited.

1526
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:19,920
That's what he said.

1527
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:20,880
I said, maybe next time.

1528
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:21,400
I said, next time.

1529
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,320
Chi Chi's mom is so cute.

1530
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,080
I'm with Xu Rulan.

1531
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,000
You could say I'm her older sister.

1532
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,280
How long have you been together?

1533
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,720
How long has it been?

1534
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,040
Since 2018 until now.

1535
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:32,640
Seven years.

1536
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,360
It's been seven years.

1537
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,720
After getting to know her,

1538
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,560
Rulan is very perceptive.

1539
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:38,360
She can also

1540
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:40,040
inspire people, she's that kind of kid.

1541
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,040
Welcome, friends and family.

1542
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:42,600
Thank you.

1543
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,560
Welcome to our older sister.

1544
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,360
I'm Lu Yuan's mom.

1545
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:46,440
To be honest,

1546
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,160
When she first came here,

1547
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,080
I was a bit worried.

1548
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,160
Because she

1549
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,720
when it comes to dating and relationships,

1550
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,080
I brought it up with her,

1551
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,720
but she was pretty

1552
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,040
resistant to the idea.

1553
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:58,760
So,

1554
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,120
I didn't force her.

1555
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:01,560
In my opinion,

1556
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,200
I let her do as she likes.

1557
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:03,600
Whatever makes her happy.

1558
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,720
Then she suddenly joined this show.

1559
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:06,800
Mom, what did you think?

1560
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:07,880
What's going on?

1561
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:08,720
Yeah.

1562
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,080
At first, I asked what kind of show it was.

1563
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,120
I asked, is it a proper show?

1564
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,440
A proper show.

1565
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,480
She said yes, so I agreed.

1566
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,240
Because she's still in school.

1567
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:18,560
That's right.

1568
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,880
I'm still a little worried.

1569
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:21,920
And now, sitting here today,

1570
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,480
it feels like a parent-teacher meeting.

1571
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:24,240
It really does.

1572
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,960
Our show is very proper.

1573
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,600
We've been running for eight seasons.

1574
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:29,840
I really didn't know.

1575
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:32,720
To be honest.

1576
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,040
Mom is very honest.

1577
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,600
Honestly.

1578
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,240
Mom is so cute.

1579
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,240
I'm Wang Yifan's colleague.

1580
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,680
We're best friends in Shanghai.

1581
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,800
Best friends talk about everything.

1582
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:44,880
Yeah.

1583
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:45,520
Has she ever told you

1584
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,280
what her ideal type is?

1585
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,760
Her ideal type is someone

1586
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,640
just like this gentleman here.

1587
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:52,720
Like this gentleman.

1588
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,960
Someone very strong and fit.

1589
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,080
Ma Boqian looks so macho today.

1590
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:01,920
I haven't introduced everyone yet.

1591
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:02,880
This gentleman

1592
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,120
is joining us today

1593
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,560
as our male guest.

1594
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,320
What qualities does he have

1595
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:12,160
that you think

1596
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,120
Yifan would like?

1597
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:15,520
Yes, he's handsome.

1598
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:16,800
Handsome.

1599
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,720
But looks are nothing compared to his talent.

1600
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:21,040
They're worth nothing next to his talent.

1601
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,480
Right, I rely on my personality.

1602
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,160
He laughed at his own joke.

1603
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,280
I think it's so funny.

1604
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:31,720
Alright.

1605
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,560
If these guests come on stage,

1606
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,480
then you're definitely the ideal type.

1607
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:36,560
Ideal type.

1608
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,840
I wouldn't.

1609
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:40,520
This is so much fun.

1610
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:41,280
So happy.

1611
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:42,600
This makes the kids happy.

1612
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:43,120
Look at that.

1613
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,800
They took it seriously.

1614
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,120
Really.

1615
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,400
Has Wang Jue ever talked to his sister-in-law about this before?

1616
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:50,880
Like,

1617
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,760
what her ideal type is?

1618
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,760
The first thing Wang Jue wants

1619
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,840
is to handle emotions well.

1620
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,120
Because no matter what the issue is,

1621
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:00,760
or who’s right or wrong,

1622
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,160
if you don’t manage the girl’s emotions,

1623
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,520
no matter what you say to her,

1624
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,720
she won’t listen.

1625
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:06,720
That’s impressive.

1626
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:08,440
Well said.

1627
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,600
First, calm her emotions.

1628
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,360
So I also hope

1629
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:13,840
our little sister

1630
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,600
can meet someone like that.

1631
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:17,640
But there’s one more thing.

1632
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,080
You can’t just always give in.

1633
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:19,520
Right.

1634
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,920
You have to have your own sense of self.

1635
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,040
Actually, in a relationship between two people,

1636
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,680
it's not about how I change myself,

1637
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,680
but about being myself

1638
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,840
while still fitting together even better.

1639
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:30,280
Right.

1640
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,760
You can't keep compromising yourself.

1641
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,240
Don't lose who you are.

1642
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:33,960
Isn't that true?

1643
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,400
Mom, you're so kind.

1644
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:38,600
You keep saying

1645
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,080
how much you miss your daughter.

1646
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,560
You're happy and content.

1647
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:41,600
Really happy and content.

1648
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:42,840
But at the same time, I don't want

1649
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:43,840
you to lose yourself.

1650
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:44,880
Because only then, the two of you

1651
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,360
the feeling of being together

1652
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:47,040
and the state you're in

1653
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,760
will be more genuine.

1654
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:50,800
So basically,

1655
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,440
if he is true to himself,

1656
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,000
the relationship will last longer.

1657
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,240
Yes.

1658
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,000
Exactly.

1659
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,480
I'm Ke Ailin's mother.

1660
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,640
During the time I've spent with my daughter,

1661
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,160
I've been with her a lot.

1662
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,200
As her mother,

1663
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,840
I think being there for her is really important.

1664
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,760
Because when a child is alone

1665
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,040
in a strange city,

1666
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:08,840
it's very lonely.

1667
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,680
Especially when she's sick,

1668
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:11,480
like having a cough or a cold,

1669
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,080
she feels helpless by herself.

1670
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,360
My daughter often gets coughs and colds.

1671
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,720
I video call her often.

1672
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:17,760
I always think about

1673
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,720
her health and happiness first.

1674
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:21,880
A mother's care is always here.

1675
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:22,960
Yes.

1676
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,480
As a mother,

1677
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,160
I think if a boy

1678
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,560
can give a girl

1679
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:29,840
happiness,

1680
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,120
companionship,

1681
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,680
and guidance,

1682
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,480
that's what a mother hopes her daughter will find.

1683
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,520
A boy like that.

1684
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,200
That's very well said.

1685
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:38,720
Of course,

1686
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,160
no one can be perfect.

1687
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,480
You can't give everything.

1688
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:42,920
You can't have it all.

1689
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:43,720
It's impossible.

1690
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,200
If we get just one thing,

1691
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,520
and it's what the girl wants,

1692
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,040
I think she'll be happy.

1693
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:49,600
Very happy.

1694
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:50,160
For example, me,

1695
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,360
I value companionship.

1696
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,840
Maybe he spends more time with you,

1697
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:55,000
but isn't as good at making money.

1698
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:55,680
That's okay.

1699
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:56,680
You have companionship,

1700
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:57,560
so you should be happy.

1701
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,000
You got what you wanted.

1702
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,840
Just having one thing can bring happiness.

1703
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,280
That's really well said.

1704
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:04,880
Really.

1705
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:06,800
You can't have everything.

1706
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:07,760
I think all the moms

1707
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:08,320
right from the start

1708
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,440
have elevated the show.

1709
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:10,000
I'm about to cry.

1710
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:10,520
Yeah.

1711
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:11,000
Makes me want to cry.

1712
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,800
When she said that just now,

1713
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:13,480
I felt the same.

1714
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,920
It made me think of my own mom.

1715
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,320
I thought of my daughter.

1716
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,080
A mother's words are

1717
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:23,520
gentle yet strong.

1718
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:24,440
Yes.

1719
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:25,280
They're powerful.

1720
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,800
She really wants

1721
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,360
her child to be well.

1722
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:28,720
So,

1723
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:29,680
she truly hopes

1724
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:30,440
there will be

1725
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:32,040
someone worthy of trust.

1726
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,920
We’ll be meeting the guys soon.

1727
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:38,720
Let’s all ask them questions.

1728
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:39,320
How about it?

1729
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,640
We’ve prepared so many questions.

1730
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,440
I think we should just ask whatever we want.

1731
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:44,800
Just ask anything.

1732
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:45,120
Yeah.

1733
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,960
If the two of them are in a long-distance relationship,

1734
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,480
and something comes up,

1735
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:48,600
what would he actually do?

1736
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:51,000
How would he show it through actions?

1737
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,640
To express his love?

1738
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,200
That’s so real.

1739
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,840
First, I want to see if someone

1740
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:58,280
can stay committed for a long time,

1741
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:59,200
and be loyal.

1742
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:01,320
So now,

1743
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:03,000
let’s write down the questions we want to ask the guys

1744
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:03,880
on these cards.

1745
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:06,200
Let’s start.

1746
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:10,880
These questions just keep coming.

1747
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:11,600
They’re really intense.

1748
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:13,240
I’m already on my third question.

1749
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,240
We were supposed to write just one.

1750
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:16,440
But I wrote three.

1751
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:18,920
I’m so nervous.

1752
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:19,920
We’re about to meet them.

1753
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,680
Why is there only one cutting board?

1754
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,080
I’ll be done soon.

1755
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:26,640
Everyone’s scared off.

1756
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:27,840
Sis,

1757
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:29,040
I’ll give you two more cards.

1758
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:31,680
I’m feeling a bit stressed over here.

1759
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:32,240
Feels like it.

1760
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,480
Do you think we still have plenty of time?

1761
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:35,960
I’m not sure about the time.

1762
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,120
It’s all so rushed.

1763
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,040
So you think it’s possible

1764
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:40,760
for a mystery guest to show up halfway?

1765
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:42,480
Alright.

1766
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:43,080
Let’s take

1767
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,080
all our questions

1768
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,440
and meet up with the guys.

1769
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:46,040
Let’s go.

1770
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:46,680
We’re heading out.

1771
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:49,000
I can’t wait to see how the guys react.

1772
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,080
Me too.

1773
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,680
I’m already excited about these questions.
