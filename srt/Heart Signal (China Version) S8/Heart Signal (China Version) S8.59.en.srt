1
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:22,600
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,320
I'm Lan Lan.

3
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,360
I'm back again.

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,080
I'm definitely not alone today.

5
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,760
So, where are my friends now?

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,920
Let me show you a little magic.

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,680
And make them appear.

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,640
Hello!

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,240
Hello, everyone.

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:36,680
We're back again.

11
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,520
Back again!

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,160
So, was my magic impressive?

13
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,880
Your magic didn't work.

14
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,880
But this is pretty good, right?

15
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,480
Let's take a seat.

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:44,960
Okay.

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,960
There are two seats left.

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,200
That means two new friends

19
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,520
are joining us for Pei Ni Kan Xin Dong: Heartbeat Companion.

20
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,240
So next,

21
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,720
let's welcome Cassien

22
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,720
and the energetic Ah Zhen.

23
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,760
Please, have a seat.

24
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,560
Hello!

25
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,160
Hello!

26
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:05,600
Hello!

27
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,720
You're so fair-skinned.

28
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,960
You all look beautiful.

29
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,040
So pretty—everyone looks great.

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,880
Welcome!

31
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,880
Now everyone's here.

32
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,240
Let's have our new friends

33
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,840
introduce themselves.

34
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,360
Hello, everyone.

35
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,800
I'm a Xiaohongshu Heartbeat Observer,

36
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,720
the energetic Ah Zhen.

37
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,960
You can call me Ah Zhen.

38
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,960
Alright, Ah Zhen.

39
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,240
Welcome!

40
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,800
My love starts without warning, like this song.

41
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,840
Are you feeling your heartbeat too?

42
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,240
But you don't say it.

43
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,080
Just like me.

44
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:39,280
Used to hiding love, never speaking out.

45
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,240
That's really sweet.

46
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,400
Hello, everyone.

47
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,960
I'm a Xiaohongshu Heartbeat Observer,

48
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,960
and singer-songwriter Cassien.

49
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,080
Also known as the Garlic Princess.

50
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,560
You can call me Kaka.

51
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,880
Now let's have our old friends

52
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,200
introduce themselves.

53
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:53,920
Okay.

54
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,480
Hello, everyone.

55
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,120
I'm from Heart Signal,

56
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,840
season eight, Wang Lechen.

57
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,720
Hello, everyone.

58
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,880
I'm from Heart Signal,

59
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,280
season eight, Jin Yuxing.

60
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,760
Hello, everyone.

61
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,520
I'm from Heart Signal,

62
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,080
season eight, Xu Rulan—Lan Lan.

63
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,560
Gorgeous!

64
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,120
Which guests do you two like most

65
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,200
from this season?

66
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,760
At first, I really shipped you two

67
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,320
as a pair.

68
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,200
But I didn't expect that later

69
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,240
you didn't interact much.

70
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,840
So I started shipping Ruilong and Duoduo.

71
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,320
Me too, actually.

72
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,240
I really shipped Lechen and Lu Yuan.

73
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,040
Alright.

74
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,400
And also Ruilong.

75
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,520
His personality

76
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,760
feels kind of innocent.

77
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,120
Later, Zihan and

78
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,840
Chichi.

79
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,120
Which couple do you ship?

80
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,640
Me?

81
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,160
Take a guess.

82
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,880
Do you ship yourself and Doctor Fang?

83
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,680
This time, we're not watching

84
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,320
life inside the house anymore.

85
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,320
Everyone's about to start a trip.

86
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,760
So let's begin

87
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,920
watching our show.

88
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,760
Okay.

89
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,040
Urumqi.

90
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,480
A video diary.

91
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,320
Ate lots of roast whole lamb.

92
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,200
Not really.

93
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,080
So happy.

94
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,600
This ambiguous stage is the best.

95
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,960
You look so happy.

96
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,760
This is kind of shippable.

97
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,080
"Boyfriend perspective."

98
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:48,960
So exciting.

99
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,800
You have to be brave enough.

100
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,800
Are you a Libra?

101
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,840
This takes courage.

102
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,480
Because there's a lot of risk.

103
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,320
Because girls don't have a perspective.

104
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,120
It's about the guys

105
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,280
and how they'll choose.

106
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,960
Or what the final outcome will be.

107
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,680
Who does she want to be with one-on-one now?

108
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,160
I'm really curious.

109
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,400
Is it you?

110
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,560
Or him?

111
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,520
You'd have to ask Chichi about that.

112
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,400
It's pretty easy to choose.

113
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,600
Because for them,

114
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,400
it really is easy to choose.

115
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,960
For him, it's definitely easy to choose.

116
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,840
Everyone's pretty brave.

117
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,720
Now the question goes to these two guys.

118
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,600
"Three-person trip."

119
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,680
You two are just watching the drama.

120
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,440
I'm sitting right next to you.

121
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,320
I can sense that you don't

122
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:41,720
really feel much for Yifan.

123
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,240
Yifan took my little train.

124
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,960
On the little train.

125
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,440
I've already made it clear to Yifan.

126
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,520
I said maybe being friends

127
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,200
is a better choice.

128
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:51,760
It's more suitable.

129
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,520
Yeah, it's a better fit.

130
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,840
Does he know?

131
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,640
Does Zihan know about this?

132
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,440
He doesn't know.

133
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,440
Because in the house,

134
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,160
everyone's perspective is pretty one-sided.

135
00:06:59,160 --> 00:06:59,320
Got it.

136
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,080
Just don't know

137
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,000
what's happening with others.

138
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,520
Because every day when we return,

139
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,280
everyone comes back

140
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:04,840
at different times.

141
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,560
Then we eat, and that's about it.

142
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,560
Your

143
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,240
little gestures like this

144
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,640
You have so many little gestures.

145
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,880
So awkward.

146
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,640
Why didn't you say it back then?

147
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,040
I think the person Chichi wanted to pick

148
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,000
was me.

149
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,920
Because everyone really couldn't hold on

150
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,640
so I just...

151
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,960
Actually, Zihan

152
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,080
and the others didn't know

153
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,080
that at the first night's dinner

154
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,640
Chichi texted me saying

155
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,800
she wanted to sit next to me.

156
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,680
But since we were in the cabin,

157
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,840
everyone got along pretty well.

158
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,920
And then...

159
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,120
I didn't want to

160
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,440
use a really forceful

161
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,120
or aggressive

162
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,800
yes, direct way to break

163
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,000
everyone's

164
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,280
I get it.

165
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,080
friendship or relationship.

166
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,760
That's it.

167
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,080
Yeah, that's nice and generous.

168
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,400
Suddenly,

169
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,240
change the subject.

170
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,160
I think these two

171
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,680
just want to leave the "battlefield" fast.

172
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,720
Find a hole to hide in first.

173
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,640
Were you starting to

174
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,960
feel a bit unsure then?

175
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,480
Thinking about making this compromise?

176
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah, at that time

177
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,480
Zihan brought it up.

178
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,160
To think from a girl's perspective.

179
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,000
When she made that choice,

180
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,640
what was her point of view?

181
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,160
That move—

182
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,480
When you did that move,

183
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,400
what were you thinking?

184
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,040
So cool, really.

185
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,160
Chichi will understand when she sees this.

186
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,920
From my understanding,

187
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,240
at that moment,

188
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,120
Ruolong and Wang Jue had already left.

189
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,440
Everyone was afraid of saying goodbye again.

190
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,640
To anyone.

191
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,400
Everyone still wanted harmony

192
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,280
as the shared goal.

193
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,200
No one wanted to leave.

194
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,800
Because Yifan, from start to finish,

195
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,440
was always very sure

196
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,840
about choosing Yuxing.

197
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,920
So maybe she also wanted

198
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,800
the last trip

199
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,840
to have no regrets.

200
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,560
So I can understand her.

201
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,680
And I can understand Yuxing too.

202
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,600
Yes.

203
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,840
I think Yifan is really brave.

204
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,720
That's right.

205
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,040
Now let's test

206
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,960
our two new friends.

207
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,280
On Heart Signal Season Eight,

208
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,680
see what they know.

209
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,000
And our two guys

210
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,160
can join in too.

211
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,280
I've got some quick-answer questions.

212
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,040
Please answer as fast as you can.

213
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,480
Whoever gets the most right

214
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,360
will win

215
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,840
the Heart Signal

216
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,160
official Heartbeat Light-Up Bracelet.

217
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,400
Are you ready?

218
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,000
Ready.

219
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,360
Go ahead.

220
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:29,960
Okay.

221
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,880
Question:

222
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,920
When the guys split into travel groups,

223
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,600
during the selection,

224
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,360
who made the first choice?

225
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,760
Three, two, one—

226
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,960
Jiao Zhiheng.

227
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,400
Doctor Fang.

228
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,360
Correct, that's right.

229
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,560
Second question:

230
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,000
In the Dog Walk Diary,

231
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,520
which guy's name

232
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,000
shows up the most?

233
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,440
Yuxing.

234
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,200
That's right.

235
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,160
Awesome.

236
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,480
Okay, next up—

237
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,400
In the Heartbeat Apartment,

238
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,040
who loves spicy crayfish the most?

239
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,080
Lan Lan.

240
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,280
Correct, impressive!

241
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,760
It's me.

242
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,400
Yes, you won the game.

243
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,440
Applause.

244
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,840
Great job.

245
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,120
Thank you.

246
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,080
Thanks, everyone.

247
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,320
Lechen.

248
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:19,560
Lechen, come here.

249
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,120
Thanks for your effort.

250
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,800
Thank you.

251
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,280
Thanks.

252
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,800
Hope you like it.

253
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:27,800
Thank you.

254
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,920
So pretty.

255
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,200
Red one.

256
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,400
There's both blue and red.

257
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,360
Alright, let's keep watching.

258
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,720
What did he say?

259
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,720
Separation anxiety.

260
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,240
Because you just left two days ago.

261
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,280
He misses me, right?

262
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,480
Do you feel sad too?

263
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,240
A little bit, yeah.

264
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,640
Because at this moment,

265
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,120
I can understand everyone's feelings.

266
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,080
Yes.

267
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,680
I want to talk with everyone too.

268
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,320
But right now,

269
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,440
people's emotions can't always

270
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,120
be controlled rationally.

271
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,480
So the whole vibe

272
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,160
gets a bit delicate.

273
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,640
I think you're so rational.

274
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,400
I'm super rational.

275
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,800
You're really a little sun.

276
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,280
Doctor Fang, hehe.

277
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,160
Doctor Fang says, "The savior is here."

278
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,160
The savior is here.

279
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,280
I think the friendship between you two

280
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:26,880
is also very precious.

281
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:27,800
Yes.

282
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,600
Actually, through this trip,

283
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,240
I got closer to Duoduo as well.

284
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,560
Yes.

285
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,760
Honestly, gaining friendship is also

286
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,560
very important in the cabin.

287
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,160
It's truly precious, yes.

288
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
After I talked things out with Jiao Ge,

289
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,120
and then when Duoduo arrived,

290
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,040
the atmosphere among us

291
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,480
became so much better.

292
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,520
My original intention

293
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,320
was for everyone to

294
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,360
have fun during this journey.

295
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,240
No matter what

296
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,800
kind of way we get along,

297
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,480
just enjoy the moment

298
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,080
and create beautiful memories.

299
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,160
I think communication is quite important.

300
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,880
Everyone has their own way

301
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,520
of interacting.

302
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,120
Yes.

303
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,480
A lot of times, it depends on

304
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,880
something called "energy field."

305
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,080
The energy field matters a lot.

306
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,080
Energy field.

307
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
So what kind of energy does Lu Yuan have?

308
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,760
When you two are together,

309
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,200
what kind of energy do you feel?

310
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,000
Is it calm,

311
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,560
sweet, or something else?

312
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,600
But I don't want to define it strictly.

313
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,360
I think it has all kinds of feelings.

314
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,240
It's comfortable.

315
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,720
Yes, after spending time together,

316
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,000
at least I feel comfortable.

317
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,880
That feeling, you can't fool yourself.

318
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,920
I think she's really comfortable with Lu Yuan.

319
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,080
Yes, it's really comfortable.

320
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,600
She just starts "grinning."

321
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,560
What's up?

322
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,000
Why are you already "grinning"?

323
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,760
Let's ask Lan Lan then.

324
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,480
Me?

325
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,080
Because I remember

326
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,480
the way you look at Doctor Fang.

327
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,360
It's just different.

328
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,320
You keep staring at him.

329
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,120
I could stare at you too.

330
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,120
But I always feel

331
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,040
there are

332
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,520
stars in your eyes.

333
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,720
What's in them?

334
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,480
Stars.

335
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,040
Freshness.

336
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,600
Stars.

337
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,200
Stars.

338
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,320
Sorry.

339
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,320
Actually, I think "freshness" isn't wrong.

340
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,800
Because Doctor Fang

341
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,800
is a type I've rarely met.

342
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,840
That kind of person.

343
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,040
What type is he?

344
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,040
It's hard to describe.

345
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,440
But it's a different "flavor."

346
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:12,960
"Flavor."

347
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,640
So what kind of "flavor" is it?

348
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,480
He's your roommate.

349
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,560
You probably know him well.

350
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,680
But a male perspective

351
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,080
is different from a female perspective.

352
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,120
So you can keep watching.

353
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,080
Yes, keep pursuing.

354
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:25,520
Okay.

355
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,600
Okay.

356
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,480
So cute, giving the turtle a bath.

357
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,320
It feels like Chichi has also

358
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,000
opened up more here.

359
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,280
Yes.

360
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,400
She cares.

361
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:31,960
She does.

362
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,760
I don't really like this side of myself.

363
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,760
He's really good at it.

364
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,360
He cheers up quickly.

365
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,920
The way he looks at her

366
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,920
says "I like you."

367
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,680
Actually, Chichi just said

368
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,560
she sometimes doubts herself.

369
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,560
Then Zihan here

370
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,440
came up with a way

371
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,160
to encourage her every day.

372
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:51,480
Yes.

373
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,720
When I see you, I'll say three things

374
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,440
to praise you.

375
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,120
Words of praise for you.

376
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,760
You give great emotional value.

377
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,000
You're wonderful too.

378
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,600
Thank you.

379
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,680
I will.

380
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,760
We match.

381
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,720
We match.

382
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,280
I like this phrase.

383
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,560
You deserve all the good things.

384
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,600
It's very straightforward.

385
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,360
I think she really needs

386
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,280
this kind of encouragement.

387
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,600
Actually, Chichi in this state

388
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,040
is just great.

389
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,560
Just like me.

390
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,200
Shared values are what matter.

391
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,120
That sounds pretty masculine.

392
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:15,920
Yes.

393
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,840
Emotional value is maxed out.

394
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,600
If fireworks fade quickly,

395
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,360
then set off more of them.

396
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,360
Keep setting them off.

397
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,800
The good and bad of a trip

398
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,760
aren't decided by the average.

399
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,320
It's about the most memorable

400
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,680
moment and feeling.

401
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,320
Or by how it ends.

402
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,040
Zihan told her, "You deserve it. You match."

403
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,000
I'll praise you three times every day.

404
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,080
So I think the whole journey

405
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,880
for her

406
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,960
was full of happiness and joy.

407
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,240
Here, he actually

408
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,640
left an emotional anchor.

409
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,600
So Chichi will look forward to

410
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,760
whether every day after this

411
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,560
she'll get those three compliments.

412
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,000
Let's keep watching.

413
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,360
Back in the cabin,

414
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,080
I was just like you all.

415
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,360
Whenever I saw Yuxing, I wanted to laugh.

416
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,960
I really did.

417
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:25,920
What are you laughing at?

418
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,880
Random things make me laugh.

419
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,400
Nervous.

420
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,920
At a loss.

421
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,440
Look.

422
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,440
Rubbing hands.

423
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,000
Pretty cute.

424
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:43,920
It's a habit.

425
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,800
Actually, what she's saying is

426
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,520
she firmly chose you.

427
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,840
So she

428
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,920
made this choice.

429
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,440
Where are you guys right now?

430
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,600
This is a guesthouse in Shaoxing.

431
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,680
They decorated it based on

432
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,720
a scene from a Hayao Miyazaki film.

433
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,520
That's how the guesthouse was set up.

434
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,320
So beautiful.

435
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,840
They're all nearby.

436
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,000
But they went to Xinjiang.

437
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,640
We had rainy days the whole time.

438
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,200
But they had sunny weather.

439
00:23:59,080 --> 00:23:59,760
Are you telling her

440
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,920
that you won't give up on Chichi?

441
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,440
Well...

442
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,720
Is there a type you like?

443
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,560
That kind of type?

444
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:31,880
No.

445
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,240
I think feelings like this

446
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,800
are hard to explain.

447
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,680
Sometimes, at first sight,

448
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,920
you just feel something.

449
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,280
With some people, it just feels

450
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:39,960
like friendship.

451
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,000
I get it.

452
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,800
That's really cute.

453
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,320
You two are so straightforward.

454
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,480
Yeah, very direct.

455
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,800
But that's nice too.

456
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:07,920
And I think Yifan

457
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,080
is especially optimistic.

458
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,280
I think for Yifan,

459
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,240
after making her final effort,

460
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,160
once she got a clear answer,

461
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,720
she could finally let go.

462
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,480
She could move on.

463
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,160
Have you ever wondered

464
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,800
how their date is going now?

465
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,160
Yeah, I do think about it.

466
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,080
Like, we're sitting here

467
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:26,720
Like, we're sitting here

468
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,960
watching a movie on a rainy day.

469
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,200
I wonder what they're doing.

470
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:33,600
Yeah.

471
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,840
I mean, what is everyone up to? Right.

472
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,160
Without them,

473
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,640
it's like every day is sunny.

474
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,560
Honestly, they're so shippable.

475
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,720
Yeah.

476
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,640
Have you ever wanted to date?

477
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,400
Seeing this kind of thing,

478
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,480
I've always wanted to be in love.

479
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,640
I'm falling for it.

480
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,240
What's wrong?

481
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,120
So thoughtful, right?

482
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,680
So beautiful.

483
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,360
Is that your phone now?

484
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,400
Is this your current phone wallpaper?

485
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:31,960
I'm shipping them.

486
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,080
You two are really shippable.

487
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:34,640
The two of them are really

488
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,120
The two of them are really

489
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:35,800
like a couple already.

490
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,040
They're in that couple mode.

491
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,240
Well, they did light up the lamp.

492
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,160
Wait, why did you post this photo?

493
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,440
Effortlessly handsome.

494
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,800
I can't take it anymore.

495
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,080
They're really shippable.

496
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,600
Your conversations are so close.

497
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,360
The way you talk.

498
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,280
And it's not even

499
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,400
forced topics or anything.

500
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,040
It's all so natural.

501
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,360
So you two are already holding hands.

502
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,400
So you two are already holding hands.

503
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,000
It feels so natural.

504
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,240
Mainly, he's very proactive.

505
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,120
That initiative of his,

506
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,720
those little moments,

507
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,080
Inside, Lu Yuan must be

508
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,000
so happy.

509
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,040
Her heart must be having a party.

510
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,720
This activity

511
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,120
This project is so much fun.

512
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,000
This angle is hilarious.

513
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,760
He's really shy.

514
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,080
He's so good at this.

515
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,840
You're so good at this.

516
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,320
And not even greedy.

517
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,320
Even walked to a little heart.

518
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,640
Just said it out loud.

519
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,480
So direct—applause for you!

520
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,160
I like you.

521
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,280
This feeling is so nice.

522
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,160
Just started shipping right away.

523
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,560
I want to fall in love.

524
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,080
You guys probably don't need to eat.

525
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,120
You're already full of happiness.

526
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,640
They're really in sync.

527
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,680
Throughout, it all seems—yeah.

528
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,480
You're so good with words.

529
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,080
In the "fish tank,"

530
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,200
"Misheard Lyrics Master"

531
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,800
In the corner of your eye,

532
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,240
Mutual pursuit.

533
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,360
When I watched it,

534
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,000
I felt the same way.

535
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Really?

536
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,200
She remembered what he said offhand.

537
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,880
Every girl wants

538
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,520
to be chosen with certainty.

539
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,280
This dinner conversation was really nice.

540
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,840
So actually, while traveling,

541
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,200
feeling the same joy

542
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,600
or building a sense of connection

543
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,800
is very important.

544
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,520
Right?

545
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,560
So, what do you think helps

546
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,120
to create that kind of connection?

547
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,120
For me, honestly,

548
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,240
it's more about going with the flow.

549
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,920
I don't try to force

550
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,040
or create something on purpose.

551
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,080
Or do anything special.

552
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,920
I think it's just fate.

553
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,280
So you focus on

554
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,400
how you feel in the moment.

555
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,000
It's all very natural.

556
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,440
What about Jin Yuxing?

557
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,800
I agree with what Wang Lechen said.

558
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,280
It's mainly about chemistry.

559
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,400
Right? The more chemistry, the better.

560
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,840
Are you in sync with Chichi?

561
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,160
I think both Chichi and I

562
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,320
are pretty slow-paced people.

563
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,560
We're that kind of person.

564
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,160
I'm even slower, actually.

565
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,680
What do you look like when you're anxious?

566
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,840
When I'm anxious,

567
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,160
I just start rambling.

568
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,080
Chatting with everyone today

569
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,600
feels amazing.

570
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,200
Because I'm someone who

571
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,680
loves to share and express myself.

572
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,560
So usually,

573
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,640
I chat on Xiaohongshu

574
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,640
with everyone.

575
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,640
Or I check out

576
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,360
how others see this topic

577
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,640
and what their take is.

578
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:53,880
Yes.

579
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,920
When I watch Heart Signal,

580
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,640
I often search on Xiaohongshu

581
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,400
to see how people discuss it.

582
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,960
It's fun to ship couples online

583
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,840
and talk about it together.

584
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,720
It's really interesting.

585
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,560
They're a great match.

586
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,080
I think he's pretty much a guide

587
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:30,760
and an encouraging partner.

588
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,160
Yes, a guiding partner.

589
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,720
Definitely.

590
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,920
So cute.

591
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,720
Chichi looks great.

592
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,040
Looks great—no, wait.

593
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,800
Honestly, he's good at taking photos.

594
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,800
Xiaoyuanz

595
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,680
Xiaoyuanz

596
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,640
I noticed

597
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,400
Wang Lechen doesn't talk much with us,

598
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,640
but talks a lot with Xiaoyuanz.

599
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,240
That's different.

600
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,600
A whole string of nonstop chatting.

601
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,120
Didn't sleep well yesterday, sorry.

602
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:50,920
Didn't sleep well yesterday.

603
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,680
Had insomnia.

604
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,320
Started running around.

605
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,400
They feel kind of like a drama couple.

606
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,880
You're really the comic relief this season.

607
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,080
Everyone's dates here are so joyful.

608
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,120
Just feeling sad alone for a bit.

609
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,160
This kind of thing leads to misunderstandings.

610
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,240
Yeah.

611
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,360
Did you later talk to Doctor Fang

612
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,680
to explain the misunderstanding?

613
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,680
So, what did you do?

614
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,480
I told him

615
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,840
I didn't see you today.

616
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,120
I wondered what you were up to.

617
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,200
So awkward.

618
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,440
So much fun.

619
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,960
So curious.

620
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,400
Your trips are all so interesting.

621
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,160
Right?

622
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,200
It's even more fun for those watching.

623
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:29,600
Isn't it?

624
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,520
Maybe it's because I just got back from Xinjiang.

625
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,000
So I really relate to what you said.

626
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,440
Maybe some things happened there,

627
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,320
like little romantic stories.

628
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,680
Having fun is what matters most.

629
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,280
Happiness is the most important thing.

630
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,400
So maybe Wang Lechen, the first time,

631
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,920
was interested in Lu Yuan right away.

632
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,320
Really?

633
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,000
At first sight.

634
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,040
Maybe I tend to trust first impressions.

635
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:52,760
That's how I feel.

636
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,000
It's either first impression or chemistry.

637
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,880
After meeting for the first time,

638
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,080
and exchanging a few words,

639
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,640
I just feel comfortable.

640
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,080
That's good.

641
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,960
But if after meeting,

642
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,480
you realize

643
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,600
something just feels a bit off,

644
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,960
Comfort is the foundation at first meeting.

645
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,120
For a relationship,

646
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,480
whether it can last long-term,

647
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,000
it starts with that first

648
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,760
Wang Lechen just mentioned chemistry.

649
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,320
And first impression.

650
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,920
Is there a sense of destiny in meeting?

651
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,400
Yes.

652
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,880
And finally,

653
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,280
you face adjustments later on.

654
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,080
For me personally,

655
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,600
it's about gaining new perspectives.

656
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,960
There are definitely many

657
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,320
things I didn't do well.

658
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,560
I found some flaws

659
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:34,800
in myself.

660
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,080
I try to improve and fix them.

661
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,720
Actually, I think you did great. Yeah.

662
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:41,520
Alright.

663
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,280
So this time,

664
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,040
we brought you some small gifts.

665
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,320
What are they?

666
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,200
This one is for Jin Yuxing.

667
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,520
Muscle Potato.

668
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,560
Muscle Potato.

669
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,800
Dark-skinned Muscle Potato.

670
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,640
It suits him well.

671
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,800
This one is for Wang Lechen.

672
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,880
This one is for Wang Lechen.

673
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,880
Hope you can feel more at ease.

674
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,440
Thank you.

675
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,320
May you live comfortably every day.

676
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,320
Thank you, same to you.

677
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,160
This is for Lan Lan.

678
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,200
It's a blue Xiaohongshu.

679
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:14,800
Thank you.

680
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,920
I think they're all perfect

681
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,840
for each of us.

682
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,440
I love them, thank you all.

683
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,600
Glad you could come today.

684
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,320
We're happy too.

685
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,600
I think everyone is so genuine.

686
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,680
Yes.

687
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,960
Actually, we have a gift

688
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,880
for both of you.

689
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,400
That's right.

690
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,480
It's from our little house,

691
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,200
the most-used Ice Dominator Cup.

692
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:34,840
Ice Dominator Cup.

693
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,400
So cute.

694
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,680
Cheers!

695
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,920
Hope everyone drinks plenty of water.

696
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,000
Stay healthy and happy every day.

697
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,760
Okay.

698
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,920
Finally, let's all

699
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,520
take a group photo together.

700
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,320
Okay.

701
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,840
Pei Ni Kan Xin Dong: Heartbeat Companion

702
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,120
Heartbeat never ends.

703
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,720
See you next time.

704
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,640
Bye-bye.
