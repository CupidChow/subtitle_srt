1
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,320
Ask

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:10,600
She's so cool

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,400
Ask

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:12,720
Okay

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,080
Sorry

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,960
It's okay

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,760
Are you satisfied with your current seat?

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,560
Why?

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,480
There really are some issues

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,880
That's really hard to answer

11
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,280
I'm satisfied

12
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:47,840
Why?

13
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,720
Because there's someone I want to get to know

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,440
Sitting next to me

15
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,320
These girls are amazing

16
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,240
Because there's someone I want to get to know

17
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,960
Sitting next to me

18
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,440
All the girls are extroverts

19
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,280
Super extrovert

20
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:13,760
Super direct

21
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,480
Super direct

22
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,760
But I didn't expect her to be this direct

23
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,520
Me neither

24
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,440
Just add one more sentence

25
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,360
Say "sitting next to me"

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,640
Very brave.

27
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,040
I just thought of earlier.

28
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,000
What Xu said.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,800
He said her attitude toward

30
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,680
this seat

31
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,000
also represents her attitude toward

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,200
relationships.

33
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:37,720
Firm.

34
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,640
Very firm.

35
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,800
Yes.

36
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,000
I think Yuan Yuan's (Lu Yuan's) situation

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,720
left a deeper impression.

38
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,080
The one where she immediately adjusted.

39
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,560
Yes.

40
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,720
I think she has this

41
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,400
After seeing things clearly,

42
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,880
she makes a decision right then.

43
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,080
Yes.

44
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,280
There needs to be a

45
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,080
change and response to my love.

46
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,600
And also,

47
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,360
if you want in this kind of

48
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,040
environment...

49
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,640
Suddenly, I said I wanted to

50
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,840
change my answer.

51
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,400
It still shows that

52
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,680
she is a person

53
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,840
with certain qualities.

54
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,520
Yes.

55
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,280
It feels like love at this stage

56
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,160
doesn't need to be spoken out loud.

57
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,000
But I

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,120
understand what you mean.

59
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,600
And I'll also let you know what I mean.

60
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,520
And on the other side,

61
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,320
actually, Fang (Fang Yijiong)

62
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,200
gave a message

63
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,440
that was also very clear.

64
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,200
I sent the message too late.

65
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,040
And he also

66
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,480
kept looking at the other person.

67
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,120
He wasn't just

68
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,360
hinting at it.

69
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,400
It was very clear.

70
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,280
If you're slow, you'll miss out.

71
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,400
Yes, exactly—if you're slow, you'll miss out.

72
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,160
Right, if you're slow, you'll miss out.

73
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,440
As for Jin Yuxing now,

74
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,800
he also hasn't clearly

75
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,320
expressed his feelings.

76
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,040
It seems that later on,

77
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,680
when Chichi (Sun Hanqing) arrived,

78
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,960
it seemed to give Jin Yuxing

79
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,040
a different feeling.

80
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,120
Yes, because of Chichi (Sun Hanqing)'s choice.

81
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,280
Why did you sit

82
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,920
next to Jin Yuxing?

83
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,320
Is it also because you want

84
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,360
to get to know him better

85
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,680
and are more curious about him?

86
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,400
But I have a feeling

87
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,200
that just now, Wang Yifan and

88
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,480
Jin Yuxing's conversation

89
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,240
made them feel like there was

90
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,480
something between Wang Yifan and Jin Yuxing.

91
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:50,800
Yeah.

92
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,520
Just now, afterwards, Wang Yifan

93
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,000
also talked with Jin Yuxing,

94
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,520
like, whoever asks the question, right?

95
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,240
So what about Wang Lechen?

96
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,960
It should be pretty difficult for Wang Lechen.

97
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,720
That feeling is like

98
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,000
if suddenly

99
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,120
three people

100
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,240
at the same time

101
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,320
send you that signal.

102
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,040
But basically,

103
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,200
he hasn't had the chance yet

104
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,760
to really get to know the three of them.

105
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,120
It's difficult.

106
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,920
It's okay. I think right now,

107
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,920
in this process,

108
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,960
we've already analyzed some

109
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,440
important information

110
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,320
and also seen the center of some whirlpools.

111
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:15,880
And also,

112
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,000
in this process,

113
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,120
there are still some people

114
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,800
who want to

115
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,120
use various ways

116
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,800
to increase their understanding of each other.

117
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,320
So we too

118
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,800
will carry this suspense

119
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,200
and continue to see

120
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,280
what will happen next.

121
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,440
What is this?

122
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,920
This is...

123
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,120
What is this?

124
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,480
A special gift.

125
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,680
So cute.

126
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,960
Hello, dear guests.

127
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,720
This is prepared for all of you.

128
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,960
An exclusive trial romance travel package.

129
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,640
If you have already decided

130
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,440
who your final romantic interest is,

131
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,400
and you won't change your mind,

132
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,440
you can invite him or her in advance

133
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,960
to join the trial romance trip.

134
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,000
Together, you can embark on a journey tailored just for you.

135
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,160
A romantic trip.

136
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,720
But this is a journey that requires mutual commitment

137
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,280
to begin.

138
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,120
We hope that during

139
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,800
the process of sincere interaction,

140
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,320
you can find in advance

141
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,240
the one who will embark on the journey with you.

142
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,360
Okay.

143
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,040
This time, both sides need to be clear about their feelings.

144
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,520
Right.

145
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,440
That's pretty cool.

146
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,520
Looking forward to it.

147
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,680
Really looking forward to it.

148
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,120
To see this happen even sooner.

149
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,560
That's so nice.

150
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,800
You're actually quite brave.

151
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,520
Really?

152
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,960
Each of them has one.

153
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,120
It's just a fleeting moment.

154
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,800
It's just a fleeting moment.

155
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,520
Something that might happen in the future.

156
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,760
Yes.

157
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:39,960
So looking forward to it.

158
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,360
Really looking forward to it.

159
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,160
Celebrate

160
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,480
Let's move into the cabin tomorrow.

161
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,720
We'll move in together.

162
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,200
Okay.

163
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,800
See you tomorrow.

164
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,880
Cheers.

165
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,440
Cheers.

166
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,080
May we be happy every day.

167
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,160
Happy.

168
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,480
Let's go.

169
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,720
See you tomorrow.

170
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,160
In this process,

171
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,960
the most important thing is

172
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,600
we need it to be mutual,

173
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,880
it has to be mutual,

174
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,680
to make a match.

175
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,840
Because before, the "light up" option

176
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,720
could be one-sided.

177
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,160
Right.

178
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,280
But this one has to be mutual.

179
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,040
Right.

180
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,160
So the risk is a bit higher.

181
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,720
This is quite difficult.

182
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,160
The guests who mutually "light up" right now

183
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,280
will have to leave the house

184
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,840
and go on a trip together.

185
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,920
They'll start living their happy days together.

186
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,320
That's pretty bold.

187
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:24,640
I think

188
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,880
this also takes courage.

189
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,560
And I think

190
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,600
the name of this trip

191
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,280
is also great.

192
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,800
It's called "Trial Love Trip."

193
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,520
Trial love.

194
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,120
It's like a bridge between this house

195
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,120
and the real world.

196
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,040
That's how it feels.

197
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,280
Through this trial love,

198
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,240
they can, in real life,

199
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,880
move toward a committed relationship.

200
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,560
But what if

201
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,400
they find out after the trip that things aren't going well?

202
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,640
What should they do?

203
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
That's good too.

204
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,120
Right.

205
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,040
We've also fully explored

206
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,200
one possibility.

207
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,840
It's also a kind of learning.

208
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,080
And our trial romance travel bracelets

209
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,520
are from us,

210
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,800
from the seventh season of "Signal of the Heart,"

211
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,320
designed for us by Li Dinghao.

212
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,240
He's a fashion accessory designer.

213
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,960
Yes.

214
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,440
Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng),

215
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,120
while they were heading home,

216
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,400
also started sending

217
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,320
their heart-fluttering messages.

218
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,640
What I want to know most is about Ruilong.

219
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,280
Ruilong.

220
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:00,760
Right.

221
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,920
Who will he connect with?

222
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,080
Actually, next,

223
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,000
we'll be able to see

224
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,920
this information right away.

225
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,320
That's great.

226
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,440
After the group dinner,

227
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,200
the first heart-fluttering message

228
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,440
in the end,

229
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,560
how will it be sent?

230
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,640
First, we can

231
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,120
announce

232
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,400
which girls

233
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,480
each of the boys are interested in.

234
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:17,960
Let's do it.

235
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,520
(Ruilong) chose

236
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,120
Chichi (Sun Hanqing)

237
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,840
Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong) chose

238
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,760
Lanlan (Xu Rulan)

239
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,200
Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng) chose

240
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,160
Lanlan (Xu Rulan)

241
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,960
Jin Yuxing also chose Lanlan (Xu Rulan)

242
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,600
Everyone chose

243
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,600
Lanlan (Xu Rulan)

244
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,960
Only Ruilong chose

245
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,720
Chichi (Sun Hanqing)

246
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,760
Four votes

247
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,800
All went to Chichi

248
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,880
She is the type of girl

249
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,280
that boys really like

250
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,640
Let's analyze this

251
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,400
Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng)

252
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,320
chose Lanlan (Xu Rulan)

253
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,520
Let's be clear

254
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,240
Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong)

255
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,920
chose Lanlan (Xu Rulan)

256
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,400
Let's be clear

257
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,440
Ruilong chose

258
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:53,960
Chichi (Sun Hanqing)

259
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,160
As long as he's happy

260
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,160
Wang Lechen

261
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,520
chose Lanlan (Xu Rulan)

262
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,480
This

263
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,800
Here

264
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,600
At their dinner in the restaurant

265
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,320
The first guy

266
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,440
The first girl

267
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,240
That's the one

268
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,360
The moment of instant attraction

269
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,640
When they first came in

270
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,840
They sat facing each other

271
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,720
I guess at that moment

272
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,440
Wang Lechen was already

273
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,200
already

274
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,240
struck by it

275
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,400
I’d like to add something.

276
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:18,600
That is,

277
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,600
about Lanlan (Xu Rulan).

278
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,120
I think she has

279
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,880
some qualities worth learning from.

280
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,480
Qualities worth learning from.

281
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,840
For one, she knows how to make everyone feel comfortable.

282
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,000
At ease.

283
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,120
I think that’s not easy.

284
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,960
She has this ability to

285
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,920
create a positive atmosphere.

286
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,360
Her way can actually help

287
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,200
move a relationship forward.

288
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,000
I think this aspect

289
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,480
is really

290
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,280
worth learning from.

291
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,920
Definitely worth learning.

292
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,280
When you talk with her,

293
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:42,800
it’s unlikely that

294
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,960
it’s unlikely that

295
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,520
there will be any awkward silences.

296
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,040
She’s also a very confident girl.

297
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,640
So when communicating,

298
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,400
she doesn’t make the other person feel pressured.

299
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,960
A confident girl like her

300
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,960
is likely to leave a good impression on guys.

301
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,400
And relatively speaking,

302
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:58,840
And relatively speaking,

303
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,480
if most of the guys

304
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,520
tend to be less talkative,

305
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,360
there's usually

306
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,880
a girl who will take the initiative to break the ice.

307
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,760
It tends to happen a bit faster.

308
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,440
It tends to happen a bit faster.

309
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,520
Yeah.

310
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,600
I think it's her.

311
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
She gives off a kind of

312
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,520
feeling that makes you really want to be around her.

313
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,400
Yeah.

314
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,080
And you feel like

315
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,640
being with her

316
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,200
is just very comfortable.

317
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:15,920
No matter what you say to her,

318
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,120
you feel like her

319
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,720
you feel like her

320
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,040
eyes are very sincere.

321
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,320
And then

322
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,840
you just feel like

323
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,960
this person is really

324
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,240
making you feel important.

325
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,640
Yeah.

326
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,480
Like that.

327
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,240
Next, let's take a look

328
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,160
at the girls' side.

329
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,080
Who?

330
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,080
Jin Yuxing got two votes.

331
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,080
One is Chichi (Sun Hanqing),

332
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,520
and one is Duoduo (Ke Ailin).

333
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,680
And Wang Lechen got four votes.

334
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,520
Why would Duoduo (Ke Ailin)

335
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,800
vote for Jin Yuxing?

336
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,080
Hasn't Duoduo (Ke Ailin) always been

337
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,880
with Wang Lechen?

338
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,240
Duoduo (Ke Ailin) chose Jin Yuxing.

339
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,280
Okay.

340
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,280
Everyone else voted for Wang Lechen.

341
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,240
What about the other three?

342
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,360
No one chose them.

343
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,160
To be honest,

344
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:58,920
our show

345
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,880
is already in its eighth season.

346
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,920
This kind of voting

347
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,400
is truly shocking.

348
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,880
It hasn't happened before, right?

349
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,200
One person got four votes.

350
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:05,880
And

351
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,600
the two students who each got four votes

352
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,240
chose each other

353
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,120
as their pick.

354
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,000
Yes, it's mutual between them.

355
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:12,880
But look,

356
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,400
that Wang Lechen,

357
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,600
he actually doesn't talk much.

358
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,800
But Lanlan (Xu Rulan)

359
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,200
might like this kind of person.

360
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,920
It's like there's a bit of a push-and-pull dynamic.

361
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,720
So I think

362
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,520
Wang Lechen is very gentlemanly,

363
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,640
and also very steady.

364
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,640
Plus, he's good-looking.

365
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,640
So I think

366
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,080
a lot of girls might

367
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,440
have chosen Wang Lechen

368
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,080
in the first round of voting.

369
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,040
And it's the same logic for Xu Rulan.

370
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,800
If it were me,

371
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,520
I think this boy

372
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,240
is pretty quiet,

373
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,280
and seems a bit introverted.

374
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,520
He also doesn't really

375
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,720
like to talk much

376
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,320
or express himself.

377
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,400
I think this trait

378
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,800
and the fact that he looks great in a suit

379
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,000
give him a nice contrast.

380
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What I like about him is

381
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,200
he can joke around with others,

382
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,480
and he can also take

383
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,560
others joking about him.

384
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,000
Yeah.

385
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,800
I think maybe

386
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,000
everyone likes to see

387
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,880
that

388
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,120
people have different layers

389
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,200
and some variety to them.

390
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,080
That leaves a deeper impression on you.

391
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,240
But I really want to see

392
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,360
the two of them alone together

393
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,720
and how it feels when they interact

394
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,880
Like a clash between experts?

395
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,320
In your mind, you've already

396
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,720
defined them, haven't you?

397
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,240
I think both of them

398
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,560
are people who

399
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,240
really know how to show

400
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:13,920
their own charm

401
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,600
Yes

402
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,040
So I think

403
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,760
I'm especially eager to see the two of them

404
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,240
when they're alone together

405
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,320
and how they interact

406
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,160
Let's take a look

407
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,400
at the messages they sent

408
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:22,840
Shall we?

409
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,640
Okay

410
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,360
I'm really looking forward to

411
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,400
the time we'll spend together

412
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,800
I wonder if you feel the same way

413
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,880
Thank you for the unexpected gift

414
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,760
What kind of gift is it, exactly?

415
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,840
I'm glad you came

416
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,040
Looking forward to a happy life together in the cabin

417
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,640
Very polite and very cute

418
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,080
We meet again

419
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,640
Really looking forward to tomorrow

420
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,440
We

421
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,920
are like old friends who've known each other for a long time

422
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,960
It's as if we

423
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,600
just met for the first time

424
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,720
but can already

425
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,000
get along so well

426
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,120
Hello, Lechen

427
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,720
Please take care of me from now on

428
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,040
Very pure

429
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,760
It's nice to get to know each other slowly

430
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,160
See you tomorrow

431
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,960
I hope you like the gift I prepared for you today.

432
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,120
In return,

433
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,080
can we have cilantro beef tomorrow?

434
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,360
Look,

435
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,680
actually, this kind of information is needed.

436
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,320
This information is

437
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,600
useful information.

438
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,160
Yes.

439
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,360
Because they all mentioned

440
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,080
that the guy is good at cooking.

441
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,360
So she directly invited him for tomorrow.

442
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,680
Details.

443
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,840
Lanlan (Xu Rulan) might know.

444
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,160
Being able to cook actually adds a lot of points.

445
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,080
Do girls like guys who can cook?

446
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,480
He does.

447
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:50,800
This thing

448
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,720
I think definitely

449
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,480
is good.

450
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,960
It shows that you

451
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,800
in the days to come

452
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,320
can cook.

453
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,520
I feel like your appearance and your inner self

454
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,920
each have their own unique little world.

455
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,880
I really want to get to know

456
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,600
the different sides of you.

457
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,200
I'm very happy to meet everyone today.

458
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,120
Thank you for the flowers.

459
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,240
I'll make sure to keep that one flower you gave me.

460
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,600
Looking forward to seeing you again tomorrow.

461
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,800
Alright, next

462
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,160
let's carry all these expectations

463
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,080
and share a little

464
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,880
with everyone.

465
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,960
This season,

466
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,920
we've upgraded from our Heartbeat Cabin

467
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,000
to the Heartbeat Apartment.

468
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,480
Let's see

469
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,040
what kind of signals everyone will give off

470
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,640
after moving into our Heartbeat Apartment.

471
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,320
Let's all take a look together.

472
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,080
They're finally here.

473
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,680
It's so beautiful.

474
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,120
I'm really curious about their professions.

475
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,040
Will their jobs be revealed when they return to the cabin?

476
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,880
Yes.

477
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,560
Jiaxing.

478
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,800
This place is just so beautiful.

479
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,800
The Heartbeat Cabin is built inside a park.

480
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,520
This is the first floor of the Heartbeat Apartment.

481
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,880
There's also a gym.

482
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,320
And a movie lounge.

483
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,840
This is a new kind of

484
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,200
dating place.

485
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:32,880
It feels

486
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,480
so nice here,

487
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,040
it's perfect for falling in love.

488
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,960
Is the sleep zone for sleeping?

489
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,160
Yes, it's a rest area.

490
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:45,800
Living area.

491
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,440
Everyone can work here,

492
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,840
spend time together, and eat.

493
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,000
Here they come.

494
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,760
They've checked in.

495
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:00,840
Let's meet soon.

496
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,720
Good Sleep Zone

497
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,080
Hello.

498
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,480
Hello, sweetheart.

499
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,480
Introduce her.

500
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,160
Take a look around.

501
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:17,560
Sure.

502
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,000
Okay.

503
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,320
There's also a slide.

504
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,640
This little house looks so nice.

505
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,680
It really is nice.

506
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,640
Check out my (room).

507
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,560
Let me see.

508
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,200
Actually, during the dinner,

509
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,360
they already chose their rooms.

510
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,560
Room 801 is on the first floor.

511
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,760
Room 802 is on the second floor.

512
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,720
I want to visit the second floor.

513
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,040
Yours is blue here.

514
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,080
So refreshing.

515
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,280
Let's take a look.

516
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,760
Yours looks very business-like.

517
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,400
I like this room.

518
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,600
This room is really nice.

519
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,680
The Heartbeat Apartment is divided into a Good Sleep Zone and a Living Zone.

520
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,480
Nicole and Winnie are the apartment's guard dogs.

521
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,920
Every day, one man and one woman are needed

522
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,960
to take them to the park

523
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,920
to let them burn off energy.

524
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,640
So there are pets.

525
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,200
Nicole.

526
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,040
Let's go see the doggies.

527
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,520
Where are Nicole and Winnie?

528
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,520
Are they in the Living Zone?

529
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,200
So cute.

530
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,240
Corgi.

531
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:30,920
Little butt.

532
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,640
Super cute.

533
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,640
Hello.

534
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,360
Puppy.

535
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,800
It's so adorable.

536
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,880
It's really well-behaved.

537
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,360
Look, there's another one over there.

538
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,240
Alaskan Malamute.

539
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,920
Both of them are so energetic.

540
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,600
This totally fulfills my idea of home.

541
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,760
All my imagination.

542
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,480
This is the dining room.

543
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,240
The residents of 8-1 and 8-2

544
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,920
need to prepare dinner in their own kitchens.

545
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,440
Look how happy they are.

546
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,720
This should be Western food.

547
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,480
There's black pepper sauce.

548
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,320
This kitchen is so beautiful.

549
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,120
This kitchen is really nice.

550
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,120
It looks so pretty from this angle.

551
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,320
Here they come.

552
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,040
Duoduo (Ke Ailin).

553
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,440
So cute.

554
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,880
Hello.

555
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,200
So cute.

556
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,800
Jue Bao'er (Wang Jue)

557
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Who came back?

558
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,160
Is it Duoduo (Ke Ailin)?

559
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:38,920
Duoduo (Ke Ailin)

560
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,680
I missed you so much.

561
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,720
My bestie is here.

562
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,240
So cute.

563
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,000
Hello.

564
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,480
Um...

565
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,000
I have a really heavy suitcase.

566
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,040
So I might need some help.

567
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,400
I'll go help you carry it.

568
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,000
Jin Yuxing, go help out.

569
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,200
Thank you.

570
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,200
I'll go with you.

571
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,080
Duoduo (Ke Ailin)

572
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,040
I'll put this in the fridge.

573
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,040
We might need it later.

574
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,160
You can put it in the kitchen for now.

575
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,680
I'll take care of it later.

576
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,680
Okay.

577
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,440
I'll move it over first.

578
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,240
So we'll just cook here today.

579
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:08,840
Yeah.

580
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,480
Let's start.

581
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:11,600
Let's start.

582
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,760
She brought ingredients too.

583
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,280
This is...

584
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,320
This is shrimp.

585
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,680
Take the bag out too.

586
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,040
Cilantro.

587
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,240
We brought exactly the same ingredients.

588
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,120
Because yesterday we said

589
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,640
we'd make cilantro beef.

590
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,720
We both brought it.

591
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,360
So when you cook,

592
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,920
it should be really delicious.

593
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,800
He can cook beef.

594
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,360
His beef is really tasty.

595
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,800
He can also cook shrimp.

596
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,040
Braised pork.

597
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,600
Yeah, he's really good at cooking.

598
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,200
Sorry.

599
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,240
We both brought it.

600
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,680
We both bought a portion for Wang Lechen.

601
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,280
Yeah.

602
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,200
Now there's an extra piece of meat.

603
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,440
Yeah, another piece of beef.

604
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,400
Cilantro.

605
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,600
You can't eat that.

606
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,640
The kitchen is here.

607
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,000
You can't eat it.

608
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You can't eat it.

609
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,280
Stop sniffing.

610
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,440
Hello, Xiaofang.

611
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,560
Hello.

612
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,880
So, are we all here?

613
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,000
No, the two guys

614
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,480
are eating on the other side.

615
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,880
They’re eating over there.

616
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,320
We’re all squeezed into one kitchen.

617
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,440
Isn’t it too crowded?

618
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,680
I finished over there.

619
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,560
Okay.

620
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,640
That’s it.

621
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,480
Chichi.

622
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,080
Coming.

623
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,360
Hello.

624
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,560
Hello.

625
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,760
Hello, is anyone here?

626
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,120
Hello.

627
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:31,960
Hello.

628
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,560
Baby.

629
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,080
Did you get here early?

630
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,240
No, I just got here. Give it to me.

631
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,400
Alaska.

632
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,240
I love Alaska the most.

633
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,280
Her name is Nicole.

634
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:40,880
Hello.

635
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,280
How did you know her name is Nicole?

636
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:42,920
They told me.

637
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,520
These two dogs have such good temperaments.

638
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,880
Chichi (Sun Hanqing) is here.

639
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,360
Hello.

640
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,160
Hello.

641
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,560
You all have already started cooking?

642
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,160
Yes.

643
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,160
What are you making?

644
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,400
Shrimp—do you know how to cook it?

645
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,440
Should we leave the shrimp for him to cook?

646
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,240
I bought a portion of shrimp.

647
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,840
Who is it for?

648
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,760
It's the stuff you bought.

649
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,800
I bought one portion of everything.

650
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,600
What should we do?

651
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,200
It's fine.

652
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,280
Then let's put it in the fridge.

653
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,000
Okay.

654
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,240
Let's wait for Wang Lechen to cook the Macrobrachium shrimp.

655
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,960
Macrobrachium shrimp, right?

656
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,320
You bought this Macrobrachium shrimp, right?

657
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,520
Yes, because isn't he the one who wants to cook it?

658
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,840
Macrobrachium shrimp with butter.

659
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,440
Then let him have it.

660
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,520
I bought white shrimp.

661
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,120
That's fine, just boil the white shrimp directly.

662
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,440
Right.

663
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,440
Just boil it.

664
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,760
Has Wang Lechen come back yet?

665
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,640
Wang Lechen specifically asked to make this.

666
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,040
Answering the wrong question

667
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,320
Realizing it late

668
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,320
That reaction is really cute

669
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,840
Yeah, he even specifically ordered cilantro beef

670
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,760
And he still hasn't come back

671
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,800
A subtle reaction

672
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,720
So does anyone cook among you?

673
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,560
Yeah

674
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,360
It's just that

675
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,840
You went to that kitchen again and came back

676
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,800
Not enough to keep you busy, baby

677
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,160
I think Wang Jue

678
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,600
picked up on some information

679
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,640
Actually, Wang Jue has

680
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,840
an interest in Wang Lechen, right?

681
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:20,880
Hello, everyone

682
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,680
Eat, eat (Sun Hanqing)

683
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,240
Hello

684
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:24,640
Hello

685
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,880
What are we eating over here?

686
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,400
We’re actually pretty quick

687
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,600
Because of these

688
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,600
This is ready-to-eat

689
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,400
I think it’s just

690
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,800
Just pop it in the air fryer and it’s done

691
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,520
This one

692
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,600
Do you know how to make it?

693
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,840
I know a little

694
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,800
So you can make it

695
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,400
I want to wash my hands

696
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,320
Then what can I do?

697
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,400
We can prepare a bit

698
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,480
like green onions, ginger, garlic, and so on

699
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,360
Green onions

700
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,440
Two people can cook together

701
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,360
That feels really nice too

702
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,840
Yeah

703
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,280
You took out the steak.

704
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,560
You want to make steak, right?

705
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,360
Yes.

706
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,240
It's defrosting.

707
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,200
After this, we'll make the steak.

708
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,520
The steak will be quick too.

709
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,400
Smashed cucumber is quick as well.

710
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,200
Then I'll wash the asparagus.

711
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,520
Okay.

712
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,120
That happiness on your face.

713
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,600
Here he comes.

714
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,240
Ruilong.

715
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,240
Hello.

716
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,040
Yes, 802.

717
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,360
Hello.

718
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,800
Hello, you're back.

719
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,680
Hello.

720
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,440
Hello.

721
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,920
Hello, I'm back.

722
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,960
Have you ever defrosted steak?

723
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,760
Usually.

724
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,880
Defrost it in the fridge for a day?

725
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,280
A day? Then do we have to wait until tomorrow to eat it?

726
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,240
There's a defrost button here.

727
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,640
I think we can try one piece.

728
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,360
I think so.

729
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,320
Let's just use the microwave to defrost it.

730
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,320
Okay.

731
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,440
This big one can be cut a bit more.

732
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,560
First.

733
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:39,800
I think that's enough.

734
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,960
Because there are a lot of other dishes.

735
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,400
You cut it open.

736
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,640
Just a little, it's fine.

737
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,160
He hurt his hand.

738
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:56,720
Duoduo (Ke Ailin)

739
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,040
Do you know where I can find

740
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:58,600
band-aids

741
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,640
or a first aid kit?

742
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,080
I'll help you look for it in a bit.

743
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,280
Do you have any in your suitcase?

744
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:03,960
I have some in my suitcase,

745
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,960
but it's iodine.

746
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,640
After applying it, he might not be able to

747
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,600
Yeah, it won't help either.

748
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,640
I didn't bring any band-aids either.

749
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,440
What should we do then?

750
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,960
Looking for band-aids, right?

751
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,160
Yes, looking for band-aids.

752
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,280
This also shows you care a lot.

753
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,040
Don't have any?

754
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,840
No.

755
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,000
Then just tell him not to get it wet.

756
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,000
Did you hurt your hand?

757
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:29,640
It's fine.

758
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,520
I just don't know where

759
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,640
I scraped it a little.

760
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,640
Why don't you wipe your hand first?

761
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,600
It's okay.

762
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,840
I don't think it's a big

763
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,480
deal.

764
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,560
Staring affectionately

765
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,920
at the signal of a crush.

766
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,840
Yeah.

767
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,640
Did you feel it?

768
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,000
It's pretty obvious.

769
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:29,960
Here she comes.

770
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,280
Lanlan (Xu Rulan) has arrived.

771
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:34,920
She looks great.

772
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,600
Why is it that she...

773
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,760
...looks good no matter what?

774
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,400
Why is that?

775
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,520
Hello, everyone.

776
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,760
We meet again.

777
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,520
I'm here.

778
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,040
It smells so good.

779
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,960
We're serving Chinese food here.

780
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,560
And then...

781
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,040
Next door, there are many people making...

782
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,520
...Western food.

783
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,160
So I arrived pretty late, didn't I?

784
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,360
Not really, it's not that late.

785
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,240
Okay.

786
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,960
Then I'll go check on them first.

787
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,920
And then I'll come back to help you.

788
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,720
Alright.

789
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,400
You're back.

790
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,200
Hello, everyone.

791
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,720
Hello.

792
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,240
Hello.

793
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,520
Hello.

794
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:13,800
You all

795
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:14,360
all arrived so early.

796
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,320
All arrived so early.

797
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,640
I'm a bit late today.

798
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,680
It's okay.

799
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,920
We're still in the food prep stage here.

800
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:23,960
We're still in the food prep stage here.

801
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,080
If you need any help from us,

802
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,080
just let us know.

803
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,680
You can start by

804
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,960
washing these pots, bowls, and dishes.

805
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,120
Okay.

806
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,320
See, she's about to

807
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,760
join in that activity right away.

808
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,600
She's very proactive.

809
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,880
This is dish soap, right?

810
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,720
Yes, that's dish soap.

811
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,200
Okay.

812
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,520
Chichi (Sun Hanqing) can't find a way to help.

813
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,200
Right now, Chichi (Sun Hanqing)

814
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,760
really wants to do something.

815
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,520
But she doesn't know what to do.

816
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,280
Suddenly, she doesn't know what to do.

817
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,680
She’s just anxious.

818
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,760
I want to make tomato and scrambled eggs first.

819
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,040
Do you need to beat the eggs?

820
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,480
Yes.

821
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,440
Let me help you beat them.

822
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,920
Beating eggs doesn’t take much skill.

823
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,840
It does take some skill.

824
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,440
She’s probably thinking now

825
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,760
about what else she can do.

826
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,680
We’re also making tomato and scrambled eggs.

827
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,640
Yeah.

828
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,040
This is for making tomato and scrambled eggs.

829
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,040
There’s tomato and scrambled eggs, plus shrimp with soft eggs.

830
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,880
Look at the way she’s doing it.

831
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,480
She’s clearly used to doing this.

832
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,840
Actually, I can cut the tomatoes too.

833
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,160
That works too.

834
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,080
She’s taking the initiative now.

835
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:50,800
I’ll...

836
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,200
I can make tomato and scrambled eggs.

837
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:54,520
Sure.

838
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,120
This is a dish I know how to make.

839
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,800
Do you make it savory or sweet?

840
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,720
I make it sweet.

841
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,920
I like the sweet version too.

842
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,000
How about you?

843
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,120
I like it savory, but it’s fine.

844
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,240
You like it savory?

845
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,520
Maybe over there they...

846
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,720
I can go ask.

847
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,440
Are they making it savory or sweet?

848
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,640
Whatever you make, I’ll eat.

849
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,000
What are you going to do?

850
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,320
I'm going to blanch that tomato.

851
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,360
And you said you only knew a little.

852
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,960
Exactly.

853
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,040
That's just being modest.

854
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,120
The main thing is the contrast.

855
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:30,840
Impressive.

856
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,560
No.

857
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,800
It's a pleasant surprise.

858
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,720
Smells so good.

859
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,000
Chef Fang.

860
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,720
You're really good at cooking.

861
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,440
It really smells amazing.

862
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,640
All by himself,

863
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,160
he filled the kitchen with this aroma

864
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,880
so that everyone can smell it.

865
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,320
See, when a guy can cook,

866
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,520
it’s a bonus.

867
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,600
It really smells so good.

868
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,680
I feel like I can already smell it.

869
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,240
I feel like Wei Ni has been waiting for someone.

870
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:02,800
Look.

871
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,080
Waiting for the beef.

872
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,040
Waiting for the beef.

873
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,800
The person making the beef isn't back yet.

874
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,720
Everyone is waiting for Wang Lechen to cook.

875
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,920
To make the shrimp and beef.

876
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,880
He's here.

877
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,960
Wang Lechen.

878
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,440
He's here.

879
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,240
One hand in his pocket.

880
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,520
All the girls here are waiting for him.

881
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,440
Hello

882
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:05,960
Hello, everyone

883
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,720
You finally came back

884
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,280
Hello

885
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,680
Can you make shrimp?

886
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,000
Can you make cilantro beef?

887
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,760
It's here

888
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,400
All the beef is ready for you

889
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,920
It's all thawed

890
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:28,800
Where's the beef?

891
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,440
Here

892
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,960
I still have to cut it myself

893
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,880
Because we didn't know if you wanted it shredded

894
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,400
Or sliced

895
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,440
The most popular one

896
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,720
Everyone gathered around all of a sudden

897
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,240
If it were that person at this moment

898
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:40,880
Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong)

899
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,880
It would be a bit awkward

900
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,400
Wouldn't it?

901
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,520
Because he would suddenly feel

902
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,600
Why did everyone just gather around?

903
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,760
Because we didn't know if you wanted it shredded

904
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,640
Or sliced

905
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,160
Or cut into strips

906
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:51,680
Right

907
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:52,600
Right

908
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,840
Do you want to cut it into shreds?

909
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:58,840
Slices.

910
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,440
But I think you should wear an apron.

911
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,440
Okay.

912
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,000
Where's the apron?

913
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,280
It's down below.

914
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,160
Below.

915
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,480
Chef.

916
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,400
What are you making, chef?

917
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,320
Tomato and scrambled eggs.

918
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:13,800
Tomato and scrambled eggs.

919
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,720
Are you adding chili?

920
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,480
No.

921
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,240
Thank you.

922
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,280
You’re finally back.

923
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,720
You’re finally back.

924
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,800
We’ve been waiting for you for so long.

925
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:31,600
Really?

926
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:33,920
You missed me that much?

927
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,240
She said what they were all thinking.

928
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,120
That corgi is probably thinking,

929
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,480
“When will your food be ready?”

930
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,560
Yeah, exactly.

931
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,920
Who bought the beef?

932
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,160
Who bought the beef?

933
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:49,760
Both girls bought some.

934
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,480
Both girls bought some.

935
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:50,920
Yeah.

936
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,520
I bought it.

937
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,080
You bought it.

938
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,800
I don’t think I bought this one.

939
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,200
The one I bought is in the fridge.

940
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,720
It’s a bit thin.

941
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,520
Is it not suitable?

942
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,160
Or maybe there are other ingredients in the fridge.

943
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,560
Or maybe there’s more beef in the fridge.

944
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,200
There’s more beef in the fridge.

945
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,320
Everyone keeps talking.

946
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,280
Every sentence overlaps with the next.

947
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:07,840
Yeah.

948
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,280
There’s more beef.

949
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,440
I bought a portion.

950
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,400
And then Duoduo (Ke Ailin)

951
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,160
also bought a portion.

952
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,040
Yeah, you can take a look.

953
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,760
Which one do you want?

954
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,480
We bought quite a lot.

955
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,080
This one is freshly sliced.

956
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,160
It might be more tender.

957
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,480
This chunk.

958
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,880
Yours might be yellow cattle beef.

959
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,160
This one is a bit more tender.

960
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,600
Why don't you cook a bit more?

961
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,440
Sure.

962
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,520
We've been waiting a long time for your beef.

963
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,360
Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong)

964
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,640
He's here.

965
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,760
He's watching the fun from the side.

966
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,000
The girl he likes

967
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,120
is in another kitchen.

968
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,160
That's right.

969
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,960
Is there no pickled chili either?

970
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,120
There is.

971
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,040
There's pickled vegetables.

972
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,600
There are pickled chilies.

973
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,400
Bird's eye chili.

974
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:05,880
Yes, I want it.

975
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,000
Lucky.

976
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,560
Twist it hard.

977
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,520
Bro.

978
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,240
Wait a second.

979
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,960
What's going on?

980
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,560
I can do it.

981
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,480
Let me do it.

982
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,200
Or let us do it.

983
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,480
Or let us do it.

984
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,120
Let me do it.

985
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,480
I really can do it.

986
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,000
No.

987
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,960
I really can do it.

988
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,360
No.

989
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,200
I really can do it.

990
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,160
Wait a second.

991
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,280
Let us do it.

992
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,040
It's fine, give it to me.

993
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,200
No.

994
00:33:59,200 --> 00:33:59,760
Let us do it.

995
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,280
No.

996
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,920
A man's dignity.

997
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,520
Give it to me.

998
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,480
It's fine.

999
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:11,920
Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong)

1000
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,560
He's just watching the commotion from the side.

1001
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:14,760
No.

1002
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,120
Let us do it.

1003
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:15,560
No.

1004
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,680
It's fine.

1005
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,480
Give it to me.

1006
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,280
I'll open it.

1007
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,680
This scene is hilarious.

1008
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,560
She's chasing him, he's running away.

1009
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,160
There's something going on.

1010
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,800
Okay, I got it.

1011
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,600
No, he said "a man's dignity," it should be...

1012
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,400
No, you should smash it once.

1013
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,200
No, you should smash it once.

1014
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,360
He's also very competitive.

1015
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,960
No, you should knock on the edge.

1016
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,480
The girl took it away.

1017
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,280
Yes, hit it hard.

1018
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,120
So it dents in a little.

1019
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,480
It really has to be you.

1020
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:03,800
That works.

1021
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,920
Do you have this many little tricks every day?

1022
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,680
I want to ask.

1023
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,440
Of course.

1024
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,800
I'm a pro at helping out.

1025
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,880
That's impressive.

1026
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,680
Do you know how to open a bottle cap?

1027
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,120
Really fast.

1028
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,480
Got it.

1029
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:23,960
Like this.

1030
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,160
No.

1031
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:25,640
First, tap the bottom, then turn it over.

1032
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,440
First, tap the bottom, then turn it over.

1033
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,600
Then pinch it like this with your hand.

1034
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,160
The cap will pop right up.

1035
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,760
I really want to eat your cooking.

1036
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,320
Your food must be super delicious.

1037
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,360
When can we?

1038
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,560
Give us a chance like that.

1039
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,640
When we go on a trip.

1040
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,280
Tomorrow.

1041
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,840
I want to eat beef.

1042
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,080
I want to eat beef.

1043
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,360
Let's eat beef.

1044
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,560
I want beef with cilantro.

1045
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,160
I want beef with cilantro.

1046
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,120
You can cook when we go on a trip.

1047
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,680
I've been waiting for your beef for a long time.

1048
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,680
You should cook when we go on a trip.

1049
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,280
Beef.

1050
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,200
Turns out it's so fun when everyone talks over each other.

1051
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,160
Yeah.

1052
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,080
Can you feel it?

1053
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,200
Everyone's here.

1054
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,600
When everyone is giving you feedback.

1055
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,200
How do you feel?

1056
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,440
So happy, I don't know what to do.

1057
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,880
I don't even know where to look.

1058
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,720
These two

1059
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,080
These two are both guys from the 802nd floor

1060
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,920
We brought them all over to the 801st floor

1061
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,840
But the guys from the 801st floor are cooking over there

1062
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,400
That's true, yes

1063
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:17,760
Exchange

1064
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,440
We swapped

1065
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,360
And then kept swapping

1066
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:20,880
That's pretty good

1067
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,440
Pretty good

1068
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,400
We really need you guys

1069
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,800
Can you stay here?

1070
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,320
What?

1071
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,080
Can you stay here for good?

1072
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,120
Of course

1073
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,440
See, when a guy can cook

1074
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,400
That's real skill

1075
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,240
Okay

1076
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,040
I'll remember that

1077
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,520
Got it

1078
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,600
There's a fee for that

1079
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,440
No problem

1080
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,520
Teacher Fang cleverly

1081
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,440
avoided this question

1082
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,080
Teacher Fang said, I don't want to

1083
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,000
If I hadn't come back early today

1084
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,680
You want to go take a look, right?

1085
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,120
Here she comes

1086
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,040
Lanlan is coming over

1087
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:53,640
Lanlan

1088
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,280
Hello, everyone

1089
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,560
He's happy now

1090
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,880
He's happy

1091
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,760
We're here to see how you guys are doing

1092
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,840
It feels like there are a lot of experts here.

1093
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,000
But they're all from your floor.

1094
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,240
We've borrowed all of them.

1095
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,160
You came back too late.

1096
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,800
We waited for you so long that even the flowers would have wilted.

1097
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,520
There's some resentment in that sentence.

1098
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,440
Really.

1099
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,120
Can I have

1100
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,400
some of your steak?

1101
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,080
Sure.

1102
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,000
Ruilong is from your side.

1103
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,920
He'll bring it over in a bit.

1104
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,080
Okay.

1105
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,000
But we'll keep exchanging like this.

1106
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,400
Is that okay?

1107
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,080
I...

1108
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,480
It depends on the person.

1109
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,720
We've already asked.

1110
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,680
Looks troubled.

1111
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,680
They don't just want to exchange food.

1112
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,560
Wang Yifan is back.

1113
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,960
What are you planning to make?

1114
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,280
How about stir-frying this chicken?

1115
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,480
Chicken with asparagus.

1116
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,160
Stir-fried chicken with asparagus.

1117
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:16,680
But to be honest,

1118
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,920
it's my first time stir-frying chicken breast today.

1119
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,920
Then I'll do it.

1120
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,360
You know how to stir-fry?

1121
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:19,960
I can do it.

1122
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,640
See?

1123
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,000
This makes it more interactive.

1124
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,880
Stir-frying is still doable.

1125
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,160
Let me check it out first.

1126
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,040
Light soy sauce.

1127
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,200
Chichi (Sun Hanqing)

1128
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,040
At this moment, she

1129
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,760
doesn't really know what to do.

1130
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,920
Yeah, she can't help.

1131
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,880
How does this open?

1132
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,760
We still need to figure it out.

1133
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,320
Like this.

1134
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,520
Like this.

1135
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,320
Bottom left, this one.

1136
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,040
So,

1137
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,360
Wang Yifan, can you cook?

1138
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,320
A little bit.

1139
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:03,960
It's edible.

1140
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,960
The kind that won't "poison" anyone.

1141
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,640
Then I'm about the same as you.

1142
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:12,880
Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng)

1143
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:20,680
Hello.

1144
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,680
Hello, everyone.

1145
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,440
You're back.

1146
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,200
You're back.

1147
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,480
I brought you some fruit.

1148
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,440
Okay.

1149
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,400
There are lychees and mangosteens.

1150
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,320
I'll take them out, then.

1151
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,440
Okay, thank you.

1152
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,840
Then I'll go to the bathroom.

1153
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,680
Have you all been here for a long time?

1154
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,160
No, I just got here twenty minutes ago.

1155
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,360
You just arrived too.

1156
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,240
I thought I was the last one.

1157
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,840
Maybe you really are the last one.

1158
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,280
Is that you?

1159
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,000
It seems like you are.

1160
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,680
Where is the restroom?

1161
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,680
Could it be upstairs?

1162
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,520
There's an upstairs too?

1163
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,240
Yes.

1164
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,040
Have you been to other areas of the park?

1165
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,880
No.

1166
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,040
After we eat, we can all go together.

1167
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,200
We can take a walk around.

1168
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,200
Are we going to the third floor?

1169
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,880
The third floor is the office area.

1170
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:13,920
Your rooms

1171
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,520
are also over in the sleep zone.

1172
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,880
Are you on the 802nd floor or the 801st floor?

1173
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:17,800
I'm on the 801st floor.

1174
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,960
Everyone from the 802nd floor has been borrowed.

1175
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,320
Everyone from the 802nd floor has been borrowed.

1176
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:21,760
What does that mean?

1177
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,680
Because actually,

1178
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,320
our Western restaurant uses the 802nd floor's kitchen.

1179
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,120
And since we arrived too late,

1180
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,040
they went over there to cook first.

1181
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,560
It seems like there isn't a restroom here.

1182
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,960
So there's really none here?

1183
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,040
There probably isn't.

1184
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:36,960
Let's talk about it later then.

1185
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,640
Who's the head chef here?

1186
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,760
Everyone here is a head chef.

1187
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,600
Okay, how can I help?

1188
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,520
I can already tell what Ruilong wants to do.

1189
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,000
Do we still need to chop any more vegetables?

1190
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,360
I think we're almost done chopping.

1191
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,080
Should we chop the scallions?

1192
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,480
I'm not sure if anyone here doesn't eat scallions.

1193
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,320
So I didn't chop them yet.

1194
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,320
Makes sense.

1195
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,440
Do you eat scallions?

1196
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,440
I can eat them.

1197
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,560
But I love cilantro even more.

1198
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,040
Let me do it.

1199
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,160
I'll wash them.

1200
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:34,960
Let me wash them.

1201
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,360
Okay.

1202
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,800
You're really attentive.

1203
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,280
That's great.

1204
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:39,960
Pretty good.

1205
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:57,960
Showing off your skills.

1206
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,560
So professional.

1207
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,040
What are they doing over there?

1208
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,920
I'll go take a look.

1209
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,520
Is this the kind of feedback you want?

1210
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,520
Smells so good.

1211
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,520
So cool.

1212
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,840
Turns out the boss comes whenever you call.

1213
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,160
And you can even learn to cook.

1214
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,360
Excuse me, who said anything about a boss?

1215
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:39,760
Oh no, Duoduo (Ke Ailin).

1216
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,160
She's totally smitten.

1217
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,080
It.

1218
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,480
Turns out you need to put cilantro underneath it.

1219
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,640
That's impressive.

1220
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,080
Nice plating.

1221
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,600
Teacher

1222
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,440
So impressive

1223
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,160
So beautiful

1224
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,160
You really can cook

1225
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:01,760
Extra points

1226
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,040
Alright

1227
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,040
Alright, everyone

1228
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,520
Give half of the cilantro beef to the neighbors

1229
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,160
Okay

1230
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,040
The kitchen is yours now

1231
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:17,680
That's so nice

1232
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,520
Time to step back after a job well done

1233
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,120
Leaving after finishing the task

1234
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,680
Go ahead

1235
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,120
Every bite of cilantro beef we eat

1236
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,280
will make us miss you

1237
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
We still warmly invited the two teachers

1238
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,880
If possible, please stay with our restaurant more often

1239
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,280
Alright

1240
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,240
Please

1241
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,400
You're on the second floor

1242
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,240
Me

1243
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,960
Oh right, we're both guests

1244
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,240
Why did we come here to cook?

1245
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,000
No, don't go

1246
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,560
Why did we come here to cook?

1247
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,640
We'll help you prep the ingredients

1248
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,400
We'll provide emotional support

1249
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:47,880
Bye

1250
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:48,240
Okay

1251
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,760
Leaving in such a hurry

1252
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,720
A little sad

1253
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:54,600
All done

1254
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,760
Arrived after finishing the task

1255
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:57,480
I'm really curious

1256
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,600
How many dishes do they actually have over there?

1257
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,520
Go take a look

1258
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,960
I think you should go home and check

1259
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:01,960
He probably wants to go

1260
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:02,680
see Lanlan (Xu Rulan)

1261
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,080
and have a meal.

1262
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,360
During this process,

1263
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,080
you can still feel a lot.

1264
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:10,960
Just like Xu Rulan earlier,

1265
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,120
as soon as she appears,

1266
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,480
she immediately breaks the calm

1267
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,280
again and again.

1268
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,080
Yes.

1269
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,160
Look at the way she enters,

1270
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,120
the way she expresses herself,

1271
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,800
it's all very natural.

1272
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:19,320
Yes.

1273
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,480
It feels very comfortable.

1274
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:20,960
It's just that simple.

1275
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,440
Another thing is,

1276
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,680
when the female guests were gathered around

1277
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,760
Wang Lechen cooking together,

1278
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,720
that was a moment

1279
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:27,880
that left a deep impression on us.

1280
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,240
If you talk about someone like Wang Lechen,

1281
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,040
in that situation,

1282
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,360
I would actually feel

1283
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,160
I would be afraid of that,

1284
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:33,640
I would be afraid of that,

1285
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:34,640
afraid that such a situation

1286
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,400
would happen to me.

1287
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,200
So Hani, who do you most want

1288
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:37,840
to be in this process?

1289
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:38,720
During this process,

1290
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:39,720
I think

1291
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,160
maybe I would

1292
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,120
just do my own thing.

1293
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,160
But after confirming the relationship,

1294
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:44,880
if the other person cooks, I would

1295
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,120
definitely support them.

1296
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,400
But at this stage,

1297
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,720
when everyone is like "wow,"

1298
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,480
I probably wouldn't go over.

1299
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,800
Instead, I would

1300
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,120
focus more on doing my own things.

1301
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,920
If it really happens in this situation

1302
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,920
and everyone is extremely busy,

1303
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,520
then I would step up and say,

1304
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,040
"I'll wash the dishes after you finish."

1305
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:03,520
Then I would

1306
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,440
go do my own things.

1307
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,120
And I would tell the person I like,

1308
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,120
"Call me when you need me."

1309
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:08,840
That works.

1310
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,320
Actually, in that kind of environment,

1311
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,200
I think it's very likely

1312
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,520
that I would just end up eating. (Sun Hanqing)

1313
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,520
I really want to do something,

1314
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,040
but

1315
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,120
since everyone is fighting to do the work,

1316
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,080
there's nothing left to do.

1317
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:18,920
But I have

1318
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:19,440
I have found

1319
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,960
the person I want to become.

1320
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,520
I want to be that corgi.

1321
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,160
Your perspective is so unique.

1322
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,280
There's even that option.

1323
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,640
Then I'll be the Alaskan.

1324
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,280
Alaskan.

1325
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,640
Those three girls are also very

1326
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,720
brave in expressing themselves

1327
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,320
You can really feel

1328
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:36,920
that they are using

1329
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:37,600
their own ways to express themselves

1330
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,320
their own ways to express themselves

1331
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:38,920
their own ways to express themselves

1332
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:41,280
and all want to

1333
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,680
well,

1334
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:43,840
interact with Wang Lechen

1335
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,360
which is pretty nice

1336
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,640
I can already imagine

1337
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,680
Mengchen watching you cook

1338
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,160
and how she stands by your side

1339
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,640
completely captivated by you

1340
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:53,560
My main role is

1341
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,920
the part where she’s charmed by me

1342
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,440
because she cooks really well

1343
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,240
so I just help out as her assistant

1344
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,280
In real life

1345
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,840
I’m more like the supportive friend

1346
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:01,720
providing her with emotional support

1347
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,080
Yeah, I’d say this dish really

1348
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:04,640
looks amazing here

1349
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,320
You can definitely make it taste the best

1350
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,560
Then I’d prepare the beef in advance

1351
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,280
and say, “This beef is really good today”

1352
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,640
It’s all fresh and tender

1353
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,840
So I just keep

1354
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,520
offering all kinds of emotional support

1355
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:17,560
It’s pretty nice

1356
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,960
Alright, let’s keep watching

1357
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:26,720
Come on.

1358
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,480
Let's eat.

1359
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,360
Let's eat.

1360
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:28,960
Let's eat.

1361
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,000
Let's eat.

1362
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,040
Let's start eating.

1363
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,720
Happy New Year.

1364
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,400
Happy New Year.

1365
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,800
Happy New Year.

1366
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:41,920
Come, it's time to eat.

1367
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,200
Thank you, chefs.

1368
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,640
Go ahead and eat.

1369
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,760
I want to try the beef.

1370
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:50,400
Cilantro beef.

1371
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,640
This dish is really

1372
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,440
really good.

1373
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,440
Delicious.

1374
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:53,880
Here.

1375
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:54,320
Thank you.

1376
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,560
It's really delicious.

1377
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,040
Really?

1378
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:57,760
Delicious.

1379
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,880
I'll try this one first.

1380
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,480
Then I'll start eating.

1381
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,080
Cilantro beef.

1382
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,560
This is really delicious.

1383
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,320
I think it's delicious too.

1384
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:12,560
I think it's delicious too.

1385
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:14,240
It's quite tasty.

1386
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,560
It's good, I've already tried it.

1387
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:19,560
Lanlan (Xu Rulan) still gives

1388
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,440
emotional value.

1389
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:21,960
"Most Popular"

1390
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:26,080
Yes.

1391
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:30,800
He's really paying attention to her.

1392
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,440
Whether she's eating the dish he made.

1393
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,000
It's a bit bland.

1394
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,320
A bit bland.

1395
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,000
This one is pretty good.

1396
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,240
Pretty good.

1397
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,240
So happy to be complimented.

1398
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:46,680
So sweet.

1399
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,640
We can talk about our jobs.

1400
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,520
Today we can finally ask.

1401
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,240
Finally.

1402
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,960
The job part is here.

1403
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,840
I'm really curious about their jobs.

1404
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:01,920
Yeah.

1405
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,560
I really want to know.

1406
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:04,280
Here it comes.

1407
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:04,640
Really looking forward to it.

1408
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,960
It's here.

1409
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:47,000
Can we

1410
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:47,520
Can we

1411
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,240
reveal our professions now?

1412
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,120
Here we go.

1413
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:50,760
I'm really looking forward to it.

1414
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,120
Go ahead and guess, everyone.

1415
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,160
Something in medicine.

1416
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,040
Radio.

1417
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:54,640
Soccer.

1418
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,360
Games.

1419
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,040
Guess again.

1420
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,080
I can't guess.

1421
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:57,880
I really can't figure it out.

1422
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,040
I feel like Yiwu's should be pretty easy to guess.

1423
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,040
Sells toilets.

1424
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,840
Maybe they've been at their workplace for a long time.

1425
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:04,800
Workplace.

1426
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,640
So it's "AAA Building Materials Brother Wang."

1427
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,680
I work at a company.

1428
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,120
This profession hasn't come up before.

1429
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,760
This time the profession is really unique.

1430
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,080
It all makes sense now.

1431
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,880
I do

1432
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,560
You can't tell.

1433
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,240
Are you talking about Lanlan (Xu Rulan)'s profession?

1434
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,080
Even if you gave me ten tries, I still couldn't guess.

1435
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,640
Really?

1436
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,280
Yes, that's right.

1437
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:28,920
These contrasts

1438
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,680
Are they all this big this time?

1439
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,280
My kitten can smile.

1440
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:37,480
Really.

1441
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:38,840
You don't believe me.

1442
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:39,600
I believe you.

1443
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,960
My kitten can smile too.

1444
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:42,800
After he finished talking about his job,

1445
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,680
Did you see him,

1446
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:44,840
he immediately put on a filter.

1447
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,280
Is it possible that it's just me

1448
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:46,920
doing it for myself?

1449
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,000
Then I went to the bathroom,

1450
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:49,360
and when I came back,

1451
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,760
I found my breakfast had been eaten.

1452
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,760
Then I'll make you another one.

1453
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,080
Okay.

1454
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,320
This is sweet.

1455
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,560
You just came up to bring a drink,

1456
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,280
and then you left.

1457
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:00,120
So sweet.

1458
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:00,840
This really is...

1459
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,120
Is he leaving or not?

1460
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:05,320
Anyway, learning more is always good.

1461
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:06,240
It's still good for yourself.

1462
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,080
You really are bold.

1463
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,720
The two of them are so relaxed and natural.

1464
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,120
And it feels like the dog's pace is in sync now.

1465
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,040
At this moment, the animals are just...

1466
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,280
The little animals are helping out.

1467
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:16,800
Right?

1468
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:18,040
Right.

1469
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,240
Finished walking.

1470
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,840
Baby, did you miss me?

1471
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,040
You got walked, didn't you?

1472
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,480
You didn't even say anything before taking the dog out.

1473
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,040
Are you jealous?

1474
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:31,520
Are you happy?

1475
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,600
The three of us are all around you.

1476
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,280
See, she really tells everything to others.

1477
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,240
So now you

1478
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,360
How do you feel right now?

1479
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,080
I feel about the same as it does.

1480
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:44,840
First date.

1481
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:45,640
And you came right away.

1482
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:47,920
Heading out.

1483
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:48,720
Let's go.

1484
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:50,920
Let's set off.

1485
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:51,880
I was slow to send it that day.

1486
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:52,720
Today I have to

1487
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:53,440
go for it.

1488
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,440
Came down the slide sitting.

1489
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,160
That was too intense.

1490
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,880
What? He ran away?

1491
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,720
But we don't know whose gift is whose.

1492
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,320
There's also a gift exchange.

1493
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:04,360
Pick one.

1494
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,840
This is when you look the best.
