1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,680
Beautiful.

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,120
There was a river behind my grandma’s house when I was little.

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,120
We used to catch fish in the river.

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,280
I couldn’t stay away from water.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,520
I couldn’t stay away from water.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,040
Because when I was a kid,

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:19,760
my grandparents would

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,120
in the yard at home,

9
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,600
grow

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,760
those tomatoes.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,680
I used to do that too.

12
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,960
On my grandma’s balcony,

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,560
there were lots of vegetables.

14
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,760
She even kept chickens up there.

15
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,600
What I really wanted was

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,360
that scene—

17
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:34,880
like,

18
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,920
barefoot, planting rice seedlings in the muddy field.

19
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,320
I’ve never experienced that.

20
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,320
I haven’t tried that.

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:40,760
Yeah.

22
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,280
That’s really good training.

23
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,400
I used to work at the radio station.

24
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,440
They needed someone

25
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,920
with experience in robotics

26
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,680
and science and engineering knowledge to host.

27
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,120
Live commentary.

28
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:56,680
Live commentary.

29
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,440
For their competition.

30
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,560
So did you go?

31
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,000
I did.

32
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,280
I studied robotics like crazy.

33
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,480
I really buried myself in studying.

34
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,880
It was like reading a foreign language.

35
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,280
You’re such a fast learner.

36
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,200
If it’s something

37
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,280
you don’t like,

38
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,400
would you still force yourself to do it?

39
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,600
If it’s good for

40
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,240
my future development,

41
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:15,920
I would.

42
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,720
If it’s

43
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,520
a necessary step toward my goal,

44
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,240
something I have to go through,

45
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,040
then I’ll definitely do it.

46
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,000
You’re the same way.

47
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,640
You push yourself to try new things.

48
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,840
Yeah, for sure.

49
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,160
Yeah.

50
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,840
Even with my current job.

51
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,200
I have to learn everything from scratch.

52
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,360
But it’s definitely

53
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,920
a way for me to gain experience.

54
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,440
I totally get that.

55
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,720
You want to keep moving forward.

56
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,440
Have some confidence in yourself.

57
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,920
I do, I’m confident.

58
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,640
You’re such a skilled rider.

59
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,680
Super confident.

60
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,840
Compliment squad.

61
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,520
That’s really important.

62
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,400
This guy

63
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,040
really needs

64
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,440
a girl like this.

65
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,920
Yeah, they’re perfect for each other.

66
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,480
They both catch each other’s “ball.”

67
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,440
And things are heating up between them.

68
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,080
You can really see them moving forward.

69
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,480
Yeah.

70
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,000
Please, keep this a secret, okay?

71
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,960
Okay.

72
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,440
We’re here.

73
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,960
No cup games today.

74
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,560
She always remembers.

75
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,760
I’ll start playing soon.

76
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:45,960
Let’s play.

77
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,120
This familiar cup.

78
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,560
Familiar cup shape.

79
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,400
It really is this one.

80
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,880
The girl says, “I remember everything about you.”

81
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,720
She’s telling him

82
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,200
Yeah, from way back.

83
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:55,640
Yeah.

84
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,080
The little details.

85
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,800
I remember all your little gestures.

86
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,520
Okay.

87
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,960
Thank you.

88
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,960
I really love homemade food.

89
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,360
Eat.

90
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:09,720
Eat up.

91
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,080
Eat.

92
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,040
Pretty tasty.

93
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,440
Delicious.

94
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,160
It really is tasty.

95
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,440
Do you think you’ve

96
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,320
been taking good care of yourself lately?

97
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:24,840
Me?

98
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,520
Not bad.

99
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,640
When it comes to food,

100
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,280
I don’t really have high standards.

101
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,000
I think you take good care of yourself.

102
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,960
You can cook, too.

103
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,280
You’re seeing me through rose-colored glasses.

104
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,520
Guys always feel like they’re not doing enough.

105
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,280
But before,

106
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,480
there was a period

107
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,480
when I had no motivation for anything.

108
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,480
I’d get so hungry,

109
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,080
then maybe grab something to eat.

110
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,840
Or sometimes,

111
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,320
I’d just eat whatever, just to get by.

112
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,840
When I learned

113
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,400
how to cook for myself,

114
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,480
my mom and my grandma said,

115
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,280
“At least now you won’t go hungry.”

116
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,120
Yeah,

117
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,400
at least when I’m cooking,

118
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,320
I’m really immersed in it.

119
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,360
I love waiting for the food

120
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,320
as it slowly cooks.

121
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,240
Right? That process is actually healing.

122
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,080
It feels like

123
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,200
being good to yourself

124
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,320
gives you positive feedback.

125
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:15,840
Yeah.

126
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,480
So in your daily life,

127
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,320
are you someone who really needs positive feedback?

128
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,200
Like, whatever you do,

129
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,200
you need some positive response?

130
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,320
Definitely. I bet you’re the same.

131
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,560
After spending time together,

132
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,000
even though you’re usually

133
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,960
really lively,

134
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,200
but actually,

135
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,200
deep down,

136
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,960
you’re a very slow-paced person.

137
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,080
You could say you’re a bit slow or indecisive.

138
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,640
What about you?

139
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,480
Me?

140
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,400
It’s obvious.

141
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,040
Yeah, she’s really quick.

142
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,000
Right.

143
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,360
But honestly,

144
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,280
I still think

145
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,160
in every aspect,

146
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,480
it’s better to take things slow.

147
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,120
She keeps giving him positive feedback.

148
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,880
Because it’s you,

149
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,920
anything you do is fine.

150
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,600
You think the same way as I do.

151
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,720
Exactly the same.

152
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,120
Once I’m in a relationship,

153
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,040
I’m actually

154
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,880
the type to give two hundred percent

155
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,440
and put everything into it.

156
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,000
That’s my role.

157
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,520
I just feel

158
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,960
like I should put

159
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,680
all my attention,

160
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,960
all my energy,

161
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,400
completely into her.

162
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,320
And you’re probably not the type

163
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,200
who would

164
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,760
end things easily.

165
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,520
I’d feel like I’m really hurting the other person.

166
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,480
Seriously.

167
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,640
You’re just like me.

168
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,080
You’re just like me.

169
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,760
I remember yesterday

170
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,600
I asked what animal you resemble

171
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,640
Your friend said you’re like a kitten

172
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,720
Yeah

173
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,880
But what do you think

174
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,000
What animal do you think you’re like

175
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,440
Me?

176
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,480
The kitten was your friend’s idea

177
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,400
I kind of feel like a hedgehog

178
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,720
That’s a bit unconventional

179
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,560
A hedgehog

180
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,360
That’s what I said last time

181
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,880
Are you calling me weird?

182
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,360
I didn’t dare say it last time

183
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,400
You’re saying I’m not mainstream

184
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,000
Isn’t there a song called “Hedgehog”?

185
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,600
Have you heard it?

186
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,080
I’m rolling my eyes at you

187
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,600
Have you listened to it?

188
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,080
No

189
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,560
Go listen to it later

190
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,520
Generation gap

191
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,080
Look, Chenchen is really

192
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,040
happy with her

193
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,960
Yeah

194
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,720
Are you done eating?

195
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,840
Take your time, no rush

196
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,640
I was really hungry

197
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,040
It’s awkward with you watching me eat

198
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,920
Why don’t you eat a bit more

199
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,960
I’ll go to the restroom first

200
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,040
Eat some more while I’m gone

201
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,080
Okay, I’ll have a few more bites

202
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,800
Alright

203
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,760
Have a few more bites

204
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,320
I’m back

205
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,120
All done

206
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,880
Here you go

207
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,160
I brought

208
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,320
a little gift

209
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,360
A gift?

210
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,560
Really?

211
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,040
He brought a gift

212
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,800
A little sheep

213
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,680
Thank you

214
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,360
Why a sheep?

215
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,240
Well

216
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,560
I’m telling you, stop being a hedgehog

217
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,520
Okay

218
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,960
Just like I said

219
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,240
You don’t always have to be so tough

220
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,960
Sheep have horns too

221
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,240
They’re not totally defenseless

222
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,560
They can use their horns to protect themselves

223
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,640
But

224
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,840
I hope you can be like a little sheep

225
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,040
Okay

226
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,440
I didn’t know sheep could be so romantic

227
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,800
I’m not asking you to change completely

228
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,440
But I hope you don’t have to be so tired

229
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,360
Thank you

230
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,640
I really like it

231
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,320
Why is it so cool as soon as we get in the car?

232
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,760
Yeah, I was worried it’d be stuffy in here.

233
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,960
So I used my phone in advance

234
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,040
to turn on the air conditioning.

235
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,720
You’re really thoughtful.

236
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,280
Of course.

237
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,680
And the Lynk & Co 07

238
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,040
has a phone-car connectivity feature.

239
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,680
You can even browse Xiaohongshu in the car.

240
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,240
Really?

241
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,520
Let me try.

242
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,320
Do you want to play for a bit?

243
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,040
It’s fine.

244
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,240
I’d rather chat with you.

245
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,160
Okay.

246
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:19,800
So let’s

247
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,640
head out.

248
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,680
I’m a little touched.

249
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,120
Why is it so short?

250
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,640
Add more episodes.

251
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,480
If everyone

252
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,520
wants to see more content,

253
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,040
you can check out our

254
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,040
membership section

255
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,480
for more exclusive content.

256
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,280
It’s really nice and comfortable.

257
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,280
This couple is so comfortable together.

258
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,240
His way of being romantic

259
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,320
isn’t the usual kind.

260
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:42,520
Not that kind of romance.

261
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,320
He’s really sincere.

262
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,880
He doesn’t say it out loud.

263
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,320
Yeah.

264
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,200
But he shows it through his actions.

265
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,320
That he cares about you.

266
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:49,880
Right.

267
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,680
I’m already hooked.

268
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,240
They’re such a perfect match.

269
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,480
What I think is great about Yuanyuan

270
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,800
is that she never kills the mood.

271
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,000
And when she said,

272
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,360
“I’ll go home and do my homework right away,”

273
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:00,800
Yeah.

274
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,200
She’s so positive,

275
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,760
but not in an overwhelming way.

276
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:05,720
So that’s why

277
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,360
the motorcycle

278
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:06,800
part

279
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,240
made me think they should end up together.

280
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,120
When you put it that way,

281
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,120
the motorcycle is great.

282
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,600
Because the motorcycle

283
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,240
gave them

284
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,320
a perfect setting.

285
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,000
You know, I heard something before.

286
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,960
If you like a girl,

287
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,680
you should take her to do something scary.

288
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,720
Why?

289
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,040
Because when your heart races

290
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,200
it’s the same as when you’re excited.

291
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:22,840
And when you’re scared,

292
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,600
your heart races too.

293
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,080
Right.

294
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,200
So you might mistake fear for attraction.

295
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,120
It really happens.

296
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,880
That’s how it works.

297
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,520
There’s psychological research on this.

298
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,000
Suspension bridge effect.

299
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,520
But the premise is,

300
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,440
you at least feel neutral about the person.

301
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,760
You can’t dislike them.

302
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,840
So that’s why I said before,

303
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,040
if I were planning it,

304
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,680
we’d ride a roller coaster together,

305
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,080
then go bungee jumping,

306
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,120
and finally visit a haunted house.

307
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,400
I feel like if these two

308
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,840
end up together in the future,

309
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,200
they have a chance to build

310
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,280
a really great relationship.

311
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,600
I call it

312
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,440
a relationship where they can truly rely on each other.

313
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,320
They both understand

314
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,720
each other's vulnerabilities,

315
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,520
and in terms of ability

316
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,800
and attitude,

317
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,680
they can

318
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,680
depend on each other.

319
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,120
They're great teammates.

320
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,760
And at the same time,

321
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,240
in life and communication,

322
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,680
their rhythms match perfectly.

323
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,480
These three things—

324
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,000
if all three fit,

325
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,040
then I think

326
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,560
it's a relationship where they can truly rely on each other.

327
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,920
Next, I think

328
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,240
every date

329
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,760
will give us

330
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,360
a different kind of excitement.

331
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,240
Now, our Longlong

332
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,920
is coming.

333
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,040
Longlong, I really like him. He's so cute.

334
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,240
Let's see

335
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,320
what kind of

336
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,800
date they'll have.

337
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,520
Everyone, let's watch.

338
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,680
Here they come.

339
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:41,840
Longlong.

340
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,200
Duoduo.

341
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,000
Duoduo.

342
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,960
So pretty.

343
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:08,840
Hello.

344
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,040
Hello.

345
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,400
Hi, Duoduo.

346
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,560
Hi, Duoduo.

347
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,560
Hello.

348
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,360
Hi, Ruilong.

349
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,520
We meet again.

350
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,960
You look handsome today.

351
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,800
Yeah.

352
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,800
You look beautiful today.

353
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,760
So stunning.

354
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,640
I think so too.

355
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,680
This place really suits your vibe.

356
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,440
You have a prince-like aura.

357
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,640
Making pottery.

358
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,440
Throwing clay.

359
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,400
Isn't that when you do it from behind like this?

360
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:39,960
Are you talking about

361
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,840
Ghost?

362
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,760
Yeah.

363
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,800
I'm so old-fashioned.

364
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,680
Alright.

365
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,560
This place is awesome.

366
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,320
I'm going to make a cat bowl for my two cats.

367
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,920
Pick an outfit.

368
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,080
Okay.

369
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,240
Should I help you tie it?

370
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,080
You can tie it yourself first.

371
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,200
I can help you tie it.

372
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,040
Thanks.

373
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,120
No problem.

374
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,600
A bit silly.

375
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,520
Very cute.

376
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,160
He seems a little nervous.

377
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,720
This button is really tight.

378
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,720
Maybe it's worried you won't finish

379
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,440
and you'll run away halfway?

380
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,520
So tight.

381
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,640
Okay.

382
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,920
Thank you.

383
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,480
Can you help tie mine too?

384
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:42,920
On the outside here.

385
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,480
Alright.

386
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,680
Okay.

387
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,080
Thanks.

388
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,080
Done.

389
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,800
Okay, I'll sit here.

390
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,320
So nervous.

391
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,360
He's a bit shy.

392
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,400
So cute.

393
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,200
Feels like we're desk mates.

394
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,160
I think I can spin it all the way.

395
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,200
He's been watching her the whole time.

396
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,360
So fast.

397
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,120
What shape is it turning into?

398
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,720
Feels like

399
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,160
it's a bit oval.

400
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,480
You're working so fast.

401
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,920
You're really talented.

402
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,160
You are too.

403
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,280
I am too?

404
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,960
A little talent, a big talent.

405
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,240
Let me try again.

406
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,360
Ruilong just keeps watching.

407
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,880
You want to make a plate first, right?

408
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,000
Yeah, I'll make a plate first too.

409
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,880
Okay.

410
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,360
Later, I want to

411
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,800
make one for incense sticks.

412
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,160
It's because I saw you

413
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,640
at the last dinner party

414
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,120
giving that incense stick.

415
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,200
Should I also

416
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,600
make an incense holder?

417
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,320
Does Duoduo like lighting those?

418
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,120
Incense sticks.

419
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,920
Yeah.

420
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,360
I didn't expect Ruilong to be so thoughtful.

421
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,960
I thought he was just

422
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,760
a rough, sporty guy.

423
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,200
Nope.

424
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,120
He's the type who keeps things in his heart.

425
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,480
Remake a few pieces.

426
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,800
How can it turn out so ugly?

427
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,520
Such cute little hands.

428
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,560
Really?

429
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,080
Always complimenting.

430
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,000
Let's swap.

431
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,560
Want to?

432
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,080
Sure.

433
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,760
If this ends up in my hands, that's trouble.

434
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,080
Anyway, I said

435
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,600
we can make something

436
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,320
for the water.

437
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,480
He's trying to interact with Duoduo.

438
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,680
I'll make you a lotus flower.

439
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,240
Look forward to it.

440
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,280
I'll make you a little cat.

441
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,600
Lotus flower.

442
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,560
So pretty.

443
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,240
You can say if you don't like it.

444
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,280
Actually, you can also

445
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,120
choose not to put it on.

446
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,240
Of course you can put it on.

447
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,240
Let me do it.

448
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,440
I'm really happy with mine.

449
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,760
It's pretty cute.

450
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,120
Yours looks great.

451
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,400
So cute.

452
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,480
So beautiful.

453
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,880
Just leave it here for now.

454
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,600
Once it's fired,

455
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,440
we'll let you know to pick it up.

456
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:49,840
Okay.

457
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,480
Thank you.

458
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,160
Thanks.

459
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,560
Let's go then.

460
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,160
Alright.

461
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,880
What are we eating tonight?

462
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,600
Tonight we're having something really delicious.

463
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,320
So pretty.

464
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,480
Little garden.

465
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,640
Looks nice.

466
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,760
It's what I like.

467
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,480
I actually prepared something else today.

468
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,240
What did you order?

469
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,960
I bought some seafood.

470
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,160
Didn't you say you like seafood?

471
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,400
She mentioned before that she likes seafood.

472
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:29,840
Yeah.

473
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:45,840
Tasty.

474
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,480
So I

475
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,760
talked to their chef first.

476
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,080
They said they can make seafood too.

477
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,200
So I ordered it.

478
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,000
Thank you.

479
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,440
He's so attentive.

480
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,840
He's already thought of many ways

481
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,160
to interact with Duoduo.

482
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,760
I discussed this with you before.

483
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,280
Can you make it for us?

484
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,360
Make it with scallion oil.

485
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,960
Spicy is fine too.

486
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,840
If you can't handle spicy, don't eat it.

487
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,360
I'm fine with anything.

488
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,680
Make it spicy.

489
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,200
I ship them, I can't handle it.

490
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,160
Ruilong can't handle spicy food at all.

491
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,320
Everyone is thinking about each other.

492
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,960
Ruilong's eyes are so pure.

493
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,520
Yeah.

494
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,040
You can really see from his eyes

495
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,520
that he's a good person.

496
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,680
He has puppy eyes.

497
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,240
Really, puppy eyes. Seriously.

498
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:49,960
Alright.

499
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,240
You can eat it, right?

500
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,440
I can, yeah.

501
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,520
Duoduo didn't look at him.

502
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,880
Actually, there's one more

503
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,520
thing I want to show you.

504
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,440
Okay.

505
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,320
I don't know if you saw it just now.

506
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,400
What?

507
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,160
What is it?

508
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,160
Can you do it?

509
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,120
What?

510
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,080
Can you play?

511
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,560
I can.

512
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,760
Guqin.

513
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,200
He can play the guqin.

514
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,680
This scene is so unique.

515
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,280
He really knows when to show off his skills.

516
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,160
Is this the VIP seat?

517
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,440
Yes.

518
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:37,800
Alright.

519
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,960
I'll take my seat then.

520
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,560
Have you heard it before?

521
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,720
My mom can play the guzheng.

522
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,800
But I've never heard the guqin.

523
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,000
I'll play a piece I know.

524
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,480
Okay, I'm ready.

525
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,480
Awesome.

526
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,080
So impressive.

527
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,200
The guys all had hidden talents.

528
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,920
One rides a motorcycle, one plays the guqin.

529
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,600
Really unexpected.

530
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,520
So surprising.

531
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,400
You’re good at keeping secrets.

532
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,480
Turns out you’re so talented.

533
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,240
Sounds beautiful.

534
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,680
Thank you.

535
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,040
Do you want to give it a try?

536
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,240
Sure.

537
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,840
Will my nails affect it?

538
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,760
This looks a bit tricky.

539
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,120
Okay.

540
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,520
You can just try playing first.

541
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,800
Pluck, flick, or swipe.

542
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,960
Pulling back is called “mo”.

543
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,760
Pushing forward is “tiao”.

544
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,040
Mo and tiao.

545
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,400
But Duoduo’s vibe

546
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,160
really suits sitting there.

547
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,000
Is that okay?

548
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:43,760
Yes.

549
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:46,480
Very good.

550
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:49,640
You’re amazing too.

551
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,680
They’re so cute together.

552
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,440
I get it.

553
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,240
Playing a song on the first day

554
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,120
is a bit tough.

555
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,400
But I learned it today.

556
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,840
Now I can keep plucking.

557
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,160
So cute.

558
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,320
So I also prepared

559
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,720
some incense sticks.

560
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,360
Because usually when playing guqin

561
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,120
you light an incense stick too.

562
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,160
That’s nice.

563
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:31,920
Next time I’ll

564
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,200
give you my incense sticks.

565
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:33,760
My incense sticks

566
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,520
can really help you

567
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,200
relax and sleep well.

568
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,040
The guys can’t take their eyes off.

569
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,400
So, shall we

570
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,480
I mean,

571
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,400
go eat?

572
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,120
Okay.

573
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,520
Let’s go.

574
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,840
What a surprise.

575
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,600
Hidden depths.

576
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,640
But this guqin is

577
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,520
my own guqin.

578
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,120
It’s yours?

579
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:21,640
Yes.

580
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,440
I can bring it to the cabin later.

581
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,480
That’s great.

582
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,080
Go play it.

583
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,000
First up is mantis shrimp.

584
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,800
Mantis shrimp.

585
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,760
I want some too.

586
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,880
So much food.

587
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,560
A full seafood feast.

588
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,760
This fish looks great.

589
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,280
Today’s meal is really rich.

590
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,920
The wait was worth it.

591
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,400
Try some quickly.

592
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,040
Okay.

593
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,520
Thanks.

594
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,560
Thank you, Ruilong.

595
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,280
Thanks for coming.

596
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,080
I’m really happy today.

597
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,600
But I don’t feel that happy.

598
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,280
Because she thanked him.

599
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,520
Yeah, she’s being polite.

600
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,480
Smells so good.

601
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,120
Among these dishes,

602
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,760
which one do you like most?

603
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,720
Today I liked this one best.

604
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,920
Mantis shrimp.

605
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,240
Why?

606
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,200
Because you brought this dish.

607
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,520
So it feels a bit special.

608
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,240
Thank you.

609
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,400
Every dish is delicious.

610
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,440
Yes.

611
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,320
Really, every single one.

612
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,120
I’m glad you liked it.

613
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,360
Honestly, I was a bit nervous yesterday.

614
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,480
I thought you’d turn me down.

615
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,200
Why?

616
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,280
I don’t know.

617
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,200
Standing at the door, I wondered

618
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,360
if you didn’t want to come out.

619
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,200
You mean

620
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,480
the later double invitation at night?

621
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,880
But I’m still happy.

622
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,400
Still, I’m happy.

623
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,440
I think

624
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,600
today was really joyful.

625
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,520
If Ke Ailin hadn't been disappointed with Le Chen just before,

626
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,200
if she hadn't felt let down by Le Chen,

627
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,360
would she have agreed to Rui Long?

628
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,200
Ke Ailin told Rui Long

629
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,480
that they're just friends.

630
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:08,680
Yeah.

631
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,720
If it's just friends hanging out,

632
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,800
then we can go out together.

633
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,040
She did say that at the time.

634
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,840
Right, but if she didn't know

635
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,720
that Le Chen was also

636
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,760
dating someone else,

637
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,360
would she

638
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,360
have just turned him down?

639
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,520
She might not even

640
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,560
agree to hang out as friends.

641
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,200
I think Duoduo

642
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:21,840
wouldn't do that.

643
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,800
I think the girls are very classy.

644
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,160
The guys did well too.

645
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,720
Both of them handled it well.

646
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,560
I know why Rui Long looks

647
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,160
kind of sad.

648
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,560
Because first,

649
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,160
he's so careful with every word.

650
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,960
His caution

651
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,680
is all about watching her

652
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,960
and considering Duoduo's feelings.

653
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,560
He's done everything he can.

654
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,120
Like swapping the pottery,

655
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:45,880
switching those things.

656
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,280
He suggested they exchange with each other.

657
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,960
He thought of many ways to interact.

658
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,320
But his expression is still

659
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,680
very restrained.

660
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,920
He's always trying to be appropriate.

661
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:54,640
Yeah.

662
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,720
He doesn't want Duoduo to feel pressured.

663
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,840
Or feel uncomfortable in any way.

664
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,400
Right.

665
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,600
But I really think

666
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,680
that before,

667
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,000
when they were at the gym,

668
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,360
both could work out happily together.

669
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,400
But this time,

670
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,800
even though it's as friends,

671
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,080
they're already

672
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,880
not as natural as they were at the gym.

673
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,160
It's completely different now.

674
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,040
Yeah, because the difference is

675
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:14,920
Rui Long has expressed

676
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,720
his feelings for Duoduo.

677
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,120
There's no going back.

678
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,360
But I think

679
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,320
the overall vibe

680
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,280
is still

681
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,680
still happy.

682
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,000
Overall, it's still very cheerful.

683
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,960
Rui Long is awesome.

684
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,320
Go for it!

685
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,280
Here they come.

686
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,120
Who?

687
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,680
Xiao Jiao.

688
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,760
I'm so excited.

689
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,720
He's hiding flowers.

690
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,480
What surprise does he have planned?

691
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,080
Why does she look so pretty?

692
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,760
From the back.

693
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,480
Coming out from behind.

694
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:09,920
Hello.

695
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,840
He quickly turned around.

696
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,640
Hi.

697
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,240
How did you come from this side?

698
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,120
You thought I'd come from over there.

699
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,360
I thought you'd come from here.

700
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,720
So silly.

701
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,040
It's nice, very cute.

702
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,320
Okay.

703
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,800
So you saw this.

704
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,960
Alright, you can look.

705
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,360
Thank you.

706
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,520
It's Lanlan's favorite peony.

707
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,680
Let me hold your umbrella and bag.

708
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,320
Over here.

709
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,040
Do you know what we're doing today?

710
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,680
Skiing.

711
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,760
You mentioned before that you like skydiving.

712
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,080
Skiing also feels pretty free.

713
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,160
Let's just relax today.

714
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:49,640
Okay.

715
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,560
This looks fun.

716
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,960
How do these shoes...

717
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,040
Do I need to open them?

718
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:04,840
Yeah.

719
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,320
So fast.

720
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,560
How can it be so quick?

721
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,920
When you like someone, you'll...

722
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,200
Let me try.

723
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,800
Okay, go ahead.

724
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,440
It might be a bit tight.

725
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:28,920
It might be a bit tight.

726
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,880
Let's go change for another pair.

727
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:34,880
He's good.

728
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,120
So cute.

729
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,800
Hello.

730
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,920
Do you have shoes half a size bigger?

731
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,280
Thank you.

732
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,320
Very professional.

733
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:57,840
Is it okay?

734
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,280
Yes.

735
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:58,640
Okay.

736
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,440
If it feels uncomfortable,

737
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,520
you can adjust this part yourself.

738
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:00,680
Okay.

739
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,520
Take this off.

740
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:03,960
Okay.

741
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:04,960
Let's go.

742
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,160
So cool.

743
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,680
I feel alive again.

744
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,200
Let's put the skis here first.

745
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,480
Do you remember what you learned before?

746
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,680
I forgot.

747
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,480
First,

748
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,200
which is your dominant foot?

749
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:19,840
You should know this.

750
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,680
Don't tell me you forgot your dominant foot too.

751
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,640
I forgot.

752
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,320
Alright then,

753
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,600
I'll show you.

754
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,480
For example, like this.

755
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,760
I lifted my right foot first.

756
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:28,920
That's my dominant foot.

757
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,760
Got it.

758
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,600
Let me try.

759
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,880
Actually, you can hold her hand now.

760
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,000
And lead her forward.

761
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,560
You're holding too fast.

762
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,400
Too fast.

763
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,000
It's the left foot.

764
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:42,760
Left foot.

765
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,400
So your dominant foot is left.

766
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:43,760
Left foot.

767
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,280
Right.

768
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,040
Let's first

769
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,840
practice single-foot gliding.

770
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,240
Okay.

771
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,560
Like this, for example.

772
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,880
Pretty good.

773
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,880
Didn't glide very far.

774
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,960
Get a feel for it.

775
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,600
Take your time.

776
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,360
Go ahead.

777
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:13,440
That's good.

778
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,040
Pretty good.

779
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,880
I think you've got the hang of it again.

780
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,920
You're doing great.

781
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:24,720
Pretty good.

782
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,600
I think you're really good at this.

783
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,840
Let's turn back now.

784
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:27,640
Okay.

785
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,240
Come on.

786
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:32,960
Right.

787
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,080
That's it.

788
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:34,960
Perfect.

789
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,200
Very standard.

790
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,960
What's next, Teacher Jiao?

791
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,080
Because I think your basics are excellent.

792
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:41,840
And you're very smart.

793
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,120
So,

794
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,800
we can go up and try directly.

795
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,680
Right now?

796
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,200
Yes.

797
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,400
Put on your protective gear.

798
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,160
Little turtle.

799
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:50,880
Where do I wear it?

800
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,560
Here.

801
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,440
The turtle is here.

802
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,040
Is it supposed to go on your butt?

803
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:54,840
Yes.

804
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,360
Is it fastened well?

805
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,320
It might need to be tightened.

806
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,040
Okay.

807
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,320
Take out the one in the back.

808
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,240
Like this.

809
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:10,880
Yeah.

810
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,640
Just like this.

811
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,200
Okay.

812
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:14,400
Alright.

813
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,800
You look great wearing this.

814
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,080
You look really good in this.

815
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,320
This is my first time seeing

816
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,720
someone make a little turtle look so stylish.

817
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,960
Xiao Jiao is totally in love.

818
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,720
Yeah, he’s definitely the pure love type.

819
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,240
He’s really attentive.

820
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,400
Right.

821
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:35,520
Is that okay?

822
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,000
Sure.

823
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,920
There’s one more important thing.

824
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,720
I forgot to mention it.

825
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,520
It’s about

826
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,200
the correct way to fall when skiing.

827
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,000
Just sit down on the ground.

828
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,720
No, don’t just sit down.

829
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,240
If you sit down like that,

830
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,000
you might break your tailbone.

831
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,200
This is the right way to fall.

832
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,080
That fall looked so real.

833
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,440
He’s so genuine.

834
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,080
And then,

835
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:08,880
Don’t laugh.

836
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:09,640
Yeah.

837
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,240
You’ll get your turn to fall soon.

838
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:14,680
Let’s go.

839
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,280
Okay.

840
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,200
Go up and give it a try.

841
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,800
I’m a little nervous.

842
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,840
I won’t help you next time.

843
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,400
Then I’m doomed.

844
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,360
I might just fall flat in the middle.

845
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,840
Can I watch you ski first?

846
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,400
Sure, go ahead.

847
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,680
I’ll show you how.

848
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,400
Xiao Jiao is in his element now.

849
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,000
So cool.

850
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,640
Showing off his muscles.

851
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,480
He’s handsome.

852
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,880
Look, there’s admiration.

853
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,680
Yeah.

854
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,720
Awesome.

855
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,200
Alright.

856
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,720
Let’s practice snowboarding.

857
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,360
The easiest move is

858
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,560
back edge push.

859
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,960
Come on, let’s walk this way first.

860
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,960
They’re holding hands now.

861
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,440
Can I pull you over?

862
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,680
Should we go sideways?

863
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,480
Yes.

864
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,600
I’ll pull you sideways.

865
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,520
It’s fine.

866
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,600
Okay.

867
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,360
Give me your other hand.

868
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,720
I’ll help you balance.

869
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,600
Look at how Lanlan is looking at Xiao Jiao now.

870
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,840
Doesn’t it seem a bit different?

871
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,920
Yeah.

872
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,120
Just don’t lean too far back.

873
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:35,480
Okay.

874
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,960
If you lean back too much, you’ll lose your balance.

875
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,360
Stand up a bit straighter first.

876
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:38,640
Right.

877
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,200
Now lift your heels back.

878
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:43,960
Yes.

879
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,120
Let me tell you a trick for using your strength.

880
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,080
I’ll hold your board first.

881
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,360
Okay.

882
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,080
You can relax.

883
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,560
Relax.

884
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,280
Just don’t

885
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,640
use your feet to

886
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,240
hook it.

887
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,200
If you do that, you’ll tire quickly.

888
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,680
Your ankles will get tired fast.

889
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,120
Alright.

890
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,080
Your calf muscles will feel tense.

891
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,160
It’s more like using your

892
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,800
calves to press against the back of the board.

893
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,040
It just feels really natural,

894
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,000
like your whole body is like this.

895
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,240
You feel like you’re falling back.

896
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:10,960
Yeah.

897
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,120
That’s how it is.

898
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:13,640
Give it a try.

899
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,360
Like this?

900
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,360
Yes.

901
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,120
Now try a different move first.

902
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,080
You can try standing up straight.

903
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,000
Then squat down.

904
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,240
Look at that expression.

905
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,480
Yeah.

906
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,080
Stand up straight.

907
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:43,600
Squat down.

908
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,640
So if it feels too fast,

909
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,880
just squat a little.

910
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,840
Come on.

911
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,400
You can get a feel for it.

912
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,360
Sure.

913
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,520
Then lean back a bit.

914
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:53,880
Right.

915
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,120
Then I'll pull you forward.

916
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,120
Lean back a little more.

917
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,400
I think choosing this snowy spot

918
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,360
was a good idea.

919
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,240
I agree.

920
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,720
They've been

921
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,640
interacting the whole time.

922
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,320
Yeah.

923
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,480
One is being cute,

924
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,360
the other is

925
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,480
giving her a sense of security.

926
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,080
If it goes left, step with your left foot.

927
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,160
Yeah, you're learning so fast.

928
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,680
You've already leveled up.

929
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,240
Yes.

930
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,320
You're so smart.

931
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,800
Really smart.

932
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,560
Let's go, let's head up again.

933
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:34,320
Okay.

934
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,680
Isn't it pretty easy?

935
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,880
It's alright.

936
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,120
Don't speak too soon.

937
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,440
Come on.

938
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:43,640
Let's go.

939
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,360
Let's turn around first.

940
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:46,880
Alright.

941
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,000
You really look like a rabbit.

942
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,520
I think we can just slide down.

943
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,000
Okay.

944
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,120
Let's try. If we fall, we fall.

945
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:54,480
Alright.

946
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:54,640
Okay.

947
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,360
Go.

948
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:57,560
Careful.

949
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,560
This feels like a drama scene.

950
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,160
Yeah.

951
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,120
Xiao Jiao.

952
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,880
Trying hard to stay by her side.

953
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,200
I love this feeling of speed.

954
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,760
Stop.

955
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,040
Falling down together with her.

956
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,160
It's just too sweet.

957
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,120
I'm dying of laughter.

958
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,560
Does it hurt?

959
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,000
No, I'm fine. It doesn't hurt at all.

960
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,120
I have a little turtle.

961
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,040
Alright.

962
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,520
It feels like, in the end,

963
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,080
we won't fall anymore.

964
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,040
And the two of us

965
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,200
Yeah, I thought we were about to stop safely.

966
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,800
But we still fell.

967
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,960
What else can we do?

968
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,240
There's a slide.

969
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,040
We can try that.

970
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,640
Let's go.

971
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:08,880
I ship them so much.

972
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,160
Sit tight and hold on.

973
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,000
Okay.

974
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,280
Hurry, I'm going after her.

975
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,600
Hurry, I'm going after her.

976
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:19,800
Hurry, I'm going after her.

977
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:21,960
Push harder.

978
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,440
It's still pretty exciting.

979
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,200
We can sit here for a bit.

980
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,000
Okay.

981
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,840
This place looks so fun inside.

982
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,040
Come in.

983
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,320
Which seat do you want?

984
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,360
I'll sit here.

985
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,160
Alright.

986
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,200
I also have a matcha one here.

987
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:46,960
Chocolate.

988
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,640
He always pulls all sorts of things out of his pocket.

989
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,240
This is delicious.

990
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:53,920
Let's go.

991
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,160
Let's head to the next activity.

992
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:55,720
Eat.

993
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:56,920
Eat.

994
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,520
It's really too cold to handle.

995
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,960
We suddenly started running.

996
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,040
Seriously, we...

997
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,040
So romantic.

998
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,880
Watching them on a date,

999
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,200
it's just like a drama.

1000
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:16,920
Yeah, a drama.

1001
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,760
Especially their setting.

1002
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,000
And how they look on screen,

1003
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,680
it all looks so good.

1004
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,160
Do you think Xiao Jiao seems more relaxed now?

1005
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:24,960
Yeah.

1006
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,200
Because last time,

1007
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,280
at the wishing tree,

1008
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,080
he still seemed

1009
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,000
really cautious.

1010
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,560
But here, he's much more at ease.

1011
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,360
I think his mindset has changed.

1012
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,680
The environment here is so nice.

1013
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,120
Yes.

1014
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:48,760
Thank you.

1015
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,520
I mainly ordered

1016
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,280
some hot dishes.

1017
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,000
Okay.

1018
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,440
Because you were cold skiing today.

1019
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,200
Cheers.

1020
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:09,880
Cheers.

1021
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:16,960
And then...

1022
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,400
Wait a moment.

1023
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:18,840
Alright.

1024
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:19,680
What?

1025
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,640
I have a gift for you.

1026
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,160
There's a gift every day.

1027
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,000
Thank you.

1028
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,400
It's a...

1029
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,120
Um...

1030
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:30,840
A scented candle.

1031
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,280
A sleep-aid scented candle.

1032
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,160
Because you said lately

1033
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,400
you've been up until three

1034
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,560
and only get

1035
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,920
three or four hours of sleep.

1036
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,160
Citrus and cedar.

1037
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:39,720
Yeah.

1038
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,440
Citrus and cedar.

1039
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,880
Both help you focus and sleep better.

1040
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,320
He's like a little encyclopedia.

1041
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,640
So I hope it can

1042
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,120
help you sleep better

1043
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,320
for a while.

1044
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,080
Thank you.

1045
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,440
And the box is so pretty.

1046
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,280
Thank you.

1047
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,320
I really like it.

1048
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,760
I'm happy now.

1049
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:10,840
Thank you.

1050
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,760
Thank you.

1051
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,560
This looks so tasty.

1052
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,320
Let's eat first.

1053
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,280
Sure.

1054
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,080
You even ordered clams.

1055
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,160
I don't think I mentioned it.

1056
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,840
I really love clams.

1057
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,680
That's just

1058
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:27,880
fate.

1059
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,360
So straightforward.

1060
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,840
Yeah.

1061
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,320
Like yesterday's jump rope.

1062
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,280
It really left an impression on me.

1063
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,560
Yifan didn't come today.

1064
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,600
So...

1065
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:41,960
Teacher Jiao,

1066
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,560
you can invite

1067
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,120
any of the girls here

1068
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,520
to join you in this competition.

1069
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,320
So, who do you want to invite?

1070
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,400
I want to invite Lanlan.

1071
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,400
Did you hesitate?

1072
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,880
When you made that choice?

1073
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,960
I didn't hesitate.

1074
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,640
I didn't hesitate.

1075
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,320
How could I hesitate?

1076
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,000
Yeah.

1077
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,560
He kept putting food in her bowl.

1078
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,640
So for you,

1079
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,200
how do you usually interact with friends?

1080
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,080
Which side of yourself do you show?

1081
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,320
Like in close relationships.

1082
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:22,800
With good friends.

1083
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,640
Especially close friends.

1084
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,720
I think it depends on the person.

1085
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:31,960
Yeah.

1086
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,320
You can totally adjust based on the other person.

1087
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:34,640
Right.

1088
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,240
To find a state where both sides are

1089
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,920
comfortable.

1090
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,520
Well said.

1091
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:40,600
I just think

1092
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,720
the chemistry between people is subtle.

1093
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,440
In relationships,

1094
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:47,960
I can be the one

1095
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,160
who takes initiative.

1096
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,520
But relatively speaking,

1097
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,600
I think attraction is more important.

1098
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,640
Rather than directly chasing someone.

1099
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:00,960
Between people,

1100
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,040
it's definitely about attraction.

1101
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,840
It's more natural that way.

1102
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,480
She's hinting at something.

1103
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:07,760
Yeah.

1104
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:09,800
It seems like

1105
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,840
because we're not in the same room,

1106
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,920
so I might not really

1107
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,160
know.

1108
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,080
And you also changed jobs in between.

1109
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,040
Were they all the same type of job?

1110
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:20,440
No.

1111
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,000
No.

1112
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,400
Now I'm working in construction engineering.

1113
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,400
It's closely related to what I studied before.

1114
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,000
I did my master's in project business management.

1115
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,720
And it's also engineering-oriented.

1116
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:32,760
Project business management.

1117
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,400
And my previous job

1118
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,400
was in

1119
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,000
fast-moving consumer goods.

1120
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:38,520
Yeah.

1121
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,800
After working there

1122
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,440
for a while,

1123
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,920
I felt I still

1124
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,360
wanted to go back

1125
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,280
to a more specialized field.

1126
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,280
She really has her own ideas.

1127
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,360
So that's

1128
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,280
why I moved from Beijing to Shanghai.

1129
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:50,800
Yeah.

1130
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,520
I took the opportunity

1131
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,000
and

1132
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,920
completely switched career paths.

1133
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:57,360
Yeah.

1134
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,720
That's impressive.

1135
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,960
After just one year of work,

1136
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,680
you could make up your mind

1137
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,840
and change jobs right away.

1138
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,600
It's totally different, right?

1139
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,640
Completely different.

1140
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:11,440
Because I'm someone

1141
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,240
who really doesn't want my choices

1142
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,720
to lead to any regrets.

1143
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,120
Once I make up my mind,

1144
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,920
I absolutely won't regret my decision.

1145
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,520
I'll be very

1146
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,400
decisive about my choice.

1147
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,520
That's great too.

1148
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,800
I think what you said is really awesome.

1149
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,160
I'm learning new things from everyone every day.

1150
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,320
Learning something new.

1151
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,120
I think

1152
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,280
I've learned a lot from you.

1153
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:41,960
It's something to think about for a long time.

1154
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,160
And to savor for a long time.

1155
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,760
Actually, I prepared something else today.

1156
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,560
There's more.

1157
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,080
Well,

1158
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,200
you might need to look around.

1159
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,160
What is it?

1160
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,360
Are you going to play the piano?

1161
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,200
No.

1162
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,400
Remote control.

1163
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,320
I see two outlets.

1164
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,320
It's related to the window.

1165
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,560
Related to the window.

1166
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:26,880
Hard to imagine what it is.

1167
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,000
Related to the window.

1168
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:34,880
Three

1169
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:36,840
Two

1170
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,160
One

1171
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,680
What is it?

1172
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,600
This is so touching.

1173
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:00,360
What is this?

1174
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,000
It's snowing.

1175
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:01,400
Yeah.

1176
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,760
This is so romantic.

1177
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,840
I'm so happy.

1178
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,160
Xiao Jiao made it snow in summer.

1179
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,760
A snowfall just for the two of them.

1180
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:17,840
Actually, Xiao Jiao

1181
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,200
is really good at creating an atmosphere.

1182
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,720
Why do I

1183
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,360
care so much about a sense of ceremony?

1184
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:27,760
It's because I think

1185
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:31,040
it's hard for people to remember all 365 days.

1186
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,240
Every single day that happens.

1187
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,280
But if we try our best

1188
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,720
to make each day

1189
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,080
have more wonderful and happy moments,

1190
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:40,680
then we'll remember them.

1191
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,480
Today, I'm a happy kid.

1192
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,240
A happy kid.

1193
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,120
There are still

1194
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,440
pure love type guys in this world.

1195
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,400
Yes.

1196
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,200
So when you're eating,

1197
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,360
it's snowing outside. What about you?

1198
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:09,080
It depends on whether I like the person.

1199
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:09,560
It depends on whether I like the person.

1200
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,680
If I like them,

1201
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,360
I'll like them whether it snows or not.

1202
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:12,600
Yeah.

1203
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,160
Yeah.

1204
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:14,680
But I don't want

1205
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:15,960
him to use tricks.

1206
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,800
But I think Xiao Jiao isn't using tricks.

1207
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:18,920
He's really pure-hearted.

1208
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:19,600
Yeah.

1209
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,560
He's sincere.

1210
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:22,560
But I always remember

1211
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:23,520
last time, Lanlan

1212
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,400
said she's sapiosexual.

1213
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:26,720
Actually, I think Lanlan

1214
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:27,560
really is like that.

1215
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,120
She might admire

1216
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,280
and hope the other person

1217
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,080
knows more than she does.

1218
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,600
But just now, Xiao Jiao said

1219
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,120
"You're amazing."

1220
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:34,480
From you,

1221
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,240
I've gained so much.

1222
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:35,760
But

1223
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:36,640
what about her?

1224
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:37,800
She doesn't seem to

1225
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,040
get much from him

1226
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,320
except warmth.

1227
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,560
Nothing substantial.

1228
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:45,440
Because she just looks soft and cute on the outside,

1229
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,800
but inside,

1230
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,720
she's actually very sharp.

1231
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,480
Maybe praising her for being outstanding

1232
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,880
doesn't really

1233
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:52,960
touch her

1234
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,880
deep down inside.

1235
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,160
Right now, Xiao Jiao

1236
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,520
only gives a sense of ceremony.

1237
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,640
It's all big gestures.

1238
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,080
But when he gets to the cabin,

1239
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,000
like when we need

1240
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
to interact in small, detailed ways,

1241
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,280
and get to know each other,

1242
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,400
with those little details,

1243
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,160
he seems to

1244
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:09,560
step back.

1245
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,320
But Dr. Fang is always there

1246
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,960
when it comes to those small interactions.

1247
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,160
He shows up.

1248
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:16,760
Lanlan and

1249
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,240
Dr. Fang's interactions are more

1250
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:19,960
detailed.

1251
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,120
With Xiao Jiao, it's more

1252
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,080
ceremonial.

1253
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,360
So they seem great together,

1254
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,560
but it always feels like something's missing.

1255
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,040
One thing's for sure,

1256
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,600
Xiao Jiao is a really good person.

1257
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,000
Really good.

1258
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:36,920
All of this

1259
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,160
is just his way of showing love.

1260
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:39,760
Everyone

1261
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,760
has their own way of "showing their muscles."

1262
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,000
He's very romantic.

1263
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,120
Today.

1264
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,040
He probably thought about it all.

1265
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:45,880
All those moments.

1266
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,440
All the little details.

1267
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:47,000
He definitely did

1268
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,080
a lot of homework.

1269
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:48,280
Yeah.

1270
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:48,920
Right.

1271
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,240
Exactly.

1272
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,040
Yilin, tell us

1273
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:51,480
what your husband

1274
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,360
has done

1275
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,600
that made you feel

1276
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:54,640
loving him is truly

1277
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,080
the best decision

1278
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,560
I've ever made.

1279
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,360
He changed his phone recently.

1280
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,240
But I didn't.

1281
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,040
But the chargers are different now.

1282
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,640
One day when we went out together,

1283
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,520
I said I forgot my charging cable.

1284
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:07,600
Then he took out

1285
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,720
his charging cable from his bag.

1286
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,840
He didn't even need it.

1287
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,480
He said, "I knew you wouldn't bring yours."

1288
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:13,800
It's the little things.

1289
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,520
Makes me want to marry him all over again.

1290
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:19,800
It's things like this

1291
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,800
that make me

1292
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,240
Yeah, it's just natural.

1293
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,200
Those details that show up in daily life.

1294
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,120
Yeah.

1295
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:26,920
Sometimes I feel

1296
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,280
that genuine care

1297
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,920
slowly builds up.

1298
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:32,480
Do you think

1299
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,040
it definitely won't

1300
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,120
move Lanlan?

1301
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:36,920
It's possible.

1302
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,040
She might be touched.

1303
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,040
Because Xiao Jiao really is

1304
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,080
someone worth loving.

1305
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,360
He's truly a good person.

1306
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,000
He also needs someone

1307
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:45,680
to tell him

1308
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:46,640
that he doesn't need to prepare

1309
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:47,520
so many grand gestures.

1310
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,320
I'll still

1311
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,120
love you for who you are.

1312
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:50,400
You're already adorable as you are.

1313
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,760
After hearing that,

1314
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:54,720
I feel

1315
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,080
so warm inside.

1316
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,560
I think Xiao Jiao's sincerity

1317
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:58,520
is really touching.

1318
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,920
I hope that when Xiao Jiao

1319
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,200
sees this part,

1320
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,240
he'll know

1321
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,360
what we're trying to say is

1322
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,640
you don't have to work so hard,

1323
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:06,560
there will still be many people

1324
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:07,680
who support and love you.

1325
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:08,480
Yeah.

1326
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:09,960
Alright, so

1327
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,680
the first day of the double dates

1328
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,120
ends here.

1329
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,400
Things are exciting in the house.

1330
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:14,920
Just think about it,

1331
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:15,760
the ones who didn't go out

1332
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:16,440
must also be

1333
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,080
feeling anxious.

1334
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:17,360
Yeah.

1335
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,280
Let's hurry back to the house

1336
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:19,880
and see

1337
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,120
what everyone's up to.

1338
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:44,880
These two are back.

1339
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:49,000
But

1340
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,240
is it possible

1341
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,400
that many people

1342
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,280
still haven't come back yet?

1343
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:53,200
It's possible.

1344
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:53,520
Yeah.

1345
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:55,800
They're home.

1346
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,000
They're back.

1347
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:02,880
Hello.

1348
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:05,680
Xiao Fang really cares.

1349
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:07,080
Hi.

1350
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:08,360
Hello.

1351
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,440
Xiao Jiao went up after them.

1352
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,560
Xiao Fang might overthink things.

1353
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,360
Yeah.

1354
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:24,080
When she (Xu Rulan) just came in,

1355
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:24,880
she had such a sweet smile.

1356
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,040
Did they just have

1357
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,200
a wonderful moment together?

1358
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,160
Were you really happy just now?

1359
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,000
He’ll definitely overthink.

1360
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,120
For sure.

1361
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,560
I thought today was your turn.

1362
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,720
Doctor Fang, do you want some cake?

1363
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:40,760
No, thanks.

1364
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,040
Have something sweet.

1365
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:42,680
Enjoy a little sweetness.

1366
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:43,960
No.

1367
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:44,400
I don’t need anything sweet.

1368
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,560
They’re all comforting Doctor Fang.

1369
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:53,440
It’s obvious.

1370
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,280
I’ll take out my snacks.

1371
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:12,720
He seems a bit down.

1372
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,320
Everyone suddenly disappeared.

1373
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:30,760
I’m the only one left.

1374
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,880
Doctor Fang is always sitting here.

1375
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,800
Grab some snacks and have a bite.

1376
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:40,880
Anyone want to join me?

1377
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:41,440
I’ll eat.

1378
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,080
Pick one.

1379
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:55,240
Why are you laughing?

1380
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:55,960
How’s it going?

1381
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,560
Are you happy today?

1382
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,200
That’s a good question.

1383
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,480
Are you happy today?

1384
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:01,960
I don’t know.

1385
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,280
It’s a daily soul-searching question.

1386
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,160
Are you happy today?

1387
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,480
I’m happy. I’m happy every day.

1388
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,360
I was a bit happier yesterday.

1389
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,800
Or are you happier today?

1390
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,400
I guess I was happier yesterday.

1391
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,040
Do you think you’ll be happier tomorrow

1392
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,360
or happier today?

1393
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,600
Probably happier tomorrow.

1394
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,840
Because I can go on a date with Lanlan tomorrow.

1395
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,520
Those two are really funny.

1396
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:29,680
Should I go over?

1397
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:32,960
Give them all to me.

1398
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,800
The dog got wet.

1399
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:37,480
Blow it dry.

1400
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:38,720
Today, they

1401
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,240
The puppy got wet.

1402
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:39,760
It got caught in the rain.

1403
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:40,600
Yeah, it got rained on.

1404
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:42,400
So thoughtful.

1405
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,280
That’s so sour.

1406
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:47,720
So sour.

1407
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:48,520
It really is sour.

1408
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,000
You can put it here.

1409
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,160
Then switch to another one.

1410
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:54,720
I can handle it.

1411
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,000
It’s within what I can tolerate.

1412
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:57,920
He means his heart.

1413
00:54:58,560 --> 00:54:59,320
He feels it.

1414
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,040
He keeps looking upstairs.

1415
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,480
He’s probably waiting for Lanlan.

1416
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:11,240
Yeah.

1417
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:13,600
He’s distracted.

1418
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:16,880
Where are they?

1419
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,160
They just left.

1420
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:23,360
I’ll go too.

1421
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:24,520
Go quickly.

1422
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:25,360
Bye.

1423
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,800
He’s chasing after them.

1424
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,640
He’s going to find her (Xu Rulan) right away.

1425
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:30,000
Action.

1426
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:31,960
Wait for me.

1427
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:39,920
What did you do today?

1428
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,320
I went to a lot of places.

1429
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,000
What for?

1430
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:43,600
Shopping.

1431
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,760
I went all over today.

1432
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,200
So you just sat down not long ago.

1433
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,400
I've been sitting for twenty minutes.

1434
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:52,760
Hello.

1435
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:53,640
Hi.

1436
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,840
This hair dryer looks so strange.

1437
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:00,640
Right?

1438
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:01,760
I just wondered if this was a hair straightener.

1439
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,560
I thought it was for straightening hair.

1440
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,560
It must be multifunctional.

1441
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:06,920
It can straighten too.

1442
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:08,200
Yeah, it can straighten and smooth.

1443
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,840
What's up, do you need it too?

1444
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:12,880
I don't need it.

1445
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:13,640
You want to straighten your hair?

1446
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:14,600
My hair isn't that long.

1447
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:17,040
It's almost long enough.

1448
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,600
Are you leaving or staying here?

1449
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:21,920
Do you want to go for a walk?

1450
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:23,480
Let's go.

1451
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:25,680
Come on.

1452
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,400
The dog is so cute.

1453
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,080
Yeah.

1454
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:54,720
How do you feel about today?

1455
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:01,920
Do you think liking or loving someone

1456
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,240
is unconditional?

1457
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:08,200
I don't think so.

1458
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,600
When you give to someone,

1459
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:13,600
you say you don't expect anything back,

1460
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,240
but actually, while giving,

1461
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,720
you also gain emotional value.

1462
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:17,720
That's the return.

1463
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,440
Let's switch roles then.

1464
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,360
Say there's someone you don't love,

1465
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,520
who keeps

1466
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,800
expressing or giving things to you.

1467
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,440
Would you feel uncomfortable?

1468
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:33,080
They want positive feedback.

1469
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,640
If I already know

1470
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,920
I don't love them,

1471
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:38,880
then

1472
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:39,760
the gap is huge.

1473
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,640
If I know I don't like them,

1474
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:45,280
I might feel a bit pressured.

1475
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,880
So emotions are pretty complicated.

1476
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,640
Why?

1477
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,040
People are just conflicted.

1478
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,520
That's Lucky (Season 6 guest Zhang Jin).

1479
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,880
She said the house is just the beginning.

1480
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,040
Let others be themselves.

1481
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,360
And be yourself.

1482
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:20,640
How was today for you?

1483
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:26,680
Pretty good.

1484
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:29,640
Really good.

1485
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,080
Those two were a bit awkward.

1486
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,280
I was thinking,

1487
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:48,080
maybe there are things to say later.

1488
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:49,040
Don't stress too much.

1489
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,680
He sensed it.

1490
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,640
It's best if everyone just acts naturally.

1491
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,200
Give the girls some time to think.

1492
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:12,600
I think the guys

1493
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:14,320
know what they said

1494
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,160
maybe wasn't that great.

1495
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:16,400
Yeah.

1496
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:24,800
Hello.

1497
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:25,560
Hi.

1498
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:28,760
I'm really happy.

1499
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:35,440
Your cousin

1500
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,520
He’s really good at talking

1501
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:37,720
Didn’t I say this yesterday?

1502
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,440
He really understands you

1503
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,600
You can tell he’s truly

1504
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:43,520
someone very close to you

1505
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:45,560
I agree

1506
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:45,880
I think

1507
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,920
if your cousin really

1508
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:49,960
understands you

1509
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,160
he might say things

1510
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:52,040
that even you

1511
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,040
don’t fully realize about yourself

1512
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:56,040
Because people often

1513
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:57,680
get lost in their own situation

1514
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,480
So right now, you’re in it

1515
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:02,080
Do you feel confused?

1516
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,240
I’m not confused anymore

1517
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,920
Especially today, I feel even clearer

1518
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:14,880
He’s actually more relaxed this way

1519
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,520
Because I don’t feel like

1520
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:17,600
I have to do anything specific

1521
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:18,960
What about you?

1522
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,360
Honestly, I think

1523
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:23,720
I’ve always been clear

1524
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,000
I’m just saying

1525
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:30,920
when you haven’t found

1526
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:32,560
the answer yet

1527
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:35,520
Got it

1528
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:40,560
This group is back.

1529
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:43,080
Want some cherry tomatoes?

1530
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:45,720
Where did you go today?

1531
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:46,840
You didn’t go pick tomatoes, did you?

1532
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:47,360
Secret.

1533
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:48,680
Secret.

1534
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:51,800
Hello.

1535
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:52,280
Hello.

1536
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:53,440
You two came back together.

1537
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:54,680
Secret.

1538
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,440
It’s a secret, you wouldn’t get it.

1539
01:00:58,040 --> 01:00:58,520
It’s fine.

1540
01:00:58,520 --> 01:00:59,360
There aren’t that many secrets.

1541
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,480
Everyone’s got a lot of secrets today.

1542
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,440
I’ve never seen your style like this before.

1543
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:04,560
Me neither.

1544
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,080
What did I do today?

1545
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:08,720
I totally didn’t expect it.

1546
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,560
It kind of felt like horseback riding.

1547
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,560
Did we all go out today?

1548
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:16,080
Did you go out?

1549
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:19,640
I even asked Zi Han.

1550
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:20,240
They are...

1551
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,640
They went to a dog park.

1552
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:23,600
Who went to the dog park?

1553
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:24,800
Zi Han and Chi Chi.

1554
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:25,920
Zi Han and Chi Chi.

1555
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:26,160
Yeah.

1556
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:27,640
Then they said...

1557
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,160
They thought both of them could swim.

1558
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:31,840
Both dogs could swim.

1559
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:32,800
Both people could swim.

1560
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:33,440
At that moment...

1561
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:35,560
Why make Chi Chi and Zi Han swim?

1562
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:38,440
What?

1563
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:39,240
They went swimming.

1564
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:41,320
They’re so cute together.

1565
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:44,160
We thought both dogs could swim.

1566
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,520
But when they got there, they found out...

1567
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,240
Only Wei Ni could.

1568
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:49,680
They took both dogs with them.

1569
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,000
Did I come back?

1570
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,080
Looked everywhere but couldn’t find them.

1571
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:53,960
You can do that?

1572
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:56,000
Are you happy?

1573
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,040
Laughter like silver bells.

1574
01:01:58,600 --> 01:01:59,640
Happy.

1575
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:01,400
I laughed so hard.

1576
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,920
Everyone’s got something going on today.

1577
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,200
There’s something about today.

1578
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,200
Honestly, I really want to see your work.

1579
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:13,080
Wait a second.

1580
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:14,480
Don’t tell me it’s a musical.

1581
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,360
It really is a musical.

1582
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,920
It’s what we played.

1583
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:18,080
A musical feast.

1584
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:19,200
The way you played...

1585
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,120
Just a few notes, right?

1586
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,360
Those few notes captured thousands of people.

1587
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:24,680
Hello.

1588
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:25,440
You went swimming?

1589
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:26,560
You went swimming?

1590
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:27,200
We went swimming.

1591
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,000
We took the dogs diving.

1592
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:30,480
Really?

1593
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,360
Yeah, how did you know?

1594
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:32,720
Word got out.

1595
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,760
Everyone knows we went diving.

1596
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,800
I just mentioned it once.

1597
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:40,520
Now the whole house knows.

1598
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,520
Do you want to put it inside or outside?

1599
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,080
Put it back.

1600
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,480
Ruilong looks like he’s carrying a big sword. So cool.

1601
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,200
Do you want to show it off?

1602
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:01,240
Show it off?

1603
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:01,600
Forget it.

1604
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:02,200
Let’s do it tomorrow.

1605
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:02,800
Okay.

1606
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:04,280
Then hide it well today.

1607
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,600
Otherwise, you’d have to show it today.

1608
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:06,720
So you can hide it.

1609
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:11,560
Alright, I’ll just leave it here.

1610
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:15,800
So where did you go?

1611
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:16,520
Guess.

1612
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:16,760
Guess.

1613
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:17,760
Look at what I’m wearing today.

1614
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:18,320
What do you think I did?

1615
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,080
Picked tomatoes.

1616
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:22,680
No need to guess that.

1617
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:23,400
So these are really the tomatoes you picked?

1618
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,960
And also...

1619
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:26,320
You can tell by the outfit.

1620
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:29,400
So what about them?

1621
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:30,120
Equestrian.

1622
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:30,520
No.

1623
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:32,040
Duoduo cares a lot.

1624
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:35,560
Equestrian coach.

1625
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:36,680
Has the vibe of an equestrian coach.

1626
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:40,760
Why go so fancy?

1627
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:49,000
You guys need to give a heads-up.

1628
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:53,520
Hurry up.

1629
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:54,320
With that outfit of yours,

1630
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:55,920
go-kart.

1631
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,040
motorcycle.

1632
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:10,280
What kind of motorcycle?

1633
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:11,960
Which one? The three-wheeled motorcycle, bro.

1634
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,400
What other kinds of motorcycles are there?

1635
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,080
I mean, how do you ride it?

1636
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:18,280
You just straddle it, of course.

1637
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:19,120
And start riding.

1638
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:20,200
How else would you ride it?

1639
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:31,720
Ruilong.

1640
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:43,560
These two are back.

1641
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:49,960
Hello.

1642
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:53,000
So pretty.

1643
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:57,000
Everyone's back.

1644
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:02,840
I'll go put my stuff away first.

1645
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,600
Even food doesn't taste sweet anymore.

1646
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:25,520
Hello.

1647
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:28,200
Hello.

1648
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:29,360
Hello.

1649
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,000
Hello.

1650
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:35,400
Chichi hasn't taken her eyes off.

1651
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:36,320
Chichi hasn't looked away.

1652
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:41,840
Who else hasn't come back yet?

1653
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:42,280
Lanlan.

1654
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:43,320
Lanlan.

1655
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,280
Lanlan isn't back yet.

1656
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:45,160
Lanlan's back.

1657
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:46,920
She's back.

1658
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:47,520
Where is she?

1659
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:49,720
Upstairs.

1660
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:50,920
She's not upstairs.

1661
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:55,960
Maybe she was

1662
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:56,720
uh...

1663
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:57,280
Yeah.

1664
01:05:58,960 --> 01:05:59,800
taken away by Xiao Fang.

1665
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:11,320
So we came back the latest.

1666
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:13,560
Probably.

1667
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:16,720
Here they come.

1668
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:19,360
What did you guys do today?

1669
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,280
We went...

1670
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:23,400
He quickly changed the topic.

1671
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:25,640
Xiao Jiao, relax.

1672
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:26,360
Xiao Jiao, don't be nervous.

1673
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:28,120
No.

1674
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,000
Lanbao.

1675
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:47,600
What did you guys do?

1676
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:48,680
Skiing.

1677
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:49,040
Together.

1678
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:49,760
We went skiing together.

1679
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:50,560
You two went skiing?

1680
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:50,720
Yeah.

1681
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:50,960
Yes.

1682
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:54,240
Where did you go?

1683
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,440
You can tell from their outfits.

1684
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:56,680
By their clothes.

1685
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:57,920
Went.

1686
01:06:58,400 --> 01:06:59,840
Honestly, it felt like a ball.

1687
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:01,120
Flowers.

1688
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:02,080
Huahua.

1689
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:03,520
I played piano, he played guqin.

1690
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:04,760
You two played guqin?

1691
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:05,760
You went to play guqin?

1692
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,320
No wonder it's so Chinese-style.

1693
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:12,080
Then we performed.

1694
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:13,840
Out in nature.

1695
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:15,920
And you could hear that kind of

1696
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:22,560
That's awesome, Ruilong.

1697
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,240
When I said I could play guzheng before,

1698
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:26,880
I thought

1699
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:30,800
he was hiding his talents.

1700
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:31,880
Hidden talent.

1701
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:32,280
Yeah.

1702
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:35,560
What did you guys do?

1703
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:37,720
We went...

1704
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,240
Guess.

1705
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:40,480
Archery.

1706
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:43,720
Wearing that for archery?

1707
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,320
She said it was something you make.

1708
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:54,280
So you went to...

1709
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:55,000
Give us a hint.

1710
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:56,400
Pottery.

1711
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:58,120
Perfume.

1712
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:01,880
Decorations.

1713
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:03,760
It makes a sound.

1714
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:10,840
Bell.

1715
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:11,280
That...

1716
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:12,360
What kind of bell?

1717
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:13,400
Actually, it's a bell.

1718
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:14,480
It's a bell, right?

1719
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:15,280
Wind chime?

1720
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:17,000
Wind chime.

1721
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:17,960
Yeah.

1722
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:21,040
The ones who care aren't saying anything.

1723
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:22,200
Yeah.

1724
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:36,800
You can hang it at the door.

1725
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,280
That way, everyone who comes in

1726
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:40,160
If someone goes out at night,

1727
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:41,440
everyone in the house will know.

1728
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:49,560
Honestly, I think

1729
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,640
this might be too much information.

1730
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:05,560
This relationship is wild, guys.

1731
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:14,640
The ones who care didn’t even ask.

1732
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:15,640
Chichi didn’t ask.

1733
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:16,320
Zi Han didn’t ask.

1734
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:16,680
Yeah.

1735
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:18,560
Because Zi Han doesn’t want to see Chichi’s reaction either.

1736
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:21,320
So the two of them care way too much.

1737
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:21,880
Exactly.

1738
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:21,920
Right.

1739
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:23,040
I think Dr. Fang

1740
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,440
said something really cute.

1741
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:26,400
Yesterday, today,

1742
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,040
and tomorrow.

1743
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:29,040
These three days,

1744
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,880
we’ve really figured things out.

1745
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,920
We’ve understood a lot.

1746
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:33,520
Yes.

1747
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:37,240
It’s starting now.

1748
01:09:58,200 --> 01:09:59,720
Alright, Cupids of love,

1749
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:01,480
let’s do something different today.

1750
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:01,880
What does this mean?

1751
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:03,000
What does this mean?

1752
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,920
All the love connections are here.

1753
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:08,280
But what are we guessing?

1754
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:11,240
We’re guessing boys and girls.

1755
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:13,600
Each group has one connection

1756
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:15,000
that’s wrong.

1757
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,800
We need to find the wrong one.

1758
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,040
Only one is wrong, right?

1759
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:19,440
Yes.

1760
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:19,920
Alright.

1761
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:22,200
Today we’ll split into two groups.

1762
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:24,560
Boys in one group, girls in another.

1763
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:25,880
Boys guess the girls.

1764
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:25,920
Boys guess the girls.

1765
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:26,960
Girls guess the boys.

1766
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:29,000
The group that guesses wrong

1767
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,160
will need to

1768
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:31,960
post on Weibo

1769
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:33,960
tonight’s love connections.

1770
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:35,760
It’s so hard to guess.

1771
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:38,160
And tag all the Cupids present.

1772
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:39,560
So this time,

1773
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:40,640
there’s a penalty.

1774
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,120
Ours is super easy to guess.

1775
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:43,360
Isn’t this just giving away points?

1776
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:44,320
Yeah.

1777
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,560
So for the boys’ part,

1778
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:46,640
let’s use elimination.

1779
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:48,480
Zi Han chose

1780
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:49,160
Chichi.

1781
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:50,800
Xiao Jiao is out.

1782
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:51,600
Dr. Fang.

1783
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:52,640
Lanlan.

1784
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:55,200
Longlong, I think he still loves Duoduo.

1785
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:56,240
Le Chen.

1786
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:56,960
Lu Yuan.

1787
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:59,080
So the biggest mystery now is

1788
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:01,600
how Yu Xing and Zi Han will choose.

1789
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:03,880
After careful thought,

1790
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:04,800
it’s hard to guess.

1791
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,160
I think it’s Yu Xing.

1792
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:08,400
So the question is, who did Yu Xing pick?

1793
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,320
Chichi.

1794
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:10,920
Definitely Chichi.

1795
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:11,520
Yeah.

1796
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:13,240
This really doesn’t sound that hard.

1797
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:14,080
Right.

1798
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:15,120
Did he pick me?

1799
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:22,480
Alright, next let's guess the girls' choices.

1800
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:23,000
Jue.

1801
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:23,840
That's correct.

1802
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:24,360
Ailin.

1803
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:25,480
Yes.

1804
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:26,680
Lu Yuan.

1805
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:27,680
No problem.

1806
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:28,240
Lanlan.

1807
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:32,080
Right.

1808
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,360
Dr. Fang.

1809
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,720
She spent the whole day interacting with Xiao Jiao.

1810
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:36,520
Yeah.

1811
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:38,240
She wouldn't write to Teacher Jiao.

1812
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:40,360
That snow didn't melt her heart.

1813
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:40,960
No.

1814
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:41,560
No.

1815
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,520
Spent a wonderful day with me.

1816
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:46,520
Or maybe something like, "You put a lot of thought into it."

1817
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:48,680
Suddenly I feel like Lanlan will pick Xiao Jiao.

1818
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:51,640
When Lanlan talks to Xiao Jiao,

1819
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:52,600
what do they usually say?

1820
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:53,800
Chasing and attraction.

1821
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,640
I feel like she's still the same as before.

1822
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,640
Her feelings are just like her previous choices.

1823
01:11:58,640 --> 01:11:59,320
They're the same.

1824
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:00,920
She thinks Dr. Fang is relatively

1825
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:01,920
still pretty good.

1826
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:03,520
So I think it should be Chichi.

1827
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:05,360
Now I feel like

1828
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:07,200
it's between Chichi and Lanlan.

1829
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:08,640
One of them.

1830
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:10,240
So who did Chichi pick?

1831
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:11,800
Chichi picked Yuxing.

1832
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:12,320
Yuxing.

1833
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:16,640
Because the two of them really

1834
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:20,560
started chatting and even washed the dog together, it went well.

1835
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:21,840
Dog.

1836
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,480
But it got awkward at the end.

1837
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,400
Both of them looked upset in the end.

1838
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:28,960
The vibe wasn't that great.

1839
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:29,600
Yeah.

1840
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:31,080
If the ending was good,

1841
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,120
I think it's fine if there were some issues in the middle.

1842
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:32,800
That's not a problem.

1843
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,680
But the problem is, the ending wasn't good.

1844
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:36,640
That can make the whole thing feel off.

1845
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,000
Makes sense.

1846
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:38,680
Chichi, then.

1847
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:39,120
Chichi.

1848
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,040
If that's the case,

1849
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:46,080
let's have Yuxing go first.

1850
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:46,920
Connect with Chichi.

1851
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:51,160
Chichi should pick Yuxing here.

1852
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:56,240
We can't be wrong right from the start, right?

1853
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:56,600
No way.

1854
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:57,160
Impossible.

1855
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:57,680
I'm telling you,

1856
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:59,160
if I get this wrong today,

1857
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:00,760
I'll eat this heart.

1858
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:01,320
You know?

1859
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:02,520
Someone actually did that before.

1860
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:05,840
Seriously, he didn't show up for the next episode.

1861
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,320
Because he was still eating it.

1862
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:07,680
Still eating.

1863
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:08,200
Got hurt.

1864
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:09,400
Alright.

1865
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:11,560
When the jasmine blooms, it's a sign of love.

1866
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:12,440
Next, let's move on to

1867
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:15,440
the Kang Shifu Jasmine Tea Heartbeat Moment.

1868
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:16,400
Everyone,

1869
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:17,920
the exciting moment

1870
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,400
is about to arrive.

1871
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:20,400
Will it be our boys

1872
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,680
who get the Heartbeat Stone,

1873
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:22,520
or the girls?

1874
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:26,720
Let's reveal the results now.

1875
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:29,240
First, we'll announce the girls' choices.

1876
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:37,080
Who did Lanlan pick?

1877
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:37,960
Lanlan picked Xiao Jiao.

1878
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:41,840
Just now, I really

1879
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,800
Lanlan picked Xiao Jiao.

1880
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:46,120
So who did Chichi send hers to?

1881
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:47,200
Zihan.

1882
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,840
Is everyone basing it on today's gratitude?

1883
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,120
It depends on what she wrote.

1884
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:52,320
Yeah, the content matters.

1885
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:52,440
Yes, the content is important.

1886
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:53,360
Right.

1887
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:55,600
Next, let's look at the boys' choices.

1888
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:03,080
Wrong.

1889
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:04,760
Ruilong gave it to Jue'er.

1890
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:06,240
Ruilong.

1891
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:07,560
We were all wrong.

1892
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:10,120
I'll admit my mistake and accept it.

1893
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:13,320
Is it possible that

1894
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:14,840
When Ruilong said he was looking forward to tomorrow,

1895
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:16,720
it was when he was with Duoduo.

1896
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:18,440
He could totally feel that Duoduo

1897
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:19,640
didn't like him anymore.

1898
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:22,560
I realized Ruilong actually gets it.

1899
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,560
He knows when it's not going to work.

1900
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:25,880
So he stops at the right time.

1901
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:27,480
I won't pressure you anymore.

1902
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:28,760
Yeah.

1903
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:29,720
So let's see

1904
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:31,800
what the message actually says.

1905
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,720
But before that,

1906
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:34,880
our Weibo today

1907
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:35,600
was really lively.

1908
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:38,840
Everyone was posting like crazy.

1909
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:40,480
We should be united.

1910
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:42,480
One Weibo post.

1911
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:43,280
Everyone is

1912
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:44,720
posting the same thing.

1913
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:46,520
That's too hard.

1914
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,280
I really didn't expect that.

1915
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:48,840
So all of us

1916
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:49,840
don't have it, right?

1917
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:50,280
Yeah.

1918
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:50,840
That's fine too.

1919
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:52,000
None of us have it together.

1920
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:52,760
That's also

1921
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:54,120
something to be happy about.

1922
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:54,840
How nice.

1923
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:56,200
Very optimistic.

1924
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,120
We've got team spirit now.

1925
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,000
We were wrong together.

1926
01:14:59,000 --> 01:14:59,640
Come on.

1927
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:00,800
Everyone, let's take a look

1928
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:01,920
at the message content.

1929
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:06,400
I want to hear you play the guqin.

1930
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:07,240
I understand.

1931
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:08,120
I get this one.

1932
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:11,960
Thank you for your thoughtfulness.

1933
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:13,680
You made my day really happy.

1934
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:15,320
I'm a pretty slow person.

1935
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:16,680
But today felt strange.

1936
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:19,080
I could clearly feel your sincerity.

1937
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:21,400
She still just says thank you.

1938
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,000
Maybe she's just shy.

1939
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,040
Maybe it's just a polite way to say thanks.

1940
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:28,040
Let's see what's next.

1941
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:31,440
Riding the motorcycle was awesome.

1942
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:32,280
I was super happy.

1943
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:33,120
That was expected.

1944
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,760
Seeing snow in midsummer

1945
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:38,680
was funny,

1946
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:40,040
but also kind of magical.

1947
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,720
"Magical" and "strange,"

1948
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:42,680
both are

1949
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:43,720
subtle feelings.

1950
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:47,840
I just hope you're happy every day.

1951
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:51,440
Thank you for celebrating my birthday today.

1952
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:54,360
Enjoy the rest of your journey.

1953
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:55,880
That's very polite.

1954
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:57,400
Next is the guys' part.

1955
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:01,400
I had a great and happy day today.

1956
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:06,080
Hope today's rain was happy and warm.

1957
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,400
Those two have a chance.

1958
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:11,960
Really looking forward to where we'll go tomorrow.

1959
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,640
Can you use less vinegar next time?

1960
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:18,240
It's too sour.

1961
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:23,880
To me, you looked just like

1962
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:26,640
a sparkling ski suit under the lights today.

1963
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:28,040
Wavy line.

1964
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:30,640
Sparkling.

1965
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,400
I made you feel pressured.

1966
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:36,400
I'm really sorry.

1967
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,040
He wants to apologize to her.

1968
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:41,680
I think Zihan really scored points with this.

1969
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:42,080
Yes.

1970
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:43,240
I think taking responsibility for your actions

1971
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:44,800
and making up for them quickly

1972
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:45,600
is great.

1973
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:46,520
Yeah.

1974
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:46,880
Okay.

1975
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:49,600
That's all the messages we have.

1976
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:50,680
Let's keep watching.

1977
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:56,280
The wind outside has been so strong lately.

1978
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:58,480
It messes up my hair completely.

1979
01:16:58,480 --> 01:16:59,960
After I wash my hair, look—

1980
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:01,240
I can't even comb it out.

1981
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:03,640
Your hair is so smooth.

1982
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:04,720
How do you take care of it?

1983
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:06,160
I use the newly upgraded

1984
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:08,320
Pantene High-Active Peptide Bubble Shampoo and Conditioner.

1985
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:09,720
Do you want to try the hair mask first?

1986
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:10,800
Sure.

1987
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,320
What are these little beads inside?

1988
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:15,840
They're concentrated essence microbeads.

1989
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,560
Combined with skincare-grade peptide formula,

1990
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:19,680
it can rebuild hair core proteins from the roots.

1991
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:21,520
It makes your hair look and feel amazing.

1992
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,960
My hair is so much smoother now.

1993
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:28,920
It's bouncy and resilient.

1994
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:30,120
And really shiny.

1995
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:31,520
I need to go buy some right away.

1996
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:32,480
That's great.

1997
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,680
Seeing these results makes me want it too.

1998
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:35,720
I'm totally sold on it.

1999
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:36,920
You really caught onto this one.

2000
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:38,360
Let me tell everyone as well.

2001
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:39,920
Dear friends,

2002
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:40,480
right now,

2003
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:43,920
search online to get Pantene for just one cent.

2004
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:46,080
There are surprise new product promotions too.

2005
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:48,960
Stock up and look beautiful every day.

2006
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:50,160
Guaranteed beauty.

2007
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:51,080
Guaranteed quality.

2008
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:52,480
Guaranteed results.

2009
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:54,360
So on the first day

2010
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:54,920
of this date

2011
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:55,680
during the process,

2012
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:56,880
everyone really

2013
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,280
shared a lot,

2014
01:17:58,280 --> 01:17:59,280
and expressed a lot.

2015
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:00,480
Many stories happened.

2016
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:01,280
So next,

2017
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:02,040
soon,

2018
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:02,960
we're about to start

2019
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:04,640
the second day of dates.

2020
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:06,360
There are so many people

2021
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:07,560
to look forward to.

2022
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:09,120
Like Duoduo's date,

2023
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:10,160
and Wang Jue,

2024
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:12,120
Jue'er and Longlong's date,

2025
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:14,480
Doctor Xiao Fang and Lanlan's date,

2026
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:17,200
Chichi and Yuxing's date—

2027
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:17,920
all of them are

2028
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:19,680
really exciting dates.

2029
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:22,120
So let's keep watching and see what happens next.

2030
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:02,600
Soon

2031
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:05,440
It's almost time for our second date

2032
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,040
I didn't give you a gift when you came in

2033
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:08,200
Were you a little disappointed?

2034
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:09,600
Just seeing you makes me happy

2035
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:13,640
This is so much fun

2036
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:15,760
I'm super happy

2037
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:16,120
Yeah, this looks really fun

2038
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:16,800
Yeah, this looks really fun

2039
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:17,760
I think

2040
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:18,320
No way

2041
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:19,000
No way

2042
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:19,960
You can't think that way

2043
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:21,000
Okay, fine

2044
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:26,040
So sweet

2045
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:27,160
A princess carry in the air

2046
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:30,680
He keeps passing her the ball

2047
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:31,480
Yeah, he's always passing the ball

2048
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:33,680
I think she's super cute right now

2049
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:34,840
She finally opened up

2050
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:36,120
Awesome

2051
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:37,640
Hello

2052
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:38,040
Hello

2053
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:40,560
Mine is already boiling

2054
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:41,160
Mushrooms are fine

2055
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:41,720
Mushrooms

2056
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:45,800
The one from yesterday

2057
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:48,360
Duoduo

2058
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:48,960
This is for you

2059
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:50,120
Watch it today or (tomorrow)

2060
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:51,840
You can watch it anytime
