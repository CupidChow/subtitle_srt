1
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,440
Bet you didn't expect it—it's us again.

2
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,840
Surprised?

3
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,440
Long time no see.

4
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,040
It's still us.

5
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:41,960
Alright.

6
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,000
So,

7
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,520
let's warm up first.

8
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,840
Why does it feel like I'm playing

9
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,680
a dance game?

10
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,240
A dance game.

11
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,040
This is so challenging.

12
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,160
It's getting harder.

13
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,120
Kids these days dance so well.

14
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,440
Were we ever this good?

15
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:21,720
Okay.

16
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:21,920
Okay.

17
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,920
Okay.

18
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,680
Warm-up done.

19
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,600
Not bad.

20
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,240
It's hot.

21
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:25,840
So hot.

22
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,600
I'm exhausted already.

23
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,360
I'm sweating.

24
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,600
Just one set and I'm spent.

25
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,920
Need a breather.

26
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,840
Take a sip.

27
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,760
Let's all introduce ourselves.

28
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:39,640
Hello, everyone.

29
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,120
I'm from Heart Signal,

30
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,600
Season 8 team, Liu Zihan.

31
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,120
Hello, everyone.

32
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,760
I'm from Heart Signal,

33
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,840
Season 8 team, Wang Lechen.

34
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,200
Hello, everyone.

35
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,440
I'm from Heart Signal,

36
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,720
Season 5 team, Sun Xing.

37
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,040
You can also call me Xiaopai.

38
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,400
Hello, everyone.

39
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,080
I'm from Heart Signal,

40
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,880
Season 5 team, Xue Zheyang.

41
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,480
Hello, everyone.

42
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm from Heart Signal,

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,920
Season 5 team, Chen Zonglun.

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,360
Alright.

45
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,560
Welcome, everyone, to

46
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,400
this episode of Watching Heart Signal With You.

47
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,280
This is the sports special.

48
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,840
We're all sporty guys.

49
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,560
What sports

50
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,280
are you especially good at?

51
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,600
I try all kinds of sports.

52
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,680
I ski and skate more often.

53
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,680
For me, it's mainly diving and skiing.

54
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,720
Playing ball games and working out.

55
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,480
What about you guys,

56
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,320
any favorite activities?

57
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,200
I know Chen Zonglun has been playing tennis lately.

58
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:24,800
Right?

59
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,320
Yeah, I've got tennis fever lately.

60
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,400
I've been really into tennis.

61
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,560
Still a beginner.

62
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,040
Tennis for him—

63
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,240
Tennis is

64
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,240
a childhood skill.

65
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,960
Started young.

66
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,040
Tennis Prince.

67
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,760
Tennis Prince.

68
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,040
Tennis at the youth sports school.

69
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,400
Alright, let's

70
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,520
watch the main episode together.

71
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,120
Let's go.

72
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,320
Let's check out episode four.

73
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,600
Looking forward to it.

74
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,120
Here it comes.

75
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,120
It's about to start.

76
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,400
Tie the apron.

77
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,440
Feels natural.

78
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,000
You guys—

79
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,840
In your season,

80
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,280
this must've happened a lot, right?

81
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:14,800
A lot.

82
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,640
Every day.

83
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,680
Tied it every day, right?

84
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,640
You help me, I help you.

85
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,720
He helped me.

86
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,880
Once you enter the kitchen area,

87
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,920
you have to start tying the apron.

88
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,480
You just automatically pick up the apron.

89
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,200
Find someone to help you tie it.

90
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:24,840
It's automatic.

91
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,520
Yeah.

92
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,520
Which day was this?

93
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,720
I've already forgotten.

94
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,040
I remember this day.

95
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,400
I probably came back late.

96
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,960
Just the two of you eating in the kitchen?

97
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,440
We all live on sunlight.

98
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,400
Here it comes.

99
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,240
Here it comes.

100
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,920
Let me see if paper is stronger

101
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,000
or if the spatula is stronger.

102
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,240
Paper wins.

103
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,120
Brother Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng)

104
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,560
Why are you washing things again?

105
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,160
Born with the "washing master" physique.

106
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,800
No.

107
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,000
Brother Jiao's respawn point.

108
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,120
It's only that one.

109
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,000
That place.

110
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:45,880
Found it.

111
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,080
They even have this going on.

112
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,520
You really need a third-person view.

113
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,040
You know what?

114
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,120
I feel like

115
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,680
I feel like I wasted my time in the cabin.

116
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,320
Was there any spare ribs left after they cooked?

117
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,240
I didn’t get any anyway.

118
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,280
Missed out on everything.

119
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,080
I didn’t get any anyway.

120
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
Riding the little train every day.

121
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,520
Riding the little train every day.

122
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,960
Only you two get to ride this train, huh?

123
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,960
The chance for "choo-choo" moments.

124
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,480
Not even a chance for "choo-choo."

125
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,560
I want to ride too.

126
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,480
I want to try it too.

127
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,800
I want to "choo-choo" too.

128
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,760
When will you take us for a ride?

129
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,680
Where are you going?

130
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,760
No, that’s not it.

131
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,600
The little train.

132
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,360
Are you two heading off to

133
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,200
do the "choo-choo"?

134
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,200
Go "choo-choo" for a bit.

135
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,880
Off you go.

136
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,040
I’m driving the train.

137
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,320
You’re driving?

138
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,040
Driving it yourself.

139
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,800
Anytime.

140
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,120
Ready to go whenever.

141
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,200
Look.

142
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,120
The girl is sad now.

143
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,040
She’s upset.

144
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,560
Just like that,

145
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,160
her face fell.

146
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,680
Her smile disappeared.

147
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,640
It’s all your fault.

148
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,720
She was just next to you.

149
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,360
I’m leaving, bye.

150
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,560
Can’t even hide my smile.

151
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,200
I’m leaving.

152
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,680
I’m done filming.

153
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,440
You can’t keep driving the train.

154
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,080
Turned and left.

155
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,800
Said you can’t drive anymore.

156
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,000
Forget it, I’m leaving.

157
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,040
See if there’s another activity.

158
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,720
So she can

159
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,040
spend some time alone with you.

160
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,520
Happy.

161
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,280
Smiling so happily.

162
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,440
Smiling this much.

163
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,280
Ruilong said,

164
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,000
You guys chat first.

165
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,360
I’m heading back to Switzerland.

166
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,920
Ruilong rarely expresses this kind of thing.

167
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,720
He’s pretty shy, right?

168
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,200
Yeah.

169
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,880
Your iconic moment is coming.

170
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,120
Whose iconic moment?

171
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,040
His iconic moment.

172
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,920
What iconic moment of yours?

173
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,480
Do you know about him climbing over the railing?

174
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,040
Climbing the railing.

175
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:41,960
The same kind of railing.

176
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,320
There’s water right under this railing.

177
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,360
You jumped down?

178
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:44,960
He said,

179
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,920
Yesterday felt so good.

180
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,280
Went down.

181
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:50,760
Really?

182
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,080
Really.

183
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,680
Go take a look.

184
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:53,960
Okay, let’s go see.

185
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,720
Let’s go check it out.

186
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,840
Living here.

187
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,480
Every time I see it, I get jealous.

188
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,440
So many people.

189
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,720
He was invited on the spot.

190
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,120
He just went right after getting the invite?

191
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,840
Yeah.

192
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,960
Bro, watch this.

193
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,720
Dr. Fang isn't here.

194
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,160
Just go for a sneak attack.

195
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,160
Where did Dr. Fang go?

196
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,640
Where is Dr. Fang?

197
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,080
What is he doing?

198
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,760
Did he go for surgery?

199
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,320
Key point.

200
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,120
Doesn't matter anymore.

201
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,880
Right in front of all of you.

202
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,600
They went to the park.

203
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,120
It's Brother Jiao.

204
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,000
Snatched the park time.

205
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,760
This is something to grab.

206
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,280
Yeah.

207
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,760
It only

208
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,480
refreshes every Sunday.

209
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,960
You have to use it that week.

210
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,800
Use it up.

211
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,200
The key is you have to invite someone.

212
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,080
And they have to agree.

213
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,800
Right.

214
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,640
You can actually refuse.

215
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,640
You can refuse.

216
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,240
Park time allows it.

217
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,360
All the activities in the park

218
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,280
can be freely arranged.

219
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,240
That's awesome.

220
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,720
But only inside the park.

221
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:21,680
Really?

222
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,880
That park is huge.

223
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,480
Yeah, the park is really big.

224
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,040
That's pretty cool.

225
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,800
This is even better than the little train.

226
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,160
Definitely.

227
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,560
Brother Jiao is always busy.

228
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,960
He wants to light up tonight.

229
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,960
What did they go do?

230
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,560
Barbecue.

231
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,920
Very thoughtful.

232
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,720
Brother Jiao is super thoughtful.

233
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,040
That girl is good at expressing herself.

234
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,760
Doesn't this line mean

235
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,560
that thing?

236
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,560
Tonight's moonlight

237
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,400
is beautiful.

238
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,080
Beautiful.

239
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,600
Yeah.

240
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,880
Sweetheart.

241
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,280
Sweetheart.

242
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,280
Come on, a toast to your sweetheart.

243
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,200
Is the moon beautiful tonight?

244
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,400
The moon.

245
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,960
I didn't prepare this for you.

246
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,080
What kind of idol drama is this?

247
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,040
There's even this?

248
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,360
This is still glowing.

249
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,680
So romantic.

250
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,160
Looks great.

251
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,160
The whole universe will know.

252
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,960
Why not name this tree

253
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,080
"Rulan Tree"?

254
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,600
"Rulan Tree."

255
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,920
He climbed up to hang this.

256
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,520
He set it up himself.

257
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,240
Brother Jiao even has this

258
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:39,600
skill.

259
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,280
Except for washing dishes.

260
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,800
Except for washing dishes.

261
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,560
Always looking for things to do.

262
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,000
Always looking for things to do.

263
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,400
People who notice things are different.

264
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,240
And also

265
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,400
more things to do.

266
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,840
More things to do.

267
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,240
Did you guys know about this?

268
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,680
I didn't know.

269
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,680
So

270
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,200
He didn't really explain.

271
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,760
Even if he did, we couldn't imagine it.

272
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,920
It's this kind of scene.

273
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,360
Focus your energy.

274
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,120
Focus fire.

275
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,600
Yeah.

276
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,040
(Touched) Made me cry.

277
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,040
Brother Jiao was so genuine that day.

278
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,480
Had a great time.

279
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,200
I think Brother Jiao probably

280
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,400
based on what Xu Rulan said before,

281
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,040
a lot of things,

282
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,360
he must've thought of a lot.

283
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,960
He wanted to prepare these for her.

284
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,600
Yes.

285
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,360
The key is he remembers all these things.

286
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,880
Brother Jiao is amazing.

287
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,320
If it were Brother Jiao,

288
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:02,760
and he did this for me,

289
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,240
I’d definitely be moved to tears.

290
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,680
The highest spirit of devotion.

291
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,040
He’s the devoted type in relationships, right?

292
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,640
Devoted personality.

293
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,440
He’s a devoted partner.

294
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,080
Learning.

295
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,080
Learning.

296
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,120
The trees look better through your eyes.

297
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,040
I can’t take it.

298
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,320
I’m really looking forward to what happens next.

299
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,800
I think this time in the park

300
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,800
was completely infused with

301
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,920
Brother Jiao’s own ideas.

302
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,680
I’ve found he’s

303
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,400
a very thoughtful person.

304
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,800
His ideas are really detailed.

305
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,480
He has so many ideas.

306
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,320
It’s honestly

307
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,560
beyond what I imagined.

308
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,960
He can set things up so well—

309
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,640
To me,

310
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,040
this is like a proposal-level setup.

311
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,600
He’s raised the bar

312
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,560
so high.

313
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,000
Everyone

314
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,080
he personally put thought into the arrangements.

315
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,280
I think

316
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,880
this is really special.

317
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,440
Because I’m someone who doesn’t care about rituals at all,

318
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,680
when I see things like this,

319
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,720
I get embarrassed, you know?

320
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,400
But deep down, are you touched?

321
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,480
Of course.

322
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,400
But

323
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,920
since I’ve never had a sense of ceremony,

324
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,360
I don’t even celebrate my birthday.

325
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:34,920
Okay.

326
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,880
Yeah, so for these kinds of rituals,

327
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,520
these holidays, I’m really

328
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,240
unmoved.

329
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,000
I just treat it like any other day.

330
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,280
You prefer the kind that’s

331
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,600
I just like things to be simple.

332
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,040
Normal.

333
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,520
Simple.

334
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:47,760
Ordinary.

335
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,080
Yeah.

336
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,840
Simple.

337
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,440
Duoduo.

338
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,120
Duoduo.

339
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,760
Secret Message Box.

340
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,360
Yeah.

341
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,560
Little train.

342
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,040
Is it Ruilong?

343
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,240
Because Ruilong just now, on the way,

344
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,680
heard she wanted to ride the train.

345
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:07,960
Yeah.

346
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,680
That’s my guess.

347
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:09,720
Yeah.

348
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,800
Turns out it is Ruilong.

349
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,920
Ruilong prepared it.

350
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,800
She responded to him first.

351
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,360
She always gives emotional support.

352
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,760
She never lets a word go unnoticed.

353
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,720
She knows boxing.

354
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,960
She’s really good.

355
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,160
When Ruilong smiles,

356
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,840
it’s truly healing.

357
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,680
Cooling spray.

358
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,080
Your favorite.

359
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,600
Really?

360
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,040
Right?

361
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,640
What?

362
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,280
No need.

363
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,680
No need to roast me anymore.

364
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,200
Got on.

365
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,440
Very generous.

366
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,480
Duoduo.

367
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,440
Ruilong has a similar personality.

368
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,520
Very generous and pure.

369
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,760
Shy but generous.

370
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,320
Kind of like Li Wanyi.

371
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,200
Similar personality.

372
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,440
This pair is pretty good too.

373
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,320
The side profile looks quite similar.

374
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,160
Little Leo (Leonardo).

375
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,840
Ruilong always fails when chasing girls.

376
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,200
Yeah.

377
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,800
What kind of girl

378
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,240
would reject someone like Ruilong?

379
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:37,520
Yeah.

380
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,320
Guy.

381
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,040
Isn't Ruilong pretty good at handling things?

382
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,080
Open Day

383
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,520
Baby

384
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,200
Who is this? They look so familiar.

385
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:07,520
Good Luck (Zhang Jin)

386
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,160
Good Luck (Zhang Jin)

387
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,400
Zhang Good Luck (Zhang Jin)

388
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,960
Is this a Zeng Zhaohui fan meeting?

389
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,440
Zeng Zeng (Zeng Zhaohui)

390
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,720
He just got engaged.

391
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,080
Brother Squad

392
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,480
If you invite your friends

393
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,280
to the sports event

394
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,120
how would they help you out?

395
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,320
I hope he can be my eyes.

396
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,120
I'd definitely tell him first

397
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,120
that I might be interested in this person

398
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,840
maybe have some feelings

399
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,720
Then when I can't see

400
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,880
he can help keep an eye out for me

401
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,680
and report back to me.

402
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,720
So do you think if a girl

403
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,680
shows any signs or hints

404
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,440
would you immediately

405
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,560
tell your bros?

406
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,160
I'd check first.

407
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,440
See if there's any chance between you two.

408
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,120
If not, just break it up, right?

409
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,400
What about Chen Zonglun?

410
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,560
If you bring friends

411
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,840
Winning comes first

412
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,640
Friendship second, I guess.

413
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,800
Definitely want to

414
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,320
win.

415
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,520
Try to get as much help as possible

416
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,000
from your bros in the events.

417
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
That way you get first pick for dating.

418
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,720
Right?

419
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:15,800
You two

420
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,440
when you went to the sports event

421
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,560
did you talk to your brother squad

422
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,520
about it beforehand?

423
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,520
Definitely not.

424
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,160
We had no idea what we were supposed to do.

425
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,800
Yeah.

426
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,600
Did you tell him

427
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,480
which girl you liked?

428
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,960
No, didn't say anything at all.

429
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,560
Just come and have fun, that's it.

430
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,160
Just play.

431
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,680
Just play, that's fine.

432
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,160
Just come and experience it.

433
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,000
Coming is the right choice.

434
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,880
Coming is the right choice.

435
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,200
Just come.

436
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,680
Let's keep watching.

437
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,640
They probably talked before coming up.

438
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,200
They must've chatted.

439
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,040
They exchanged info.

440
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,800
They talked.

441
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,920
Didn't talk at all.

442
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,480
Seriously, not at all.

443
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,760
They also met on the spot.

444
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,400
Only met the female guests here.

445
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,720
Hadn't met before.

446
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,280
Even knowing names doesn't help, right?

447
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,760
Jaw-dropping.

448
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,120
Really had no idea.

449
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,520
Darn it, said the wrong thing.

450
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,720
That's interesting.

451
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,880
Your bro figured it out.

452
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,200
My bro.

453
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:42,880
He thought...

454
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,920
What he thought.

455
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,920
He thought.

456
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,040
Alright.

457
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,040
Okay.

458
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,240
801st floor, 802nd floor.

459
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,040
Which side do you think will win?

460
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,920
Why did you lose?

461
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,920
Evenly matched.

462
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,480
How are they so evenly matched?

463
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,400
What a coincidence.

464
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,280
He slipped.

465
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,160
Jiao slipped underfoot.

466
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,200
Nice.

467
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,760
Really want to win.

468
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:07,960
Brother Jiao.

469
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,200
His hand twisted.

470
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:09,560
Yeah, felt like no strength.

471
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,720
Yeah, didn't use full strength.

472
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,640
Slipped at first.

473
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,160
Lost strength in the foot.

474
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:19,840
Yep.

475
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,160
Hurry up.

476
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,880
So intense.

477
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,520
No need.

478
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,560
It's fine.

479
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,840
Okay.

480
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,200
Alright.

481
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,440
Where's the one in blue?

482
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,880
Your Lu.

483
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,920
Here he comes.

484
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,040
He's here.

485
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,320
Wait, what's up?

486
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,000
This is the finale.

487
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:13,800
Here he comes.

488
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,320
That's right, it's the finale.

489
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,400
Finale.

490
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,160
Wasn't chosen.

491
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,320
I'm feeling a bit down.

492
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,240
Right?

493
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,440
It's a bit harsh.

494
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,520
Yeah.

495
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,040
So romantic.

496
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,000
So sweet.

497
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,720
Very romantic.

498
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,360
Let them keep jumping.

499
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,080
Just let them keep jumping.

500
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,480
That's a sure thing.

501
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,880
This is way too flirty.

502
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,560
It's up to you.

503
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,600
What should we do?

504
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,200
How do you choose?

505
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,680
Can three people jump together?

506
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,120
Arm.

507
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,800
Hold with your arm.

508
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,840
Squatted down.

509
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:08,960
Nice.

510
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,240
Such good teamwork.

511
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,080
Sports pro.

512
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,920
She wants to try with you.

513
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,320
Alright.

514
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,520
Their clothes look alike.

515
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,040
Gray and blue.

516
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,120
What?

517
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,800
Don't ask, it's obvious.

518
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:08,960
Clearly with...

519
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,480
Obvious.

520
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,840
Clearly with Jin Yuxing.

521
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,160
Yeah, great jump.

522
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,520
This...

523
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,960
Already won.

524
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,760
Guaranteed win.

525
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,640
So impressive.

526
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,760
Pro team.

527
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,080
You need to pause in the air.

528
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,160
That's your issue.

529
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,960
Yeah, you landed.

530
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,560
Shouldn't he have feet?

531
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,320
True.

532
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,560
Why are you holding them when they're swinging the rope?

533
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,200
They're swinging the rope, why are you holding?

534
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,320
What are you holding?

535
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,600
Why do you have to touch their hand?

536
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,240
Congratulations

537
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,720
Awesome

538
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,480
Did you see how they jumped so high?

539
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,240
Seriously, they were flying when they jumped

540
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,720
So professional

541
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:30,760
You need to cushion it a bit

542
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,520
Great jump

543
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:31,960
Great jump

544
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,360
I had no idea

545
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,320
How can those two jump so fast?

546
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:35,760
Did you know?

547
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,840
They’re even faster than one person jumping

548
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,880
And they’re tying their shoelaces too

549
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,960
Feels kind of insulting

550
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,280
Insulting you

551
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,760
So insulting

552
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,040
It’s fine

553
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,360
It’s normal to stumble sometimes

554
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,160
Really

555
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,120
I’m telling you, the atmosphere here is explosive

556
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,040
What about Xu Rulan?

557
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,640
Jump twice

558
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,160
One person jumps twice

559
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:42,720
Right

560
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,640
The smile won’t fade

561
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,320
It just moves on, right?

562
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,920
Two minutes

563
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,160
I thought it was so awesome then

564
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,880
Don’t be too good at it

565
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,040
Wait, why jump twice?

566
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,960
Because they’ve already won overall

567
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,720
They’ve already won overall

568
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,120
Just two points left

569
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:28,880
Just two points left

570
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,440
You’re pretty romantic too

571
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,320
Win-win

572
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,200
Win-win

573
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,520
Win-win

574
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,280
Let’s get together for a meal next time

575
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,600
Not eating

576
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,240
Not eating

577
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,320
What are you doing?

578
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,120
I’m not the one choosing, right?

579
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,920
You’re choosing

580
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,040
You choose, hurry up

581
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,960
Yeah, you choose, quick

582
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,760
Did you guys have it too back then?

583
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,360
No.

584
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,480
We only had one room.

585
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,040
There were just six of us.

586
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,120
We had no rooms to switch.

587
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,160
We already had nowhere else

588
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,400
to swap.

589
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,200
This episode is really exciting.

590
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:03,840
So exciting.

591
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,920
It's pretty interesting.

592
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,600
We still need to move around.

593
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,240
Let's get active.

594
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,320
How about we get moving too?

595
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,760
Let's exercise.

596
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,040
Okay.

597
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,120
The game we're playing today

598
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,880
is called "Love Knock Knock."

599
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,520
Rules for "Love Knock Knock":

600
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,520
Each team sends one player.

601
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,800
Stand on opposite sides of the board.

602
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,920
Put on blindfolds for a 1v1 match.

603
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,000
After the start signal,

604
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,560
Spin three times, then you can start.

605
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,200
Hit the opponent.

606
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,480
Whoever hits the most wins.

607
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:25,960
The losing side

608
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,560
switches to another player.

609
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,280
Rotate in order.

610
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,400
Until a winning team is decided.

611
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,840
Each round is limited to two minutes.

612
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,240
We can't lose this, right?

613
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,560
Liu Zihan's hip and waist

614
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,600
I heard they're injured, right?

615
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,200
Yes.

616
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,440
Me too.

617
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,480
Only my hip is injured.

618
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,640
How about you three play?

619
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:41,760
Me too.

620
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,200
Or just give me the prize.

621
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,720
So this time I'll represent Liu Zihan

622
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,480
and join our

623
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,440
Season 8 team.

624
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,640
That's right, I've "switched sides."

625
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,880
Liu Zihan will be

626
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,960
the host for the match.

627
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,360
Okay.

628
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,440
I'll be the host and referee.

629
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,760
If I call you brother, will you answer?

630
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,280
Sure.

631
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,840
Everyone, put on your blindfolds.

632
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,440
Put it on and spin, right?

633
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,240
One spin.

634
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,920
Two spins, three spins.

635
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,560
Okay.

636
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,480
Alright, stop.

637
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,600
Wait a second.

638
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,200
Move a bit more to the left.

639
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,200
You, yes.

640
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,120
Step a little forward.

641
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:24,400
Me.

642
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:24,880
Just a little.

643
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,240
Me.

644
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:25,840
Okay.

645
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:27,600
Hit.

646
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,640
Hit forward.

647
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,200
Forward.

648
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,800
Stop hitting, guys.

649
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,400
Did you hit?

650
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:00,960
Yes, I did.

651
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,960
I don't even know if I hit a person

652
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,720
or the board.

653
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,880
How many?

654
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,440
Eight zero one.

655
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:08,880
Eight zero two.

656
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,880
Then we have one more.

657
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:10,440
Did we win?

658
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,240
You won, you won.

659
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:11,600
We won.

660
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,200
You're impressive.

661
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,280
Sorry, bro.

662
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,320
You're awesome.

663
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,720
I want to play again.

664
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,160
Did it already go like this?

665
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,560
Three, two, one.

666
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,760
One spin, two spins, three spins.

667
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,360
Don't stop.

668
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,240
No, that's cheating.

669
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,040
No.

670
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,120
No hitting while crouching.

671
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,040
That doesn't count.

672
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,840
Where am I?

673
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,600
Ten seconds countdown.

674
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,760
Attack, aim down.

675
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,280
Let's end this round.

676
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,080
Xue Zheyang really won this one.

677
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,760
His strategy was really...

678
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,840
Hit once and leave.

679
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,000
We're on the last one.

680
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,720
Final round.

681
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,160
Go for it!

682
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,080
You got this!

683
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,600
Okay, three, two, one, go!

684
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,640
Get closer, Brother Chen.

685
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,640
Chinese kung fu!

686
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,320
Knocked down!

687
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,920
Five.

688
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,120
Four.

689
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:57,800
Three.

690
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,920
Two.

691
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,520
One.

692
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:02,800
So tired.

693
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,080
Alright.

694
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,400
Evenly matched.

695
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,600
Wang Lechen definitely had the edge.

696
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,160
Congrats to Wang Lechen and Sun Xing.

697
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,840
Congratulations to the Season 8 team.

698
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,120
For winning the "Unlimited Potential but Take a Break Cup."

699
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,800
We are the champions!

700
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,440
My tears...

701
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,720
Congrats to the Season 8 team for winning

702
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,360
the "Brother Barbecue Voucher."

703
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,920
The sizzling skewers are ready.

704
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:30,760
Come and unlock

705
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,240
this epic late-night feast!

706
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,280
We can all go together later.

707
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:35,880
That's great!

708
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,960
Awesome!

709
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,360
You even have pets this year.

710
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,600
This apartment feels more and more like home.

711
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,360
Yeah.

712
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,080
That's really the meaning of Heart Signal Apartment.

713
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,120
Bringing everyone together.

714
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:48,800
Yes.

715
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,760
It's truly wonderful.

716
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:50,440
Yes.

717
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,920
Honestly, I'd love to experience it again.

718
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,520
But there's only this one chance.

719
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,600
So we have to make the most of it.

720
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,840
Fate is truly amazing.

721
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,120
Yeah.

722
00:34:59,120 --> 00:34:59,520
Yes.

723
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,640
How about we all

724
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,840
take a group photo together?

725
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,120
Then let's happily go for barbecue!

726
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:04,520
Okay.

727
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,160
Let's go.

728
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:05,560
Let's go.

729
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,640
Alright, let's go.

730
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,480
Stand on the right.

731
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,440
Watching Heart Signal with you, the excitement never ends.

732
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,280
See you next time.
