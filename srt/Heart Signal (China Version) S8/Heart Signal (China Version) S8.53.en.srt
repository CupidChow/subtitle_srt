1
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,240
I made these.

2
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,280
This cheat sheet is pretty good.

3
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,840
I feel uneasy without a cheat sheet.

4
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:57,800
Thank you.

5
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,720
The mystery person is...

6
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,240
The mystery person is me.

7
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,320
It's me.

8
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,840
So mysterious.

9
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,080
I almost guessed it.

10
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,520
He really pulled it off.

11
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,000
When you're making a wish,

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,120
you can come to me too.

13
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,920
You really know how to make things special.

14
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,640
You've got some real skills.

15
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,600
We opened Ruilong's room.

16
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,960
He left a letter for everyone.

17
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,320
No way.

18
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,520
Surprise!

19
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,360
I'm playing hide and seek, no one can find me.

20
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,120
Hello.

21
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,080
Wang Jue.

22
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,920
I chose to leave the house.

23
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,240
I really admire your courage.

24
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,640
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,120
I let you down.

26
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,480
Fate plays tricks.

27
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,160
She chose to open his box today.

28
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,280
He chose to say goodbye to everyone today.

29
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,720
I still feel

30
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,640
Did I put pressure on him?

31
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,120
No.

32
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,880
No.

33
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,880
Get to know each other in a different setting.

34
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,960
Yeah.

35
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,080
I think it's pretty good.

36
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,800
Please pat my hand.

37
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,280
Duoduo.

38
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,440
Friendship between girls.

39
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,920
Where to? Let's take a walk.

40
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,080
Let's go.

41
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,560
Go on a trip.

42
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,360
Go somewhere it doesn't rain.

43
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,960
I want to go somewhere without rain.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,840
Light up the signal!

45
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,000
Isn't this a success?

46
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,240
Super beautiful.

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,200
What did you say?

48
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,360
I said,

49
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,560
The fireworks are beautiful.

50
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,040
Yes, they're beautiful.

51
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,760
So romantic.

52
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,080
Here we go.

53
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,240
We're back again.

54
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,920

Welcome, everyone.

96
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,840
It's another week, friends.

97
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,120
Last week was especially

98
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,600
It really kept us on edge.

99
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,320
For example,

100
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,280
Ruilong left.

101
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,200
And Wang Jue.

102
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,840
There's a bit of sadness.

103
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,640
But also,

104
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,720
for their future lives,

105
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,640
we're full of hope.

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,520
Yes.

107
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,120
And also,

108
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,040
Zihan's

109
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:04,960
park time.

110
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,640
Park time.

111
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,160
It was a big success.

112
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,440
Very layered.

113
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:08,800
Yes.

114
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,760
And you know what,

115
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,560
there's another thing.

116
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,600
It's Lechen and Xiaoyuan's

117
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,480
mutual light up the signal.

118
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:15,960
Yes.

119
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,080
Also very layered.

120
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,200
I agree with you.

121
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,800
It's this kind of casual

122
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,600
and also intentional sense of ritual.

123
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,840
That's another layer, for sure.

124
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,720
Super romantic.

125
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,520
Impulsive romance.

126
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,480
It feels so nice.

127
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,120
So cool.

128
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,520
It's for our Lechen and Xiaoyuan's

129
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,440
trial love trip.

130
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,920
They're heading to beautiful Xinjiang.

131
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,480
Magnificent Xinjiang.

132
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,800
Welcome them to Xinjiang.

133
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,400
Alright, next

134
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,200
let's all

135
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,240
watch them

136
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,360
enjoy their wonderful trip.

137
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,480
Look at that smile.

138
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,000
Calm down a bit.

139
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,600
What's going on? It's too exciting!

140
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,520
It's really exciting.

141
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,240
Tomorrow we're heading to Xinjiang.

142
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,480
Who would have thought?

143
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,800
Did you expect me?

144
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,760
Would I go and press it?

145
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,280
I didn't expect it.

146
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,400
Totally unexpected.

147
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,640
I really thought you just wanted to take me for a walk.

148
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,080
I went out in flat shoes.

149
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,040
I'm speechless.

150
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,200
You could've at least told me.

151
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,240
I did it on purpose.

152
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,040
Expressing it openly.

153
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,080
I did it on purpose.

154
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:24,880
Laughing again.

155
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,840
What's so funny about that?

156
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,760
I'm here.

157
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,320
Exhaling.

158
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,560
We're here.

159
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,560
Good job.

160
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,440
Let's go.

161
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,120
Go.

162
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,800
We're off.

163
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,600
This is truly a spontaneous trip.

164
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,120
See, this is

165
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,000
the feeling of excitement.

166
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,360
Now I finally know what airport sprinting means.

167
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,880
I think both of them are really excited.

168
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,000
But right now they're

169
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,160
trying to hold back their excitement.

170
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,560
But they're not hiding it very well.

171
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,760
It's written all over their faces.

172
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,160
So happy.

173
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,600
Turns out these colors match well.

174
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,600
What colors?

175
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,440
Their clothes.

176
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,720
They're wearing couple outfits.

177
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,880
This is really

178
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,480
thoughtful.

179
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,280
Would you believe me if I said it's a coincidence?

180
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,760
What do you think?

181
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,440
I think it was intentional.

182
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,160
That's definitely a deliberate choice.

183
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,680
Yeah.

184
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,520
We just happened to dress like this.

185
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,880
Yeah.

186
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,520
Yeah.

187
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,720
Everything is the best arrangement.

188
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:28,920
Well said.

189
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,480
Hello everyone.

190
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,760
In transit.

191
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,440
Vlog.

192
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,000
Hey everyone,

193
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,240
Hey everyone, we're in Xinjiang now.

194
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,320
We're in Xinjiang.

195
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,360
We're in Xinjiang.

196
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,280
We need to do a bit more.

197
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:44,760
Yeah.

198
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,040
Do you know how to have fun?

199
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,280
Are you filming?

200
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,400
It's eight o'clock at night.

201
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,480
It's still bright outside.

202
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,560
What do you want to eat later?

203
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,200
I'm not hungry.

204
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,440
How come you're not hungry again?

205
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,080
I'm not hungry, I ate too much at lunch.

206
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,920
It was really delicious.

207
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,800
I'll take you to eat later.

208
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,720
What?

209
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,720
Baked buns.

210
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,480
Not just baked buns.

211
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,800
Some Xinjiang specialties.

212
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,320
Okay.

213
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,600
I really like the vibe between them right now.

214
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,280
I really like how they

215
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,920
can record their own moments.

216
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,200
They'll have lots of memories in the future.

217
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,480
You know this is called "boyfriend’s perspective."

218
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,280
His camera angle is like

219
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,400
how a boyfriend would film.

220
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,120
That's why it's called "boyfriend’s perspective."

221
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,800
It looks extra intimate.

222
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,520
It feels very natural and real.

223
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,440
Yeah.

224
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,240
Big Plate Chicken.

225
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,640
My favorite.

226
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,480
It looks so tasty.

227
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,920
No worries, I'll invite you all to my wedding.

228
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,920
What am I even saying?

229
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,840
What are you talking about?

230
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,720
Do you need

231
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,680
a host for your wedding?

232
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,360
I do.

233
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,760
I need you to be my emcee.

234
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,680
Can't catch me on camera.

235
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,200
I'm too tall, sorry.

236
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,640
I want to eat some vegetables.

237
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:01,960
This one.

238
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,280
Fruit-flavored mixed salad.

239
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,680
Sounds good.

240
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,720
This is grape.

241
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,400
Big plate chicken.

242
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
Yogurt rice dumpling.

243
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,600
Why so stunned?

244
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,400
I want to try it.

245
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,600
Just looking at it makes me hungry.

246
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,680
So delicious.

247
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,960
It's so tasty, great choice.

248
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,240
Weren't you not hungry?

249
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,200
You've been praising it for ages.

250
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:32,800
Not eating, not eating.

251
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,360
They're so sweet together.

252
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,720
Whenever those two are together,

253
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,200
it feels like they're soaked in love.

254
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,680
Yeah.

255
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,840
Didn't get it on camera yet.

256
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,280
Didn't record it.

257
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:50,800
Do it again.

258
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,800
Yuanyuan's current vibe.

259
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,200
Even I think it's so cute.

260
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,480
Girls in love just shine.

261
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,920
Don't be "socially anxious".

262
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,520
"Social anxiety".

263
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,400
They're holding hands.

264
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,560
They're starting to get physical.

265
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,840
She's holding onto him.

266
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,200
They're dancing.

267
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:22,760
Here they come.

268
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,320
Lechen is actually bold for love.

269
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,440
Hurry, run!

270
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,880
Don't be shy.

271
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,840
I dance and still have to pay the bill.

272
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,440
Let's go.

273
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,760
Can you move your eyebrows?

274
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,320
Can you move just one side?

275
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,480
Can you move your ears?

276
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,640
Impressive.

277
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,000
Ear-moving magic.

278
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,520
You can't do it?

279
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,840
I can only move my eyebrows.

280
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,200
How do you move your eyebrows?

281
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,440
What are you doing?

282
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,480
You're rolling your eyes.

283
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,560
What's there to show off?

284
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,160
I'm not showing off, I'm asking you.

285
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,920
Can you move just one side?

286
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,560
Just one side.

287
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,280
You can do it too.

288
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,760
Alright.

289
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,240
You think this is

290
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,080
some unique "magic" only you have?

291
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,200
Nope.

292
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:21,800
It's wonderful.

293
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,560
Seeing this really makes me want to go.

294
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,400
Xinjiang welcomes everyone.

295
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,360
Really, you're all very welcome.

296
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,080
It's so warm and friendly.

297
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,160
You can eat well and have fun.

298
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,640
Once you're here,

299
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,080
we're already looking forward to it.

300
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,840
And what I especially love is

301
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,520
the way they're filming this time.

302
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,840
Yeah, me too.

303
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,920
It's so authentic.

304
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,920
It feels so alive.

305
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,040
There's a lot of depth.

306
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,520
Yeah.

307
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,240
You really feel how natural they are.

308
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:02,640
And then,

309
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,080
you know they're going out to see the world.

310
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,640
That feeling.

311
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,120
Yeah.

312
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,680
It's amazing.

313
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,000
Yeah.

314
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:06,640
And look,

315
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,640
we get to witness

316
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,400
their trial love trip.

317
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,600
Those two have always been

318
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:10,840
really into each other.

319
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,400
They're both interested.

320
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,520
And I think the scenery is beautiful, and so are the people.

321
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:13,960
I feel like it will

322
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,800
add a special touch.

323
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,720
And it'll be an unforgettable experience.

324
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,520
Yeah.

325
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,840
Alright, just now

326
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,440
we saw

327
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,960
our trial love trip

328
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,200
already has a bit of

329
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:22,760
a beginning.

330
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,520
So next,

331
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,200
let's see what everyone in the house

332
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,280
is up to.

333
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,280
Sit with me for a bit.

334
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:30,920
Okay.

335
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,200
I think the trial love trip

336
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,040
you won't know unless you try.

337
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,040
If I had the chance,

338
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,760
I wouldn't hesitate.

339
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,480
I'd just go for it.

340
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,920
You're really brave.

341
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,480
So there are only a few days left.

342
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,320
Within a week,

343
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,320
it'll be over.

344
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,560
I'm really looking forward to it now.

345
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,640
Will any of the guys be

346
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,240
motivated by this?

347
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,320
I think so.

348
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,600
Be a bit bolder.

349
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,840
Our Signal Apartment

350
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,680
is about to have its final long-distance date.

351
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,840
It's the last time.

352
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,120
There will be two one-on-one pairs

353
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,440
and one two-on-two group.

354
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,840
After all the girls discuss together,

355
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,240
they choose their preferred date group.

356
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,440
The guys will, based on the girls' choices,

357
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,360
discuss together

358
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,800
and make their final date selection.

359
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,320
I don't get the rules.

360
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,200
The rule is

361
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,800
girls choose first, then guys.

362
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,960
What does this rule mean?

363
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,840
Let me take a look.

364
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,840
Actually, if you look,

365
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,000
Duoduo is really relaxed now.

366
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,440
Yeah.

367
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,160
Duoduo.

368
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,000
What should I do?

369
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:03,920
Go choose quickly.

370
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,560
See what you think.

371
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,080
Talk it over before deciding.

372
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,800
How do you even choose?

373
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,720
It's so hard.

374
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,080
Or maybe Duoduo, what do you want?

375
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,000
Would you want a one-on-one?

376
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,320
I probably wouldn't choose a one-on-one.

377
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:25,880
I don't think I want that.

378
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,800
Mainly, I prefer

379
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,960
to make more memories and take more photos.

380
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,200
Got it.

381
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,600
Understood.

382
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:31,840
Okay.

383
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,280
Duoduo will probably go for the two-on-two.

384
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,080
Then I'll go with you.

385
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,320
I'll join you then.

386
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:35,600
Alright.

387
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,440
Are you okay with that?

388
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,840
I kind of want the two-on-two too.

389
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,880
If she wants two-on-two, it means

390
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,120
Zihan's park time worked.

391
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,560
What are you thinking?

392
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,840
You want two-on-two?

393
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,560
But honestly, I also want a one-on-one.

394
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:58,960
What should I do?

395
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,480
But it's basically the same.

396
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,000
It's just that

397
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,000
we'll do two-on-two.

398
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,200
So, four people together.

399
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,920
Let's do that then.

400
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,560
Okay.

401
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,240
I'm definitely choosing this.

402
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,560
Two-on-two.

403
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,240
I've made up my mind.

404
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,560
What did she choose?

405
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,680
Yifan said she

406
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,520
would try without hesitation.

407
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:36,720
She'd give it a shot without hesitation.

408
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,360
Chichi also wants an answer.

409
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,520
So that means

410
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,240
only one guy can go with her.

411
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:49,960
On this date.

412
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,320
For this date.

413
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:50,960
Right.

414
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,680
Okay, I get it.

415
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,160
Lanlan, Duoduo.

416
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,040
Then Xiaojiao and Dr. Fang.

417
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,800
Most likely.

418
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,040
But I really want to hang out with you too.

419
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:02,720
Duoduo.

420
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,640
Everyone wants to hang out with me.

421
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,240
Do what you want.

422
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,600
You're amazing.

423
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,040
Everyone's great.

424
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,640
Don't regret coming to the house.

425
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,520
There aren't many days left.

426
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,160
Right?

427
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,200
Yeah.

428
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,480
Make sure you have no regrets.

429
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,600
I'll really miss you.

430
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,120
No,

431
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,440
if you guys really want to hang out with me,

432
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,080
I'll invite you.

433
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,440
Let's go.

434
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,960
Actually, just now

435
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,440
I didn't get the rules at first.

436
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,120
But I figured it out.

437
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,640
I just realized

438
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,000
when it turned into a group of four,

439
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,960
I felt a bit shaken.

440
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,760
You kind of wanted to be with me.

441
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,160
Because I think

442
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,840
if it were

443
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,040
you there,

444
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,760
maybe something else would happen.

445
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,200
I could directly

446
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,120
talk to you about it.

447
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,680
Yeah.

448
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,120
Just like Duoduo said,

449
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,120
I think no matter what,

450
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,200
everyone should make more memories.

451
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,520
But maybe that firework

452
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,920
was inspired by Yuaner's courage.

453
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,440
So I feel like maybe

454
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,520
what I'd already suppressed

455
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,600
those calm feelings

456
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,760
suddenly resurfaced a little.

457
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,560
Like fireworks bursting.

458
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,440
They were lit up again.

459
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,280
And then I felt

460
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,080
I think life in the house is just like this.

461
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,160
It's about not leaving regrets for yourself.

462
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,680
Yes, I want to fight for my own happiness.

463
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,280
To make brave decisions.

464
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,280
Actually, I really like that saying.

465
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,680
The brave enjoy the world first.

466
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,000
Go and enjoy it.

467
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,160
Just enjoy it.

468
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,120
We won't see each other for a few days.

469
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,040
We'll be back soon.

470
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,480
I think those fireworks

471
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,760
brought something to each of them.

472
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,280
It lit up something in their hearts.

473
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,720
A bit more courage, one way or another.

474
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,160
It sparked the impulse in their hearts.

475
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,000
Yeah.

476
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,800
So Yifan chose a one-on-one date.

477
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,560
She was inspired by that.

478
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,680
She wants to take one last chance.

479
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,000
That tiny possibility.

480
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,520
Just so she won't have regrets.

481
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,040
Right.

482
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,760
No matter if there's a chance or not.

483
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,920
I think it's great.

484
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,560
Very brave.

485
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,680
Honestly, what I was thinking inside

486
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,160
was a one-on-one date.

487
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,000
But do you think

488
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,200
But I feel like I

489
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,080
maybe need a two-on-two date.

490
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:38,640
But...

491
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,360
Thinking again,

492
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,840
I still want a one-on-one.

493
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,480
Who exactly is her "one"?

494
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,120
I think your choice of one-on-one

495
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,560
I totally support it.

496
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,760
But I don't know if I can do it well.

497
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,000
What are you worried about?

498
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,000
You both bravely

499
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,800
chose one-on-one dates.

500
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,240
That means

501
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,400
our attitude is clear.

502
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,400
See?

503
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,520
I think that's really brave.

504
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,480
And I think

505
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,560
you can know in advance

506
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,280
what each other wants,

507
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,840
at this stage.

508
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:11,960
The answer.

509
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,240
Don't worry.

510
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,240
We'll have the result soon.

511
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,000
So now the biggest suspense is Chichi.

512
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,040
Next, let's see

513
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,280
who Chichi really wants

514
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,080
to choose.

515
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,040
Will that person also

516
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,640
choose Chichi directly?

517
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,200
Yes.

518
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,680
If it's still two guys

519
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,160
who both choose her for a one-on-one,

520
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,760
then what happens?

521
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,640
Then it depends on which guy

522
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,440
firmly puts his photo

523
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,120
next to hers.

524
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:39,760
And if

525
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,360
Yuxing and Zihan are both determined?

526
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,480
Then it's a showdown.

527
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,480
That would be exciting.

528
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,560
So thrilling.

529
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,920
Now, us girls

530
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,560
have already made

531
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,560
our choices.

532
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,080
Let's see what the guys

533
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,800
will choose.

534
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:55,840
Let's go.

535
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,280
I guess in the end

536
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,880
Zihan will be with Chichi.

537
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,360
Or maybe Yuxing and Chichi.

538
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,400
Yuxing, be bold for once.

539
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,960
Be a little braver.

540
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,400
Group discussions are really interesting.

541
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,680
It's time for our weekly deduction again.

542
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,280
This round is a team challenge.

543
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,600
We need to guess all the guys'

544
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,920
long-distance date

545
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,800
groupings.

546
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,640
If we guess correctly,

547
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,720
everyone

548
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,880
can get a Heartstone.

549
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,760
Let's look at the guys' side.

550
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:47,920
First,

551
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,480
let's solve the easy ones.

552
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,720
That's Lanlan's group, right?

553
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,680
That's the easiest.

554
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,680
Jiao

555
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,360
Dr. Fang

556
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:54,880
Let's do it now.

557
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,600
Let's analyze these two.

558
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:57,680
One is Zihan,

559
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,600
the other is Yuxing.

560
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,280
What should we do?

561
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,280
I think Yuxing

562
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,160
if he feels some pressure,

563
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,000
can only adjust himself.

564
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,720
Because at this moment,

565
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,000
I think Zihan will definitely take the lead.

566
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,560
For such an important trip,

567
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,920
he must have his own rhythm.

568
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,520
But do you think he'll let Yuxing decide?

569
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,080
If Yuxing is really determined,

570
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,960
then it's a real competition.

571
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,920
But I think it's likely

572
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,440
one of them

573
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,320
will step back.

574
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,360
Maybe worried about Yifan

575
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,480
being alone.

576
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,520
Since we can't figure it out,

577
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,600
let's use reverse reasoning.

578
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,160
I really can't imagine

579
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,760
just can't picture

580
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,120
Zihan and Yifan traveling together.

581
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,720
That possibility.

582
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,760
Those two

583
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,880
haven't interacted at all.

584
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,640
So Zihan must be

585
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,240
paired with Chichi.

586
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,040
And Yuxing goes with Yifan.

587
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,080
That's how it is.

588
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,000
That's how it is.

589
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,480
That's how it is.

590
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,080
Right.

591
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,840
But Yuxing and Yifan

592
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,480
don't really

593
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,720
have much chemistry either.

594
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,320
But I think Yifan choosing one-on-one

595
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,920
is actually showing Yuxing

596
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,800
her feelings.

597
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,280
Yeah.

598
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,520
I think at this point, Chichi

599
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,040
is telling Yuxing

600
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,920
"I want to see your attitude this time."

601
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,760
Right.

602
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,000
You.

603
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,640
Still you.

604
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,920
It's up to you two

605
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,680
and your determination about this.

606
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:02,720
Your determination about this.

607
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,240
Yeah.

608
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:03,880
Alright, everyone,

609
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,200
we've finished analyzing.

610
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,080
Let's make a decision.

611
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,760
We're ready.

612
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,000
Raise your hand if you think it's Zihan.

613
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,160
Raise your hand if you think it's Yuxing.

614
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,120
The two of us.

615
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,200
Jasmine blooms, that's the signal of love.

616
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,120
Next, we enter

617
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,960
Master Kong Jasmine Tea's Heartbeat Moment.

618
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,120
Everyone's here.

619
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,800
Here they come.

620
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,520
Still need to discuss.

621
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,480
Alright, let's all discuss.

622
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,520
Come on, let's talk it over.

623
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,080
How will they discuss it?

624
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,600
Dr. Fang and I probably don't need to discuss.

625
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,520
How about the two of us go first?

626
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,120
Let's make our choice first.

627
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,680
Let's stick it on first.

628
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,280
What about these two?

629
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,080
They're acting so fast.

630
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,640
No idea who Yuxing will choose.

631
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,200
Tao, we're the minority.

632
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,400
Really.

633
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,560
Yuxing is fine.

634
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,600
Okay.

635
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,800
I saw the look in Yuxing's eyes.

636
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,120
He seemed determined.

637
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,360
It's different from before.

638
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,920
Yeah, he did great this time. He went for it.

639
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:01,880
Nice.

640
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,360
Yuxing made it this far.

641
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,640
I think that's really good.

642
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,800
He was brave this time.

643
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,560
Let's see what he says.

644
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,280
What do you mean?

645
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,840
I'm so nervous.

646
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,000
Let's see how it goes.

647
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,200
It's getting tense.

648
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,040
It's a showdown.

649
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,000
So exciting.

650
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,080
Zihan can do it.

651
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,200
Well...

652
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,720
Is this okay?

653
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,400
Let's see who ends up together.

654
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,760
So dramatic.

655
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,880
It's pretty explosive.

656
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,760
Impressive.

657
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,960
Yeah.

658
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,280
Even though I think Zihan is great,

659
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,520
I think it'll be Yuxing.

660
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,960
First of all, I definitely won't be paired with Yifan.

661
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,600
All along,

662
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,520
I never said

663
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,400
I was sending her any signals.

664
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,280
That's for sure.

665
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,480
I think what Zihan said

666
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,760
for Yuxing's personality,

667
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,520
is a game-changer.

668
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,440
Yeah, he'll take that into account.

669
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,440
Right.

670
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,360
Zihan said it well.

671
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,760
Then you should've gone first.

672
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,600
Picked it up before me.

673
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,720
Put it up first.

674
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,040
That way, I would have...

675
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,760
Because I saw you hesitating.

676
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,440
So I thought,

677
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,200
then I'll just...

678
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,800
It's fine, you can still change it now.

679
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,800
It's okay, you can still change it.

680
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,240
Zihan is very firm.

681
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,200
He won't change his mind.

682
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,880
But I think I've already

683
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,680
made my choice first.

684
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,320
Yeah.

685
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,960
I don't think it matters who chose first.

686
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,000
It doesn't make much difference.

687
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,720
Honestly,

688
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,840
the current rule is

689
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,600
for everyone to discuss

690
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,760
and then put it up.

691
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,560
Zihan is also trying.

692
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,640
But I don't think you can say

693
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,480
just because I've interacted with Yifan more

694
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,880
or know her better,

695
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,520
it's just...

696
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,200
Because I've talked to her,

697
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,360
actually, with her,

698
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,240
it's more like we're just friends.

699
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,400
Yuxing has changed.

700
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,040
Let's look at it from another angle.

701
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,960
Do you think Yifan is

702
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,720
a determined person?

703
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,400
I think Yifan

704
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,640
is actually pretty determined.

705
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,360
Should we give her

706
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,320
a chance?

707
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,280
But...

708
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,720
It feels like a battle now.

709
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,960
But for me,

710
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,080
it's not really fair.

711
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:06,560
I think

712
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,720
Yeah.

713
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,640
I think

714
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,520
I wouldn't send signals to someone I'm not interested in.

715
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,800
I wouldn't give any signals.

716
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,640
I'm about to scream.

717
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,880
That determination

718
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,640
is good for everyone, I think.

719
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,240
So much pressure.

720
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,160
What should I do?

721
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,080
But I think you two

722
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,800
are definitely like me

723
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,200
in this way.

724
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,360
Zihan keeps looking for new angles.

725
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,520
Suddenly got called out.

726
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,640
I feel like Dr. Fang and I probably

727
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:55,800
just

728
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:56,480
yeah

729
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,440
Dr. Fang and Xiao Jiao acted as me

730
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,760
The two of us have already talked it through

731
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,640
Because neither of us would choose

732
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,120
the other two for a one-on-one

733
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,040
right

734
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,760
So you two are pretty firm in your choices

735
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:06,520
right?

736
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:06,920
yeah

737
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,360
Yuxing is just being himself

738
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,160
He’s made up his mind

739
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,520
But I don’t think that’s enough

740
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,360
to convince me to change my choice

741
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,280
yeah

742
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,320
At the dinner that first night

743
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,280
you weren’t there

744
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,040
Chichi arrived last

745
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,400
Actually, the seat she chose

746
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,000
was her own decision

747
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,320
I got a message

748
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,200
telling me to find

749
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,120
a seat with an empty spot next to it

750
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,680
because the newcomer

751
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,840
might want to sit next to me

752
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,520
But if we go by who arrived first

753
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,640
I think for me

754
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,520
it’s kind of unfair

755
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,360
So I feel like all this

756
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,240
doesn’t really have much

757
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,800
persuasive power

758
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,760
Teacher Jiao quietly started to drift away

759
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,200
He left

760
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,520
That’s so funny

761
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,680
Xiao Jiao and Xiao Fang

762
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,080
seem so harmonious together

763
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,160
This windmill

764
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,960
stopped spinning on the first day

765
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,000
and hasn’t spun since

766
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,120
It looks so nice when it spins

767
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,800
These two are already admiring the view

768
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,840
It’s unusually harmonious

769
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,360
Yeah

770
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,120
I can totally empathize with them

771
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,840
But we can’t really help

772
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,360
Actually, I was just thinking

773
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,240
like if

774
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,360
if it were the two of us

775
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,000
if

776
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,320
suppose

777
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:05,880
the way to decide

778
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,320
Right now

779
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:06,760
Yeah, I was thinking too

780
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,080
I thought of some ways to decide

781
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:08,520
I’m thinking about it too

782
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,480
I’m just wondering

783
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,440
whether it’s rock-paper-scissors or

784
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,720
I think we still need to

785
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,200
yeah

786
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,480
do something challenging

787
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,280
Those two are so happy right now

788
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,560
They’re laughing so happily

789
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:20,640
Honestly, I think

790
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,680
personally, I think this point is about you

791
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,200
because

792
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,320
you and

793
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,880
Yifan have interacted a lot

794
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,560
so you can help her resolve her issues

795
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,640
But the purpose of this date

796
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,000
isn’t to resolve

797
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,760
a friend’s issues

798
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,400
It’s useless for the rest of us to talk about it

799
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,160
But for me, it’s just

800
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,080
a matter of gain and loss

801
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,240
But in the current situation

802
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,880
I think you can use this opportunity

803
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,040
to do something

804
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,960
Actually, I’ve talked with her

805
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,360
about this in detail

806
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,360
I think only the person involved can solve it

807
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,560
You just let us go

808
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,640
Actually, anyone who goes

809
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,400
can’t really do anything

810
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,280
to solve this problem

811
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:01,920
right?

812
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,280
I think

813
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,400
you can't convince the other person.

814
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,360
The decision she has to make in the end

815
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,920
is also hard to accept, right?

816
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,000
That’s actually

817
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,320
against her true feelings.

818
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,000
He can't persuade Yifan

819
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,320
to give up choosing him.

820
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,760
That won’t work.

821
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,400
If he tries to explain things to Yifan this time,

822
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,400
then Chichi will be even more

823
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,080
If he does that now,

824
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:31,640
darn it.

825
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,840
Then Yuxing falls into the self-justification trap.

826
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,400
Yuxing keeps explaining to Zihan,

827
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,080
trying to stand firm.

828
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,840
If it’s not based on the order,

829
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,200
then I think everyone should

830
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,160
discuss this again.

831
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,400
The order of choosing dates.

832
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,720
Let’s call them over.

833
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,440
Zhiheng.

834
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,400
Dr. Fang.

835
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,760
I think we still need to

836
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,280
talk it over again.

837
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,000
I just

838
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,160
discussed with Herry (Zihan).

839
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,800
It’s really just about

840
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,120
the order of choosing dates.

841
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,480
That’s the issue.

842
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,560
I think we need to

843
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,400
come up with a new

844
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,600
order for picking dates.

845
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,800
The order.

846
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,240
This is really a tough problem.

847
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,880
What Yuxing wants to say

848
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,480
is actually meant for Zihan.

849
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,520
But I have a point of disagreement.

850
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,440
Everything I’m saying now

851
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,880
I think Dr. Fang would agree with.

852
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,360
It’s just that

853
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,240
the disagreement between you two is actually about

854
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,840
the two girls on the left.

855
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,360
And there’s no disagreement

856
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,280
on the two-on-two side.

857
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,240
Right.

858
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,040
This is just

859
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,480
a small premise under the bigger premise.

860
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,520
Because the main premise is

861
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,480
everyone is

862
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,080
unhappy with the order of posting profile pictures.

863
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,000
not satisfied.

864
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,480
Right?

865
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:05,720
Yeah.

866
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,680
That’s how I see it.

867
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,120
There are still people who disagree.

868
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,400
Your whole main premise,

869
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,880
is the order of choosing really important?

870
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,040
Yuxing got serious.

871
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,960
He said, “Is the order

872
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,960
really important or not?”

873
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,440
Right.

874
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,960
He’s really firm this time.

875
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,440
Is the order of choosing really important?

876
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:22,840
Is the order

877
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,800
something everyone agreed on at first?

878
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,240
Yeah.

879
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,720
I think making your feelings clear

880
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,560
is also important.

881
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,440
I’ll go get chairs for everyone.

882
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,240
He probably can’t carry them alone.

883
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,880
He probably can’t carry them alone.

884
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,520
Here.

885
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,320
Two can sit here.

886
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,160
It’s fine, we’re just

887
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,120
taking our time to discuss, no rush.

888
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,840
First, I think I should ask everyone.

889
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,160
Is the order of choosing important?

890
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,440
Good.

891
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,640
This is the most important point.

892
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,840
It's also the core issue.

893
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,320
This argument is solid.

894
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:29,800
Yes.

895
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,040
I think it's about sticking to it.

896
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:36,920
At times like this, there's no need for

897
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,800
worrying about dignity.

898
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,440
And you can't let

899
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,840
For the two of us,

900
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,840
theoretically, it's not important.

901
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,920
So, is the order of choosing important?

902
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,280
My only question is, is it important?

903
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,320
If the girl you like is in a one-on-one,

904
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,240
I'm asking if it's important.

905
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,400
Just answer "important" or "not important."

906
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,480
There needs to be a premise.

907
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,800
Premise? I don't have a premise.

908
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,600
Just, is it important?

909
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,200
This debate is

910
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,240
also for the outcome of this choice.

911
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,600
We've thought of many solutions.

912
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,400
Then ask Dr. Fang how he'd answer this.

913
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:03,960
That's tough.

914
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:08,800
I think it's like this.

915
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,600
It's because

916
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,400
every premise based on choice

917
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,200
is that we need to discuss together

918
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,160
and come up with a fair rule.

919
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,360
to follow.

920
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:17,480
Right?

921
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,640
Yes. Does everyone agree?

922
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,080
That's what Herry said.

923
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:19,680
About this.

924
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,720
It's tense again.

925
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,120
I think staying silent won't solve anything.

926
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,480
I asked Herry,

927
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,040
one question.

928
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,760
See if it's what you wanted to ask.

929
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,360
Is it possible you'd choose two-on-two?

930
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:02,760
No.

931
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,840
I've already said,

932
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,880
I think I've made it very clear.

933
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,400
As long as it's not the second group (one-on-one),

934
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,320
I definitely won't choose it.

935
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,280
Okay.

936
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,720
Then I think if

937
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,360
Herry is this determined,

938
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,840
it might be hard for the two of us.

939
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,520
Then I should

940
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:25,960
act.

941
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,720
I don't think I can make any concessions.

942
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,360
Right.

943
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,280
They have a strong camaraderie today.

944
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,160
Neither wants to lose

945
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,960
the last chance to date Lanlan.

946
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:37,920
I don't know.

947
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,920
I don't know about Yifan and Chichi.

948
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,640
But the two of us

949
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,440
are choosing for love.

950
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,360
What did Yifan decide?

951
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,600
I think everyone should

952
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,880
already know in their hearts.

953
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,120
The starting point of love you just mentioned,

954
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,880
I think it's totally

955
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,480
not convincing.

956
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,960
So if what you have is love,

957
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,120
then what about me and Herry (Zihan)?

958
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,720
What is that?

959
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,080
You two are also in love.

960
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,440
That's good then.

961
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,480
Well, there's nothing we can do.

962
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,160
I mean,

963
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,920
I just think there's no way to

964
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,160
make a compromise or anything.

965
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,600
No one wants to compromise when it comes to love.

966
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,920
It's raining now.

967
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,040
Darn it.

968
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,120
We're stuck again.

969
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,080
Are we going to be stuck like this until morning?

970
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,120
We've been struggling with this for ages.

971
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,200
My suggestion is,

972
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,240
I hope we follow the girls' wishes.

973
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,240
to make this decision.

974
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,400
Go with what the girls want.

975
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,360
Darn it.

976
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,000
He can't be about to...

977
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,600
Darn it.

978
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,280
Yuxing, don't give in.

979
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,200
At this point,

980
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,640
just stick to your own choice.

981
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,280
If you like someone, you like them.

982
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,920
Don't do it, Yuxing.

983
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,400
Please don't.

984
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,760
Don't.

985
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,320
He even moved his card up.

986
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,680
This is so hard.

987
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,600
I was only thinking from my own perspective just now.

988
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,640
But I think

989
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,320
sometimes

990
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,320
people shouldn't just think from their own point of view.

991
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,560
Yuxing is a really kind person.

992
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,960
He tends to be soft-hearted.

993
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,520
Yeah.

994
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,480
That's how soft-hearted people are.

995
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,840
Even if they're uncomfortable, they still...

996
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:42,840
Sometimes

997
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,840
people shouldn't just think about themselves.

998
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,120
But honestly,

999
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:02,880
I actually

1000
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,960
I clearly told her (Wang Yifan)

1001
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,840
that up to now, I still feel

1002
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,720
just like friends with her.

1003
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,000
It's just that I don't want

1004
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,040
to cause her any trouble.

1005
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,440
I just don't want

1006
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,320
because I feel that

1007
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:21,920
making this choice

1008
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,520
is also pretty

1009
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,160
hard for me.

1010
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:29,840
I'm just

1011
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,040
worried that my decision

1012
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,440
will bring Yifan even more trouble.

1013
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:36,800
That's all.

1014
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,520
I'm afraid she'll misunderstand.

1015
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,000
I think that's it.

1016
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,520
Such a pity.

1017
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:01,640
Let's go.

1018
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,000
Let's talk inside, it's raining outside.

1019
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:31,600
I feel really sad.

1020
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,920
I wish he wasn't so kind.

1021
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,960
I even wish he could

1022
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:34,480
sometimes

1023
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,080
be a bit more selfish.

1024
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:35,640
or a little more assertive.

1025
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,680
People who try to consider everyone

1026
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,200
often end up taking on more and suffering more.

1027
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:39,960
Yeah.

1028
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,480
Even if they're unhappy, they still make these choices.

1029
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,840
Just to keep things dignified for everyone.

1030
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:45,760
Anyway,

1031
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,920
in the end, Yuxing

1032
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,200
was convinced by Zihan.

1033
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,320
But actually, he should have

1034
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,640
stood his ground and said

1035
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,040
I just don't want her to misunderstand.

1036
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,720
So I definitely can't choose.

1037
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,800
In this kind of competitive environment,

1038
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,880
it's just like life.

1039
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,280
Competition is always harsh.

1040
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,960
Yuxing actually said it twice.

1041
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,360
I told her we're not possible.

1042
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,520
I told her we're not possible.

1043
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,080
He said it twice.

1044
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,280
But no one responded.

1045
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,840
He tried to get the other two on his side.

1046
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,200
He failed.

1047
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,480
He failed again.

1048
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,360
But for him,

1049
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,520
it's already a big step forward.

1050
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,120
I think what he did

1051
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,360
is the bravest thing

1052
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,720
he's done in all these days.

1053
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,440
Some people need room to grow.

1054
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,720
And for the first time,

1055
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:20,960
he said it in front of everyone.

1056
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,120
I've made it very clear

1057
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,160
to Yifan about this.

1058
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:24,840
Yeah.

1059
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,720
This time, he really made

1060
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,960
a huge change and progress.

1061
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:31,600
Why does Zihan make everyone

1062
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,200
feel there's nothing to discuss?

1063
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,680
His attitude is almost absolute.

1064
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,280
He won't even look at you. It's impossible.

1065
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,120
Yeah.

1066
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,000
But what about Yuxing?

1067
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,440
Then what should I do?

1068
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:39,680
Yeah.

1069
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,480
But I don't want to.

1070
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:40,960
I really want to.

1071
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:41,840
You know,

1072
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,800
in real life,

1073
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,920
during negotiations, you feel

1074
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,120
he has room to maneuver.

1075
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,840
I might still have a chance to break through.

1076
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:47,960
So the nature of competition

1077
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:48,920
is that it's harsh.

1078
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,080
It's about whether you

1079
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:50,840
pull the drawer back,

1080
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,320
and refuse to push it in no matter what.

1081
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,920
Yeah, that's true.

1082
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,880
That's really one of Yuxing's traits.

1083
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:57,480
Yeah.

1084
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,000
He tends to

1085
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,880
think more about others.

1086
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,560
His future partner

1087
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,280
might need to be someone

1088
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,680
who understands this about him.

1089
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:05,080
Yes.

1090
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,320
Sometimes, they even need to

1091
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:09,080
accept this trait in him.

1092
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,960
That's also a lesson Yuxing needs to learn in life.

1093
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:12,800
Yeah.

1094
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,640
He'll learn that in the future, for some things,

1095
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,760
when he needs to be firm,

1096
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,440
he can choose

1097
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,040
to be more decisive

1098
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,400
and stand by his own choices.

1099
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,360
Or something else.

1100
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:24,600
But

1101
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,280
I think, actually, for Zihan

1102
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,120
he's not wrong either.

1103
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:29,760
I see Yuxing is a bit

1104
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,920
like my former self.

1105
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,480
Zihan sees who he is now.

1106
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,920
I think in the past, I might have thought

1107
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,640
I wanted everyone to be happier.

1108
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,960
I put everyone before myself.

1109
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,400
But later, I realized

1110
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,840
whether it's fate

1111
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:44,720
or opportunity,

1112
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,040
because of this,

1113
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,000
it's not just about relationships.

1114
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:47,920
Maybe in life too,

1115
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,920
we all experience things like this.

1116
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,360
I end up losing a lot.

1117
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,400
From Zihan's perspective,

1118
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,560
he really seized this chance.

1119
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,160
He finally got to date the one he likes.

1120
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,240
the opportunity for a date.

1121
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,240
So in relationships,

1122
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,680
fighting for what you want is an advantage.

1123
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,160
It's also a skill.

1124
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:04,800
Right now, we don't know

1125
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,320
what Chichi thinks about this

1126
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,360
what her opinion really is.

1127
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,200
Because she doesn't know

1128
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,520
so much has happened.

1129
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,040
Yeah.

1130
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,040
But her first choice

1131
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:11,560
who is it, really?

1132
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,720
She hasn't said.

1133
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:13,440
We don't know either.

1134
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,600
Actually, I think Chichi

1135
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,120
has someone in mind.

1136
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,120
Otherwise, she wouldn't choose a one-on-one.

1137
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,440
She's just waiting to see who it is.

1138
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,200
Next,

1139
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,160
they're about to start

1140
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,720
their first day of the trial love trip.

1141
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:24,200
Let's all

1142
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,160
experience it together.

1143
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:25,960
Come on.

1144
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,000
Chichi, your hair always looks

1145
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:31,840
so good.

1146
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,360
Because after I wash my hair,

1147
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,440
I always use Pantene rose oil.

1148
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,480
It's very lightweight.

1149
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,320
You should try it.

1150
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,440
It gets absorbed instantly.

1151
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,800
And after blow-drying,

1152
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,080
it's smooth for days.

1153
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,280
Aren't we leaving for the trip tomorrow?

1154
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,080
Going on a trip?

1155
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,600
We should take good care of our hair today.

1156
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:50,360
True.

1157
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,480
Your hair now is really

1158
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,960
smooth and shiny.

1159
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,120
And the rose scent

1160
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,360
smells amazing.

1161
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,760
I need to get a bottle too.

1162
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,840
Everyone looks so beautiful.

1163
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:29,080
Xiao Jiao

1164
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:32,880
Why aren't you using an umbrella?

1165
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,360
It wasn't raining just now.

1166
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,080
Why is it still raining over here?

1167
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:41,800
I'm so happy.

1168
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:44,600
Have you been waiting long?

1169
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:45,880
It's okay.

1170
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:46,640
About ten minutes.

1171
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,520
That's quite a while.

1172
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,400
Do you know where we're going now?

1173
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:57,600
Where we go doesn't matter.

1174
00:48:58,680 --> 00:48:59,760
Who you go with is more important.

1175
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,320
It's about who you go with.

1176
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:04,440
Right.

1177
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:08,600
Duoduo,

1178
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,800
told me this morning

1179
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:10,680
she'd be a bit late.

1180
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,000
She has something to do.

1181
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:12,720
Work-related.

1182
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:13,680
Okay.

1183
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,280
Dr. Fang is here.

1184
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:39,840
Give it to me.

1185
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:40,400
Thanks.

1186
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:01,360
These two.

1187
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:06,400
Let's go.

1188
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:08,360
Let's go.

1189
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:10,760
How should we sit?

1190
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,080
Let Lanlan sit in the front.

1191
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:14,400
Okay.

1192
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,120
He thinks the front seat is more comfortable.

1193
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,440
My bro Jiao is really

1194
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,920
generous.

1195
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,320
Have you ever been to Nanxun?

1196
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,280
No.

1197
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:33,760
I have.

1198
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:34,800
Me too.

1199
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,800
Didn't you say last time you wanted to visit an ancient town?

1200
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:45,120
Nanxun.

1201
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,320
Just passed through briefly.

1202
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,600
Didn't explore the whole place.

1203
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,760
Is it big?

1204
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,920
It doesn't seem as big as Wuzhen.

1205
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:51,840
But it's still pretty big.

1206
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,320
Nanxun is actually nice on rainy days.

1207
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:57,120
It really feels like Jiangnan.

1208
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:58,320
Yeah.

1209
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:58,360
Right.

1210
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,800
Did you eat breakfast?

1211
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,320
This morning?

1212
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,200
No, I had lunch instead.

1213
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,760
So lunch counts as your breakfast.

1214
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:09,720
Of course.

1215
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:10,560
I ate.

1216
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,480
Lanlan usually has these everyday conversations.

1217
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,120
Mostly with Dr. Fang.

1218
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,280
Xiao Jiao wonders what he should say.

1219
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,080
Duoduo told you.

1220
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,080
Why couldn't she come today?

1221
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:24,920
She has work.

1222
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:25,840
She said she needs to

1223
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,720
go back to Hangzhou.

1224
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:28,600
She wouldn't lie to us.

1225
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,440
And then she didn't come.

1226
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:30,600
No way.

1227
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,320
I asked her.

1228
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,600
She said she'd come.

1229
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,280
She'll definitely come.

1230
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,280
Okay.

1231
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,120
I'm sleepy.

1232
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,800
This move is a bit abstract.

1233
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,000
Should've brought some ginseng.

1234
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:47,760
You could have some.

1235
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,680
So you'd be more alert driving.

1236
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,160
I'm worried I'll actually sleep tonight.

1237
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,120
Yeah.

1238
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,760
Let's go, time to get out.

1239
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:21,280
It's beautiful here.

1240
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,400
There are boats over there.

1241
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,120
We can go boating.

1242
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:28,120
Sure.

1243
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:29,480
Let's go.

1244
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:29,800
Come on.

1245
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:32,480
How many people?

1246
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:33,360
Three.

1247
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:54,520
There are fish.

1248
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,200
A few.

1249
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,080
The grayish ones.

1250
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:04,240
What's that floating in the water?

1251
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,440
The green stuff.

1252
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:09,480
The ones below or on top?

1253
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,000
Below.

1254
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:11,040
Below.

1255
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:17,880
Aquatic plants.

1256
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,720
Plants in the water are called aquatic plants.

1257
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,080
I think it's called Spirogyra.

1258
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,760
Oh, you were searching.

1259
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,440
I thought you were taking pictures of the scenery.

1260
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:34,960
Spirogyra.

1261
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:43,760
You can sit in the front.

1262
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,040
Sit here.

1263
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:46,680
I'll take a few photos for you.

1264
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:47,480
Okay.

1265
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,080
Turn around.

1266
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,480
That color just now

1267
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:07,760
was amazing.

1268
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,160
Why are you laughing again?

1269
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,000
Didn't take it well.

1270
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
I didn't take it well.

1271
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,080
Wait, let me switch to portrait mode.

1272
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,880
We can eat here later.

1273
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:44,960
Looks like there's a lot to eat.

1274
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,560
Let's try a bit of everything.

1275
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,600
Xiao Jiao's feelings are pretty obvious.

1276
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,400
But I think Lanlan noticed.

1277
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,800
Definitely.

1278
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,560
It's tough like this.

1279
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,720
Whether it's love or friendship.

1280
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,080
Because for Xiao Jiao,

1281
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:06,400
he really likes Lanlan.

1282
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,560
He really likes Lanlan.

1283
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,560
But he doesn't want to

1284
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,240
step into her space.

1285
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,280
So he can only use

1286
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,680
ways from the outside to handle it.

1287
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,280
What are you doing?

1288
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,880
I felt a bit of separation anxiety last night.

1289
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,600
The house is ending soon.

1290
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:52,200
Xiao Jiao has always

1291
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,160
put himself

1292
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,640
not in the primary position.

1293
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:55,200
He thinks

1294
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,280
Lanlan’s default priority

1295
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:56,880
is Dr. Fang.

1296
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:57,920
So he always gives way.

1297
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:58,960
But I think

1298
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,000
it’s not that he feels

1299
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,240
he’s not the priority by default.

1300
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:02,160
I feel he

1301
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,240
always wants to respect Lanlan

1302
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,640
and give her space.

1303
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:06,720
Yeah.

1304
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:06,760
Right.

1305
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:08,680
So I think sometimes

1306
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:09,760
you need to focus

1307
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:10,800
on yourself.

1308
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,200
Although I think Xiao Jiao is a great person,

1309
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,160
I don’t think it’s right to do this.

1310
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,360
In any relationship,

1311
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:15,120
you should focus on yourself.

1312
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,200
Just focus on yourself.

1313
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:16,920
I’m awesome.

1314
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:17,520
Support!

1315
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,400
We’re almost there.

1316
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:33,800
Without Duoduo,

1317
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:34,720
there’s really no one

1318
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:35,720
who can help him out.

1319
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:36,600
Yeah.

1320
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,160
Let’s get off the boat.

1321
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,040
Okay.

1322
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:43,560
Is your cup easy to carry?

1323
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,080
It’s fine.

1324
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:54,680
Let’s go, Jiao-ge.

1325
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,000
How about we go eat?

1326
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:57,520
Let’s head out first.

1327
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,080
Actually, if you think about it,

1328
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,560
Lanlan is pretty awkward right now too.

1329
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:15,840
It’s hard for her to handle this situation.

1330
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,480
Just waiting for Duoduo to come.

1331
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,120
Once Duoduo arrives,

1332
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:28,680
it’ll definitely get better.

1333
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,280
Before Duoduo comes,

1334
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,240
it’s really tough.

1335
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,040
Seriously.

1336
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:38,480
Lanlan.

1337
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,080
How about we go outside and chat for a bit?

1338
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:42,400
I’m fine with anything.

1339
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,360
He’s taking Lanlan out to talk.

1340
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,560
Let’s go out and talk for a while.

1341
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:52,160
Okay.

1342
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:06,320
Let me apologize first.

1343
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,760
Because just now

1344
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,040
I was a bit emotional.

1345
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,040
Part of it

1346
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,280
is also because

1347
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,640
these past two days

1348
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:15,840
I’ve been through some things.

1349
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:16,720
And then

1350
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,480
there’s probably some emotional

1351
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:21,160
buildup.

1352
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:22,520
It came out.

1353
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,560
And secondly,

1354
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:27,800
I might be a bit

1355
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:29,840
too sensitive.

1356
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,360
But maybe I myself

1357
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,480
Actually, you can talk about your sensitive side too.

1358
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,080
Because, how should I put it,

1359
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:41,560
since Ruilong left,

1360
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,960
and then Wang Jue left,

1361
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,680
I’ve been really sad too.

1362
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,120
I just want

1363
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:46,840
no matter what,

1364
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,440
everyone to enjoy the last few days.

1365
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,600
But I can imagine

1366
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:52,800
maybe for you,

1367
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:53,800
for Dr. Fang,

1368
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:54,520
for me,

1369
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:55,800
even for Duoduo,

1370
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:59,040
this group of four traveling together

1371
00:58:59,040 --> 00:58:59,920
I think there’s bound to be

1372
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,240
some awkwardness.

1373
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:02,040
I totally get it.

1374
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:06,520
Yeah, because so much has happened

1375
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:07,360
and people have left.

1376
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:08,160
No one feels good about it.

1377
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,040
Because I don't want you to be upset either.

1378
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,080
She cried.

1379
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,880
She actually feels bad inside too.

1380
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:21,880
Don't cry yet.

1381
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:23,760
And then I thought,

1382
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,840
It's best if everyone can just have fun together.

1383
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:29,160
No matter what, there aren't many days left.

1384
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:29,800
Right?

1385
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,920
Soon, we might all go our separate ways.

1386
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:37,000
Sometimes you think maybe we won't part.

1387
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,080
Or that we'll see each other again.

1388
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,480
But we might really separate.

1389
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,360
That makes me feel confused and sad.

1390
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:48,160
I know.

1391
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:48,840
I...

1392
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,880
First, I'm sorry, and then...

1393
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,360
I...

1394
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:54,080
I did get in the car.

1395
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:55,320
When I got in the car,

1396
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:56,440
The reason I chose to sleep

1397
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:57,320
was actually for two reasons.

1398
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:58,040
The first reason is,

1399
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,520
I was really worried about Duoduo.

1400
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:00,160
Even though I said

1401
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:01,240
I thought she would definitely come,

1402
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,480
but

1403
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,200
I was afraid she wouldn't show up.

1404
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:04,800
That's the first reason.

1405
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:05,920
And the second reason,

1406
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,200
In life, I might be

1407
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,120
someone who tends to be self-sacrificing.

1408
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:10,120
This was actually the first time

1409
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:11,040
I truly

1410
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,360
saw you interacting with Dr. Fang.

1411
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,640
So I chose to cover my eyes.

1412
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:18,440
At that moment,

1413
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:20,880
I wanted to use my hearing

1414
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:22,840
to sense what your dynamic was like.

1415
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:26,800
If I felt

1416
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:27,440
that during this process

1417
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:28,320
you were happy and joyful,

1418
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,200
then I...

1419
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,080
I might think

1420
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:32,160
it's better for me not to disturb you.

1421
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:35,880
Communication is really important.

1422
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,000
I'm also actually

1423
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,200
a very cautious person.

1424
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:40,760
So I...

1425
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,440
Today was actually the first time

1426
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,040
I've experienced something like this.

1427
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,080
Or maybe I know that in the future

1428
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:46,760
it might always be like this.

1429
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:48,200
So just now I was thinking,

1430
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:48,920
then I...

1431
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:51,360
My instinct after getting in the car

1432
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:52,400
was that I felt

1433
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,600
I wanted to observe first.

1434
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,680
To see what it was like.

1435
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:58,280
So now I understand.

1436
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:01,120
My actions in the car earlier

1437
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:03,320
really affected you

1438
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:04,200
so much.

1439
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:06,920
Yes, it's good to talk about it.

1440
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,960
I really understand what you're going through.

1441
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,360
Actually, I also

1442
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:16,440
feel troubled because you're troubled.

1443
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:17,560
It makes me feel uneasy too.

1444
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:18,640
Many times,

1445
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:19,760
but I don't want you to feel troubled.

1446
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,440
If my difficulty

1447
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:23,200
is making you uncomfortable,

1448
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,400
then I can let it go.

1449
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,040
No.

1450
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,960
I think you misunderstood me again.

1451
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:31,880
What I really hope for

1452
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:33,640
is more direct communication.

1453
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,760
So I think just now,

1454
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:37,360
after

1455
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:41,960
everyone calmly thinking and processing,

1456
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:42,800
plus just now,

1457
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,280
we talked through a lot of things.

1458
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,600
I feel much better now.

1459
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:46,960
Actually,

1460
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,600
I don't know if you

1461
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:49,560
feel the same way.

1462
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:51,160
I really feel much better.

1463
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,200
Yes.

1464
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:56,840
I totally agree.

1465
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:57,360
Now I...

1466
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:58,840
I feel very lucky now.

1467
01:01:58,840 --> 01:01:59,800
That we can clear up

1468
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,000
this misunderstanding.

1469
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:01,680
Is it resolved?

1470
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,200
Yes, it's resolved.

1471
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:06,680
I've truly let it go.

1472
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:07,920
Okay.

1473
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:19,120
It's still better to speak your mind.

1474
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:20,280
It's better to say what's in your heart.

1475
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
He didn't eat a single bite.

1476
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:31,880
He couldn't eat at all.

1477
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,000
Hello, Dr. Fang
