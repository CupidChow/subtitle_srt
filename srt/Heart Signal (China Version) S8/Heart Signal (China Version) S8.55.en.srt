1
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,240
Heartbeat Apartment

2
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,160
The final long-distance date is coming up.

3
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,040
This is the last time.

4
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,160
There will be two one-on-one pairs.

5
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,600
And one two-on-two group.

6
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,400
Let's see what everyone says.

7
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:00,920
Let's see what everyone says.

8
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,400
Tension in the air.

9
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:06,880
I have already

10
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,680
made my choice.

11
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,760
My suggestion is

12
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,840
I hope we follow the girls' wishes

13
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,080
to make this decision.

14
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,440
It's so hard.

15
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,440
One, two, three.

16
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,240
It seems like you both have lost weight.

17
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,320
That really hit home.

18
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,600
Well done, Duoduo.

19
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,440
Radiating with energy.

20
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,480
Like a little sun.

21
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,640
Come on.

22
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,880
You energized everyone.

23
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,560
We still prefer the evening vibe.

24
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,120
Touch the turtle's back for a long life.

25
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,480
Then I'll just keep my hand here.

26
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,960
Two hundred, three hundred, four hundred, five hundred.

27
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,040
Tortoise bath time.

28
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,560
This driver parked the car properly.

29
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,200
Don't drive recklessly.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,600
Like the day they bathed the dog.

31
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:01,960
Yeah.

32
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,880
Not bad.

33
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,280
I think I need to use some

34
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:08,920
eye drops.

35
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,760
I never thought using eye drops

36
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,920
would happen in a situation like this.

37
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,360
"Help!" TV drama.

38
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,160
This is

39
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,120
Do you believe

40
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,680
men and women can have pure friendship?

41
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,520
She's talking about those two.

42
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,240
I believe.

43
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,840
You believe?

44
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,400
I do.

45
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,880
Boundaries are important.

46
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:38,840
Right?

47
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:38,880
Right?

48
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,240
You're good at this.

49
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,320
Thanks.

50
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,280
They're so sweet.

51
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,600
Whenever those two are together,

52
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,880
it feels like they're soaked in love.

53
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,520
Lechen is so proactive, it's unbelievable.

54
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,360
What do you want to shout?

55
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,480
I want to shout.

56
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,000
Shout what?

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,080
Wang Lechen, jerk!

58
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,240
I'll go to that

59
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,960
pointy spot to shout.

60
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,360
Come on, you shout.

61
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,080
Shout towards the mountains, rivers, and lakes.

62
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,640
Shout one.

63
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,760
If you shout, I'll shout.

64
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,360
So what do you want to shout?

65
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,000
Whatever you shout, I'll shout.

66
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,840
You're so bored too.

67
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:04,760
Me.

68
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,120
I'm a copycat.

69
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,320
Or you could just yell "ah."

70
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,160
I'm really moved.

71
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm really moved.

72
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,680
Wang Lechen.

73
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,600
Jerk!

74
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm not a jerk.

75
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,080
I really like you.

76
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,160
I really like you.

77
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,280
Look how happy Xiao Yuan is.

78
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,880
I really like you.

79
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,080
Me too.

80
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,200
I really like you.

81
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,960
Me too.

82
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,760
I really didn't expect Lechen to become

83
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,960
so proactive after falling for someone.

84
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,920
So thoughtful.

85
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,360
Yeah.

86
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,520
So caring.

87
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,200
It's really worth every penny.

88
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,040
It really is.

89
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,280
What time is it now?

90
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,040
Nine forty-eight.

91
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,360
We're having dinner later and later.

92
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,600
It's ten o'clock and still bright outside.

93
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,600
Alright.

94
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,800
Eat with the sunset.

95
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,160
The timing is actually accurate.

96
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,280
Work at sunrise.

97
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,440
Rest at sunset.

98
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,400
So beautiful.

99
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,280
So sweet.

100
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,760
Let's go.

101
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,960
This looks great.

102
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,000
Take a photo, it looks nice like this.

103
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,120
Take away your candy.

104
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,280
Barbecue.

105
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,080
Bonfire dinner.

106
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,400
Having barbecue here is really

107
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,800
definitely delicious.

108
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,000
Feels a bit warmer now.

109
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,480
Better than this morning.

110
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,360
Are you cold?

111
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,760
A little.

112
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:49,720
A bit cold.

113
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,280
Wait a moment.

114
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,640
I'll get you a blanket.

115
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,920
Really taking care of Xiao Yuan.

116
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,720
Thank you.

117
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,800
Look at you.

118
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,120
You're wearing shorts and you're fine.

119
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,600
I'm not cold.

120
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,920
Who are you looking down on?

121
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,080
You're in great shape.

122
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,080
Stubborn.

123
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,680
Still stubborn.

124
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,800
Can we go warm up by the fire?

125
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,320
Let's go.

126
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:38,720
Is that okay?

127
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,640
Move the stools over.

128
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,640
I'll stand here and warm up.

129
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:48,840
It's wet.

130
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,440
Look.

131
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,240
They're holding hands.

132
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,800
It's getting more natural.

133
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,000
So warm.

134
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,160
Please sit.

135
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,560
So beautiful.

136
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,800
Have you ever made a fire like this before?

137
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,640
Yes.

138
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,360
Where?

139
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,880
In my grandma's yard.

140
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,240
Same at my grandma's place.

141
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,120
That kind of stove.

142
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,640
Yeah.

143
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,000
And then,

144
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,640
I used to make the fire myself.

145
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,480
Add wood by myself.

146
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,320
Right.

147
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,040
Can you add wood?

148
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,600
I can.

149
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,720
What's the trick to adding wood?

150
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,080
Leave space underneath.

151
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,760
We have things in common.

152
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,160
We're in sync.

153
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,280
You can tell they've done this before.

154
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,160
You have to stack it like a hashtag.

155
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:36,520
Yeah.

156
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,920
Or just pile it up.

157
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,200
Is this both fun and fitting?

158
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,160
Isn't this just...

159
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,000
Here comes the food.

160
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,480
Let's eat.

161
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,040
Move it back.

162
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,480
I'll do it.

163
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,240
Big plate chicken.

164
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,800
This is real big plate chicken.

165
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,240
Thank you.

166
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,320
Thanks.

167
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,560
What's this?

168
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,000
What is this?

169
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,960
Is this lamb or...

170
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,600
Is it lamb chops?

171
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,440
Lamb chops.

172
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:07,880
Smells so good.

173
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,440
I want to take a photo.

174
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,360
Camera eats first.

175
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,640
Just looking at it makes me hungry.

176
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,520
Delicious.

177
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,920
I'll learn to make this at home.

178
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,320
I'll cook this for you every day.

179
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,560
That's a bit much.

180
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:29,920
Here.

181
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,560
Thanks.

182
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,080
This piece is all meat.

183
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,640
Just bite into it.

184
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,960
This lamb really isn't gamey.

185
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:39,880
Right?

186
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:40,920
No weird taste at all.

187
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,640
So tasty.

188
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,360
Thank you.

189
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,760
Can I ask you something?

190
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,280
What?

191
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,280
Can I ask you a question?

192
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:57,760
Not listening.

193
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,560
Not listening.

194
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,200
Forget it then.

195
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,600
Go ahead.

196
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:01,720
Well...

197
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,280
When you were on the island,

198
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,520
how did you feel when you first saw me?

199
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,880
You were in my peripheral vision.

200
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,160
You were in my peripheral vision.

201
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,400
In the fish tank.

202
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,600
In my peripheral vision.

203
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:24,840
And then what happened?

204
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,520
My main impression was on the second day.

205
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,160
The second day.

206
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,280
Mainly,

207
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,000
Afterwards, you

208
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,760
Didn't we go to watch the sunset?

209
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,840
Didn't we go to watch the sunset?

210
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,360
There wasn't much chance to talk.

211
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,560
Right?

212
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,360
No.

213
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,840
We talked on the second day.

214
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,320
On the second day.

215
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,160
That was

216
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,760
That was because someone wasn't there.

217
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
That pack of cold medicine you gave me

218
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,800
is still in my suitcase.

219
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,280
Really?

220
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,680
Showing signs of jealousy.

221
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,360
She was going to give it to Yu Xing.

222
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,440
Cold medicine, guys.

223
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,280
You haven't finished answering.

224
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:02,840
First impression.

225
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,640
You were eating.

226
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,640
But I remember

227
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,600
I vaguely remember something that stood out.

228
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,920
I talked about a lot of topics.

229
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,880
Actually, you and I

230
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,520
have a lot in common.

231
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,320
What about you?

232
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,120
Me?

233
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,120
I didn't really have a first impression of you.

234
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,320
Because you were just in my peripheral vision.

235
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,680
I couldn't see what you looked like.

236
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,960
I didn't know what kind of person you were.

237
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:38,680
All I could see

238
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,920
was your hand picking at the cup.

239
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,760
And you didn't talk much.

240
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,880
If you had talked a bit more,

241
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,640
during that sunset time,

242
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,400
I would have chosen you.

243
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,240
If you had talked a bit more,

244
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,000
during that sunset time,

245
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,760
I would have chosen you.

246
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,360
Good thing I didn't go.

247
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,240
Otherwise, I wouldn't have gotten the cold medicine.

248
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,600
What if the cold medicine

249
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,680
was given to you the next day?

250
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,600
No way.

251
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,400
I'm tough.

252
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,120
Just like my mouth.

253
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,320
Stubborn.

254
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,000
So, you

255
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:16,920
The first time

256
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,480
you felt

257
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,600
my feelings for you, when was it?

258
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,640
It was when you gave me the school badge.

259
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,040
Peking University badge.

260
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,240
Really.

261
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:43,960
You put so much thought into it.

262
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,600
Of course.

263
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,720
At that time, I even

264
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,960
worried that you

265
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,280
might feel pressured.

266
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,520
So I kept hesitating whether to give it to you.

267
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,360
I remember

268
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,160
when I saw it,

269
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,000
So,

270
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,040
when your words are heard,

271
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,800
it feels really good.

272
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,360
In the cabin,

273
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,760
was there anything you regret?

274
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,000
Just didn't

275
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,800
do something.

276
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,200
Something you regret not doing.

277
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,080
If I hadn't pressed for mutual selection,

278
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,480
for this,

279
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,160
I might have regretted it.

280
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,760
If I hadn't pressed for mutual selection,

281
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,160
for this,

282
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,920
I might have regretted it.

283
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,200
I have something I regret.

284
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,080
I have something I regret.

285
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,240
What is it?

286
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,680
Guess what it is.

287
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,040
Give me a hint.

288
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,360
Give me a hint.

289
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,400
I didn't ride your

290
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,440
I didn't choose your little train.

291
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,560
And the park, right?

292
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,080
It's either the park or the little train.

293
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,680
Just the little train.

294
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,160
But you guys took a plane.

295
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,280
Yeah, who needs the little train now?

296
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,520
Who needs the little train?

297
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,880
You're already flying in the sky.

298
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,000
Plane, self-driving.

299
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,640
And a little motorcycle.

300
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,400
It's either the park or the little train.

301
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,000
Just the little train.

302
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,200
Smart.

303
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,200
Go back and ride it.

304
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,320
Go back and ride it.

305
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,560
You really want to ride the little train.

306
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,440
Because I want you to choose me.

307
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,920
It's not about riding the little train.

308
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,120
I've already ridden the little train.

309
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,760
I want to be chosen firmly.

310
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,200
What's wrong?

311
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,120
Wasn't it me who chose to come for trial dating?

312
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,120
Wasn't it me who chose to come for trial dating?

313
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,280
See?

314
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,960
But you said it way too casually.

315
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,520
Exactly.

316
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,800
Just said it directly.

317
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,600
Go travel.

318
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,360
I'm wearing flats.

319
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,640
That's my second regret.

320
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,640
I didn't wear high heels.

321
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,520
It's like that feeling when being proposed to.

322
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,000
Looking beautiful.

323
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,080
Yeah.

324
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,320
That's the feeling.

325
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,200
If I hadn't acted impulsively,

326
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,680
I'd still be too shy

327
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,680
to do this.

328
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,040
What's there to be shy about?

329
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,760
I don't know, maybe...

330
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,040
Can't really say.

331
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,120
We're just too shy

332
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,640
to express our true feelings.

333
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,520
Especially when you told me

334
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,880
about your coming-of-age ceremony,

335
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,240
why your dad didn't come.

336
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,720
I really felt the same at that moment.

337
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,520
You had a similar experience?

338
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,720
I didn't have a coming-of-age ceremony.

339
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,720
I didn't have a graduation ceremony either.

340
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,880
I just empathize.

341
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,440
As a male,

342
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,840
at that moment,

343
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,640
but I also understand my dad.

344
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,760
How did you make up later?

345
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,080
We just talked it out naturally.

346
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,640
Did you really open up?

347
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,320
Halfway.

348
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,800
I just thought

349
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,640
I won't feel as sad as before.

350
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,120
You're really not suited to be a hedgehog.

351
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,920
You're better as

352
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,400
a geoduck.

353
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:20,880
Half-open.

354
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,400
Half-open.

355
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,200
What's wrong?

356
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,760
This feels so good.

357
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,160
Only the two of us get this treatment in the whole house.

358
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,240
Thank you.

359
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:33,920
Thank you.

360
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,440
You're welcome, it's what I should do.

361
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,680
Thank you for not rejecting me.

362
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,680
Thank you for not rejecting me.

363
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,720
How could I refuse?

364
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,400
I've waited so long, okay?

365
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,960
After Lechen fell for someone, he really has that

366
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,480
loyal puppy vibe.

367
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,960
Let's go back.

368
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:54,720
Okay.

369
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,000
Do you know where we're going tomorrow?

370
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,120
Make a wish.

371
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,800
Go to the grasslands.

372
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,560
I want to go to the grasslands.

373
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,880
You want to ride a horse.

374
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,280
You want to film a transition.

375
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,680
I'm so bummed I didn't get to film a transition today.

376
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,320
Sure.

377
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,560
This is just too sweet.

378
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,640
Watching this, my mouth

379
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,080
never stopped smiling.

380
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:11,800
I'll take a sip.

381
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,160
Master Kong Jasmine Honey Tea.

382
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,400
To cheer them on.

383
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,560
Come on, cheers everyone!

384
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,480
Such a refreshing jasmine scent

385
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,760
Just like the two of them

386
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,200
Sweet and romantic atmosphere

387
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,080
It's the same

388
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,080
"Mo Mo loves you"

389
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,200
This means truly loving you

390
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:28,920
Yeah

391
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,360
It's so sweet

392
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,080
When I watched earlier, I said

393
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,280
It was all cheers

394
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,800
Later on

395
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,840
Come on

396
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,720
Just drown me in sweetness

397
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,120
How many more surprises can they pull off

398
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:40,680
Right?

399
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,280
But he really is

400
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,400
Look at his moves

401
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,120
They're also gradual

402
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,560
So when they talked about

403
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,600
Their first meeting

404
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,840
Their impressions of each other

405
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,920
Now they're in the trial dating

406
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,560
Stage

407
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,200
When they

408
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,920
Held hands for a photo

409
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,000
That moment of holding hands

410
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,800
It just made it even more

411
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,040
Sweet and heart-fluttering

412
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,960
Feeling between them

413
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,280
Everyone probably

414
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,240
Wants to know

415
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:00,920
What the other thought at their first meeting

416
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,720
What was your impression of me

417
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,240
Just want to ask him

418
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,040
Did you feel anything for me when we first met

419
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,720
Did your heart skip for me

420
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,560
Everyone wants to ask that

421
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,360
It's such a sweet question

422
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,680
And I kept thinking

423
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,560
This is the kind of love I want

424
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,240
In the end, they were the first

425
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,760
To become a successful mutual selection couple

426
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,240
It's fate for them

427
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,240
The moment she was about to give the medicine

428
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,960
The cold medicine went to Le Chen

429
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,400
Isn't that fate?

430
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,080
I think it must be fate

431
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,360
Fate is such a magical thing

432
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,360
When it comes, you can't stop it

433
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,320
Yes, that's right

434
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,040
That's wonderful

435
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,360
I think Le Chen

436
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,480
Now he really feels

437
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,960
Why didn't I commit to you earlier

438
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,120
Why didn't I let you feel it sooner

439
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,720
And now he really wants to give more

440
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,280
So that Lu Yuan can feel

441
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,520
His

442
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,840
Affection for her

443
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,680
So he keeps saying

444
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,320
Make a wish

445
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,280
I'll help you, and everything he can think of

446
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,920
He does for her

447
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,400
Let me be happy and confident

448
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,480
Love with all my heart

449
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,200
That feeling

450
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:56,880
Have you ever had

451
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,840
Something you said unintentionally

452
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,400
Words you said

453
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,160
That someone remembered

454
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,880
Moments like that?

455
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,200
I told him back then,

456
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,760
I said I get shy around crowds.

457
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,720
Then one time, he was

458
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,880
talking business with someone.

459
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,960
It was something serious.

460
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,680
He put his hand behind like this.

461
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,680
And I naturally went over

462
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,200
and held his hand.

463
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,160
At that moment, I felt

464
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:19,920
it was really romantic.

465
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,920
So romantic.

466
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,560
Yeah.

467
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,000
I think

468
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,800
that kind of romance is

469
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,680
when you're in front of a crowd,

470
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,640
but just the two of you

471
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,240
secretly,

472
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,120
Yeah.

473
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,200
just the two of you,

474
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,160
sharing a little secret.

475
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,680
That kind of little secret.

476
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,520
That's wonderful.

477
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,200
Our first day of the trip

478
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,000
is already over.

479
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,480
Next,

480
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,280
let's see

481
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,640
what stories will happen

482
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,160
on the second day.

483
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,600
The second day's journey.

484
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,680
So beautiful.

485
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,320
Hello.

486
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,160
Morning.

487
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:58,680
Looking good.

488
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,600
The sun is great today.

489
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,680
Wish it was this nice last night.

490
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,840
Last night.

491
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,240
Yeah.

492
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,040
Are you hungry?

493
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:07,680
Let's eat.

494
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,400
Want to eat?

495
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,840
I'm eating this breakfast with great ceremony.

496
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,000
Yeah.

497
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,640
I don't feel that formal.

498
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,640
I feel like an old man out for a morning walk.

499
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,720
But look at me.

500
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,440
The two of us.

501
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,840
I look like a gardener.

502
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,680
You look like the lady of the castle.

503
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,440
That's exaggerated.

504
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,760
Slept so long yesterday.

505
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,320
Should be energetic today.

506
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,640
Not bad.

507
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,440
Let me cheer myself up first.

508
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,080
I haven't cheered myself up today.

509
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,880
I forgot.

510
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,800
I'll cheer you up.

511
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,000
Three compliments for her.

512
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Yeah, three compliments.

513
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,520
So he's really healing her with his actions.

514
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,640
So sweet.

515
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,320
You really are

516
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,320
so touching.

517
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,280
Starting today,

518
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,960
Really?

519
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,160
You actually wrote three?

520
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,000
Look at his expression.

521
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,840
Look at Zi Han's face.

522
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,920
You keep your word.

523
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,640
Good thing it’s only three.

524
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,480
Glad you didn’t say ten.

525
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,440
Otherwise, we might not get out today.

526
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,240
I’ve been thinking.

527
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,880
Thank you.

528
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,000
I think everyone should

529
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,520
find more of their own strengths.

530
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,760
In psychology,

531
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,720
there’s something called writing therapy.

532
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,440
For people lacking confidence,

533
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,960
write one thing every day.

534
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,880
It boosts self-esteem.

535
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,160
A few confident words.

536
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,800
For yourself.

537
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,080
I’m good at this, I’m good at that.

538
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,120
I’ve always done this since college.

539
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:49,720
Really.

540
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:49,920
Yeah.

541
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,120
I always say it to myself in the mirror.

542
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,560
That’s great, since college

543
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,360
you started encouraging yourself.

544
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:54,480
Started encouraging yourself.

545
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,840
Yes, every day there

546
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,680
You’re the best.

547
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,840
You’re outstanding.

548
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:57,960
You’re outstanding.

549
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,960
That’s really good.

550
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,800
You’ll become more confident and healthy.

551
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,320
Your sense of worth will grow.

552
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,440
We all deserve it.

553
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,560
We all do, we deserve it.

554
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,160
We deserve everything.

555
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,080
All good things.

556
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:11,960
I think everyone should

557
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,160
find more of their own strengths.

558
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,600
Yeah.

559
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,280
Well said.

560
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,600
Are you feeling motivated today?

561
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,400
Yes.

562
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,880
Today will definitely be a great day.

563
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,280
Are you looking forward to it?

564
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,480
Super excited.

565
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,760
Why so quiet?

566
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,720
Where’s your confidence?

567
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,600
Can’t hear you.

568
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,320
Super excited!

569
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,360
Alright.

570
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:34,640
Let’s go.

571
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,000
Go.

572
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,480
Go.

573
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,120
Every time before going out, I recite

574
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,320
“ID, phone, keys, wallet.”

575
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,200
What does that mean?

576
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,800
ID card, phone, keys, wallet.

577
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,680
ID card, phone, keys, wallet.

578
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,600
He’s so thoughtful.

579
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,480
You’re dressed like this,

580
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,800
I don’t think we can drive today.

581
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,760
Yeah.

582
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,400
That’s a shame.

583
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,840
We’re off.

584
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,920
So beautiful.

585
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,080
That house is so nice.

586
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,520
Making pizza.

587
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,480
This really has

588
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,880
a forest cabin vibe.

589
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,480
I only know how to eat pizza.

590
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,320
Never made it.

591
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,160
Never made it.

592
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:38,720
But I believe

593
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,000
I can do a great job.

594
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:40,840
Come on.

595
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:41,920
Show us.

596
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,840
She’s already practicing self-affirmation.

597
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,120
Yeah, self-affirmation.

598
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,040
Your technique looks pretty skilled.

599
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:52,800
Really?

600
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,000
It’s stuck.

601
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:00,880
Is this

602
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,040
okay to flip directly?

603
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,200
Flip the world

604
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,800
Flip the world

605
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,760
So happy

606
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,840
Then just scoop it out like this

607
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,560
Then add the sauce

608
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,800
Add this

609
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,160
Add the sauce first?

610
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,720
Let me think

611
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,440
Add the sauce first

612
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,520
Check Xiaohongshu for tips

613
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:43,760
Go ahead and add it

614
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,080
Doesn't matter

615
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,520
We're using a lot of ingredients

616
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,320
Don't you like ketchup?

617
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,120
Add it all

618
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,200
Okay

619
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,080
Then add the meat

620
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,080
If it's not even, it bothers me

621
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,120
My OCD is kicking in

622
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,080
Looks good

623
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,800
So cute

624
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,640
Is that okay?

625
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,240
Tomato

626
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,480
You add it

627
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,400
Should we put the tomatoes on the outer edge?

628
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,000
Outer edge, like this

629
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:27,520
Okay

630
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,040
I can tell you have OCD

631
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,600
We just want it to look nice

632
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,520
I want to make a curled edge

633
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,200
Do you think it can curl?

634
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,640
Can it be rolled up?

635
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,400
Let's try

636
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,400
It works

637
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,240
Come on, roll it up

638
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,920
Why does yours look better rolled?

639
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,400
Mine is leaking filling

640
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,040
You do it

641
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,400
Maybe you have a talent for baking

642
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,960
Zi Han always praises Chi Chi whenever possible

643
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,480
Yeah

644
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,440
Is this the fourth compliment today?

645
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,200
Found another one

646
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,400
Save this for tomorrow's notes

647
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,600
So happy

648
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,520
They're really comfortable together

649
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,760
Our filling is really rich

650
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,080
Not bad

651
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,280
It really looks legit

652
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,200
Italian pie

653
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,400
The main thing is baking

654
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,840
Put it in the oven

655
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:31,920
That's good

656
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:34,560
Not bad

657
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,600
Very smooth

658
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,560
This is perfect

659
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,800
About ten minutes

660
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:39,800
Okay

661
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,520
Alright

662
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,440
Just bake it like this

663
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,640
I'm curious how it'll turn out

664
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:45,560
Here it comes

665
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,960
This really looks legit

666
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,720
Smells great

667
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,360
Let's eat

668
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,440
It should taste good

669
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,200
It should be delicious

670
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,000
It should be delicious

671
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,040
I think it's good

672
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,400
Watch your expression, whether it's good or not

673
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,800
Let's see what she says

674
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,840
Really?

675
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,080
Cheers

676
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,600
Cheers

677
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,920
I think

678
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,680
Not great

679
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,840
Just the right texture

680
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,800
I'm done eating

681
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,400
I'm a bit full

682
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,160
Doing silly things together

683
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,160
Then force ourselves to eat

684
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,040
But it's very sweet

685
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,040
Yeah

686
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,320
Let's take a walk

687
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:42,840
Let's take a walk

688
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,440
Sure

689
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,280
Want to take photos?

690
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,640
I'm not into photography

691
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,920
But I like being photographed

692
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,920
That's fine then

693
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,600
Like, even though you don't like cooking

694
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,680
You know how to taste

695
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,360
Little secret

696
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,880
Do you want to go up and see?

697
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,080
No

698
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:07,960
No secrets

699
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,840
Wait a second

700
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,960
Show your jawline

701
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,640
Let's change location

702
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,880
Such a perfect match.

703
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,240
Do you want to go up and explore?

704
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,680
I can.

705
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,160
Let's go.

706
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,560
Let's see what it is.

707
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,680
Wait a second.

708
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,680
Got an idea.

709
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,520
Got an idea.

710
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,080
Stand here.

711
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:42,960
I'll stand here.

712
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,000
You stand on the stairs.

713
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,720
Right here on the stairs.

714
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,960
Go up a bit, to the right.

715
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,120
Okay, that's great.

716
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,240
He knows how to take photos.

717
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,320
He's really good at framing shots.

718
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,480
He really does know how to take photos.

719
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,080
Liu Zihan is really good at photography.

720
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,320
Come on, I'll take you somewhere even prettier.

721
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,400
Check-in platform.

722
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,280
Have you decided on a pose?

723
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,920
I'm ready.

724
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:17,960
I really like this feeling.

725
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,360
There are tea farmers over there.

726
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,480
There's a reservoir over there.

727
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,240
Jump.

728
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,440
Do you want to shout?

729
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,000
No, I don't.

730
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,720
I'm still a bit self-conscious.

731
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,560
I'm still a bit self-conscious.

732
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,560
Let me take a photo for you.

733
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,440
Would it be better over here?

734
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,880
Got it.

735
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:40,680
This is nice.

736
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,120
You really know how to find good spots.

737
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,880
If I fall, remember to pull me up.

738
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,720
I definitely won't be able to pull you up.

739
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,720
Her smile is so sweet.

740
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,880
Very beautiful.

741
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,720
Nice, this one looks great.

742
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,200
Wipe the lens.

743
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:01,440
Wipe the lens.

744
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,440
You're really good at finding things.

745
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:14,880
Can't wipe it.

746
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,760
Feeling happy now.

747
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,920
This works.

748
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,520
It's good.

749
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,600
Pretty cool.

750
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:24,880
Let's sit here.

751
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,680
Sure.

752
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,200
So comfortable.

753
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,120
This is so relaxing.

754
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,400
That thing from the other day.

755
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,840
The card Wang Jue gave at the end.

756
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,600
The sentence you wrote on it.

757
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,440
Do you still remember it?

758
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,400
Mine said,

759
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,200
Let the wind carry everything.

760
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,200
Such a romantic line.

761
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,320
Actually, what I meant by this line

762
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,680
is that

763
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,520
if you have worries

764
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,560
or unhappy things

765
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,920
just let the wind carry them away.

766
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,320
Let them drift away with the wind.

767
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,400
That's what I thought too.

768
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,520
You thought the same?

769
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,480
Because not everything

770
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,840
needs to be solved.

771
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,200
Be.

772
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:22,680
Right.

773
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,760
Carried away.

774
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,040
Agreed.

775
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,280
A lot of things can

776
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,240
just disappear with the wind.

777
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,600
The wind is picking up.

778
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,640
So after forming a bond,

779
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,840
do you stop

780
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,640
doing whatever you want?

781
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,880
Or do you still

782
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,560
stay true to yourself?

783
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,520
That's a tough question.

784
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,760
I hope she can be like me,

785
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,760
both of us can be ourselves.

786
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,840
No need to change.

787
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,600
And we can both

788
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,440
find happiness that's greater together.

789
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,360
But that's rare.

790
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,160
Usually, one wants to go east,

791
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,040
the other wants to go west.

792
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,840
Like, you want to go to the snowy mountains,

793
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,920
but your partner wants to go to the grasslands.

794
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,560
Going to the grasslands is fine too.

795
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,120
I really can do that.

796
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,720
Even though I want to go to the snowy mountains,

797
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,880
I think what's more important is

798
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,760
being together.

799
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,400
But many people

800
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,720
solve this by saying,

801
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,520
"You go to the snowy mountains,

802
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,920
I'll go to the grasslands."

803
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,120
I want to be with her.

804
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,360
I think

805
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,360
first I need to show my attitude.

806
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,640
What attitude?

807
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,120
Accompany.

808
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,080
Accompany.

809
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,160
Accompany.

810
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,200
That's a model boyfriend.

811
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,400
Yeah, his answers are great.

812
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,000
If I want to go to the grasslands,

813
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,880
and my partner goes just to be with me,

814
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,520
forcing herself to join me,

815
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,800
I think it's better not to.

816
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,120
It causes some internal struggle.

817
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:19,840
I feel like she

818
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,280
doesn't.

819
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,600
Because in a relationship,

820
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,840
if one is really happy,

821
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,280
the other won't feel too bad.

822
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,120
Right?

823
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,000
But if one is really unhappy,

824
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,120
the other definitely won't be happy either.

825
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:33,640
That's true.

826
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,720
No one will be truly happy.

827
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,600
Yeah.

828
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,640
So I think

829
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,600
if one feels comfortable,

830
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,960
then both will feel comfortable.

831
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,880
Both will feel comfortable.

832
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,400
That line—

833
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,160
We don't need to

834
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,520
feel bad about decisions made for others.

835
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,680
Feel bad.

836
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,880
Zi Han put it really well.

837
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,360
So do you think

838
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,800
in a relationship,

839
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,440
one side will definitely not be themselves?

840
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,320
Is that what you mean?

841
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,440
It's a matter of quality.

842
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,120
Yeah.

843
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,640
Because you mentioned before

844
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,000
you think it's a kind of sacrifice.

845
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,200
I think "sacrifice" is a heavy word.

846
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,320
So I still feel

847
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,480
some pressure.

848
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,000
It's just—

849
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,160
Chi Chi is still stuck on the previous question.

850
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,360
No one should sacrifice.

851
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,200
Yeah, maybe "compromise" is a better word.

852
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,480
It's a bit better.

853
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,880
So when you face these

854
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,200
disagreements,

855
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,600
when opinions differ,

856
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,320
do you take the initiative to communicate?

857
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:49,920
Of course.

858
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,560
I think

859
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,280
I need to express what I think.

860
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,320
If you make others guess,

861
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,920
it's hard to solve the problem.

862
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,040
Would you keep it inside

863
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,200
and let others guess?

864
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,480
I used to.

865
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,880
Then I realized it's hard to solve.

866
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,760
So it's better to just say it.

867
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,760
Turns out it's easy to solve.

868
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,680
Everyone's happy.

869
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,480
Right?

870
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:06,960
Yeah.

871
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,240
That's great.

872
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,400
So you're also

873
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,720
someone who takes initiative to solve problems.

874
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,320
Because I think

875
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,240
everyone here is pretty reasonable.

876
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,720
Like, if you say you want Japanese food today,

877
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,880
and I say I want hotpot,

878
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,760
then we can

879
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,520
have a lively debate about it.

880
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,000
Like,

881
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,440
let's list the pros and cons

882
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,680
of eating Japanese food and hotpot.

883
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,640
Write them down for me.

884
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,880
Let's compare them.

885
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,840
It's actually pretty fun.

886
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,240
So if I bring Japanese food

887
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,080
to the hotpot place to eat with you,

888
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,160
or we just go to a Japanese restaurant

889
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,480
and have sukiyaki,

890
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,000
right? Sukiyaki is basically hotpot.

891
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,600
That way, everyone's happy.

892
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,280
How great is that?

893
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,320
It's the perfect solution.

894
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,120
Yeah.

895
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,440
I think from the morning,

896
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,040
I think from the morning,

897
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,480
it set the tone for

898
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,320
today's romantic date.

899
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:05,760
Right?

900
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,520
After we arrived,

901
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,400
we started with three good points.

902
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:07,600
We started with three good points.

903
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,600
I always keep my word.

904
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:09,800
I always keep my word.

905
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,320
And then,

906
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,480
when we made pizza, the two of us

907
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,080
were so sweet together.

908
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:13,840
In the end,

909
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,840
I think

910
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,640
Zi Han really has

911
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,120
a way of handling problems.

912
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:17,800
And his answers

913
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,880
are always solid.

914
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,200
He's not the type

915
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,240
to give vague answers.

916
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,160
Like if I say I'm overthinking,

917
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,280
he doesn't just say, "Then stop overthinking."

918
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,120
He doesn't give those kinds of

919
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,440
He always has lots of solutions.

920
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,040
And with that

921
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,760
emotional value,

922
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,840
he brings you emotional value.

923
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,240
He has this way of making you feel

924
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,400
that you never need to worry,

925
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,320
he always has a way.

926
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,000
His views on love

927
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,640
and even his values

928
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,440
and worldview are all very clear.

929
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,160
If someone

930
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:41,560
has their own principles

931
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,880
has their own principles

932
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,480
but they're not firmly set yet,

933
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,680
not so well thought out,

934
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,680
it's likely that

935
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,400
when questioned repeatedly,

936
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,760
they'll get confused

937
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,480
and get led astray.

938
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,240
But Zi Han, from start to finish,

939
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,200
has always been clear-headed.

940
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,920
He can always address the root of the issue.

941
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,240
I think that's real maturity.

942
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,800
Just now, they discussed

943
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,040
a topic.

944
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:03,960
In a close

945
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,760
relationship,

946
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,680
do you usually

947
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,320
stick to your own ideas

948
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,240
or accommodate your partner more?

949
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:09,840
For example,

950
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,840
I think their discussion just now

951
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,800
about hotpot and Japanese food

952
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,640
is a great example.

953
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,680
Say I want hotpot today,

954
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,000
and you want Japanese food.

955
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,400
So we eat Japanese food today and hotpot tomorrow.

956
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,280
You accommodate me today,

957
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,800
and I accommodate you tomorrow.

958
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,520
I think this is

959
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,320
mutual.

960
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,440
But would you feel

961
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,320
pressure because your partner accommodates you?

962
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,440
Would that make you feel pressured?

963
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,440
Actually, I don't

964
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,040
really like

965
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,800
the word "accommodate."

966
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,160
Because I think "accommodate"

967
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,480
can lead you into a trap,

968
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,560
like you're doing something unwillingly.

969
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,320
I'd rather use

970
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,600
another word: "companionship."

971
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,760
It's just that

972
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:38,960
two people

973
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,040
come from different backgrounds.

974
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,800
We naturally have our own preferences.

975
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,040
I can accompany you in doing something,

976
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,360
and if it makes you happy,

977
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,960
I'll feel happy too.

978
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,280
And the things I want to do,

979
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,360
the things I want to do,

980
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,560
you can join me as well.

981
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,360
So it's not really about accommodating.

982
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,680
I think "accommodate" might

983
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,400
make more sense to me

984
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,280
in situations like

985
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,200
should we

986
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,360
buy a house first

987
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,160
or invest first?

988
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,520
When you face

989
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,360
major life decisions,

990
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,160
that's when it really matters.

991
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,240
That's when you ask these kinds of questions.

992
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,160
I just heard what Teacher Ma said,

993
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:11,760
and I think it's right.

994
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,360
If, early in a relationship,

995
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,080
you face major life decisions,

996
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,760
and you give up something for me,

997
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:16,880
I admit there will be pressure.

998
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,280
I admit there will be pressure.

999
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,960
But if the relationship is stable,

1000
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,360
and we can clarify

1001
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,400
each other's needs,

1002
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,120
I think it'll be much better.

1003
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:25,920
So I think what they're

1004
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,120
discussing now,

1005
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,560
like hotpot and this stuff,

1006
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,640
isn't really about accommodating

1007
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,720
in this context.

1008
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:32,320
We are living in the moment.

1009
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,400
We are living in the moment.

1010
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,600
A lot of young people really

1011
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,880
face this issue.

1012
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,240
face this issue.

1013
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,560
They want to be in a relationship,

1014
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,600
but at the same time,

1015
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,720
they're afraid of putting pressure on themselves

1016
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:39,840
and on others.

1017
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,840
and on others.

1018
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,360
So does anyone have

1019
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,200
any advice

1020
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,280
for them?

1021
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,760
People feel this way now

1022
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,360
probably because of things outside of relationships.

1023
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,600
Young people are already under a lot of pressure.

1024
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,560
They don't have extra energy for relationships.

1025
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,880
I think young people today

1026
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,600
sometimes

1027
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,880
don't need to be

1028
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:56,960
don't need to be

1029
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,000
so pessimistic about relationships.

1030
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,320
Because I think when you're in

1031
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,280
a good relationship,

1032
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,040
you might actually feel less stressed.

1033
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,000
you might actually feel less stressed.

1034
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,200
And it's not because the other person

1035
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,720
made a huge effort

1036
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,000
or sacrifice,

1037
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,200
but because you have

1038
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,480
a supportive

1039
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,280
relationship.

1040
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,280
I think people shouldn't

1041
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,880
set too many expectations for themselves.

1042
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,480
The more you overthink,

1043
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,400
the higher your expectations get,

1044
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,160
and you become less willing

1045
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,320
to take that step.

1046
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,000
But all of this

1047
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,760
might just be

1048
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,040
your own assumptions.

1049
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:21,800
So here,

1050
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,760
we can invite all our

1051
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,720
friends on Weibo

1052
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,400
to join in

1053
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,560
a discussion.

1054
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,760
How do you balance

1055
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,040
comfort and sacrifice

1056
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,720
in love?

1057
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,200
Everyone

1058
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,280
is welcome to share their thoughts.

1059
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,200
Our official Weibo

1060
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,880
will interact with you in real time.

1061
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,640
You might get featured.

1062
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,160
You could win surprise prizes.

1063
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,720
Alright, next

1064
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,640
let's keep watching.

1065
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,200
Xiao Yuan

1066
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,000
Xiao Yuan

1067
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:05,760
Xiao Yuan

1068
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,240
Hello.

1069
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,280
Here comes Xiao Yuan.

1070
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:10,480
It's sunny.

1071
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,160
So sunny.

1072
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,160
Sunny.

1073
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,800
Help me put on this bracelet.

1074
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,320
Where is it?

1075
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,880
That's so sweet.

1076
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,480
I'm happy now.

1077
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:18,960
Which hand should I wear it on?

1078
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,440
This one.

1079
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,600
Do you know where we're going today?

1080
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,760
I guess I do.

1081
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,960
The place we wished for yesterday.

1082
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,360
Your wishes really come true.

1083
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,080
Seriously.

1084
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,440
Today we'll make your transition happen.

1085
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,160
Really?

1086
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:34,680
Yes.

1087
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,320
We're here today just to film your transition.

1088
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,600
That's great.

1089
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,000
This is for you.

1090
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,640
What is it?

1091
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,360
Lip balm.

1092
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,440
Thanks.

1093
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,400
What?

1094
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,200
Do you have lip balm?

1095
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,560
I don't have any right now.

1096
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:52,960
Never mind, it's fine.

1097
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,520
This one's nice.

1098
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,360
It's another sunny day.

1099
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,360
Let's go.

1100
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,560
We're really going horseback riding.

1101
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,440
You still don't believe it?

1102
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,560
My wishes are that effective.

1103
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,280
All my wishes come true.

1104
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,600
Today we're not "working like cattle."

1105
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,680
Today we're riding cattle and horses.

1106
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:17,800
Okay.

1107
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,680
Guess we're moving up.

1108
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,200
I see the horses.

1109
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,960
They're running.

1110
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,040
The scenery ahead must be amazing.

1111
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,280
Yeah.

1112
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,160
The snowy mountain backdrop is stunning.

1113
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,720
The weather's even better than yesterday.

1114
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,880
We're here.

1115
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,240
We've arrived.

1116
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,240
Hello.

1117
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,320
Hi, everyone.

1118
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,400
Welcome to the Zhaosu Wetland Horse Team.

1119
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,800
Zhaosu has lots of great horses.

1120
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,120
So cool.

1121
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,280
A thousand horses galloping.

1122
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,160
That's awesome.

1123
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,080
Let's get our gear on first.

1124
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,120
Put on your helmet.

1125
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:24,840
Accept reality.

1126
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,920
Wait a second.

1127
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,400
Okay.

1128
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,480
Here it comes.

1129
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,680
Your buckle, right here.

1130
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:33,720
Clumsy.

1131
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,640
Clumsy.

1132
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,240
Alright.

1133
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,440
Whatever, let's just go with this.

1134
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:46,760
It's fine.

1135
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:47,920
Okay.

1136
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,760
You can get on the horse now.

1137
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,560
Step up with your left foot first, left foot.

1138
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,000
This is its rein.

1139
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:01,520
Okay.

1140
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,880
It controls the direction.

1141
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:03,760
Got it.

1142
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,560
Why does it keep nodding?

1143
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,760
Yeah, why is it nodding so much?

1144
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,480
Because of the flies.

1145
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,520
It's shooing away flies.

1146
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,560
Horses are really

1147
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,560
smart animals.

1148
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,760
It knows right away if you can ride.

1149
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,680
Yeah.

1150
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,320
Sometimes it'll mess with you, yeah.

1151
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,960
So you need to know how to control it.

1152
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:23,800
You have to

1153
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,560
keep it under control.

1154
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,040
How many times have you ridden before?

1155
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,200
Once.

1156
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:33,720
Just once.

1157
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,000
Alright.

1158
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,960
Why isn't your horse nodding?

1159
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:40,840
It is nodding.

1160
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:46,560
Go.

1161
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:48,720
Go.

1162
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:51,800
Go.

1163
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:53,960
Can you do it?

1164
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,120
Why is it...

1165
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,520
It's not moving.

1166
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,440
Just do this a little.

1167
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,080
Give it a kick.

1168
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,000
Then it'll move.

1169
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,760
Yeah, kicking doesn't seem to work.

1170
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,760
Try kicking a bit harder.

1171
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:06,400
Okay.

1172
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,480
See, now it's moving.

1173
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,120
No, while you're riding,

1174
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,320
you don't have to pull so tight.

1175
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,160
Yeah, just when you need to turn

1176
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,320
or stop,

1177
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:14,880
then you pull the reins.

1178
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,720
But it's not moving at all.

1179
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:23,720
Wake up.

1180
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,000
Time to get to work.

1181
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:27,440
Let’s go.

1182
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,440
Let’s go.

1183
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,920
This white horse is hilarious.

1184
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,000
This horse is saying it can’t handle this shift at all.

1185
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:40,880
It’s pretending for me.

1186
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:41,520
Seriously.

1187
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,120
Why isn’t it moving?

1188
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,600
Why won’t it go?

1189
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,080
What’s going on?

1190
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,720
It really won’t move.

1191
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,080
Be good, baby.

1192
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,480
Be good, baby.

1193
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:02,720
Why aren’t you moving?

1194
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,480
Go.

1195
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,040
Go this way.

1196
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,640
It’s moving now.

1197
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,080
Turns out it’s following me.

1198
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,320
Then you have to follow me.

1199
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,320
Go.

1200
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,440
Let’s run a bit.

1201
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,040
Run.

1202
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,720
Hurry, catch up.

1203
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,560
This way.

1204
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,360
Come, I’ll pick you up.

1205
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,720
We’ve got the reins, let’s go.

1206
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:36,440
Go.

1207
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:38,480
Yeah.

1208
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,120
Now I’m following you.

1209
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,400
Guess I’ll have to steal you away.

1210
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:44,840
Those two.

1211
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,520
My horse’s personality is like yours.

1212
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,400
Your horse’s personality is like mine.

1213
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,520
But I want to ride your horse.

1214
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,040
Mine really can’t run at all.

1215
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,080
Sure, come over.

1216
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,200
I’ll help you up.

1217
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:02,520
Look at these muscles.

1218
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:03,880
Jump.

1219
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,080
This one.

1220
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:11,960
All set.

1221
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:12,840
Can you get on?

1222
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,320
I’ll try.

1223
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:18,640
Go.

1224
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:22,200
Go.

1225
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:23,960
This way.

1226
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,920
Why does it listen to you so well?

1227
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,880
You’re not using the right method.

1228
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,440
It doesn’t nod for you.

1229
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:34,920
It doesn’t nod as much.

1230
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,920
Go.

1231
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,000
This is so beautiful.

1232
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,440
So beautiful.

1233
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,520
Absolutely gorgeous.

1234
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,160
Take a picture of that, I want to shoot the snowy mountain.

1235
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:48,680
Okay.

1236
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,640
Ready, three, two, one, turn.

1237
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:56,920
This place is amazing.

1238
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,000
You can walk over like this too.

1239
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:01,880
Looks great.

1240
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,560
So stunning.

1241
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,360
He’s really good at taking photos.

1242
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,240
He does take good pictures.

1243
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,400
Let me take one for you.

1244
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:14,640
It looks amazing.

1245
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,280
Really?

1246
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,200
I’ll switch horses, let’s go over there.

1247
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,040
Alright.

1248
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:23,400
So beautiful.

1249
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,680
The horse-wrangling guy.

1250
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,160
You’re strong and mighty.

1251
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,280
Let’s be companions in this world.

1252
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,560
Live freely and happily.

1253
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,040
Gallop on horseback.

1254
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,800
Let’s gallop together then.

1255
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:38,840
Sure.

1256
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:41,480
This works.

1257
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,840
They’re so brave.

1258
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,600
Awesome.

1259
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,560
So happy.

1260
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,280
I hope you’re happy.

1261
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,440
Okay.

1262
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,360
This is insanely awesome.

1263
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,440
Awesome.

1264
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:14,640
Life is a wilderness.

1265
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,120
This really is the wilderness.

1266
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,000
I think the last part

1267
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,080
really captured the theme.

1268
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,120
Life is a wilderness.

1269
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,040
Because if you look at their decisions,

1270
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,200
the state they're in now,

1271
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,600
it's like they're in the wilderness,

1272
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,560
free to go,

1273
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,200
without any restraints,

1274
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:40,840
riding freely,

1275
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:41,720
just galloping ahead,

1276
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:42,760
daring to love,

1277
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,160
bravely expressing themselves.

1278
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,280
It's that wild energy the wilderness gives us,

1279
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,240
that burning passion.

1280
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,000
It all feels so youthful and passionate.

1281
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:50,880
That scene

1282
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,720
is truly what you imagine

1283
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,760
in beautiful Xinjiang.

1284
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,400
That's the picture you have in mind.

1285
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,520
They made it happen.

1286
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,000
Every wish they made

1287
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,240
has come true.

1288
00:48:59,080 --> 00:48:59,840
That's amazing.

1289
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:00,640
It's so wonderful.

1290
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:01,720
Next,

1291
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,120
it's a very

1292
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,320
anticipated journey

1293
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,080
gathering day.

1294
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:05,800
Let's see when everyone

1295
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,360
comes together,

1296
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:08,960
what will happen

1297
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:09,800
this time.

1298
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,160
I wonder if someone

1299
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,360
will mention to Chi Chi

1300
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,720
that actually Yu Xing

1301
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,400
is really determined.

1302
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:16,800
I'm thinking maybe during their

1303
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,800
conversation,

1304
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:18,600
someone will bring it up.

1305
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,280
I think it's possible.

1306
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,640
We played outside all day yesterday,

1307
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:26,640
now my hair is all tangled.

1308
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:27,440
I can't comb it out.

1309
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,000
Try Pantene rose oil.

1310
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,680
It's perfect for your hair right now.

1311
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,600
It's best to use it when your hair is half dry.

1312
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,720
Absorbs in 3 seconds, no sticky hands.

1313
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,240
Blow-dried hair stays soft, shiny, and fragrant.

1314
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,080
It really becomes smooth instantly.

1315
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,000
And the blow-dried texture looks great.

1316
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,800
Plus, the rose scent

1317
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:46,480
is so elegant.

1318
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,000
Right?

1319
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,320
A quick hair rescue like this

1320
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,600
makes it instantly smooth and shiny.

1321
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,080
Now we can go out looking great again.

1322
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:57,480
Just the two of us.

1323
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:58,160
Let's go.

1324
00:49:58,720 --> 00:49:59,560
What?

1325
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:08,080
I'll do it.

1326
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:08,680
Thanks.

1327
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:09,880
Okay.

1328
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,560
How did you sleep after last night?

1329
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,240
Pretty well.

1330
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,200
What about Xiao Jiao and Lan Lan?

1331
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,160
On the island's first meeting day,

1332
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,960
they exchanged messages.

1333
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:39,080
So they got

1334
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,960
a "reminiscent date."

1335
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,280
This part

1336
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,400
can be found in our

1337
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,920
members section.

1338
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,600
Is there a rainbow?

1339
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:58,880
Where's the rainbow?

1340
00:50:59,520 --> 00:50:59,880
Really?

1341
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,080
On top of that cloud,

1342
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,400
there's a rainbow.

1343
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,680
Is it the "Fairy Gathering"?

1344
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,160
Maybe.

1345
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,280
You can slow down and take a look.

1346
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:21,960
Emerald wilderness

1347
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,440
So lush and green

1348
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,880
Vacationing here feels amazing

1349
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,560
See? It's great

1350
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:30,920
We're almost there

1351
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,040
There are lights over there

1352
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,080
Looks like it's right there

1353
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,200
I see it

1354
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:35,680
I see it

1355
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,160
There's a terrace over there

1356
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:43,960
We're here

1357
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,720
Qiandao Lake is so beautiful

1358
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,720
The environment at Qiandao Lake is great too

1359
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,200
But the design here is really unique

1360
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:58,680
Yeah

1361
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,840
We're the first ones here

1362
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,080
Should we go for a walk?

1363
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:03,720
Sure

1364
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:04,760
Let's wait for them

1365
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:05,840
We've already

1366
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,520
explored everything here

1367
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,000
Why isn't anyone else here yet?

1368
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:12,840
Seriously

1369
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,040
I've been waiting so long

1370
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:16,840
We drove too fast

1371
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,560
But did you notice?

1372
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:20,800
Everyone's driving speed is different

1373
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,000
I think Yu Xing is really

1374
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,520
already eager to go back

1375
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,320
This is a viewing platform

1376
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,800
Pink-purple sky

1377
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,960
Such a beautiful sky

1378
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,800
You can actually watch the sunset from here

1379
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:40,840
But it's already over now

1380
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,640
There are only four chairs here

1381
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,000
There should actually be just one chair

1382
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:54,640
Why?

1383
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:55,760
Loneliness

1384
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,120
This is designed for "solitude"

1385
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,680
For "solitude"

1386
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,280
Let's get out

1387
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,120
Okay

1388
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,480
I'm a bit distracted

1389
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,160
I want to stay in the room for a while

1390
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:35,280
Okay

1391
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:07,920
Feeling restless.

1392
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,320
Where did Dr. Fang go?

1393
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:36,840
Is someone coming?

1394
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:38,760
Let me check.

1395
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:44,840
Are they here?

1396
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,520
I hear a car, they're definitely here.

1397
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,560
My ears are pretty good, right?

1398
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,000
Let's go greet them.

1399
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:52,960
I guess it's them.

1400
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:53,680
Chi Chi and the others.

1401
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,840
I've been wanting to see Chi Chi.

1402
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,520
Then I'll guess Dr. Fang.

1403
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,800
I guess Dr. Fang and Lan Lan.

1404
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,440
Always talking about Chi Chi.

1405
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,560
I have logic, you know?

1406
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:07,680
I thought it was...

1407
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,560
The one you keep thinking about.

1408
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:15,400
Dr. Fang.

1409
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:16,760
Yu Xing.

1410
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:17,840
I guessed it was you.

1411
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,000
Why are you alone?

1412
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,480
We were just guessing who would come.

1413
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,240
I guessed you and Lan Lan.

1414
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:24,880
He guessed Chi Chi and the others.

1415
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:26,840
So was I right?

1416
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:27,640
Nope.

1417
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,080
Wrong guess.

1418
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:30,920
I thought you always guessed right.

1419
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,120
I guessed you.

1420
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,080
So I was right about you.

1421
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,440
Yeah, I said Dr. Fang.

1422
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:36,880
So Dr. Fang, where did you go?

1423
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:39,120
We went to the ancient town.

1424
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,280
Nanxun Ancient Town.

1425
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:40,880
That's right.

1426
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,160
I'll stay in my room for half an hour.

1427
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:47,720
Then I'll go.

1428
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,200
I'm going to Dr. Fang's room.

1429
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,000
Okay.

1430
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,400
Did you have fun?

1431
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,000
Was it fun?

1432
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:54,680
It was alright.

1433
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:55,480
Not bad.

1434
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:56,880
Kind of subtle.

1435
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:57,840
Subtle.

1436
00:55:58,880 --> 00:55:59,720
What do you mean?

1437
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,120
How was it subtle?

1438
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,200
There were some little incidents.

1439
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:04,680
Tell me about them.

1440
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,520
Then I'll tell you one from here.

1441
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,080
A secret.

1442
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:08,680
Really?

1443
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,440
You'll definitely thank me.

1444
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:11,680
If you find out.

1445
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,080
Seriously.

1446
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:15,120
Come over here.

1447
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:15,880
Sit down.

1448
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:17,400
The incident.

1449
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,040
So, the incident was...

1450
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,040
This morning when I woke up,

1451
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,560
Only Duoduo and I were left.

1452
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,040
What do you think happened?

1453
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,080
Jiao Ge took her to watch the sunrise.

1454
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:28,840
No way.

1455
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:29,920
After saying it,

1456
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,560
I surprised myself with that thought.

1457
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,640
Come on, tell yours.

1458
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:38,640
What's your secret?

1459
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,080
There's a karaoke room here.

1460
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:43,080
They have it outdoors.

1461
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,960
There's a karaoke room here.

1462
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,920
I was wondering what he was going to say.

1463
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,360
What's the point of that?

1464
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:49,800
Of course it has a use.

1465
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:50,960
I'm telling you to get ready in advance.

1466
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,720
Better than starting at the last minute.

1467
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:55,840
They're here.

1468
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,360
They're here.

1469
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,040
Should we go out?

1470
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:03,200
We're just about to head out.

1471
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:04,960
Is Duoduo a good singer?

1472
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,200
Do I look like a "nightingale"?

1473
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:08,640
Let's eat.

1474
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:09,800
What's on the menu?

1475
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:10,360
There's soup.

1476
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:11,480
There really is soup.

1477
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:12,720
Do we have to wait here?

1478
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,720
I feel like I can't hold back.

1479
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,040
I can't resist.

1480
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,000
Me too, it's hard to wait.

1481
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,160
The food's ready.

1482
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:20,000
Smells pretty good.

1483
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,040
I'm starving.

1484
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,160
There's crab.

1485
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,400
Four people took fruit.

1486
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,520
Three people are eating.

1487
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,360
What is it? Eat.

1488
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:44,720
It's fine.

1489
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,280
Don't eat it.

1490
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,200
Save it for the right person.

1491
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,400
She doesn't like sour food.

1492
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:53,800
I didn't say who.

1493
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:58,760
So sour.

1494
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:00,480
Is it a plum?

1495
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:02,480
It really is sour.

1496
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:08,600
Who's here?

1497
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:09,680
Who's here?

1498
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,080
Hello.

1499
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,120
Hello.

1500
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,120
Have you already

1501
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,240
settled in?

1502
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:20,040
Yes, we have.

1503
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:20,960
Chi Chi is here.

1504
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,360
Chi Chi finally arrived.

1505
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,040
I already guessed.

1506
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:27,880
Guessed what?

1507
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:28,680
We're all here.

1508
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:29,640
Yeah.

1509
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:30,960
Go up from there.

1510
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,320
Then we'll wait for you to come down and eat.

1511
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,400
Okay.

1512
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:35,280
This is such a feast.

1513
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:35,960
Come down quickly.

1514
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:36,920
I'm starving.

1515
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,040
But we still have to wait

1516
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:40,760
for the last person.

1517
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,000
I'll sit.

1518
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:50,760
See where she sits.

1519
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:53,760
Baby, come here.

1520
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:54,600
Alright.

1521
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,160
So where did you guys go?

1522
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:32,400
Africa.

1523
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:33,760
I don't believe it.

1524
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,120
Really.

1525
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:37,280
Seriously.

1526
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,760
We went to see the animal migration.

1527
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:40,640
You went to the zoo?

1528
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:45,920
What zoo?

1529
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,280
A wildlife park.

1530
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:51,680
An African zoo.

1531
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:52,600
Yeah.

1532
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,280
Did you see any interesting animals?

1533
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:56,360
Just giant tortoises.

1534
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:57,120
Giant tortoises?

1535
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:58,760
The really big ones.

1536
00:59:59,080 --> 00:59:59,680
Yeah, that big.

1537
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:00,640
And we gave it a bath.

1538
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:01,880
Gave it a bath?

1539
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:03,160
Yeah, like scrubbing a car.

1540
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:04,280
Just scrubbing, like washing a car.

1541
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:04,960
Right.

1542
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:06,440
Last time, did you guys

1543
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,920
also give Weini and Nicole a bath?

1544
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,320
Yeah, we did.

1545
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,640
Yuxing kept sneaking glances at Chichi.

1546
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,480
Born to give massages to others.

1547
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:22,480
That's nice.

1548
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:30,160
Hello.

1549
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,560
Lanlan is finally here.

1550
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:33,080
Hi.

1551
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,520
You guys are finally back.

1552
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:38,640
Everyone's here.

1553
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,360
Hello.

1554
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:40,960
Hi.

1555
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:47,880
Here she comes.

1556
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,000
(Lanlan) heads straight to Dr. Fang.

1557
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:49,960
The seat next to him.

1558
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:53,880
What did you two go do?

1559
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,640
First thing, check what they did.

1560
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,240
Today we had a "reminiscent date."

1561
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:00,240
It's like the first day,

1562
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,320
when we were on the island texting each other.

1563
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,960
The day we watched the sunset.

1564
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,200
Was there a sunset today?

1565
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:11,040
We didn't see one today.

1566
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,880
That orange sunset.

1567
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:14,720
No orange sunset.

1568
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,240
Were there any other sunsets?

1569
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,800
It just got dark all of a sudden.

1570
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:27,160
She just naturally sat over there.

1571
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:28,720
Sat next to Dr. Fang.

1572
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,240
I think, more or less,

1573
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:31,680
she probably guessed

1574
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,720
Xiao Fang would be anxious.

1575
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:35,400
But I think it's fine.

1576
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:37,520
As soon as Lanlan came in,

1577
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:38,680
she was really affectionate,

1578
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:40,720
didn't even hesitate,

1579
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:41,520
just went

1580
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:42,880
and sat right next to Dr. Fang.

1581
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,960
Just like when they're in the cabin,

1582
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,480
always chatting together.

1583
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:48,400
Yeah.

1584
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,560
When Chichi came in

1585
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,040
after entering the room,

1586
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:55,120
Yu Xing is also getting anxious.

1587
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,160
Yu Xing is still

1588
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:58,120
very determined about Chi Chi.

1589
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:58,800
You can see it.

1590
01:01:59,280 --> 01:01:59,840
But Yu Xing

1591
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:00,720
has already missed

1592
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,720
a whole day and night of time together.

1593
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:05,080
He needs to quickly

1594
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:06,520
reconnect with Chi Chi

1595
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:07,480
and restore

1596
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:08,280
their previous dynamic.

1597
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:10,240
Also, Chi Chi doesn't know

1598
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,120
that he was forced to join

1599
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:12,800
another group.

1600
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:13,440
I think Chi Chi

1601
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:14,640
showing up again at this moment

1602
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:15,680
she will also have

1603
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:17,160
her own feelings about it.

1604
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,960
Now everyone is here.

1605
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,360
So next,

1606
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:22,200
what other

1607
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:22,560
exciting

1608
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:23,480
stories will they have?

1609
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:24,120
Let's

1610
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:24,720
look forward to it together.

1611
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:26,400
See you for next week's exciting stories.

1612
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:27,600
Can't wait!

1613
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:29,800
Jasmine blooming is the signal of a crush.

1614
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:30,520
This show is sponsored by

1615
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:33,120
Kang Shifu Jasmine Tea, with floral aroma and fresh taste.

1616
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:33,920
as the title sponsor.

1617
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:36,880
Extra reality show content every Thursday at noon.

1618
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,600
Unlock more clues about romance.

1619
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,480
Every Friday and Saturday at noon,

1620
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:41,360
watch the romance with you.

1621
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,400
The Heartbeat Family connects across seasons.

1622
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,360
Enjoy the show to your heart's content.

1623
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,280
Go to Tencent Video Caocangdi

1624
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:48,760
to get the same romantic merchandise as the guests with one click.

1625
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:52,600
Everyone, let's keep feeling the heartbeat next week!

1626
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:38,080
Give us a direction, "Captain".

1627
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:38,640
Straight ahead.

1628
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:40,720
Go for it.

1629
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:50,920
No way.

1630
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:51,640
We have to go.

1631
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:55,760
Make a wish, quick.

1632
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:00,920
I didn't see you today.

1633
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,480
I'll wonder what you did today.

1634
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,960
Honestly, I was thinking as soon as I left home,

1635
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:04,600
what you guys were up to.

1636
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,280
I'm gazing from afar.

1637
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:10,760
Above the moon.

1638
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,240
But it seems Yu Xing can't cheer up.

1639
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:17,720
If I

1640
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,000
don't make a sacrifice,

1641
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,160
maybe this can't be resolved.

1642
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:25,760
This is actually our biggest disagreement.

1643
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,880
Is it really that hard to be brave?

1644
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:29,160
The vibe feels a bit off.

1645
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:34,000
Now, the only "Sunset Time" invitation card

1646
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,360
is about to be given out.

1647
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:38,360
So beautiful.

1648
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:39,400
The sun is setting.

1649
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:40,840
The sunset is stunning.

1650
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:42,160
But it's almost dusk.

1651
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:43,040
So many people.

1652
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:43,960
Mountains and rivers everywhere.

1653
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:45,120
Enjoying the view.

1654
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:46,960
I accidentally caught a glimpse of you.

1655
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:52,840
I have to make sure you're safe.

1656
01:04:58,360 --> 01:04:58,880
Are the three of us

1657
01:04:58,880 --> 01:04:59,680
friendship-type lovers?

1658
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:02,280
Don't mention me.

1659
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:03,160
Please don't bring me up.

1660
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:05,560
Mimi.

1661
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:08,200
Eye contact is fine.

1662
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:09,680
This one looks good.

1663
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:13,680
Is a classic moment coming up?

1664
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:15,000
I'm so nervous.

1665
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:16,880
Don't be nervous, it's just starting.

1666
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,040
It's getting a bit heated.

1667
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,400
Now the question goes to these two gentlemen.

1668
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:22,440
I think you're really rational.

1669
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:23,560
I'm super rational.

1670
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:24,720
I think Zhi Heng's approach

1671
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:25,600
is actually pretty great.

1672
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,160
I've never seen Yu Xing like this.

1673
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,680
Just totally lost for words.

1674
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:30,520
Now the drama begins.

1675
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:31,840
So dramatic.

1676
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,160
This is still sweet.

1677
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:37,680
I can't even watch.

1678
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:39,240
There's something called "magnetic field".

1679
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:40,560
It just clicks together.

1680
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,880
So what kind of magnetic field do you think Lu Yuan has?

1681
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,320
The game punishment is

1682
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:47,840
to call Wang Lechen.
