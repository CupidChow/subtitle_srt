1
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,920
I'm back.

2
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,560
I'm here too.

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,880
I noticed the massage stick is missing.

4
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,320
It's gone.

5
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,720
"The Zongzong who runs carrying a train"

6
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,800
There should be another friend joining us this time.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,960
Guess who it is.

8
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,200
Let's welcome our good friend Duoduo.

9
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,520
Hello.

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:58,920
Hello.

11
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,800
Very formal.

12
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,040
We saved the center seat for you.

13
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,200
First time here, and it feels great.

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,200
This center spot.

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:05,640
First, let's

16
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,440
say hi to everyone.

17
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,480
Hi, everyone.

18
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,640
I'm from "Signal of the Heart"

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,080
Season 8, Ke Ailin, Duoduo.

20
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,240
Hello, everyone.

21
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,480
I'm from "Signal of the Heart"

22
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,280
Season 8, Lu Yuan, Xiaoyuan.

23
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,120
Hello, everyone.

24
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,520
I'm from "Signal of the Heart"

25
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,400
Season 8, Jin Yuxing.

26
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,480
Okay.

27
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,760
Let us show you around.

28
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,760
Sure.

29
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,040
This is from every time they've visited before.

30
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,480
Yes, every time we come to "Watch Signal of the Heart," we take a group photo.

31
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,200
We always leave a photo.

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,480
Last time we came,

33
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,320
we left this one.

34
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,000
After we finish watching this time,

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,800
we'll take another photo.

36
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,160
Alright.

37
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,160
I want to ask, why is it every time

38
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,320
it's always Zihan?

39
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,120
Because he's tall?

40
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,520
Tall and has long arms.

41
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,520
In every photo, Zihan's face

42
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,240
looks like this.

43
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,600
Yes, and over here

44
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,200
there's fruit.

45
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,160
And water.

46
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,960
You can snack while watching later.

47
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,080
Just relax.

48
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,640
Make yourself at home.

49
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,240
Enjoy the gossip.

50
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,400
This time, maybe

51
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,440
there's a new activity.

52
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,880
Is it the capsule toy machine?

53
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,280
Yes, the capsule toy machine.

54
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,480
I see it.

55
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,600
I want to ask Duoduo,

56
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,360
it's your first time on "Watch Signal of the Heart,"

57
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,480
how do you feel right now?

58
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,920
First of all, I think

59
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,480
this has a different cozy vibe.

60
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,680
It's actually very warm.

61
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,600
Very comfortable.

62
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,880
When we first entered the room,

63
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,640
we already noticed

64
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,160
there's not just fruit on the table,

65
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,280
but also tea.

66
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,600
There's actually something very "out of place."

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,280
It's this painting in front of us.

68
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,360
I was drawn to it right away.

69
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:22,880
Yes.

70
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,040
Guess who painted each one.

71
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,680
And what they painted.

72
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,920
I think this one is

73
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,000
either Nicole or Weini.

74
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,240
But it's easy to tell if it's Nicole or Weini.

75
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,920
The tail.

76
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,120
It's easy to tell because the tail is long.

77
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,920
This one is Nicole.

78
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,120
Congrats, you're the best at this so far.

79
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,640
Come on, Xiaoyuan, your turn.

80
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,200
These two are really hard to guess.

81
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,760
Is this one a boy or a girl?

82
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,640
First, I think she's a girl.

83
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,800
Is that her braid?

84
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,560
She usually likes to wear a high ponytail.

85
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,680
It's not me.

86
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,400
Chichi.

87
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,760
Chichi.

88
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,240
Really?

89
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,920
Is it Chichi?

90
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,600
Chichi has worn a high ponytail before.

91
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,400
Is it Chichi?

92
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,200
Is it Chichi?

93
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,520
Could this be me?

94
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,200
That would be way too abstract.

95
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,080
Guess again, pick one.

96
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,360
I remember Chichi had a braided high ponytail.

97
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,080
I've worn a ponytail too.

98
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,800
You have too?

99
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,880
Is it Chichi?

100
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,080
I want a definite answer.

101
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,800
Chichi

102
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,800
Yes, that's Chichi.

103
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,000
It's Chichi.

104
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,640
I guessed two correctly.

105
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,480
I definitely guessed the most.

106
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,560
For now,

107
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,160
this abstract painting is actually pretty tough.

108
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,800
Dr. Fang

109
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,160
This is either Liu Zihan or Dr. Fang.

110
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,080
How can you tell it's Dr. Fang or Zihan?

111
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,880
Because his jaw is square.

112
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,880
Lechen

113
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,240
Jiao Ge

114
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,080
Jiao Ge

115
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,320
Could it be Jin Yuxing?

116
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,920
Does it look like him? I want to ask.

117
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,680
Is this even reasonable? Seriously?

118
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,600
Honestly, it just looks like a "painting."

119
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,920
I'll just reveal it, okay?

120
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,120
This is actually

121
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,440
Ruilong.

122
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,520
Yes, it's Ruilong.

123
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,240
Why?

124
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,480
Why?

125
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,560
You'd have to ask the artist why they drew him like this.

126
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,760
Is this for real?

127
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,360
Ruilong.

128
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,800
Because Yuxing guessed right twice out of the three paintings.

129
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,080
Congratulations.

130
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,880
We've prepared a generous set meal for you.

131
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,880
What?

132
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,760
What kind of set meal?

133
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,200
What kind of set meal?

134
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,640
What's in the set meal?

135
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,120
It's coming, don't rush.

136
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,880
Here it comes.

137
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,080
I think this is just awesome.

138
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,400
Feels just like home.

139
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,920
Let's look forward to it.

140
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,000
Let's take a look.

141
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,800
What will happen today

142
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,400
What kind of story will unfold?

143
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,760
Let's watch the drama together

144
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,200
while enjoying the show.

145
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,480
Definitely an ENTJ.

146
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,880
Quick to take action.

147
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,520
Xiaoyuan also has the skill of making dumplings.

148
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,280
Just found out today.

149
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:17,680
They're really well made.

150
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,840
You made them really well.

151
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,480
Seriously, they're well made.

152
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,440
Well made.

153
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,800
Why didn't you give us one to try?

154
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:42,920
I think it looks similar.

155
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,560
Did he make buns or dumplings?

156
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,280
I also think it looks a bit like xiaolongbao.

157
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,200
I thought the last one looked like xiaolongbao too.

158
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,000
Looks like he made buns.

159
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,080
Looks like he made a bun.

160
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,880
Made a bun.

161
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,040
Hello.

162
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,280
Ruilong is saying hello over there.

163
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,720
Hello.

164
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,560
Hello.

165
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,080
So interesting.

166
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,520
Me.

167
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,000
You.

168
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,880
Me.

169
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,560
The drama ended up involving me, seriously.

170
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,520
Ruilong.

171
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,440
Take a sip and glance over.

172
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:46,880
Helps cool you down a bit.

173
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,320
Helps cool you down a bit.

174
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,400
Honeysuckle.

175
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,480
He brewed honeysuckle.

176
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,440
Honeysuckle.

177
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,920
Coconut.

178
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,440
I just remembered, that day

179
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,800
when Zihan "went to Hainan."

180
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,720
Right, coconut.

181
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,840
A day trip.

182
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,360
So cool.

183
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,440
Should've made more.

184
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,480
All gone.

185
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,600
Made too few.

186
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,080
I'll make some for you next time.

187
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:35,640
Cake

188
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,720
Brought you a cake, right?

189
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,560
Bread

190
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,480
Is it that one?

191
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,000
The one from Shanghai, right?

192
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,720
Cinnamon roll

193
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,880
Because I told her before

194
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,520
I said my favorite cinnamon roll

195
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,240
is from that shop in Shanghai

196
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,200
Super tasty

197
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,000
I tried it, it really is delicious

198
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,440
That cinnamon roll is insanely good

199
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,120
That cinnamon roll

200
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,920
I ate it

201
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,480
It was delicious

202
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:49,840
So good

203
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,520
I still remember

204
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,080
these little details

205
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,920
I didn’t notice at first

206
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,120
I see

207
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,280
So do you know the result?

208
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,360
I know who my mom voted for

209
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,880
I know who Xiaoyuan’s mom voted for

210
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,040
I even know who Chichi’s mom voted for

211
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,000
Want to know?

212
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,120
Me

213
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:26,840
I’ll just watch it myself

214
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,960
Watch the show myself

215
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,920
Every day at noon

216
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,520
Keep up with the show myself

217
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,400
Okay

218
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,560
Chichi?

219
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,120
Chichi

220
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,840
Enjoying the gossip about Jin Yuxing

221
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,160
What’s up?

222
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,320
This hairstyle looks really good

223
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,720
Princess hairstyle

224
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,400
Stop

225
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,840
So curious

226
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,280
See, now you’re confident

227
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,200
That’s enough

228
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,440
So awkward

229
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,160
I think this part

230
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,720
It’s definitely easier to walk on the carpet

231
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,160
Right?

232
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,320
Pacing back and forth

233
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,560
Getting into the rhythm, bro

234
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,920
I remember this photo

235
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,600
Really?

236
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,000
You’re really good at giving compliments

237
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,840
You’re so good at complimenting

238
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,320
It’s not like you haven’t complimented before

239
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,080
Looks like you listened to your friends

240
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,200
You just won’t stop talking, hurry up and drink

241
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,800
We’re on the same wavelength

242
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,200
Jin Yuxing, you’re hilarious

243
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,320
No

244
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,440
Stop trying to cover it up

245
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,960
Seriously

246
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,760
All of you, honestly

247
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,960
Time to watch the drama

248
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,400
I’m here for the gossip

249
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,120
Feels like everyone’s vibe is totally different from earlier in the house

250
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,480
Completely different

251
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,840
It’s a real drama-filled situation

252
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,120
What’s this?

253
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,440
A badminton racket, right?

254
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,400
A pink one

255
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,240
A pink basketball

256
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,280
Did you give it?

257
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,640
Cake

258
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,240
You didn’t want to share earlier

259
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,400
Just didn’t want others to eat it

260
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,000
You only wanted to give it to Chichi

261
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,160
Is it raspberry?

262
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,080
Blackberry, blueberry

263
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,480
I’ll make a wish too

264
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,800
Make a wish together

265
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,080
Wish that we won’t gain weight in Changsha for two days

266
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,920
Eat without getting fat

267
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,920
Let me brag with you all

268
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,000
They’re all yellow

269
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,240
The fork and plate just now

270
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,720
were also yellow

271
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,720
Because she likes yellow

272
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,240
You’re so thoughtful, Xing bro

273
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,680
Not bad

274
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,640
Both thoughtful and attentive

275
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,680
And the compliments are spot on

276
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,120
I can’t take it anymore

277
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,480
There’s something going on

278
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,480
Something’s up

279
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:17,960
Something’s happening

280
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,520
Something’s up, I didn’t catch it

281
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,080
Kind of like that

282
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,320
Say it together

283
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,920
A bit romantic

284
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,440
Let me drink some water to calm down

285
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,440
I said that day

286
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,000
Why is Chichi so sweet?

287
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,400
He can even hold one in his mouth.

288
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,560
Three-Sword Style.

289
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,840
You're talking about Zoro, right?

290
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,320
My Chichi.

291
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,400
Okay, got it.

292
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,960
I think this is a classic example.

293
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,720
Scorpio.

294
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,360
Yuxing.

295
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:57,920
Very nervous.

296
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,560
Yuxing, I didn't expect that.

297
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,080
Those little details.

298
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,600
You quietly remembered all of them.

299
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,800
Where we can't see.

300
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,920
Working hard in silence.

301
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,760
Actually, when I'm with everyone,

302
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,560
I might not talk much.

303
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,440
Because most of the time,

304
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,920
I'm just listening to what you all say.

305
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,800
That's true.

306
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,800
Do you have anything

307
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,960
that makes these details

308
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,440
Like just now, Yuxing

309
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,560
He remembered that Chichi likes yellow.

310
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,520
Actually, about that gift,

311
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,360
it's because she used to play badminton.

312
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,720
We played badminton at the sports day.

313
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,040
She said she hadn't played in a long time.

314
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,920
So I thought of giving her

315
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,880
a yellow badminton racket

316
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,120
with a yellow grip.

317
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,640
I think by interacting

318
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,400
in daily conversations,

319
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,800
you remember

320
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,080
the things she likes.

321
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,520
Then you do something about it.

322
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,400
I think it

323
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,960
helps build a deeper connection.

324
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,960
I think you really care.

325
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,520
Sometimes,

326
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,960
a lot of people say

327
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,000
we need a sense of ritual.

328
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,240
I think girls don't always

329
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,320
or guys don't always

330
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,880
need to wait for a special holiday.

331
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,720
Sometimes,

332
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,240
in a quiet moment of life,

333
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,360
a little surprise happens.

334
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,040
That actually adds more

335
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,120
Yes, it's those

336
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,680
things people usually forget.

337
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,040
But he remembers them.

338
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,640
I think that's really touching.

339
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,480
Yeah, like on an anniversary,

340
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,200
you know it's coming up,

341
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,160
that meaningful day.

342
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,800
That day.

343
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,400
You already expect something.

344
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,680
If he does something then,

345
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,080
it's just what you expected.

346
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:22,680
But if you

347
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,840
had no expectations at all

348
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,680
from the start,

349
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,360
and suddenly

350
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,360
he surprises you out of nowhere,

351
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,840
your happiness

352
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,560
shoots up instantly.

353
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,920
Yeah, but I think this kind of surprise

354
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,120
isn't just about

355
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:32,880
guys giving gifts to girls.

356
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,480
It's not only between different genders.

357
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
It happens between same genders too.

358
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,480
Friends do it as well.

359
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,600
Yeah, I remember you guys

360
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,840
gave each other gifts.

361
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,000
Yeah, on my thesis defense day,

362
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,640
Duoduo gave me sunflowers.

363
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,880
Sunflowers.

364
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,560
Let's keep watching.

365
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:58,600
No way.

366
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,120
Watching this part makes me

367
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,720
really take notes.

368
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,560
You described it well.

369
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,840
Even I think this part is so "straight guy".

370
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,160
Stop it.

371
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,880
What?

372
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,120
Stop.

373
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,880
So cute.

374
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,280
So this side of you

375
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,120
is something we'll never see.

376
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,760
Honestly,

377
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,680
I really didn't know.

378
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:25,960
Yifan.

379
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,360
Yifan is back.

380
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,200
You didn't know about this, right?

381
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:32,760
I knew.

382
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,200
She came in and said hi.

383
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,760
Showing off her dribbling skills.

384
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,240
Taking a basketball class.

385
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,520
Yes.

386
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,400
I felt like just now

387
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,680
I was playing basketball in the classroom

388
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,520
and got caught by the teacher.

389
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,960
That feeling of getting caught.

390
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,880
Yeah.

391
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,960
We look like

392
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,560
two people taking a walk after a big meal,

393
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,840
like elderly couples.

394
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,560
See?

395
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,880
So relaxed.

396
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,520
We really look like siblings, you know?

397
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,080
We do, actually.

398
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,360
That's so cool, Duoduo.

399
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,800
Applause for you.

400
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,800
Are you two discussing philosophy?

401
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,240
Yes.

402
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,960
We walked around the lake

403
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,000
and talked about all this.

404
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,240
I really agreed just now

405
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,280
with what you said

406
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,760
about the order people enter your life.

407
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,440
It's important, but also not that important.

408
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,400
Especially in relationships.

409
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,320
It's important because

410
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,280
maybe in the story's

411
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,360
development,

412
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,280
there are things

413
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,120
you can't control.

414
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,800
You want to find a reason.

415
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,920
And you might think

416
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,520
it's because of timing.

417
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,200
But I don't think that's always true.

418
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,040
The ending of a story

419
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,840
is always shaped by

420
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,600
many different factors.

421
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,760
So is it important?

422
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,800
It is.

423
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,640
But at the same time,

424
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,240
it's not that crucial.

425
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,800
In any relationship,

426
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,800
besides the time spent together,

427
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,280
the length of time,

428
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,400
there are many other factors

429
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,200
that affect it.

430
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,240
But I think no matter

431
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,040
what kind of relationship it is,

432
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,280
being able to accompany each other

433
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,000
for a part of the journey

434
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,600
is already a deep connection.

435
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,120
Yes.

436
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:20,800
So I think it's pretty great.

437
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,920
Really great.

438
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,320
What?

439
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,120
Breakfast in the flower room.

440
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,040
Flower room.

441
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,440
It was really plentiful.

442
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:47,720
Private chef.

443
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,160
Just watching made me hungry.

444
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,240
That's what you call a private chef.

445
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,960
Seriously, it made me hungry.

446
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,760
There were main dishes and vegetables,

447
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,240
plus grains and fruit.

448
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,360
Very nutritious.

449
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,440
Super nutritious.

450
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,440
I know.

451
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,680
It was Lanlan and Yifan.

452
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,320
They went to get their hair done.

453
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,680
Got scalp treatments.

454
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,000
Why didn't we get one?

455
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,120
Neither of us did.

456
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:25,400
Neither of us.

457
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,960
Let's get one before you go to Beijing.

458
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,520
Let's go.

459
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,480
Seriously.

460
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,720
If you want, you can go too.

461
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,320
Then I want to go too.

462
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,440
Everyone here can join.

463
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,640
Actually,

464
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,360
hand and scalp massages are really good.

465
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,040
When people are stressed at work,

466
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,120
you can massage both sides

467
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,360
where the liver and gallbladder meridians run.

468
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:43,800
Here?

469
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,560
Both sides.

470
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,240
People who get gray hair later in life

471
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,200
and it grows on both sides here,

472
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,760
it's probably due to stress.

473
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,800
Or emotional issues.

474
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,360
Some people get gray hair here.

475
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,120
Gray hair can reflect your body's

476
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,840
different problems, actually.

477
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,240
I think the reason why Lanlan

478
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,200
has different feelings

479
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,200
is actually quite normal.

480
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,640
We've interacted with Jiao and Dr. Fang

481
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,960
as well.

482
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,280
It feels just like on the show,

483
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,320
exactly the same, right?

484
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,560
Their personalities haven't changed at all.

485
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,320
But I think Jiao now

486
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,040
compared to when he was in the house,

487
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,920
I feel like he has

488
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,440
relaxed a little bit.

489
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,960
He can treat himself a bit better.

490
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,960
When people meet,

491
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,720
it should always start with bringing flowers.

492
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,720
Chichi's outfit looks amazing.

493
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,160
So stylish.

494
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,560
I'm really looking forward to it.

495
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,960
So excited.

496
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,520
Welcome to the park adventure.

497
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,120
Please relax and enjoy

498
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,280
tonight's activities.

499
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,840
The feeling of exploration

500
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,880
brings surprises with every step.

501
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,840
Duoduo, the "spiritual mentor,"

502
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,840
is actually helpful.

503
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,680
Zihan really listened.

504
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,400
Just go for it.

505
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,160
I planted another seed in him.

506
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,760
That's a bit of a stretch.

507
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,000
Yeah, that's a bit far-fetched.

508
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,120
A beautiful parabola.

509
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,280
A graceful curve.

510
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,880
What's wrong?

511
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,280
Are you feeling bored, bro?

512
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,160
I think it's pretty interesting.

513
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,480
Why does he seem upset?

514
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,240
Is Zihan going to roll out a food cart?

515
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,480
Is Zihan doing it?

516
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,080
Really?

517
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,960
Because there's only one dining chair.

518
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,720
He turned into a chef.

519
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,600
He really looks like a chef.

520
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,360
That's impressive.

521
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,680
Mr. Liu.

522
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,960
This...

523
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,440
This...

524
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,400
I've learned it all wrong.

525
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,400
Zihan has his own kind of humor.

526
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,480
His style of humor is definitely there.

527
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,040
I think...

528
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,880
You have it too.

529
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,160
You have it too.

530
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,080
You two have different styles of humor.

531
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,480
Yeah, you're funny too.

532
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,360
I totally understand Chichi.

533
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:38,480
Zihan

534
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,280
When he said that just now,

535
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,760
he looked much cooler.

536
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,240
He was already cool.

537
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,400
Now he's even cooler.

538
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,720
Just like a drama.

539
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,080
So sweet.

540
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,160
Really sweet.

541
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,000
But honestly,

542
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,800
this really

543
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,960
planning this surprise

544
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,360
had so many details.

545
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,360
I just want to ask,

546
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,440
do you think in daily life

547
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,800
it's necessary to create

548
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,600
surprises like this?

549
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,960
I think it's necessary.

550
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,480
I think life needs

551
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,080
a sense of ritual.

552
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,240
Then you'll remember things deeply.

553
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,120
The things you experience together.

554
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,280
It feels different, for sure.

555
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,560
I really like it.

556
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,320
Because it feels like

557
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,880
someone truly cares about you.

558
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,840
It's really important

559
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,280
to prepare surprises like this.

560
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:41,360
What kind of surprises do you two like?

561
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,080
What surprises do you both enjoy?

562
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,920
Specifically, what kind?

563
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,640
What are they like?

564
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,680
Is it like

565
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,880
Zihan's kind of surprise,

566
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,000
or just something small,

567
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,200
just a little gesture?

568
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,880
I probably prefer

569
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,600
just something simple,

570
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,600
even if it's a tiny thing.

571
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,120
Like Chichi,

572
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,000
she likes desserts,

573
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,920
so giving her a cake

574
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,200
is enough.

575
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,160
Just these little things

576
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,160
make me feel happy.

577
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,720
Actually, I think surprises

578
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,600
are almost the same as being thoughtful.

579
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,480
Or you can see it as sincerity.

580
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:09,960
Yes.

581
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,800
As long as it's unexpected,

582
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,560
I really enjoy any surprise.

583
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,040
Seeing someone's reaction to a surprise

584
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,200
I think the other person

585
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,000
will be happy too.

586
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,040
Alright, let's take a break.

587
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,560
Okay.
