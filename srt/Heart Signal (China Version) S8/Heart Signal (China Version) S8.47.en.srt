1
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:44,760
I wrapped it.

2
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,800
This cheat sheet is pretty good.

3
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,360
I feel uneasy without a cheat sheet.

4
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,320
Thank you.

5
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,160
Chen made it with love.

6
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,400
What's wrong? Burned by love?

7
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,680
The mysterious person is...

8
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,200
The mysterious person is me.

9
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,280
It's me.

10
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,800
So mysterious.

11
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,040
I almost guessed it.

12
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,480
He pulled it off.

13
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,960
When you're making a wish,

14
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,080
you can come to me too.

15
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,880
You're really into rituals.

16
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,600
You've got some skills.

17
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,600
There might be some connection.

18
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,760
It's really only suitable for

19
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,640
us to be the best playmates.

20
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,680
But it doesn't stop us from being friends.

21
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,240
We opened Ruilong's room.

22
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,600
He left a letter for everyone.

23
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,040
No way, he's doing this?

24
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,520
A surprise.

25
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,360
I'm playing hide-and-seek, you can't find me.

26
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,440
Hello.

27
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,400
Wang Jue.

28
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,240
I chose to leave the cabin.

29
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,240
I really admire your courage.

30
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,400
And your views on love.

31
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,440
I'm just sorry.

32
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,920
I let you down.

33
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,680
Fate really plays tricks on people.

34
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,360
She chose to open his box today.

35
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,480
He chose to say goodbye to everyone today.

36
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:45,920
Zihan

37
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,120
"Businessman"

38
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,640
Lechen gave it to me.

39
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,040
Why do I feel like Teacher Fang

40
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,160
is always cooking every day?

41
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,440
Because he needs to make breakfast for someone.

42
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,920
Such a beautiful omelet.

43
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,520
Only with love

44
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,400
can you make an omelet like this.

45
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,880
Lanlan

46
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,200
Lanlan

47
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,840
Good morning.

48
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,040
I woke up late.

49
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,720
I said I woke up late.

50
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,520
You woke up late again.

51
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,800
Didn't you mention a blue rabbit last time?

52
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,640
I couldn't find a real blue rabbit,

53
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,400
but I found something blue.

54
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,000
Thank you.

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,800
A rabbit plush.

56
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,320
Doesn't it look like me?

57
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,720
Am I a little rabbit in your eyes?

58
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,200
Little rabbits are well-behaved.

59
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,320
Am I not well-behaved?

60
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,200
You are.

61
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,880
Thank you, I really like it.

62
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:35,840
So do you know

63
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,200
how hard it was to find this?

64
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,240
Tell me, how hard?

65
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,200
I'm not telling you.

66
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,240
I'll tell you later.

67
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,480
Anyway, it was pretty hard.

68
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,600
I really like it.

69
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm glad you like it.

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,640
Then I'll pick a day

71
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,080
to wear a dress in the same color.

72
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:48,920
Okay.

73
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,720
Shall we make breakfast together tomorrow?

74
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,320
Cook together?

75
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,040
Let's plan to make breakfast together.

76
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,160
What did you make?

77
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,360
Omelet, and then

78
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,400
some noodles.

79
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,200
You finished the noodles?

80
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,160
I thought you hadn't made them yet.

81
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,920
Not yet, I haven't made them yet.

82
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,280
It's fine.

83
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,040
Darn it.

84
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,640
Ruined.

85
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,480
Ruined.

86
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,040
It was pretty round at first.

87
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,560
It turned out like this because I didn't flip it well.

88
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,360
It's okay.

89
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,800
They're so in sync.

90
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:37,920
Isn't this

91
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,160
just like a scene from a TV drama?

92
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,120
Alright, I'm starting now.

93
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,040
Do you want a full portion or half?

94
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,760
Half.

95
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,560
How much is a full portion and how much is half?

96
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,360
Hard to describe.

97
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,640
Then I'll make a full portion.

98
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,760
Let's have half a portion each.

99
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The color looks great.

100
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,560
It looks delicious.

101
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,120
Feels like it's all edible.

102
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,200
Any of these could be lunch.

103
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,040
Yeah.

104
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,080
Try it.

105
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,760
Do we need to mix this?

106
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,440
Yes, mix it a bit.

107
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,200
You do it.

108
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,520
You definitely need to mix it.

109
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,560
Try one strand.

110
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:54,800
I'll try.

111
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:09,920
Tasty, right?

112
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,160
It's really good.

113
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,960
I think so too.

114
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:19,760
I'm shocked.

115
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,880
Has your opinion changed?

116
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,600
Yes.

117
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,720
This is the best scallion oil noodles I've ever had.

118
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,000
Best scallion oil noodles I've ever tasted.

119
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,280
Really?

120
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,760
Really.

121
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,840
Really?

122
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,480
Really.

123
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,120
Absolutely true.

124
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,920
Look at Dr. Fang smiling.

125
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,560
So in the first half of your life,

126
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,240
you haven't had much good food.

127
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,040
Scallion oil noodles are really tasty.

128
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,520
You need to provide emotional value.

129
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,200
These noodles are made with love.

130
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,320
Maybe scallion oil noodles

131
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,680
have never tasted this good before.

132
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,240
Really.

133
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,760
The cilantro beef is also the best I've had.

134
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,160
Yeah, really.

135
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,720
It's delicious.

136
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,360
I think you've lost weight.

137
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,280
You just noticed?

138
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:13,880
Right?

139
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,480
I think everyone has lost weight.

140
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,360
Except me.

141
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,240
Because I'm always eating.

142
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,080
You're well fed.

143
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,240
Yeah.

144
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,480
Never missed a meal.

145
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,080
Yeah.

146
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,120
You're really well fed.

147
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,680
"Feeder"

148
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,040
"Feeder"

149
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:32,840
"Feeder"

150
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:33,640
This...

151
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,160
That's a bit intimate.

152
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:35,960
Kind of ambiguous.

153
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,840
This...

154
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,080
You're really well fed.

155
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,640
"Feeder"

156
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,480
So what "animal" are you?

157
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,240
Sometimes you're pretty slow too.

158
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,000
Do you still remember

159
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,480
what I said at the dinner?

160
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,320
I remember.

161
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,440
You said...

162
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,800
Really? Tell me.

163
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,880
The message was sent late.

164
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,640
The message was sent late.

165
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,120
I thought you were slow.

166
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,760
I really thought you were pretty slow.

167
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,880
She understood his point.

168
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,360
But I think it started with what you said.

169
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,160
I started paying more attention to you.

170
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,600
I think

171
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,480
when I like someone,

172
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,160
I need to let her know first.

173
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,160
Really.

174
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,640
It's true.

175
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,440
I agree with him.

176
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,640
I agree with him.

177
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,680
You're at it again.

178
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,480
It's not me again.

179
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,720
What he said is right.

180
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,120
Yeah.

181
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,040
If you like someone, just like them.

182
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,000
Say it, express it.

183
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,960
If you can't say it, express it.

184
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,480
Yeah.

185
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,000
Have you eaten yet?

186
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,160
Almost.

187
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:39,920
What?

188
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,520
Who ate?

189
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,000
She said they almost ate.

190
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,520
You ate?

191
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,320
Everyone ate.

192
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,160
No, I haven't.

193
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,520
What are you going to do?

194
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,400
I'm going to cook.

195
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,400
You can come and see.

196
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,160
Okay.

197
00:10:59,280 --> 00:10:59,960
What are you making?

198
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,520
I bought a lot of duck tongues.

199
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,720
When did you eat this afternoon?

200
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,440
I only had two eggs.

201
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,560
Then I won't cook.

202
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,960
I'm really hungry.

203
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,400
You must have a big appetite.

204
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,000
Just two eggs?

205
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,800
Was that just an appetizer?

206
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,280
Hello, everyone.

207
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,440
Hello.

208
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,760
That mouth corner.

209
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,200
Seeing Lanlan, it's instantly different.

210
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,000
Jiao, are you over here?

211
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,840
I'm going over there.

212
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,520
Okay, why are we splitting up?

213
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,440
I get it.

214
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,440
He's been looking at the mirror.

215
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,360
Where are we cooking?

216
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,360
Let's go.

217
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,280
Cook over there.

218
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:49,920
Alright.

219
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,480
What are you making?

220
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,080
I'm making yam.

221
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,640
Have you eaten?

222
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,200
I ate this afternoon.

223
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:03,720
Ate in the afternoon.

224
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,400
Got it.

225
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,520
Nicole.

226
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,680
Nicole.

227
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,320
Let's go.

228
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,880
Okay, don't do that.

229
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,200
Viewing spot.

230
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,240
Should I give you more?

231
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,560
Want some afternoon tea or something?

232
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,560
I want duck tongues.

233
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,760
Can you make duck tongues first?

234
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,400
Still being picky.

235
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,320
I came just for duck tongues.

236
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,800
No dinner tonight.

237
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,440
You can't go all night without eating.

238
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,360
Just duck tongues?

239
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,680
I really want duck tongues.

240
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,200
Seriously.

241
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,040
I can't do anything about you.

242
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,240
That was so "cute."

243
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,000
Pretty adorable.

244
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,080
Go get the instant camera.

245
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,040
You're really starting to enjoy watching.

246
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,600
Their outfits match well.

247
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,480
Please make me look cool in the photo.

248
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,320
Look at me.

249
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,880
How can you see your face like that?

250
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,280
Your hair is in the way.

251
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:21,760
Atmosphere.

252
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,520
Okay.

253
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,480
Alright, fine.

254
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,280
Guaranteed to look cool.

255
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,040
Really?

256
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,880
Really.

257
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,520
Trust my skills.

258
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,160
If you don't look cool, no duck tongues tonight.

259
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,200
They're going back and forth.

260
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,360
If it's not cool, I won't show you.

261
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,120
Don't be so stiff, chef.

262
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,760
This one should look good.

263
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,440
Looks good.

264
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,120
But this camera is specially

265
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,080
for taking pictures of dogs.

266
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,880
Their "banter" mode is pretty sweet.

267
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,440
Yeah.

268
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,200
No duck tongues tonight.

269
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,400
It looks good.

270
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,440
Are you going to hug the duck and eat?

271
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,800
This one looks good.

272
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:08,720
Take a look.

273
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,280
It's fine, right?

274
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,200
I forgive you.

275
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,040
So nice.

276
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:32,720
That soup.

277
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,360
Do we add scallions at the end?

278
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:35,920
Yes.

279
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,440
You can add them.

280
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:36,680
Right.

281
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,600
Just for garnish.

282
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,360
Sure.

283
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:38,600
Okay.

284
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,760
Did you taste it?

285
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,400
I tried a little.

286
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,800
Does it look good?

287
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,480
It looks good.

288
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,400
Where's the camera?

289
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:44,680
Me.

290
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,160
Here.

291
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,640
I haven't used this before.

292
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,400
Hold it vertically.

293
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:51,920
Vertically.

294
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,000
Like this.

295
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,680
Let me take a photo with the chef.

296
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,880
Yes, that's what I was thinking.

297
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,960
Come on, chef.

298
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,240
You can tell right away

299
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,680
who's working and who's not.

300
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,080
I just pressed it by accident, come on.

301
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,880
Look at the camera.

302
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,520
Three.

303
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,800
Two, one.

304
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,120
Three, two, one.

305
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,040
This one's good.

306
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,960
It's good, right? The second one?

307
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,720
This one's good.

308
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,560
I'll go check the soup over there.

309
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,880
I think my soup is almost ready.

310
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,320
Okay.

311
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,360
Isn't this already

312
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,800
like a couple living together?

313
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,680
To be honest,

314
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,640
Hello.

315
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,120
I have something to do.

316
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,280
Leaving at lightning speed.

317
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,680
Wrapped it in paper.

318
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,240
Because it's a bit hot.

319
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,560
So be careful.

320
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,840
You can hold it while eating.

321
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,360
It looks perfect in color, aroma, and taste.

322
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:51,880
Yes.

323
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,040
If you

324
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,680
don't eat any of the ingredients,

325
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,960
you can just drink the soup.

326
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,160
Okay.

327
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:56,920
Because I think

328
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,360
all the essence is in the soup.

329
00:15:59,360 --> 00:15:59,920
Right.

330
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,040
Careful, it's hot.

331
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,560
It's delicious.

332
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,800
So is it the best?

333
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,040
It's really good.

334
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,040
There's a difference between delicious and the best.

335
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,600
Your stomach should feel better today.

336
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,840
Can we have another one tomorrow?

337
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,320
So tasty.

338
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,400
It's amazing.

339
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,760
It's really delicious.

340
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,120
Is this your first time making it?

341
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:27,880
First time.

342
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,480
First time ever.

343
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,280
It's top-notch.

344
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,920
Thank you.

345
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,440
And Chen helped guide me.

346
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,040
What's that sound?

347
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,520
It's Baduanjin.

348
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:55,960
For health.

349
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,880
I think he's so cute.

350
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,080
Living with him,

351
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,040
would probably be fun.

352
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,800
Yeah.

353
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,800
It's so hot.

354
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,080
He's so lost.

355
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,120
Because the night before

356
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:38,560
they (Liu Zihan and Sun Hanqing) went

357
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,560
to the park.

358
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,520
Right?

359
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,240
Maybe.

360
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,200
Hello.

361
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:01,680
Hi.

362
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,680
Want to build blocks?

363
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,600
Where should we build?

364
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,640
How about the place where we used sticky tape last time?

365
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,360
Sounds good.

366
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,800
It rained today.

367
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,400
Why didn't it rain yesterday?

368
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,560
Just kidding.

369
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,280
It didn't rain yesterday.

370
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,160
Feeling jealous.

371
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,280
When you didn't come back yesterday,

372
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,320
I was going to build half of it.

373
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,960
And wait for you to finish it together.

374
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,640
You built half of it.

375
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,920
Built half.

376
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,520
Did you come back early yesterday?

377
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,840
Pretty early.

378
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,880
So did you have fun yesterday?

379
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,320
Yes, I had a great time.

380
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,560
Did you have fun yesterday?

381
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,640
Yesterday.

382
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,120
Yesterday was boring.

383
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,120
It felt like everyone came back late.

384
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,920
So what did you think about yesterday?

385
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,080
It was a bit more fun.

386
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,600
Guess what I played.

387
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,280
I only saw you bring back a bunch of balloons.

388
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,680
Hello, everyone.

389
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,320
We're back.

390
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,480
You finally came back.

391
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,160
Hello.

392
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,680
Hi.

393
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,960
So many bags.

394
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,320
He saw it.

395
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,320
Feels like someone's jealous.

396
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,520
We played archery yesterday too.

397
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,760
Archery.

398
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,120
There's an archery range in the park.

399
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,040
So, did your skills improve?

400
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,400
No, I didn't hit any.

401
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,800
Install this first.

402
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,040
Do you feel

403
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,960
time passes quickly in the cabin?

404
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,320
Yes, very fast.

405
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,040
But yesterday felt long.

406
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,800
Right? Yeah.

407
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,760
You look like that cat meme.

408
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,320
Made her laugh.

409
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,160
It's easy.

410
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,480
Yeah, it's actually pretty simple.

411
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,040
It's not that hard.

412
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,520
This is my first time building blocks.

413
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,200
This is your first time building blocks?

414
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,040
That's such an honor.

415
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,440
Great job.

416
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,360
Thank you.

417
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,960
Yuxing is quite thoughtful.

418
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,120
Sure, I just arranged these flowers.

419
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,320
They're for you.

420
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,160
Very nice.

421
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,360
Looks amazing.

422
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,600
Cheers.

423
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,560
To celebrate you.

424
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,600
for finishing these blocks for the first time.

425
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,000
Yesterday, Zi Han already

426
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,640
in such a spotlight moment,

427
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,760
Yu Xing didn’t lose just now either.

428
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,840
So, what did you play yesterday?

429
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,240
How did you feel?

430
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:07,840
Did you like it?

431
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,160
Just ask directly and openly.

432
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,360
As a girl, I think

433
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,960
it lets me feel that he cares.

434
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,760
And I wouldn’t feel uncomfortable

435
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,200
because of his questions.

436
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,280
If it were me,

437
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,840
I’d ask the same way.

438
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,480
You have to ask.

439
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,040
Yu Xing and Zi Han

440
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,320
These two guys really

441
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,880
each have their own

442
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,200
little tricks.

443
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:25,840
See,

444
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,920
Yu Xing is the type

445
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,560
who

446
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,960
takes his time for quality, right?

447
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,240
Like a slow, careful approach.

448
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,000
But when it’s Zi Han’s turn,

449
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,040
the whole logic

450
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,240
is laid out for you

451
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,160
right?

452
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,080
Step by step.

453
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:37,600
Everything is arranged

454
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,400
neatly and orderly.

455
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,040
You’d say, yes, that’s him.

456
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:40,760
Yu Xing.

457
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,760
That’s like the “Kids’ Channel.”

458
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,400
A bit slow and dull.

459
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,240
I think using your fingertips

460
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,160
is better for playing basketball.

461
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,080
But to be fair,

462
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:45,400
I think

463
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,280
the “Children’s Channel” can be fun too sometimes.

464
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,120
Yeah.

465
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,040
When I watch Yu Xing’s part,

466
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,200
I feel like it’s him.

467
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:50,800
When I watch Liu Zi Han’s part,

468
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,480
I feel like it’s him.

469
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:51,720
Right.

470
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,000
I feel like I’m splitting in two.

471
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,840
It depends if Chi Chi likes go-karting

472
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,320
or prefers basketball.

473
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,560
I think Chi Chi’s feelings for Yu Xing

474
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,240
and for Zi Han

475
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,400
are still different.

476
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,880
Her feelings for Yu Xing

477
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,080
are more instinctive.

478
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,880
Because from the very first moment,

479
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,720
she chose Yu Xing.

480
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,560
Her feelings for Zi Han

481
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,280
are probably more developed over time.

482
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,320
She was moved.

483
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,320
What I want to say is

484
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,200
many people think

485
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,200
that feelings developed over time

486
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,160
aren’t as strong as natural ones.

487
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,520
I disagree with that.

488
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,760
I think both kinds of feelings

489
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,720
are genuine.

490
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,560
For Chi Chi,

491
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,280
they’re both real.

492
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,040
I think that’s

493
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,040
so accurate.

494
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,320
That’s the

495
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,800
real feeling I get.

496
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,800
Let’s keep watching.

497
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,960
Dr. Fang is here.

498
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,960
Hello.

499
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,680
Hi.

500
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,600
Are we going over there?

501
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,200
Okay.

502
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,440
I’ve prepared paper and pens here.

503
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,560
Let’s go draw.

504
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,240
Darn it, this is so hard.

505
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Is it really hard?

506
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,440
Here’s the paper.

507
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,240
Did you prepare this paper specially?

508
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:21,800
Yes.

509
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,040
Do you want to draw something complicated or

510
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,880
just go with your mood?

511
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,360
Depends on my mood.

512
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,120
So, are you in a good or bad mood today?

513
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,280
I’m feeling okay today.

514
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,920
If I draw you ugly later,

515
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,320
don’t hit me.

516
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,040
If you draw me ugly,

517
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,720
that means

518
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,320
that’s how I am in your eyes.

519
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,640
No,

520
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,360
I’ve never had

521
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,520
any talent for drawing.

522
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,280
Do you want realism or abstract?

523
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,200
Either is fine.

524
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,200
No restrictions.

525
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,520
So happy.

526
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,680
Don't hit me later.

527
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,760
What do you mean?

528
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,360
Come on.

529
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,600
Show yours.

530
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,400
Three, two, one, together.

531
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,080
Wait a second.

532
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,600
I'm really curious to see how it looks.

533
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,840
Three, two, one.

534
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,000
It looks like...

535
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,240
Like...

536
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,320
So sweet.

537
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:23,760
Like...

538
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,280
Really?

539
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:24,960
Yes.

540
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,920
Does it have your vibe?

541
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:31,960
It does.

542
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,640
Let me see what you drew.

543
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,640
Don't hide it.

544
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,040
This one?

545
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,880
This is the real one.

546
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,840
So cute.

547
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,680
This one is cuter.

548
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,720
Getting compliments now.

549
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,200
Okay, I didn't really want to draw.

550
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,400
I just wanted to see you.

551
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,880
It really feels like we're a couple.

552
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,720
What are you doing? Spacing out?

553
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,400
I want to ask you something.

554
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,480
Go ahead.

555
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,160
Back on that little island,

556
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,280
you requested a song.

557
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,400
The last one you mentioned was "Ten Years".

558
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,160
Why was that?

559
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,400
Didn't you hum it in the car before?

560
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,160
It left such a deep impression.

561
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,440
This kind of delayed romance is really romantic.

562
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,960
Ten years later, we're still friends.

563
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,520
We can still say hello.

564
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,440
It's just that kind of tenderness.

565
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,600
What do you want to hear?

566
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,760
"Ten Years"?

567
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,560
I like it.

568
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,160
Darn it.

569
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,320
I'm about to cry.

570
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,840
That was unexpected.

571
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,680
It's really touching.

572
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,840
And it takes a long time.

573
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,440
To ask like this.

574
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,280
So that's it.

575
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,160
Starting from the next day,

576
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,680
I started to notice.

577
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,560
I'm really about to cry.

578
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,360
Because I feel like I've never...

579
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,160
I'm not going home today.

580
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,560
I'm chatting with my mom.

581
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,840
I said I...

582
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,320
I'm talking to my mom about my dad.

583
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,320
My dad's way of raising me since I was little was

584
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,320
not really caring about what I said.

585
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,160
And it gradually turned into

586
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,040
if I had any needs,

587
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,200
I wouldn't tell anyone.

588
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,240
Whatever I wanted,

589
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,160
I had to

590
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,160
fight for it myself.

591
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,800
Then I said,

592
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,960
I always thought

593
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,000
it was supposed to be like that.

594
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,840
But after coming to the cabin, I realized

595
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,240
there are actually many people

596
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,560
who care about what I say.

597
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:20,960
It's just...

598
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,640
People who care about you really do care.

599
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,240
Turns out someone cared about me so early on.

600
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,920
Always cared about me.

601
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,720
I feel like you...

602
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,600
When we're alone and

603
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,720
when you're with everyone,

604
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,960
you're like two different people.

605
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,840
When I first met you,

606
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,000
I thought you were just

607
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,600
an optimist.

608
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,160
And then?

609
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:55,600
Go on.

610
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,960
Well,

611
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,040
Maybe it started

612
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,760
When did it begin?

613
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,200
Maybe during the little train ride.

614
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,480
I just felt

615
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,920
our conversation was pretty deep.

616
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,720
And I think you're a very

617
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,240
thoughtful person.

618
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,040
It feels like nowadays

619
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,280
thoughtful people are rare.

620
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,080
Someone who really listens to others.

621
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:15,920
That quality

622
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,240
is hard to find.

623
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,960
Lu Yuan keeps saying

624
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,120
you're very thoughtful.

625
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,600
You have deep conversations.

626
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,480
You're good at this and that.

627
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,760
Everyone needs affirmation.

628
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,240
Why are you so thoughtful?

629
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,680
Don't you ever wonder about that?

630
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,240
That's it.

631
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,480
If you care about it yourself,

632
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,720
you'll remember it more.

633
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,440
Yeah.

634
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,560
Why are you still...

635
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,440
Acting all shy with me.

636
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,680
Still doing this.

637
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,840
This is probably the most

638
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,280
romantic thing he can say.

639
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,320
The boldest words.

640
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,440
Do you know why?

641
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,440
He only dares to say it like this.

642
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:56,720
Yeah.

643
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,520
You're really shy.

644
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:07,880
Teacher Lechen,

645
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,120
can you cook chicken?

646
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:09,800
Yes.

647
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,760
I want to eat chicken.

648
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,960
Make your best chicken dish.

649
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,880
Shredded chicken.

650
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,520
Great, you can make shredded chicken.

651
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,920
So can you start making it now?

652
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,800
Shredded chicken.

653
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,560
Sure.

654
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,880
Let me put something down.

655
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,960
I like sunflowers.

656
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,720
I want to pick sunflowers.

657
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,880
I want sunflowers too.

658
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,480
Artwork.

659
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,320
Now that's art.

660
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,600
Right?

661
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,560
Beautiful.

662
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,160
Very much your

663
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:31,720
style.

664
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,360
Really, what else can you make?

665
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,800
I really want to order.

666
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:35,960
I don't know.

667
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,920
You go first.

668
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,560
Fish.

669
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,760
What kind of fish?

670
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,360
Perch.

671
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,480
Perch.

672
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,040
Hello.

673
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,800
Perfect timing.

674
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,800
I brought fish too.

675
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,800
What kind?

676
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,280
Perch.

677
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,080
All my friends say

678
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:51,800
if you talk to me, you'll find

679
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,040
if you talk to me, you'll find

680
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,280
I'm actually like a hedgehog.

681
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,480
Why a sheep?

682
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,880
Actually,

683
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,720
I'm telling you not to be a hedgehog.

684
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,080
Okay.

685
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,800
Sheep have horns too.

686
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,040
They're not totally harmless.

687
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,680
They can bravely protect themselves, but

688
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,680
I hope you can be like a little sheep.

689
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:16,760
Okay.

690
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,320
Alright.

691
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,640
Done.

692
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,320
I really can't sleep tonight.

693
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,200
Why?

694
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,480
Your "Ten Years"

695
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,680
really hit me.

696
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,800
I'm dizzy from what you said.

697
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,720
What are you doing?

698
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,480
Is that necessary?

699
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,040
It is.

700
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,760
The key is you.

701
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,080
Didn't you do the same?

702
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,680
So I think a lot of times

703
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,440
these things need feedback.

704
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,400
It's mutual.

705
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,760
That's nice.

706
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,920
I'm so touched.

707
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,160
You're easily moved, aren't you?

708
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,760
I really fall for this.

709
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,920
Any activities?

710
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,800
What activities do you want?

711
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I'm so bored.

712
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,120
Find somewhere it doesn't rain.

713
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,440
I really want to have some fun.

714
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,480
Do you want to go out?

715
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,640
I want to go out.

716
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,920
I want to go out.

717
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,160
Let's go out for a bit.

718
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,640
What should we do?

719
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:29,960
Let's go.

720
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,400
What?

721
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,440
Where are you going? Just taking a walk?

722
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:44,840
Go.

723
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,680
Go.

724
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:48,960
Go travel.

725
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,160
Go travel.

726
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,720
Really?

727
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,520
He’s going to get that.

728
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,720
The one from the beginning.

729
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,240
It has to be mutual.

730
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,080
That’s the rule.

731
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,000
This part needs two people, both ways.

732
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:03,800
"Light up"

733
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,560
After "lighting up,"

734
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,680
you can go travel.

735
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,480
Really?

736
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,040
Wait, is that true?

737
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,080
Go travel.

738
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,640
Is that for real?

739
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,080
Write a wish.

740
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,520
Write a wish.

741
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,480
What wish should I write?

742
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,240
If right now

743
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,440
you’ve made up your mind,

744
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,040
please write their name.

745
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:46,960
I’ll write first.

746
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,400
Go somewhere it doesn’t rain.

747
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,400
This is the biggest goosebumps I’ve ever had.

748
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:18,840
I’m not writing your name.

749
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,360
(It even) got washed away.

750
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,480
Is it me?

751
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,200
I want to go somewhere it doesn’t rain.

752
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,440
"Lit up."

753
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,280
So it’s done.

754
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:02,840
Super pretty.

755
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,800
What did you say?

756
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:05,960
I said,

757
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,160
the fireworks are beautiful.

758
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,640
Yes, they’re beautiful.

759
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
We came up.

760
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,400
The windmill is spinning.

761
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,560
The windmill is spinning.

762
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,320
Someone took the (trial romance trip).

763
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,480
Someone took the (trial romance trip).

764
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,960
I know who it is.

765
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,200
They set off fireworks.

766
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,520
Go down and take a look.

767
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,400
The others are confused.

768
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,760
Everyone’s confused.

769
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,880
The first couple for the "trial romance trip."

770
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,280
This feels amazing.

771
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,920
So pretty.

772
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,000
So pretty.

773
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,440
Copy me.

774
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,360
So romantic.

775
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,080
So romantic.

776
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,840
It’s official now.

777
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:57,680
The brave ones.

778
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,200
Enjoy the world first.

779
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,480
The bracelet, right?

780
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,120
Yes.

781
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,160
Puppy.

782
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:09,840
Looks nice.

783
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,120
How do you take it apart?

784
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:15,680
How did you take it off?

785
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,320
So "dumb."

786
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,080
"Dummy."

787
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,120
Which hand do you wear it on?

788
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:26,520
This one.

789
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,320
So sweet.

790
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,800
Looks so good.

791
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,800
So romantic.

792
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,560
Really romantic.

793
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:51,800
Thank you.

794
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,120
Impressive.

795
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,280
Of course.

796
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,440
We just don’t play by the rules.

797
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,960
Awesome.

798
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,200
Take a look.

799
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,840
Who is this?

800
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,760
Who is this?

801
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,320
What is it?

802
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,920
Turns out I'm the witness.

803
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,080
Watch the fireworks closely.

804
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,360
Did you come up because of the fireworks?

805
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,120
Yes.

806
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:31,600
Yeah, we were playing ball.

807
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,320
The lights went out while we were playing.

808
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,480
That's great.

809
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,760
So cool.

810
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,440
Really cool.

811
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,320
The thing is, we were all still confused.

812
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,120
We hadn't reacted yet.

813
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,760
Just caught up in everyone guessing.

814
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,800
That's how love is.

815
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,280
Yeah.

816
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,400
That's youth.

817
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,560
That's just how it is.

818
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,880
You need to be impulsive.

819
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,440
You know, when the fireworks go off instantly.

820
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,520
It felt like watching a meteor shower.

821
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,640
Romantic.

822
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,440
So where are you going?

823
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,560
Where do you want to go?

824
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,840
I'm asking where you want to go.

825
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,840
I want to go somewhere it doesn't rain.

826
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:03,880
That's enough.

827
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,320
There's a bracelet inside.

828
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,400
What are you doing?

829
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,880
It feels like Yuxing is always serious.

830
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,000
It's a bracelet.

831
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,440
What do you mean?

832
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,240
How about listening

833
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,000
to your story?

834
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,760
No story.

835
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,320
Can you recreate it?

836
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,560
It was when we decided to go

837
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,400
and start the trial love cabin.

838
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,000
Everyone got curious.

839
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,560
How did it happen?

840
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,440
How did it happen? I want to know.

841
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:37,880
Ask him.

842
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,680
I don't know.

843
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,480
Because I want to go somewhere it doesn't rain.

844
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:47,760
Wait a second.

845
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,200
There's a message.

846
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,520
Is it for me?

847
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,520
What does it say?

848
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,320
Can you share it?

849
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:57,760
Can we see it?

850
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,520
Can you share it?

851
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,640
Pack your bags right away.

852
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,560
Head to the airport.

853
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,520
Yili.

854
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,600
Sayram Lake.

855
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,480
Sayram Lake.

856
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,200
Sayram Lake.

857
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,320
Go to Sayram Lake.

858
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,040
This.

859
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,600
Go to Sayram Lake.

860
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,440
I'm going the day after tomorrow.

861
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,600
Sayram Lake.

862
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,000
But with them,

863
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,320
the timeline

864
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:15,920
isn't the same.

865
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,400
You thought

866
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,840
you could still see them?

867
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,600
Yeah, I'm going the day after tomorrow.

868
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,440
This too

869
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,000
is so enviable.

870
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,520
Pack your bags now.

871
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,360
Sayram Lake is stunning.

872
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:31,960
Now.

873
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,880
That's now.

874
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,960
Go pack now.

875
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,240
Pack up right now.

876
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,520
Xinjiang welcomes you.

877
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,200
I really want a group photo.

878
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,280
I can.

879
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,720
Can we put the camera on that?

880
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,520
Then set the timer.

881
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,440
Set a timer.

882
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:48,720
Wait a second.

883
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,640
Let me adjust it.

884
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,320
Save a spot for Jiao, let's

885
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,040
Hurry, ten seconds.

886
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,000
I'll pose with you.

887
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,520
So happy.

888
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,440
Let's go.

889
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,240
Let's go.

890
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,240
I'm going to pack.

891
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,080
I have something.

892
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,520
I have something.

893
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,560
What is it?

894
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,240
I'm afraid you'll really leave.

895
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,280
I prepared some small gifts for everyone.

896
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,000
These are group blind boxes.

897
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,040
It means we're a whole group.

898
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,360
Exactly twelve people.

899
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:55,400
And each pair makes a team.

900
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,800
That's the idea of this group.

901
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,720
When we open them later,

902
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,720
we can compare.

903
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,280
See who got what.

904
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,800
Thank you.

905
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,640
Thanks.

906
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,000
There's also a little note inside.

907
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,280
It's a message for everyone.

908
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,320
But it's random too.

909
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,480
Why do we have to give gifts?

910
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,960
I hate this part the most.

911
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,360
Duoduo.

912
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,160
Really hate this part.

913
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,480
Actually, it's true.

914
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,000
Maybe it's about the journey here.

915
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,920
I think so too.

916
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,760
Maybe there's nothing more.

917
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,760
Like, staying here any longer.

918
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,040
So I feel

919
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,520
I'm glad to have met everyone.

920
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,640
I might be leaving tomorrow.

921
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,640
No way.

922
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,280
Yeah.

923
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,120
I understand.

924
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,920
It's because of Ruilong.

925
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,400
She doesn't have anyone else.

926
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,040
No one she likes.

927
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:17,920
So,

928
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,680
it's fine, I'm happy.

929
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,160
I'm just leaving a bit earlier than everyone.

930
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,480
Back to real life.

931
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,920
We'll meet again after this.

932
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:32,600
Okay?

933
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,200
My roommate.

934
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,080
Let me give you a hug.

935
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,560
Stay happy.

936
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,480
I'll always support you.

937
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,920
Have fun on your trip.

938
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,120
I thought you'd be alone tonight.

939
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,000
Turns out you're leaving me here alone.

940
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,080
Remember to visit me.

941
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,000
Disposable gloves.

942
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:44,440
Yeah.

943
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,120
Here.

944
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,440
With so many dishes, we'll need garlic for sure.

945
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:49,920
That's nice.

946
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,520
Did you hurt yourself?

947
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,440
Just a little, no big deal.

948
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,640
I have some.

949
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,480
Bandages, do you want one?

950
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,840
Want to talk?

951
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:03,360
Let's talk.

952
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,920
I saw you were upset.

953
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,360
I don't want you to be sad.

954
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,200
I bought some fruit.

955
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,360
Grab some snacks, have a bite.

956
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,560
Pick one.

957
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,040
Babe, you're so pretty.

958
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,000
Super cool.

959
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,080
Okay, last one.

960
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,280
I've already had three.

961
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,640
We have some marinated snacks here.

962
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,680
You can have them all.

963
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,920
Wang Jue did an amazing job.

964
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,680
Everyone here is great.

965
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:59,280
Did you notice?

966
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,240
Everyone's really nice.

967
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,640
She gives quietly.

968
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,160
She's not the type to say it out loud.

969
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:03,480
Yeah.

970
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,880
Even though I didn't find love,

971
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,280
I made some great

972
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:07,960
friends.

973
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,040
These friendships

974
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:20,680
Take care.

975
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,480
Okay.

976
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,120
Don't cry.

977
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:25,920
Alright.

978
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,080
Okay.

979
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,760
It's okay.

980
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,280
Take care.

981
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,720
Okay, pick quickly.

982
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,560
We've been wrapping for so long today.

983
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,360
Hurry up, why does it feel so low-energy?

984
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,160
I'll take this one then.

985
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,640
It looks nice on display too.

986
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:44,720
I really like it.

987
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,960
I wanted to give everyone my favorite.

988
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:47,680
Right?

989
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,480
Is it about the color?

990
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,600
I don't know either.

991
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,560
If you haven't opened it at all,

992
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:52,160
I have no idea.

993
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,280
It's about fate.

994
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,240
It's about fate.

995
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,280
Wang Jue is really nice.

996
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,080
I really want to open it.

997
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,520
The bottom part is transparent.

998
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,440
Sagittarius

999
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,840
This really suits you.

1000
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,200
This one suits you well.

1001
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,120
This is so cute.

1002
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,800
There's another saying here.

1003
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:25,880
I see it.

1004
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,200
Talk about what you love.

1005
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,040
The best way

1006
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,640
is to speak of it gently.

1007
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,880
May our lives not just follow the lines,

1008
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,280
but soar to the land of freedom.

1009
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,080
Not bad.

1010
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,160
Mine is also uncomfortable.

1011
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,880
This was my New Year's Eve

1012
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,200
social media caption.

1013
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,040
Really?

1014
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,960
It suits Duoduo right now.

1015
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,960
Fate is truly a bit magical.

1016
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,120
May we outside the cabin

1017
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,240
all have good weather.

1018
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,080
How is it?

1019
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:10,440
Yes.

1020
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:11,000
It matches.

1021
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:11,560
It matches.

1022
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:12,680
It matches.

1023
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:13,960
That's amazing.

1024
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,840
This feels just like opening that...

1025
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,760
like flipping through the Book of Answers.

1026
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,680
Everything matches.

1027
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:19,760
It really does.

1028
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,480
She wants to go somewhere it doesn't rain.

1029
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:25,520
Who is the hat among the clouds?

1030
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,920
Lechen's seems to be a pair with yours.

1031
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:30,440
Is that right?

1032
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:31,720
What?

1033
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:36,080
Lechen and Duoduo

1034
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,120
drew a matching pair.

1035
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,800
So, are they a pair?

1036
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:40,640
Yes.

1037
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:41,200
Yes.

1038
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,080
Then Lechen's is a pair with yours.

1039
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,440
One, two, three, four—yes.

1040
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,080
Go.

1041
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,520
Go up. Go.

1042
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,560
Aren't you going up?

1043
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,800
You go first. I'll be right up.

1044
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,520
I want to wait for Ruilong to open it together.

1045
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,120
Let's swap one between us.

1046
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,120
This makes me want to cry. Why?

1047
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,480
That line is so cool.

1048
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,440
Let's swap one between us.

1049
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:55,480
Let's swap one between us.

1050
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,360
Really?

1051
00:49:58,680 --> 00:49:59,520
You drew it.

1052
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,800
Duoduo.

1053
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,120
She's truly a wonderful girl.

1054
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,000
The two of them are ready to set off.

1055
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:18,960
Many

1056
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:20,960
Many

1057
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:32,640
What is it?

1058
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,080
Nothing, I just want to talk to you.

1059
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:38,200
Why? What do you want to talk about?

1060
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,440
Just between us girls.

1061
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,200
I just saw this.

1062
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,320
When you changed this for me,

1063
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:52,880
I really felt a bit...

1064
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,440
You really did...

1065
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:57,400
It's just...

1066
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,360
You helped me a lot.

1067
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,320
How is that helping?

1068
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,160
Honey

1069
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,120
You make it sound like I'm amazing.

1070
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,480
It doesn't really have much to do with me.

1071
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,120
It's always wonderful between girls.

1072
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,040
I feel like

1073
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,640
What I did to you

1074
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,960
I feel really sorry for you.

1075
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,000
No

1076
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,040
I really don't want

1077
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,680
Me and my best friend

1078
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,200
to have something like this happen.

1079
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,240
From the very beginning,

1080
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,240
I wanted to talk to you about this.

1081
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:38,240
Just to clear things up.

1082
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:39,840
I just want to tell you

1083
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:40,960
how I feel.

1084
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,720
I also feel that I

1085
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:45,200
If in this situation

1086
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,520
I tell you what I think,

1087
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,200
I might still feel

1088
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,040
like I'm bothering you.

1089
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,400
No, honey.

1090
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:54,960
First of all,

1091
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,200
I think you did great.

1092
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,000
I think both of us

1093
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,440
were brave and did well.

1094
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,280
But what I want to say first is

1095
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,920
I think there's nothing between us.

1096
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,200
We don't really need to talk too much.

1097
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,280
Because there's nothing much.

1098
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:13,600
I think it's just

1099
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,360
a matter of being suitable or not.

1100
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:16,920
And whether the timing is right.

1101
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,519
I'm actually a lot like Ruilong.

1102
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,480
For me, the meaning of the cabin is also about feeling moved.

1103
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,320
If there's no spark,

1104
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,640
and no mutual effort,

1105
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,520
then the cabin doesn't mean anything.

1106
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:29,360
For me,

1107
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,880
So I really wanted to leave at that time.

1108
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:31,920
When I wrote my diary,

1109
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,520
the first entry was for you.

1110
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,760
I said I was really

1111
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,920
I said what I'm most grateful for

1112
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:42,840
is that we didn't

1113
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,440
live in the same room.

1114
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,360
I said this is

1115
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:48,960
what I'm most thankful for in the cabin.

1116
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,600
It's the thing I'm most grateful for, honey.

1117
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,320
If we had

1118
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:55,320
lived in the same room,

1119
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,120
I wouldn't know what to do.

1120
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,360
But it's also amazing

1121
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,120
You were my first roommate.

1122
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:22,800
And my only roommate.

1123
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,080
So I think it's pretty good, honey.

1124
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:51,240
And I talked with Lechen.

1125
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:52,560
He figured it out.

1126
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,120
He knows what kind of relationship he wants.

1127
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,240
Neither of us was wrong.

1128
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:58,120
You're fine too.

1129
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,800
Actually, all three of us are fine.

1130
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:03,960
I think you're a good match for him.

1131
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,880
Because I'm someone

1132
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,040
who likes to express my feelings.

1133
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,920
Maybe that's stressful for him.

1134
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,920
And he doesn't know what to do.

1135
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:15,000
I think you're good at handling these things.

1136
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,200
And you're a good fit.

1137
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,400
I think being a good match is important.

1138
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,160
Otherwise, two people

1139
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:24,200
Otherwise,

1140
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:25,600
will both feel bad.

1141
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,040
Right?

1142
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:26,960
So I think

1143
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,040
You both have feelings for each other.

1144
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:29,880
The timing is right.

1145
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:30,840
And you're a good match.

1146
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,960
I don't think it affects

1147
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,200
us being good friends.

1148
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:52,360
So

1149
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,560
I don't feel any pressure, honey.

1150
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:01,880
Because in my eyes,

1151
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,200
you're really like a little sister.

1152
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,200
Just like a sister.

1153
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,920
I know you're a great person.

1154
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,880
You brought me flowers on the first day.

1155
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,720
And fruit on the second day.

1156
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:22,160
I didn't even know how to respond.

1157
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,560
You're really brave.

1158
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:46,920
That's wonderful.

1159
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:02,400
It's okay, dear.

1160
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,600
When you're in Hangzhou,

1161
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:04,760
I can still be

1162
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,920
your caring big sister, sweetheart.

1163
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,760
I've always thought

1164
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,200
you should meet

1165
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,840
a really good guy.

1166
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,000
Only someone like that deserves

1167
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,280
your courage and honesty.

1168
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:39,480
You talked to me

1169
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:40,920
because you were worried I'd be upset, right?

1170
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,040
I'm sorry.

1171
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,560
There's nothing to be sorry for.

1172
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,280
Feelings aren't always logical.

1173
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,080
It's all about emotions and fate.

1174
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,960
Really, there's nothing to apologize for.

1175
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,880
Feelings go both ways.

1176
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,760
You reach his heart,

1177
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,800
and he reaches yours, then you can be together.

1178
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:11,640
It just means

1179
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,560
my signals and his signals

1180
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:14,560
just aren't compatible.

1181
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,040
Here they come.

1182
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,360
Hello, everyone.

1183
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:20,880
Don't cry.

1184
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,240
Why are you crying?

1185
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,640
I cry for you, then for her.

1186
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:26,880
I'm always shedding tears.

1187
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,720
I've cried out all the water in my brain.

1188
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,920
When we saw the fireworks today,

1189
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,640
we were amazed.

1190
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:40,040
But they were beautiful.

1191
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:41,120
So brave.

1192
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,080
The fireworks were stunning.

1193
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,560
I'm truly happy for you, really.

1194
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:48,320
But I can't bear to leave you all.

1195
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,320
Without us,

1196
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,840
just the two of us,

1197
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,720
both of us at the same time

1198
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,640
will leave this room.

1199
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:58,120
What are we doing?

1200
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,600
Yesterday I comforted you both.

1201
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,240
Today you two comfort me.

1202
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:04,000
And the three of us are still on the same island.

1203
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,800
That's how fate works, it's amazing.

1204
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:06,840
It's really nice.

1205
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,280
I'm almost used to it now.

1206
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:10,400
Feels like this is my dorm life.

1207
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,600
I feel like when I come back, there'll be no one to talk to.

1208
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:14,800
I don't know what to do.

1209
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:23,040
Cheer up.

1210
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,320
Sayram Lake is beautiful.

1211
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:27,320
Sayram Lake is beautiful.

1212
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:28,600
Take lots of photos.

1213
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:29,840
Take lots of photos.

1214
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:30,360
Yeah.

1215
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,000
Because with traveling,

1216
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,800
the older you get, the fewer chances you have.

1217
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:34,840
You can just go whenever you want.

1218
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,000
This is the best time for you.

1219
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,680
No academic pressure.

1220
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:38,400
And then,

1221
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:41,560
when everything settles down,

1222
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:44,040
if there's nothing going on during winter or summer break,

1223
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:44,920
let's go out and have fun.

1224
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:45,560
Okay?

1225
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:53,800
Between girls,

1226
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:54,280
friendship

1227
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:55,560
especially at times like this,

1228
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:56,880
it's good to talk things out.

1229
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:57,720
Yeah.

1230
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,120
I think she wanted to

1231
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:01,440
talk to Duoduo for a while.

1232
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,520
It's been some time.

1233
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:03,280
In the room,

1234
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:03,920
she said,

1235
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,640
"I feel like between Duoduo and me,

1236
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,160
our relationship has

1237
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:08,520
changed subtly."

1238
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:11,200
She just said,

1239
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,880
why choose this moment

1240
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:15,040
to talk to Duoduo.

1241
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,440
She was worried that earlier,

1242
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,320
if she talked to her,

1243
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:19,560
it might affect Duoduo's decision.

1244
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:20,360
Right.

1245
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,000
It's about respect between girls,

1246
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,120
or caring for each other.

1247
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:25,640
It's really touching.

1248
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,520
If she had spoken up back then,

1249
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:28,520
then Duoduo

1250
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:30,560
might not have been brave.

1251
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,400
It could have affected her own judgment.

1252
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,400
But she waited until now,

1253
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,280
until she herself

1254
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,520
found her own answer.

1255
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:38,080
The most suitable moment.

1256
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:39,400
That's when she talked to her.

1257
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,320
I'm really grateful to Duoduo.

1258
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:43,080
Because Duoduo

1259
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:43,920
said, "Let me swap with you (blind box)."

1260
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,960
It made Yuanyuan and Lechen

1261
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:47,240
feel no

1262
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:48,080
burden.

1263
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:48,480
What burden?

1264
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:49,000
Yeah.

1265
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
They could go without worries

1266
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,880
and fully enjoy their trip.

1267
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:53,520
All of this is because

1268
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:54,960
Duoduo did this.

1269
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,720
That's why there's this

1270
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,480
feeling of pure happiness.

1271
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,440
So I think they're all

1272
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,960
perfect, like 120 out of 100.

1273
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,360
Really great.

1274
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:06,880
Jue also, in her own way,

1275
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,280
expressed

1276
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:09,840
how she should

1277
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,320
face a better life ahead.

1278
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:12,480
Yes.

1279
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,400
Also,

1280
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,640
in her own

1281
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:15,880
Heartwarming Cabin,

1282
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:16,960
she drew

1283
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,320
a loving ending.

1284
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:22,160
These are the friends

1285
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,280
I met this summer.

1286
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:25,280
A group of friends'

1287
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:25,880
joys and sorrows,

1288
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:26,800
I can feel them all.

1289
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:27,640
I just feel

1290
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,360
truly happy.

1291
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:35,040
Should we bring some mosquito spray?

1292
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:35,400
Definitely,

1293
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:35,880
we should.

1294
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:37,080
There will be lots of mosquitoes.

1295
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:38,360
You're leaving right away,

1296
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:39,480
so you must not be prepared.

1297
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:42,600
They're really brave.

1298
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,280
They're the type who just go when they say so.

1299
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,880
They flew out in the middle of the night.

1300
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:49,880
Alright.

1301
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:52,200
Let's go.

1302
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,480
Go, I'll walk you down.

1303
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:54,560
We haven't left yet.

1304
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:55,640
We're not even at the door.

1305
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,320
Enough talk, let's go.

1306
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:08,760
"Queen" takes the lead.

1307
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:11,840
Let's go.

1308
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:12,840
Go ahead.

1309
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:14,560
Go for it!

1310
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:15,360
Go for it!

1311
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:16,840
Have fun.

1312
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:18,000
Bye.

1313
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:18,320
Bye.

1314
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:20,240
Bye.

1315
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:20,880
Bye.

1316
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,280
Remember to sleep on the way.

1317
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:24,280
Guaranteed to sleep.

1318
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:25,400
Guaranteed to sleep.

1319
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:28,480
Praying for no rain in Yili for you.

1320
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:29,600
All sunny days.

1321
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:31,920
Give me the suitcase.

1322
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:36,280
See you later.

1323
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:36,880
Okay.

1324
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:40,960
Finally.

1325
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:42,800
Let me give you a hug.

1326
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:46,480
Alright, I'll wait for you to come back.

1327
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:47,120
Okay.

1328
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,320
I haven't talked enough with you.

1329
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:53,640
Let's chat more when you return.

1330
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:55,400
Talk for three days and nights.

1331
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:57,160
Won't sleep when you come back.

1332
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:58,040
No more sleep.

1333
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:01,800
I've got a little surprise for you.

1334
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:03,880
Pick a flavor first.

1335
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:06,280
Based on your mood now.

1336
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:08,960
I'll choose Master Kong Jasmine Honey Tea.

1337
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:09,880
Sure.

1338
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:11,880
I'll make you a special blend.

1339
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:19,080
It'll be ready soon.

1340
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,120
Here.

1341
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:22,800
Yours.

1342
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:23,640
"Mo Mo Loves You."

1343
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:24,480
"Mo Mo Loves You."

1344
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:25,960
Thank you.

1345
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:27,560
You can smell it as soon as you pick it up.

1346
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:28,680
Full of jasmine fragrance.

1347
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:34,000
Jasmine flower and tea aroma.

1348
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,160
Blended just right.

1349
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:36,640
So refreshing and delicious.

1350
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:37,600
You're really good at mixing.

1351
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:38,600
Of course.

1352
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:39,960
I've got lots of recipes.

1353
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,600
I'll make them for you slowly in the future.

1354
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:42,520
Okay.

1355
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:46,040
It's too sweet.

1356
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,680
"Lighting up" really is different.

1357
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:50,120
I really want to feel it.

1358
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,440
Their sweetness right now.

1359
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:52,120
Come on, everyone.

1360
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:53,720
Let's have a sip too.

1361
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:55,960
Master Kong Jasmine Honey Tea.

1362
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:56,720
Cheers.

1363
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,160
Cheers.

1364
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,280
Jasmine fragrance hits you.

1365
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:01,280
And a sweet aftertaste.

1366
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,320
It's truly the taste of falling in love.

1367
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:12,360
Can't wait to send me off.

1368
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:14,800
That's how I see it.

1369
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:16,240
Get in the car.

1370
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:16,600
Go.

1371
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:17,080
Go.

1372
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:17,960
Bye.

1373
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:18,360
Bye.

1374
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:19,320
Have fun, bye.

1375
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,440
Bye.

1376
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:22,040
Bye.

1377
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:26,160
See you in a couple of days.

1378
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:26,760
I'll be back.

1379
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:28,200
Coming back.

1380
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:30,720
Bye.

1381
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,360
Bye.

1382
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:34,880
We're heading out now.

1383
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,760
This feeling is just what I want, so cool.

1384
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:38,920
A trip where you leave as soon as you decide.

1385
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:58,560
This episode was amazing.

1386
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:00,040
So great.

1387
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:03,000
Everything was just right.

1388
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:04,280
The best arrangement.

1389
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:04,560
Yes.

1390
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:06,760
Our mutual "spark" couples will

1391
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:08,960
enter a new stage of romance.

1392
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,240
At the end of the trip,

1393
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:10,960
they'll have

1394
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:12,720
a moment just for the two of them,

1395
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:13,840
to decide

1396
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:16,240
whether to become a couple—

1397
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,280
the ultimate confession.

1398
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,440
Next week,

1399
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,280
we'll have the apartment's

1400
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:27,000
final trip date.

1401
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,480
Will everyone seize

1402
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:30,000
the opportunity?

1403
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,520
We also send our best wishes

1404
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,960
to Ruilong and Wang Jue.

1405
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,520
And once again, best wishes to everyone.

1406
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,600
When jasmine blooms, it's a sign of love.

1407
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:40,320
This show is sponsored by

1408
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:43,040
Kang Shifu Jasmine Tea, with floral aroma and fresh taste.

1409
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,200
Title sponsor.

1410
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,840
Extra reality show content every Thursday at noon.

1411
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:48,880
Unlock more clues to romance.

1412
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,680
Fridays and Saturdays at noon,

1413
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:51,920
watch love unfold with us.

1414
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:54,000
The Heartbeat Family's cross-season collaboration.

1415
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,360
Enjoy all the sweet moments with us.

1416
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:56,960
Go to Tencent Video Caocangdi

1417
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:59,480
to get the same romantic merch as the guests.

1418
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:02,880
See you all next time.

1419
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:46,480
Heartbeat Apartment

1420
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,480
The final long-distance date is coming up.

1421
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:50,400
This is the last time.

1422
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,840
There will be two one-on-one pairs.

1423
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:55,120
And one two-on-two group.

1424
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:58,160
I'm definitely choosing this.

1425
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,000
I've made up my mind.

1426
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:02,280
Then I'll go with you.

1427
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:04,360
Let's talk about it.

1428
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:06,280
What about these two?

1429
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:09,000
Let's see what they say.

1430
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:09,480
What do you mean?

1431
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:10,800
It might be hard for us.

1432
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,480
I don't think we can compromise.

1433
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:13,320
The rule is actually

1434
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:14,720
meant for everyone to discuss.

1435
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:16,000
Does the order of choosing matter?

1436
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,080
There needs to be a condition.

1437
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:17,680
I don't have any condition.

1438
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:18,480
So, does it matter or not?

1439
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:20,400
Nice, well done.

1440
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:21,520
Yuxing did great.

1441
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,320
He was really determined this time.

1442
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:30,840
Everyone looks beautiful.

1443
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:32,280
Yuxing, come here.

1444
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:33,520
Hello.

1445
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:36,160
Lanlan.

1446
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:37,160
Hello.

1447
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:39,160
Hello.

1448
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:42,720
Let's go.

1449
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:44,560
What's going on?

1450
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:47,680
It has to be you.

1451
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:48,760
Call out one.

1452
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:50,120
What do you want to call out?

1453
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:51,760
You call out something, I'll call out something.

1454
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:54,000
Or you could just yell "ah."

1455
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:00,000
Wang Lechen.

1456
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,320
Yesterday when you asked me to make a heart,

1457
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:06,800
you took the heart away.

1458
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,560
Are you a sensitive and suspicious boy?

1459
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:11,440
My eyes.

1460
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:12,720
What is it?

1461
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:13,640
Did a mosquito get in?

1462
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:15,960
You said you

1463
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:17,640
don't want others to

1464
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:18,760
do things like that to you.

1465
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:20,040
Do you understand sarcasm?

1466
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:28,200
So that's how it happened.

1467
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:29,840
We should be the first to know.

1468
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,240
Can't stand even a little.

1469
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:33,680
Stop it.

1470
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:35,000
Don't.

1471
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:36,920
I'm laughing so hard I'm crying.

1472
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:39,120
No way.

1473
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:40,520
I'm leaving first.

1474
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:41,720
No one can escape.

1475
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:42,720
Just laugh.

1476
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:46,160
Chen Ge keeps a lot of things

1477
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:47,040
in his heart.

1478
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:48,160
Because Chen Ge told me

1479
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:51,240
Baby.

1480
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,560
No, you comforted me.

1481
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:55,760
I don't want to hear it.

1482
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:57,600
It's okay, it's okay.

1483
01:09:58,040 --> 01:09:59,320
Summer is still going on.

1484
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:01,520
We have more than just one summer.

1485
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,120
It's my first time on "Watching Heartbeat with You."

1486
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,400
Crying and laughing at the same time.

1487
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:06,960
I feel like tonight

1488
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,680
so much has happened.

1489
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:10,920
Everyone ended up crying equally.
