1
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:49,840
Here they come.

2
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:50,840
I'm really looking forward to this.

3
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,480
This is so cool.

4
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,520
Hello.

5
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,000
So beautiful.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,960
Long time no see.

7
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,200
That sentence has multiple meanings.

8
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:57,920
You still have a chance to choose.

9
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,720
Actually, you can switch.

10
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,160
If I don't choose, I'll just sit here.

11
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,720
She's determined to sit across from him.

12
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,080
Silly smile.

13
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,200
Silly smile.

14
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,280
There's a signal being sent.

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,680
Did you notice there are still two seats left?

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,480
Are there really going to be more people coming?

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,720
Who arrived?

18
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,520
Hello, everyone.

19
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,440
Hello.

20
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,840
So soon?

21
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,000
The exciting part is here.

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,920
There's an empty seat here.

23
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,840
She wants to sit next to Jin Yuxing.

24
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,080
My name is Sun Hanqing.

25
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:22,720
Han as in "cultivation."

26
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,440
Qing as in "clear water."

27
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,080
And everyone can call me Chichi.

28
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:25,720
Chichi (Sun Hanqing).

29
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,200
That's right.

30
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,640
Because I love to eat.

31
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,360
There are cards.

32
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,840
This is always the most exciting moment.

33
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,680
Then let's switch seats.

34
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,640
Come on.

35
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,080
This shot

36
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,040
a battlefield

37
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,520
Tell me something you regret

38
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,200
What is it?

39
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,240
I sent the message too slowly

40
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,960
Are you satisfied with where you're sitting right now?

41
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,520
Why?

42
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,480
I'm satisfied

43
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,320
Because there's someone I want to get to know

44
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,320
sitting next to me

45
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,120
Let me do it

46
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,680
Or should we do it?

47
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,320
Let me do it

48
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,680
I really can do it

49
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,200
No

50
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,040
I really can do it

51
00:01:59,280 --> 00:01:59,520
No

52
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,400
It's fine, give it to me

53
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:02,560
No

54
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,120
Let us do it

55
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,640
No

56
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,480
It's fine

57
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:07,680
Can we

58
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,600
reveal our professions now?

59
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,320
Here we go.

60
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:09,760
Take a guess, everyone.

61
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,720
Go ahead and guess, everyone.

62
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,640
Something medical.

63
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,520
Radio.

64
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,120
Soccer.

65
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,000
Gaming.

66
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,240
I'm apprenticing at a traditional Chinese medicine hospital.

67
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,240
I'm studying acupuncture.

68
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,360
I can't tell.

69
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,240
Ophthalmologist.

70
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,000
Really?

71
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,160
Yes.

72
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,240
So my laser eye surgery

73
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,360
can I let you do it?

74
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,080
Let me practice on you first.

75
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,000
I told you two to slow down.

76
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,760
At this moment, the little animals are helping out.

77
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,040
Here it comes.

78
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,480
When jasmine blooms, it's a sign of a heartbeat.

79
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,280

Welcome, all Heartbeat Cupids

118
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,200
This week

119
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,040
we will also welcome

120
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,880
the first date

121
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,160
Let's take a moment to recall

122
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,160
what we did last week

123
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,840
what we all did

124
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:33,920
Actually, I think

125
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,760
that kitchen gathering

126
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,880
left a deep impression on me

127
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:36,960
No

128
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,320
Let us

129
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:37,760
No

130
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,880
It's okay

131
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,680
Give it to me

132
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,480
I'll open it

133
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,360
It's okay

134
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:43,880
Give it to me

135
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,080
Because I think the kitchen

136
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,280
gathering was just

137
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,360
Chenchen is just

138
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,600
completely

139
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,320
the visual focal point.

140
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,240
I think that

141
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,880
Xiao Jiao and Le Chen

142
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,440
when they're in the room

143
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,280
chatting,

144
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,160
Actually, when it comes to love,

145
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,480
I think I'm

146
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,560
extremely idealistic.

147
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,200
But I'm actually rather pessimistic.

148
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,440
But I don't know why

149
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,440
this sense of inferiority, or

150
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,040
this feeling of unworthiness,

151
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,600
feels so heavy in me.

152
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,880
Because from their conversations,

153
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,040
the way they pursue girls

154
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,240
and the way they interact with others,

155
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,640
you can intuitively understand them.

156
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,560
When they have two choices,

157
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,480
it seems easier to understand

158
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,600
why they make that decision.

159
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,280
Indeed.

160
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,840
That's Lanlan.

161
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,760
And Dr. Fang.

162
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,960
There are some really cute scenes.

163
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,880
Sitting on the piano.

164
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,880
And the dog is underneath.

165
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,440
Then Dr. Fang

166
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,280
is sitting on the floor.

167
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,280
My kitten can smile.

168
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,200
It really can smile.

169
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:39,840
You don't believe me?

170
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,680
I believe you.

171
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,080
My kitten can smile too.

172
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,360
Really?

173
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:43,960
Really.

174
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,600
And then there's also the constant

175
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,000
expression of kindness

176
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,160
from Xiao Jiao.

177
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,240
I think the three of them

178
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,680
are, in my opinion,

179
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:50,800
are, I think,

180
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,320
the ones I pay the most attention to.

181
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,120
At the same time, I think

182
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,280
the last episode gave me

183
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,040
the most laughs, especially from Yuxing.

184
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,040
His abstractness,

185
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,240
his comparison with leg hair,

186
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,040
and that spinning perfume spray,

187
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,400
I really liked it.

188
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,760
The vibe this season

189
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,720
is very cute.

190
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,320
Next up,

191
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,840
we're about to welcome

192
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,920

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,400
Everyone, our heartwarming stories for this week

196
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,600
are about to begin.

197
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,040
Yifan.

198
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,600
Hello.

199
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,360
You're back.

200
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,000
Hello.

201
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's raining really hard outside.

202
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,000
Hello.

203
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,120
Hello, Wang Yifan.

204
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,400
Can we have a meal here today?

205
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,200
Wang Yifan.

206
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,120
It's raining really hard outside.

207
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,280
Eat this.

208
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,480
This is super tasty.

209
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:58,840
Try it.

210
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,640
Did you make this?

211
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,000
Le Chen made it.

212
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,320
Le Chen made it.

213
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:02,960
That's right.

214
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:03,960
It's super tasty.

215
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,800
I'll get a bowl to save some for Duoduo.

216
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,160
Tossing the wok.

217
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,040
I didn't know you could toss the wok.

218
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,720
Did you all put your bags back?

219
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,680
Then I'll go put my bag away and come back.

220
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,160
I'll go with you.

221
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,520
I just need to grab a hair clip.

222
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,480
I'm going to put my bag away.

223
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,360
Wait a moment.

224
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,040
I'll be right back after I put my bag away.

225
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,520
Okay.

226
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,520
Okay.

227
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,280
I just gave a quick heads-up.

228
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,480
I'll be right back after I put my bag away.

229
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:40,960
So cute.

230
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,600
Put down the bag.

231
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,560
Why is there a bag here?

232
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,160
There's a surprise.

233
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,520
Not this bag.

234
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,720
Who hung it up?

235
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,800
What is it?

236
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,320
Some snacks.

237
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,840
Spicy beef jerky.

238
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,640
Take a guess.

239
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,640
I can't guess.

240
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,360
I think it's Xiao Jiao.

241
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,520
He knows Lanlan

242
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,760
likes spicy food.

243
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,400
I think I kind of

244
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,520
guessed it.

245
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,280
Who is it?

246
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:32,800
When I came back yesterday,

247
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,840
Brother Jiao was here too.

248
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,840
He came to help us.

249
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,120
During the process,

250
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,680
he asked me

251
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,040
about you.

252
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,640
Your preferences.

253
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,800
You told him about beef jerky.

254
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,120
He asked me what you like to eat.

255
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,680
I said you don't seem to eat pork.

256
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,360
Then I said, but you

257
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,400
love cilantro beef.

258
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,840
And I said you also eat spicy food.

259
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,520
Let's ask him later.

260
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,440
So she guessed it was him.

261
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,560
Did you put the spicy beef here?

262
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,760
You guessed right.

263
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,560
He put a lot of thought into it.

264
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,400
Thank you.

265
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,600
Thank you.

266
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,360
This makes me really happy.

267
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:39,960
Yeah.

268
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,920
Really thoughtful.

269
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,320
I want to ask.

270
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,560
What do you think?

271
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,600
People who like you.

272
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,080
From your friends.

273
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,920
Find out information about you.

274
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,960
I think when necessary,

275
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,040
having friends help match you up

276
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,440
could be a good thing.

277
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,200
They might help out.

278
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,920
Break the awkwardness between two people.

279
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,320
Break the awkwardness between two people.

280
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,720
Or those little thoughts.

281
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,360
I think it's pretty good.

282
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,560
And you'll feel that this person

283
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,920
cares more about you.

284
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,000
Just tries every way

285
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,880
to get to know you.

286
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,000
I don't like people to matchmake.

287
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,640
To interfere with my pace.

288
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,040
Just because

289
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,600
they don't know what I feel

290
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,880
about the whole situation.

291
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,320
Even the best friend

292
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,640
still makes me feel pressured.

293
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,120
still makes me feel pressured.

294
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,480
So if that happens, I'll tell them

295
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,320
I'll handle it myself, don't worry.

296
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:31,920
Don't worry.

297
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,120
The person helping, how do they ask?

298
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,040
Or do they know both sides' situations?

299
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,240
I think this is really

300
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,200
very important.

301
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,800
Don't.

302
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,320
Went to the bathroom.

303
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,040
What's wrong?

304
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,080
Did it pee here?

305
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,640
Yes.

306
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,760
Stay.

307
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,320
So cute.

308
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,440
There's nowhere left to step.

309
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,040
You two just stay still.

310
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,200
There's so much life in Xiao Jiao's eyes.

311
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,000
Yes.

312
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,120
There should be a mop.

313
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:28,760
At the same time,

314
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,400
I'll go check.

315
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,920
If there's a mop nearby.

316
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,240
Yuxing will mop.

317
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,640
Right, because he has a dog.

318
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,800
He's experienced with this.

319
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,200
There probably isn't a mop upstairs.

320
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,240
It seems like

321
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,440
there's only one in the room.

322
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,040
Right, I'll go get it.

323
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,640
Okay.

324
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,000
It's raining outside.

325
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,560
I'll take an umbrella.

326
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,280
Yes, take an umbrella.

327
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,080
Trying hard to create chances to be alone.

328
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,800
Thank you.

329
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:18,800
Be careful.

330
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,560
It's fine, just move it your way.

331
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,000
It's okay.

332
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,040
I don't mind.

333
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,360
Get a little closer.

334
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,600
How about I do it?

335
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,600
It's fine, you hold it.

336
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,360
I'll do it.

337
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,000
Really?

338
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,880
Really, I'll do it.

339
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:32,680
Okay.

340
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,240
Then you do it.

341
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,600
Look at their hands.

342
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,720
I was just about to ask.

343
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,080
I was asking who likes rainy days.

344
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,280
You can go for a walk.

345
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,200
Turns out no one likes rainy days.

346
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,600
We also

347
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,720
brought this over.

348
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,240
Brought it.

349
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,360
So if we want to wash it, do we have to go back?

350
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,160
It seems there really isn't a place to wash here.

351
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:04,840
I don't think I saw one.

352
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,560
Yeah.

353
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:09,960
On this floor,

354
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,520
there probably isn't a restroom.

355
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,400
Or that, maybe.

356
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,320
Seems like there isn't.

357
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,320
Looks like we don't have one here.

358
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,520
Or maybe

359
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,600
just use rainwater to wash.

360
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,720
Can you do that?

361
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,320
I can.

362
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,480
Yifan is just keeping company.

363
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,120
Yeah.

364
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,040
Then,

365
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,360
I think maybe just

366
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,240
we can go back and wash up tonight.

367
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:39,960
That's it.

368
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,840
What are you doing?

369
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:43,800
Like this.

370
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,160
Yeah.

371
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,120
Just like this.

372
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:49,960
Like this.

373
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,320
Yeah.

374
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,120
Just like this.

375
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:52,760
We can

376
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,880
absorb some rainwater this way.

377
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,320
And then take it back at the end.

378
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,760
Take it back tonight and wash up.

379
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,320
Like this.

380
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,720
He

381
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,440
Can he get clean?

382
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,040
He’s really abstract.

383
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,680
So unique, my friend.

384
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,560
That works too.

385
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,640
Appreciate nature a bit.

386
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,160
Appreciate nature a bit.

387
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,280
The sound of rain is nice too.

388
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,120
The sound of rain.

389
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,200
Washed my hair while I was at it.

390
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,720
Laughing even happier now.

391
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,760
Just two people doing silly things together.

392
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,680
So abstract.

393
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,400
Let’s go.

394
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,440
But both people have to be compatible.

395
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,640
It can't just be one person.

396
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,880
You're so dumb.

397
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,000
You're really stupid.

398
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,640
This won't work then.

399
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,520
Anyway, we can't let this part

400
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,120
be seen by Mom.

401
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,800
Mom will say, "What are you

402
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,400
doing?"

403
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,560
She'll hit us with a slipper.

404
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,120
Nicole.

405
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,240
Nicole, eat your food.

406
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,640
Winnie is eating.

407
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,040
Why are you still lying down to eat?

408
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,240
She's too lazy to walk over.

409
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,400
That's nice.

410
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,080
Dr. Fang is here.

411
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,080
Dr. Fang.

412
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,200
Dr. Fang is back.

413
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,840
Who's back?

414
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,240
Hello.

415
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,640
Dr. Fang.

416
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:37,960
Have you eaten?

417
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,680
I've already eaten.

418
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,440
Why are you so late?

419
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,640
Why are you this late?

420
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,480
Because today I

421
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,760
had something

422
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,880
at home.

423
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,560
A family dinner.

424
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,720
When I came, I naturally sat next to her.

425
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,680
Then I faced her.

426
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,280
Right.

427
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,720
What are you eating?

428
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,400
The doctor is coaxing the kids.

429
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,600
I used to have one too.

430
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,400
When I was losing my baby teeth, I had one.

431
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,800
It got pulled out by this.

432
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,320
It stuck.

433
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:24,960
Yeah, it stuck.

434
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,800
I've lost teeth too.

435
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,200
I only lost half a tooth.

436
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,120
This room is so hot.

437
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,640
Is it hot?

438
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,640
Are you wearing too much?

439
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,840
Look at their outfit.

440
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,920
Take off that jacket or whatever.

441
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,000
No, I won't.

442
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,720
It's for style.

443
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,560
I feel disappointed.

444
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,800
Honestly, I feel a bit sorry.

445
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,600
Actually, I think Xiao Jiao

446
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,200
has to work hard but also relax.

447
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,240
He's like this rubber band.

448
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,440
If you keep it stretched,

449
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,720
the moment you let go,

450
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,600
when it snaps back,

451
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,000
that's when it's at its freest.

452
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,440
It's something you have to go through.

453
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,200
Yeah.

454
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,080
Speaking of relaxing,

455
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,280
where did Ruilong go?

456
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,160
He's so relaxed, no one knows where he went.

457
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,320
Do you think yesterday's was sweet

458
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,560
or is today's sweeter

459
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,120
They're both sweet

460
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,760
Everything you pick is sweet

461
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:33,560
Your mind isn't on the book at all

462
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,200
You're totally distracted from reading

463
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,200
What's wrong

464
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,040
I can't focus

465
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,520
You need to calm down to read this kind of book

466
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,360
You can't calm down right now

467
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,000
Me

468
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,880
I usually have a hard time calming down

469
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,120
My mom says I'm like

470
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,040
the bottom of a screw

471
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,280
I can't sit still

472
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,120
Can't sit still

473
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,680
You don't look like that type at all

474
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,680
You know

475
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,160
You look like a model student

476
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,160
Like that kind

477
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,800
Also a good student

478
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,240
Really

479
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,360
I'm a "bad student"

480
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,160
Not that good

481
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,200
So do you watch anime

482
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:23,680
I do

483
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,800
They always have something to talk about

484
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:26,560
Yeah

485
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,960
I watch a little

486
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:28,640
Detective Conan

487
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,200
I like Detective Conan too

488
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,600
So are you

489
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,240
a "Kaito & Ai" fan

490
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,360
or a "Shinichi & Ran" fan

491
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,120
Ran

492
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,320
Ran

493
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,600
Do you think you're an observer?

494
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,080
More than fifty percent.

495
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,360
Do you think I am?

496
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,840
You are too.

497
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,960
So what have you observed?

498
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,600
Probably about the same as you.

499
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,120
I've learned something.

500
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,040
Okay.

501
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,440
That's a good answer.

502
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,320
The way those two go back and forth, seriously...

503
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,520
It's so sweet.

504
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,800
What a subtle line.

505
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,080
About the same as you.

506
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,200
What's going on here?

507
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,320
Girls touching up their makeup is like guys putting on cologne before going out.

508
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,760
Girls touching up their makeup is like guys putting on cologne before going out.

509
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,440
It's the same thing.

510
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,360
When the girls go out, they have to...

511
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:31,880
...go all out.

512
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,080
Right.

513
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,280
Fix up hair and makeup.

514
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,400
Now I'm beautiful again.

515
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,600
I really want to know what she'll do.

516
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,520
Why, do you have something else?

517
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,200
High-performance electroluminescence.

518
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,440
Quantum dot material system development.

519
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,960
Just participated in those...

520
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,920
...science and innovation projects.

521
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,760
Didn't you have these kinds of...

522
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,840
...science competitions back then?

523
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,400
And projects like that?

524
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,640
I want to go for a walk downstairs.

525
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,160
I want to go for a walk downstairs.

526
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,360
It's pouring.

527
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,480
It's pouring.

528
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,440
What?

529
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,600
No one else understood what that meant.

530
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,600
She really mustered up the courage to say it just now.

531
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,240
She needs to be more direct.

532
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,560
Every time, Wang Jue expresses her requests

533
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,480
without specifying the subject.

534
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,800
She says it out in the open.

535
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,680
So that person knows it's about them.

536
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,760
She will gather her courage.

537
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,680
I think she will.

538
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,400
Here she comes.

539
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,120
Say something more.

540
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,320
Hurry, say it.

541
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,360
Don't go.

542
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,920
She left again, what a pity.

543
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,960
Hello, Duoduo.

544
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:16,920
Hello.

545
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,680
Duoduo is here.

546
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,640
Duoduo.

547
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,360
You're back.

548
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:25,760
See?

549
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,520
It's different.

550
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,520
With Duoduo,

551
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,840
and with Jue'er, the reactions

552
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,800
I'll head back first.

553
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,640
I really can't handle this.

554
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,840
She already gave an awkward laugh just now.

555
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,400
After she finished speaking,

556
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:49,600
she just...

557
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,120
She's really cute.

558
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,800
She said she really can't handle it.

559
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,200
This part is hilarious.

560
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,040
But I think a lot of girls can relate to her.

561
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,520
Yeah.

562
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,920
Yeah, a lot of people, really.

563
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,600
Actually, it doesn't matter if you're a guy or a girl.

564
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,600
Everyone feels this way.

565
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,200
When you're in front of someone you like,

566
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,160
you don't know how to express yourself, and then

567
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,280
the more you care, the less you know what to do.

568
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,000
Yeah.

569
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
You try really hard, but

570
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,840
it still doesn't work out.

571
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,520
There's no way to make it work.

572
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,080
It really can't be done.

573
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,840
You know, the two of them are like

574
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,840
two puzzle pieces,

575
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,560
but no matter what, they just don't fit together.

576
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,520
She won't ask, either.

577
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,360
I think she's the kind of person

578
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,760
who overthinks everything.

579
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,440
She's pretty sensitive.

580
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,840
And then lots of little unexpected things

581
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,600
all become

582
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,440
obstacles for her to reach out and invite someone.

583
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,560
Like last time, when she wanted

584
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,440
to ask someone to walk the dog,

585
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,160
Xiao Jiao showed up.

586
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,040
As soon as she saw someone there,

587
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,720
she started to avoid it.

588
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,040
She's the typical kind of person

589
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,800
who hardly ever speaks.

590
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,440
The comments will definitely

591
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:47,920
have a lot of people saying

592
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,920
Yeah, really.

593
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,400
She didn't even cry or anything.

594
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,320
She's still pretty...

595
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,240
This...

596
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,400
It's not that bad, really, it's not that bad.

597
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,520
Yeah.

598
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,080
Okay.

599
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,240
Keep your voice down.

600
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,280
Lower your voice.

601
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,040
Don't shout at girls.

602
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,200
Alright.

603
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,920
I heard you all talking and laughing.

604
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,760
So I came down to chat with everyone.

605
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,400
Hello.

606
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,320
You're back.

607
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:24,800
It's so late.

608
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,160
Yeah, it's a bit late.

609
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,680
Here we go again.

610
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,200
But the more she acts like this,

611
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,560
the cuter I find her.

612
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,280
Yeah.

613
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,680
She is pretty cute.

614
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,520
Have you all eaten?

615
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,000
It's fine, I'll go see if there's any food.

616
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,160
So it seems Chenchen is still paying attention to her.

617
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,760
Kneeling on both knees.

618
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:13,920
Duoduo is over there.

619
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,400
I'll go find her.

620
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,440
I'm going to get some more to drink.

621
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,400
What?

622
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,600
I'm going to get some more to drink.

623
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,200
Wang Jue, stop overthinking.

624
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,520
You can also check on Ruilong.

625
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:39,880
Ruilong is very cute.

626
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,840
Hi, Weini.

627
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,200
Duoduo.

628
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,000
We saved some food for you.

629
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,840
I just left a message about it.

630
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,680
Thank you.

631
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,640
Chef Wang made it.

632
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,840
Lechen made it.

633
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,000
Go eat quickly.

634
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,560
Did you all come back early today?

635
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,320
Not really.

636
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,920
Yeah, everyone just finished not long ago.

637
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,480
Okay.

638
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,920
It's on the fourth shelf from the top in the fridge.

639
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,000
Alright.

640
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,000
What is this?

641
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,800
What is this?

642
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,440
On the fourth floor

643
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,160
Is it this one?

644
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,720
Yes, it's this one.

645
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,480
Then what is this?

646
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:21,920
Duoduo

647
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,840
This is

648
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,560
This is

649
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,760
Chichi brought it back.

650
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,640
Yunnan jackfruit

651
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,440
Do you want to heat it up?

652
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,440
Is there a microwave here?

653
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:33,720
There's one over there.

654
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,320
There's one here too.

655
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,320
I'll use the microwave to heat it for you.

656
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,480
Wang Lechen

657
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,760
When interacting with Duoduo

658
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,600
He's very proactive.

659
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,240
Yes, he wants to help her heat things up.

660
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,000
As expected, there wasn't enough food cooked today.

661
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,000
Thank you.

662
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,080
It feels like today you

663
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,160
seem completely worn out.

664
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,480
A little tired.

665
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,560
Just a little.

666
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,360
Have you eaten?

667
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:07,640
No.

668
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,440
I haven't eaten at all.

669
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,560
I only had a sandwich.

670
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,560
He wants to do something.

671
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,080
That's right.

672
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,560
Are you just eating this?

673
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,240
Yes.

674
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,440
Then you...

675
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:25,920
Is there anything else?

676
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,160
Do you want to eat anything else?

677
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:28,880
He wants to make it.

678
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,520
But he's thinking about it.

679
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,800
I just made it earlier.

680
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,120
Now I have to do it again.

681
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:32,840
Yes.

682
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,560
But in the end, I think he'll do it.

683
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,560
I want to eat noodles.

684
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:37,840
We have some.

685
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,960
Make some mixed noodles.

686
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:40,920
Mixed noodles can be made.

687
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:44,960
These are noodles.

688
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,440
It's okay, baby.

689
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,440
Just eat it like this.

690
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,480
I'll cook a little for you.

691
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,760
If I cook more, I'm afraid I can't eat much.

692
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,720
Just a little, I'll cook a small portion.

693
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,200
It'll be quick, just three to five minutes.

694
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:57,720
Okay.

695
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,000
Their friendship

696
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,720
is wonderful.

697
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,520
What's wrong?

698
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,520
Are you surprised to see me?

699
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,320
What's that reaction?

700
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,440
Eat quickly.

701
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:25,920
Eat quickly.

702
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,320
You're eating with me.

703
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:29,680
I'm so happy.

704
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,160
His feelings for Yuanyuan

705
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,400
and his feelings for Duoduo

706
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,640
actually both have

707
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,600
different levels of affection.

708
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,000
I actually just want to

709
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,240
ask a few guys,

710
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,040
if you had to choose between

711
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,480
a girl who makes you feel happy

712
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,360
and comfortable,

713
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,320
and a girl who

714
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,280
you think is outstanding

715
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,320
and whom you admire,

716
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,320
which one would you choose

717
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:57,720
as your

718
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,680
life partner?

719
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,040
I would choose someone I feel relaxed with,

720
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,440
a relationship that feels like being friends.

721
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,680
Comfort is what makes it last longer.

722
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,320
Being outstanding,

723
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,760
for me, might just be a framework.

724
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,000
I want to love the person themselves.

725
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,960
Her additional qualities

726
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,480
are just extras.

727
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,760
I prefer to be with someone

728
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,920
who gets along with me well,

729
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,520
and makes me feel comfortable.

730
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,040
I think in a relationship,

731
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:23,600
maybe

732
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,800
after the passion fades,

733
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,040
the love that remains

734
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,280
might be

735
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,640
more complete.

736
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,120
And that kind of love is

737
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,920
what can last the longest.

738
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,280
Haitao

739
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,320
What I choose is

740
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,480
the first type,

741
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,640
which is lively,

742
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,520
energetic,

743
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,240
and happy people.

744
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,320
Because I have truly benefited from this.

745
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,320
Her happiness

746
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,760
can be passed on and

747
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,520
brighten those around her,

748
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,040
every single person.

749
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,520
So people like this,

750
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,160
I always feel

751
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,520
being with her

752
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,440
is very free

753
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,320
and enjoyable.

754
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,360
I'm actually quite similar to you.

755
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,120
This person

756
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,320
gives you energy,

757
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,560
makes you happy and relaxed.

758
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,400
You feel like

759
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,560
no matter what difficulties you face,

760
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,400
you always

761
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,400
can approach them with a different mindset and perspective

762
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:10,960
to deal with them.

763
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,800
I think this

764
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,200
is very important.

765
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,840
I choose excellence and admiration.

766
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,160
If we’re talking about

767
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,560
a lifetime,

768
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,760
that means

769
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,200
I can always

770
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,280
see in her

771
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,120
things worth learning from and

772
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,320
new surprises.

773
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,480
You think she can make you a better person.

774
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,520
Yes.

775
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,360
That's what I like.

776
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,320
What kind of reaction?

777
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,000
This drawing.

778
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,400
What did you draw?

779
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,880
Even though I'm outgoing,

780
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,600
I still wouldn't do something like this.

781
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,480
Like drawing something and then laughing at it myself.

782
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,480
Are you not very happy today?

783
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:16,840
Why?

784
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,040
I just feel like

785
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,040
I want to

786
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,040
It's just me.

787
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,120
For me, I have priorities.

788
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,000
What do you mean?

789
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,880
The people I want to get to know,

790
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,840
I might say I have a priority list.

791
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,000
I want to get to know him first,

792
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,280
then get to know someone else.

793
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:35,880
That's how it is.

794
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,840
But the reason you're unhappy is

795
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,400
But I found out his priorities are

796
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,520
that you're not

797
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,960
at the top of his list.

798
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,720
So I feel a bit

799
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,680
disappointed.

800
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,400
I think she could try

801
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,680
to meet other guys.

802
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,440
Do you think any of us will

803
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,440
be the first

804
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,560
to wear the (highlighted) bracelet?

805
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,280
I think there's someone who's really determined right now.

806
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,200
Not only is he determined,

807
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,200
he's even very proactive.

808
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,480
It's him.

809
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,240
Right?

810
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,360
Xiaoyuan.

811
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,120
Xiaoyuan.

812
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,040
Who is Xiaoyuan with?

813
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:34,760
I don't know.

814
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,440
There's no one else in the room.

815
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,600
Why are you speaking so quietly?

816
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,880
It feels so sneaky.

817
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,280
Who do you think Xiaoyuan is with?

818
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,040
Xiaoyuan and

819
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,200
Lechen

820
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,440
Really? Do you think so?

821
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:49,960
Lechen

822
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,120
Really? Do you think so?

823
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,800
I don't think so.

824
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,040
I think Xiaoyuan

825
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,480
probably wouldn't move that fast.

826
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,000
But who's more proactive right now?

827
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,760
Teacher Fang

828
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,880
Teacher Fang likes

829
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,160
Do you know who Teacher Fang likes?

830
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,600
Do you think he knows?

831
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,600
Take a guess.

832
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:11,840
Lanlan

833
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,880
He knows.

834
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,960
So you see, Ruilong actually understands everything.

835
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,920
He might be the one who sees things the clearest from the sidelines.

836
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:19,960
Lanlan

837
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:21,960
Yeah.

838
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,600
How did you guess?

839
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,960
Because wasn't there that question?

840
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,600
What do you regret?

841
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,400
Don't you think these past few days

842
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,680
he's always been with Lanlan?

843
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,320
Like, they're practically glued together?

844
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,680
Exactly.

845
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,160
Totally

846
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,880
making him so jealous.

847
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,640
It's like when girls gossip,

848
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,480
like at the village entrance,

849
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,040
the guys at the village entrance.

850
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,960
Didn't he pick the room upstairs?

851
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,960
Yeah, and

852
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,400
did you notice

853
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,120
when he picked the room,

854
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,400
he was so decisive.

855
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,240
Yeah, and he didn't say why.

856
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,200
So does this bother you?

857
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,320
Because you definitely

858
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,080
send the message to Lanlan first.

859
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,640
It's just that right now, I can't really tell

860
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,080
the difference between being proactive

861
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,120
and being too aggressive.

862
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:24,920
But

863
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,520
with the current situation,

864
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,120
maybe if I'm too proactive,

865
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,080
it could make things a bit awkward.

866
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:33,840
Yeah.

867
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,000
So now I just don't know

868
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,800
what I should do.

869
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,640
So these past

870
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,200
two nights I've just been drifting.

871
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,320
I don't even know what I'm doing.

872
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,280
These past two nights,

873
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,920
Suppose you are Chenchen right now.

874
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,360
And you are in your room.

875
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,840
How do you think you would feel?

876
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,400
Like, three people like me.

877
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,600
Yes, like Yuanyuan,

878
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,960
Duoduo, and then...

879
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,000
Why are you smiling?

880
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,600
What is it?

881
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,320
It's actually a pretty nice thing.

882
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,120
What is it?

883
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,320
Your lips are curling up.

884
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,560
First, I would be very grateful to them.

885
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,400
Because it's a real honor.

886
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,040
Suddenly, three people are pursuing me at once.

887
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,240
I’d be really happy.

888
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:46,920
Yeah.

889
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,800
Rather than feeling inferior,

890
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,360
like I don't deserve to be liked by three people,

891
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,680
if I had thoughts like that,

892
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,120
they probably wouldn't come up for me.

893
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,240
As for me,

894
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,000
I would sort out my thoughts.

895
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,640
And try my best to minimize

896
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,440
the hurt to those I don't like.

897
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,920
Our Heartbeat Apartment has finally welcomed

898
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,960
its very first big date.

899
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,880
It's very intense.

900
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,160
Six girls each made a card by hand

901
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,640
related to their own interests

902
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,640
and hobbies.

903
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,280
They also chose a bottle

904
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,040
of Master Kong Jasmine Tea

905
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:03,800
to put inside the gift box.

906
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,440
I was wondering,

907
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,960
for the first date,

908
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,720
whoever picks whose card

909
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,400
will go on the date with her.

910
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,960
It'll be their first date.

911
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,880
There's a bit of fate in this.

912
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,480
He's off.

913
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,400
Where's he going?

914
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,640
Hurry up!

915
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,800
Last time, he said he regretted sending the message too late.

916
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,360
That's right.

917
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,000
Mr. Fang.

918
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,440
He's rushing down so crazily.

919
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,440
Is he going to

920
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:43,920
snatch

921
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,000
snatch Lanlan?

922
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,280
Look,

923
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,760
the key is he didn't hesitate, not even for a second.

924
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,280
Exactly.

925
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,880
And he's moving at double speed.

926
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,200
The Nth Power of Love.

927
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,000
His actions

928
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,840
if you translate them into words, it would be

929
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,040
I never want to waste another chance

930
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:00,920
because of being slow

931
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,000
and miss the opportunity to date you.

932
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,320
I don't want to be slow anymore.

933
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,840
Why is he running so fast?

934
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,520
He's sliding away too quickly.

935
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,000
Now I understand

936
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,640
the importance of this slide

937
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,360
now.

938
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,280
Dr. Fang really runs fast.

939
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,920
He went to pick a gift by himself first.

940
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,880
I don't know why he

941
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:48,880
What?

942
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,200
He ran off.

943
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,000
Dr. Fang has already left.

944
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,360
He didn't wait for us at all.

945
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,560
Xiao Jiao was shocked.

946
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,560
So impulsive.

947
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,680
He didn't wait for me.

948
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,320
Then I went after him.

949
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,480
So impulsive.

950
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,320
He

951
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,120
I think he's very determined.

952
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,440
But we don't know

953
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,120
whose gift is whose.

954
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:04,800
Look.

955
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,280
He wants more time to look.

956
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,240
And be the first to choose.

957
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,360
He wants to go earlier and look earlier.

958
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,840
He might not necessarily get it.

959
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,680
Right.

960
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,360
But going first

961
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,400
does let you look first.

962
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,520
Right.

963
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:19,960
Dr. Fang

964
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,920
You really run so fast.

965
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,720
You ran way too fast.

966
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,560
You didn't even wait for us.

967
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,880
So fast you were a blur.

968
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,040
Dr. Fang

969
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,080
Why haven't you chosen yet?

970
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,640
They also have to guess which girl drew it.

971
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,120
They need to look at the gifts.

972
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,440
I don't think we can tell either.

973
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,640
We can open them, right?

974
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,200
You didn't peek at all of them, did you?

975
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,160
No, I didn't.

976
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,800
It's not first come, first served for them.

977
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,760
Let's pick gifts together.

978
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,680
Come on, open it.

979
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,440
So, are we opening the first box or not?

980
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:55,960
It's a cat.

981
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,600
A card of the billiard kitten and

982
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,920
Master Kong Jasmine Tea.

983
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,280
Instead of just longing for it, it's better to set out.

984
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,200
Rather than just longing for it,

985
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,280
it's better to take action.

986
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,720
Did they draw this themselves?

987
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:10,880
Who here has a cat?

988
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,680
Lanlan has a cat.

989
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,720
It could be Lanlan's.

990
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,400
It's a long road, let's walk it slowly.

991
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:18,800
This one.

992
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,560
This one.

993
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,680
Then it's still a Bernese Mountain Dog.

994
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,640
This drawing is amazing.

995
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,600
Walking the dog.

996
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,080
Who knew he had a Bernese Mountain Dog?

997
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,480
Someone mentioned this.

998
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,120
That Yu Xing is

999
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,120
a Bernese Mountain Dog.

1000
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,120
So who likes Yu Xing?

1001
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,720
Then it's only Yifan.

1002
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,920
And Chichi.

1003
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,520
I think

1004
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,240
it could also be Chichi.

1005
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,440
Then this one could be Yifan.

1006
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,640
Boxing

1007
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,360
Hot pot

1008
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,720
Relax a bit

1009
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:52,760
Boxing gloves

1010
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,600
Let's go exercise together

1011
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,160
I can't guess this one

1012
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,680
Watch the sunset together

1013
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,960
It could be Wang Jue

1014
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,280
Wang Jue and Duoduo

1015
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,160
It should be related to Le Chen

1016
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,120
The sunrise again is

1017
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,040
This is just like

1018
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:13,960
a piece of art

1019
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,240
There's a book—maybe someone who loves reading?

1020
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,720
Then it must be Yuanyuan

1021
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,000
There's also a Follow Card here

1022
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,480
There's a Follow Card this season too

1023
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,120
What?

1024
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,160
As long as you

1025
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,280
get this

1026
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:29,800
Follow Card

1027
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,320
you can

1028
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,720
directly choose a guy

1029
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,240
as your date

1030
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,120
and have a one-on-one date

1031
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,440
And the other guys

1032
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,040
can't pick this card

1033
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,960
So this Follow Card

1034
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,640
is very important for the girls

1035
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,680
It's crucial

1036
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,640
You choose first

1037
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,320
You go first

1038
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,000
You go ahead

1039
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,760
Dr. Fang

1040
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,240
Thinking, which one, which one

1041
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,640
I think it's the hot pot one

1042
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,720
It kind of looks like Lanlan

1043
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,640
Looking at it this way

1044
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,840
I think Ruilong is really looking at the paintings

1045
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,200
Which one is drawn best?

1046
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,200
They both saw the same box.

1047
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,920
Xiao Jiao and Dr. Fang stared at it together.

1048
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,640
In this situation, if either of them makes a move first,

1049
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,160
the other one

1050
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:39,840
will definitely try to snatch it.

1051
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,560
Right.

1052
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,320
This should belong to Xu Rulan.

1053
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,280
Just take this one.

1054
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:56,840
He took it right away.

1055
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,640
He firmly

1056
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,000
decided that this one was Lanlan's.

1057
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,480
Then I'll take it.

1058
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,280
You're not even looking at the others?

1059
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,640
I think some of them can be guessed.

1060
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,080
So is this a secret code between you two?

1061
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,240
Can I share my own thoughts?

1062
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,200
Then, Dr. Fang,

1063
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,000
I'm really curious.

1064
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,840
What did you notice from this?

1065
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,080
I'm not telling you.

1066
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,120
You're really possessive, Dr. Fang.

1067
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,840
You keep holding onto the card like that.

1068
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,600
Just keep holding it like that.

1069
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,480
I'm not telling you guys.

1070
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,040
This one.

1071
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,400
Wait a second.

1072
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,760
Is this a Bernese Mountain Dog?

1073
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,040
It looks like it, but it's a bit too small.

1074
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,080
It is a Bernese Mountain Dog.

1075
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,120
I think this is a Bernese Mountain Dog, this one is...

1076
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,160
Just give it to him directly.

1077
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,200
You have a Bernese Mountain Dog at home.

1078
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,120
A Bernese Mountain Dog, right?

1079
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,040
Bernese Mountain Dog and Tusoong.

1080
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,120
I have a Bernese Mountain Dog.

1081
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:06,720
Yes.

1082
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:07,440
Gave it to Yuxing.

1083
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,320
But Yuxing is wondering, who is it?

1084
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,920
Should it be Yifan?

1085
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:14,880
I think it's Yifan too.

1086
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,520
So, Jin Yuxing,

1087
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,760
Do you have a pet?

1088
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,680
What kind of dog?

1089
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,880
That Bernese Mountain Dog.

1090
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,560
It's so big.

1091
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,640
It should be Yifan.

1092
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,040
I don't think it's Yifan.

1093
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,720
Then it must be Chichi.

1094
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,320
I'm not sure if I can say this.

1095
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,120
I think you look like a Bernese Mountain Dog.

1096
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,640
I look like one?

1097
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,600
A Bernese Mountain Dog.

1098
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,000
Yes.

1099
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,960
Both of them know.

1100
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:46,560
Right.

1101
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,880
It's one of those two.

1102
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,640
I think I get it now.

1103
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:52,520
Got it.

1104
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,480
Okay, understood.

1105
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,040
What about this one?

1106
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,040
Boxing and hotpot.

1107
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,680
Boxing is hard to guess.

1108
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:01,440
Boxing.

1109
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,920
Who has learned boxing?

1110
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,080
I think I know too.

1111
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:06,960
I know who it is.

1112
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,480
I think it's Duoduo?

1113
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,880
Duoduo has learned boxing too.

1114
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:15,640
Who else?

1115
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,440
Who else has learned it?

1116
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:18,880
Your information.

1117
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:19,680
Who else has learned it?

1118
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,000
I remember.

1119
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,760
Duoduo has also learned it.

1120
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,040
I want to see you box.

1121
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,360
Throw a couple punches for me first.

1122
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,240
Sure.

1123
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,080
Then it's Duoduo.

1124
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,840
Duoduo arranged a hotpot gathering.

1125
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:44,320
Chichi.

1126
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,360
Actually, someone was boxing downstairs today.

1127
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,560
Chichi was boxing downstairs too.

1128
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:48,680
Chichi also boxed.

1129
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,640
Chichi did too.

1130
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,640
Yeah, just boxed a little.

1131
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,280
Right, someone took the boxing gloves yesterday.

1132
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,360
And started swinging them.

1133
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:57,920
Yesterday it was Duoduo.

1134
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,320
Today it's Chichi.

1135
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,640
Chichi boxed too.

1136
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,360
What?

1137
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,640
This is really hard to guess.

1138
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:19,920
He was afraid of picking the wrong one.

1139
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,360
When he heard it was Duoduo, he was still holding it.

1140
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,880
When he heard it was Chichi, he put it down.

1141
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:28,880
Why is it hot pot?

1142
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:29,720
Yeah, why hot pot?

1143
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:30,560
I get the boxing part.

1144
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,640
But I don't get the hot pot part.

1145
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,040
Hot pot.

1146
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:34,560
I remember that.

1147
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,480
Chichi really wanted to eat hot pot.

1148
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,800
Chichi.

1149
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,240
I went to buy hot pot with Chichi.

1150
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,400
Then it must be Chichi's.

1151
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,640
Chichi does boxing and eats hot pot.

1152
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,360
Then this one

1153
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,720
I think this one is Xiaoyuan

1154
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,680
So who saw the sunset?

1155
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:15,920
Only two groups

1156
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,080
Did you see it?

1157
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,040
I don't think it was us

1158
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,640
Because it was cloudy that day for us

1159
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,960
Did you have such a big sunset that day?

1160
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:22,680
On our day

1161
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:23,160
Yes

1162
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:24,320
Yes

1163
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:32,600
Please describe, during the two days on the island trip,

1164
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,520
the moment that moved you the most

1165
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,040
Why?

1166
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,480
It should be when watching the sunset

1167
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,080
Because I looked forward to the sunset for two days

1168
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:43,600
It probably wasn't Yuanyuan

1169
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,560
It was Duoduo

1170
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,360
It must be Duoduo

1171
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,440
I really don't know about this one

1172
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,680
May every day be as bright as the sunrise

1173
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,040
But this drawing is really good

1174
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,560
This is really well drawn

1175
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,520
I remember someone can draw

1176
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:01,520
Who can?

1177
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,600
Who do you remember?

1178
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,760
Me

1179
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,040
Me

1180
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,280
I just can't remember

1181
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,320
But it could also be

1182
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:15,120
She wanted to go watch together

1183
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,000
Right

1184
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,920
Let’s not end up making a bunch of random guesses

1185
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,200
and not get a single one right

1186
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,520
Turns out none of them are correct

1187
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:22,760
That would be a bit embarrassing

1188
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,600
So do you have any ideas now?

1189
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,280
Ruilong

1190
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,160
Let's start choosing

1191
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:40,320
Go ahead and pick

1192
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:47,680
Suddenly, I'm so nervous.

1193
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,240
How do I choose?

1194
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,600
Well then,

1195
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,080
Then I'll choose Sunset.

1196
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:06,800
Then I'll choose Sunset.

1197
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:07,600
I choose Sunset.

1198
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:21,960
Can you be a bit more impulsive?

1199
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,960
I'm really curious about this one.

1200
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,320
Bern Mountain is the obvious choice.

1201
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,000
Why haven't you chosen yet?

1202
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,200
You still haven't chosen.

1203
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,240
You still haven't chosen.

1204
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,320
If you don't choose, who would dare pick that one?

1205
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:48,800
What he said makes sense.

1206
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,120
If you don't choose, who would dare?

1207
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,200
You...

1208
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,200
Just...

1209
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:02,520
Hurry up.

1210
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:03,880
Be more decisive.

1211
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,480
No, I think everyone...

1212
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,760
It's just...

1213
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,320
Everyone has the same right to choose.

1214
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,040
Don't make it so difficult.

1215
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:14,640
Hurry up and choose.

1216
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,440
Bern Mountain is so obvious.

1217
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,040
Chosen.

1218
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:28,640
Bern Mountain.

1219
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,200
So whose card will this be?

1220
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,520
You choose.

1221
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,960
Which one do you want to choose more?

1222
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,320
Relax a bit.

1223
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,480
The reason Rui Long chose boxing is

1224
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:58,280
he wanted to relax.

1225
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,160
Why does he look unhappy?

1226
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,360
Maybe he wants to

1227
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:04,880
ask someone out to eat.

1228
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,320
Then I'll choose this one.

1229
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,160
Let's go, we've finished choosing.

1230
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,200
It's all up to fate.

1231
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,560
There's also a follow card.

1232
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,280
I think the follow card might be Wang Jue.

1233
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,320
I hope it's her.

1234
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,240
What exactly is that hotpot?

1235
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,400
Do you want to trade with me?

1236
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:28,800
Go eat hotpot?

1237
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,200
Do you want to?

1238
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:35,440
Do you want to?

1239
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:38,600
I'm not sure.

1240
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:39,280
Do you know?

1241
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,760
Boxing is a pretty obvious signal,

1242
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,680
but hotpot...

1243
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:45,920
I still haven't figured it out.

1244
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:47,880
Why is there hotpot?

1245
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,360
Hotpot has too many calories.

1246
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,040
Go box for a while to burn it off.

1247
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,200
Everyone is there when eating hotpot.

1248
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:54,840
Seems like it.

1249
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:55,440
Goodbye.

1250
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,720
Who do you think Chenchen wants to invite this time?

1251
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:04,640
I think Chenchen

1252
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:05,760
wants to invite Duoduo.

1253
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:06,960
He must be inviting Duoduo.

1254
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,120
Because he just made a judgment.

1255
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,280
I'm sure about the boxing.

1256
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,160
But I haven't figured out the hotpot part.

1257
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,040
Yeah.

1258
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,000
I think if

1259
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,080
we're talking about priorities,

1260
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:15,080
it's very likely

1261
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,240
it's Xiaoyuan.

1262
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:17,760
True.

1263
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,360
Before, their

1264
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:19,000
interactions were frequent.

1265
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,040
I think he wants to invite Duoduo.

1266
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:45,760
That boxing, I feel

1267
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,360
is very much Duoduo's style.

1268
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:49,880
So the sunset is

1269
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:50,760
for Chichi.

1270
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,000
He wants to invite Chichi.

1271
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:52,760
I don't know.

1272
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,120
I haven't really interacted with those two.

1273
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,640
I've only interacted with Rulan.

1274
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,520
I haven't really gotten to know them.

1275
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,520
One of the girls managed to get it.

1276
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,640
So among the three people,

1277
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,680
Wang Jue, Xiaoyuan, and Duoduo.

1278
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:32,520
I don't know who got it.

1279
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,160
the Follow Card.

1280
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,640
They followed Le Chen.

1281
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,400
I think it was Wang Jue.

1282
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:38,280
That would be impressive.

1283
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,120
Let's go explore together.

1284
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,040
Lost in thought.

1285
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,080
Even if my brain explodes, I can't figure it out.

1286
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:32,720
Yours is also pretty obvious.

1287
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:34,280
Mine is also pretty obvious.

1288
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:35,600
Yours is obvious.

1289
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:36,200
Let me take a look.

1290
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:40,640
This belongs to Rulan.

1291
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,280
I think so.

1292
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:44,760
It should be.

1293
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,880
He's so careful, he wouldn't make a mistake.

1294
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,280
Are you looking at this and giggling?

1295
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,640
He really is giggling.

1296
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:10,320
Take a look.

1297
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:16,920
Take it back.

1298
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:18,720
See, he doesn't want to show it to anyone.

1299
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,560
At the dinner party,

1300
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,360
My impression was

1301
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,680
you weren't the first to send a message.

1302
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:25,360
Right?

1303
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,320
Yeah, so you have to be quick.

1304
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:32,480
That day, you sent it too slowly.

1305
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:33,960
So today you have to

1306
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:36,600
rush.

1307
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:40,240
rush.

1308
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:41,560
rush.

1309
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:42,400
rush.

1310
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:50,600
I'm just

1311
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,240
waiting to go eat hotpot.

1312
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:07,520
Everyone can see that just now,

1313
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,800
the flavor of Master Kong Jasmine Tea is also

1314
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,480
a very crucial clue.

1315
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,760
In my memory,

1316
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:13,520
Lanlan

1317
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:14,440
what does she love to drink the most?

1318
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,680
Master Kong's

1319
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,000
Jasmine Tea, right?

1320
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,480
That's right, I remember too.

1321
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:20,560
Master Kong Jasmine Tea

1322
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:21,400
matches her personality

1323
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:22,280
very well.

1324
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,560
A fresh and romantic flower tea girl.

1325
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:25,640
No wonder our Dr. Fang

1326
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:27,440
keeps holding onto that

1327
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,480
flower tea and card

1328
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,240
and won't let go.

1329
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,320
Now we

1330
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,960
are split into two teams.

1331
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,640
The Cupids on the left

1332
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:35,600
form one team.

1333
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,000
The Cupids on the right

1334
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:37,880
form another team.

1335
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,680
The Cupids on both sides

1336
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,360
will deduce whether it's the girl from 801

1337
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:42,920
or the girl from 802

1338
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:44,000
as the date.

1339
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,520
For each correct answer,

1340
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:48,240
that team will earn a gem.

1341
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:49,760
Next,

1342
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:50,840
let's start the deduction.

1343
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,080
What do you all think?

1344
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,600
I think the clearest thing is

1345
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,600
Lanlan is

1346
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,840
the one who drew this little cat.

1347
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,200
Rather than trusting the drawing skills,

1348
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,320
I would say I trust

1349
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,000
Dr. Fang's

1350
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,520
careful judgment.

1351
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,120
That's just my feeling.

1352
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:06,680
This drawing

1353
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:08,440
of the pool table is very

1354
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:09,520
neat.

1355
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,560
It's a lot like Lanlan's profession.

1356
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:13,680
That architecture

1357
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:14,160
That

1358
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:15,520
civil engineering.

1359
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:16,640
Don't you think so?

1360
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,440
Don't you think only she

1361
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,480
That makes sense.

1362
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:19,520
That makes sense.

1363
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:21,640
Only hers is

1364
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,080
the table corner is

1365
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,000
three-dimensional.

1366
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,280
It's straight and square.

1367
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:26,720
What he said makes some sense.

1368
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,000
Because my family is in construction,

1369
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,360
so I understand the point he's making.

1370
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:30,360
This "decisive evidence"

1371
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:31,600
This evidence is a "decisive blow."

1372
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:34,920
Chichi and

1373
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:38,680
Yifan both like Yuxing.

1374
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,000
So there must be

1375
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,320
one of them who is

1376
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:46,760
Do you have any ideas?

1377
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,320
I think we can take a look.

1378
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:49,280
Let's look closely at that painting.

1379
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,600
The length of that girl's hair.

1380
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:51,920
It's short.

1381
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,200
How short? Both of them have short hair.

1382
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:54,720
It's short.

1383
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:55,640
It's very short.

1384
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:56,240
That's Yifan's.

1385
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,360
So it's Yifan.

1386
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,160
The girl drew herself.

1387
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,560
The features she drew are very clear.

1388
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,000
Right.

1389
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,520
After you said that,

1390
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:02,880
it feels like

1391
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:03,640
it's exactly the same.

1392
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,000
It's in comic proportions.

1393
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:05,440
Yifan.

1394
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,960
Did Chichi participate in boxing?

1395
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:11,240
Yes.

1396
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:11,640
I think so.

1397
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,040
Earlier, he (Fang Yijiong) said that downstairs today,

1398
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,040
the one boxing was Chichi.

1399
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,160
I don't think so.

1400
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,000
It's because

1401
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
when Chichi was boxing,

1402
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,360
it looked like she just wanted to try it.

1403
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:19,280
That one.

1404
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,280
Duoduo was boxing

1405
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,560
and it looked like she had actually trained.

1406
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:22,360
For a few months, probably.

1407
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:24,320
And it was written up there.

1408
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:25,680
To relax a bit.

1409
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:26,920
I feel like she's the upbeat type.

1410
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,000
And she's pretty positive.

1411
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:28,640
So I think Duoduo

1412
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:29,440
is the one with the hotpot.

1413
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,480
Now we're guessing Chichi.

1414
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:33,320
Who do you think it is?

1415
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,400
Chichi, I’ll take care of you.

1416
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:36,880
Sunrise.

1417
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,000
Chichi hasn’t seen the sunrise.

1418
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,200
I feel like it’s sunset.

1419
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,880
Because the girl at sunset has medium-length hair.

1420
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,840
It kind of reminds me of hot pot.

1421
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:44,840
Because of Chichi.

1422
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:45,880
She wants to eat.

1423
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:47,840
Personally, I think

1424
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:48,920
Duoduo should be hot pot.

1425
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:50,440
I think this line

1426
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:51,560
really sounds like something Duoduo would say.

1427
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,800
Yeah, it’s that feeling when she laughs.

1428
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:54,960
There’s a sound.

1429
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:55,920
Let’s relax a bit.

1430
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,400
She always has that

1431
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,480
vibe about her.

1432
00:58:58,840 --> 00:58:59,560
Makes sense.

1433
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:00,680
What about Xiaoyuan?

1434
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:02,240
Xiaoyuan, what do you think?

1435
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:04,840
I think Xiaoyuan is sunset.

1436
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,360
Why not sunrise?

1437
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:08,640
It’s too early to get up.

1438
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,400
I think Wang Jue's state of mind

1439
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,400
is a bit like a sunset right now.

1440
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:18,560
Actually, there's a detail here.

1441
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:19,720
Look, this is a sunset.

1442
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:20,360
She once said something.

1443
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,680
To hold on to a fleeting memory.

1444
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,040
That must be someone who has seen a sunset.

1445
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:29,840
Someone who has watched the sunset from afar.

1446
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,560
It must be from a distance.

1447
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,800
But the style feels like

1448
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:37,120
Wang Jue has this style.

1449
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,520
I think the follower card might be Wang Jue.

1450
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:41,960
The follower card also draws.

1451
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:42,840
She also paints.

1452
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,240
I just think that

1453
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,560
none of the girls have ever mentioned

1454
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,480
liking hiking, this detail.

1455
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:50,800
Could it be a guy?

1456
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,240
Which guy likes hiking?

1457
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:53,080
Outdoor activities.

1458
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,120
Who likes outdoor activities?

1459
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,280
Outdoor activities, that's Le Chen, right?

1460
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:01,080
So the one who likes Le Chen is

1461
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:01,600
Wang Jue.

1462
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:03,920
If there's a chance to explore together,

1463
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:04,360
see,

1464
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,480
if there's a chance to explore together,

1465
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,920
Yes, that's what I hope to see.

1466
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,040
Then let's leave it at that.

1467
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:12,000
I hope it's her.

1468
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:13,080
And then,

1469
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:14,080
Yeah, Chi Chi wants

1470
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:14,960
to get up early to watch the sunrise.

1471
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,360
I feel like we got three right.

1472
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:22,800
What do you think?

1473
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:23,640
Which three do you think are correct?

1474
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,040
Lanlan.

1475
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:26,440
Duoduo.

1476
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:27,480
Yifan.

1477
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:28,560
Feels like we got three right.

1478
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:29,520
Which three do you think?

1479
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:30,400
Where do you think it might be a bit...

1480
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,240
Those three are really impossible to guess.

1481
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,280
I think we got them all right.

1482
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,400
Then let's see each team's...

1483
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,080
how many Heartstone they can win in the end.

1484
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:39,000
How many can they get?

1485
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:39,600
Is that okay?

1486
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:41,200
But you never know.

1487
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,640
Because it's a bit hard this time.

1488
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,120
When Jasmine blooms, it's a sign of excitement.

1489
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,080
Next, we move on to...

1490
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:52,440
Master Kong Jasmine Tea's refreshing moment of excitement.

1491
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:54,320
Everyone, the exciting moment has arrived.

1492
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,520
We're about to enter...

1493
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,560
the reveal of our date pairings.

1494
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,440
Will our Cupids

1495
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:02,000
be able to win the Heartstone?

1496
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,880
Let's move on to the first date group.

1497
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:04,800
Here they come.

1498
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:16,600
They're coming.

1499
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:17,320
Who is it?

1500
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:28,560
Watch closely.

1501
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:36,920
Is that sportswear?

1502
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,160
They were just wearing workout clothes.

1503
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,240
It's for eating.

1504
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:41,160
See, I said it's for eating.

1505
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,440
Looking forward to it.

1506
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:51,800
Who is it?

1507
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:53,240
Who is it?

1508
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:09,800
It really is you.

1509
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:11,640
Is it really you?

1510
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:13,160
It really is you.

1511
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:13,560
It really is you.

1512
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:16,240
Hello.

1513
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:18,920
Hello.

1514
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:26,400
Can we have one...

1515
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,520
Dr. Fang's special selection.

1516
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,080
Dr. Fang's special selection.

1517
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:29,400
This one.

1518
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,120
I'll go with Dr. Fang.

1519
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:32,640
It really is you.

1520
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:33,480
It really is.

1521
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:34,560
Thank you.

1522
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:35,560
And I also got you...

1523
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:36,760
a small gift.

1524
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,000
Because at the dinner that night,

1525
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:42,040
it seemed you didn't get a gift from the guys.

1526
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:43,000
Thank you.

1527
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
So I prepared a gift for you.

1528
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:45,120
Thank you.

1529
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,160
That's very thoughtful.

1530
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:47,400
Let me hold it for you.

1531
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:48,480
Okay, thank you.

1532
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:52,800
See, I said it wouldn't rain today.

1533
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:55,760
When I was leaving home,

1534
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:56,760
I was actually worried it would rain.

1535
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,440
So you knew it was me yesterday?

1536
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:00,960
Yesterday, I...

1537
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,080
guessed.

1538
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:03,000
I thought it was probably you.

1539
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,280
How did you guess it was probably me?

1540
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,280
He was so sure about it.

1541
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,040
After we go to open the clams,

1542
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,840
what will the pearls inside look like?

1543
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:18,400
What can you choose to do next?

1544
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:21,880
Then let's go over there to catch some clams now.

1545
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:23,040
Okay.

1546
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:24,480
Are they going to open pearls?

1547
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,000
This activity is quite special.

1548
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:26,520
Yeah.

1549
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,680
I saw there were also purple pearls over there just now.

1550
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,640
So do you like purple or some other color?

1551
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:32,320
I like them all.

1552
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:34,040
What kind of pearl do you hope to get later?

1553
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:34,800
What kind of pearl?

1554
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,960
I think white or purple would be nice.

1555
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:38,800
Thank you.

1556
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:55,480
This one you can still do by yourself.

1557
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,000
That won't do.

1558
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:59,880
At this time, you have to act like

1559
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:01,840
a clueless little dummy.

1560
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:05,120
Thank you.

1561
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:06,880
You go first.

1562
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:08,040
You go first.

1563
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:08,520
Okay.

1564
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:21,880
This is my first time on a boat.

1565
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:24,280
On this kind of boat?

1566
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:25,680
Why do I feel like our combined weight

1567
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:26,840
is making the boat a bit heavy?

1568
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,040
I've only been on big boats, never on a small one like this.

1569
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:31,880
You've never rowed a boat in the park?

1570
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:38,920
It would be great if we could catch one this big.

1571
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:43,040
I guess we'll catch ones this small.

1572
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,320
I think they'll all be pretty small.

1573
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:50,400
I didn't sleep well last night.

1574
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:50,960
Why?

1575
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:52,720
A bit nervous.

1576
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,000
A little anxious.

1577
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
You're nervous?

1578
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
A little scared.

1579
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
What are you afraid of?

1580
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:59,040
Mainly, I...

1581
01:04:59,040 --> 01:04:59,880
When I saw that thing,

1582
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:01,800
I pretty much knew it was you.

1583
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,640
I chose without hesitation.

1584
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:06,080
I chose without hesitation.

1585
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:07,920
No hesitation.

1586
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:17,720
Here, let me get you some now.

1587
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:18,920
How about I scoop up a few pearls?

1588
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:19,440
Okay.

1589
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:29,600
Pick one, which one do you want?

1590
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:31,480
Any of them is fine.

1591
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:32,560
The one by your hand is fine too.

1592
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:33,640
This one by my hand?

1593
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:34,000
Yes.

1594
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:35,800
Selected by Rulan.

1595
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:44,480
So we need to pry it open first, right?

1596
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:45,800
Try prying it open inside.

1597
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,080
Pry it open inside.

1598
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:50,080
I think yours is bigger.

1599
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:50,360
Yeah.

1600
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:51,040
This one is big.

1601
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:51,480
This one is big.

1602
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:54,480
This one is really big.

1603
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,600
We need to take some

1604
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,120
with different shapes.

1605
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,200
Let's see

1606
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,320
what differences there are when we open them.

1607
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:00,880
Right.

1608
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,520
This is actually pretty fun.

1609
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:04,280
Every year's exciting date

1610
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:05,640
is always a date strategy.

1611
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:09,760
So should we first figure out a way

1612
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,240
to pry open the clam?

1613
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:12,720
Put it here.

1614
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:13,320
Okay.

1615
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:15,760
We should put on gloves.

1616
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:17,240
Do you want to pry it open?

1617
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:18,560
Sure, I'll give it a try.

1618
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:19,640
Wear two pairs.

1619
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:20,240
Thanks.

1620
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,600
This one is pretty hard to open.

1621
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:26,280
I've opened one before.

1622
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:31,640
Shouldn't we cut around it first?

1623
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:32,520
Yeah.

1624
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:35,040
I'm doing that step now.

1625
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:38,800
It seems like Lanlan's movements

1626
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:39,560
are pretty quick.

1627
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:41,040
It's really hard to open.

1628
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:41,680
You

1629
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:43,680
try it out gently first.

1630
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:47,680
There's a lot of water inside.

1631
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:56,000
Don't use too much force.

1632
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,480
This knife is very dangerous.

1633
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:58,440
Okay.

1634
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:00,640
Try to pry it open.

1635
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:03,080
It's open.

1636
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:04,880
That was intense.

1637
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:09,000
It's open.

1638
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:13,000
I beat you to it.

1639
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:14,680
Impressive.

1640
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:19,080
Let me see how many there are in total.

1641
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,760
Let's see who has more.

1642
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:22,960
Seeing this meat makes me want to eat it.

1643
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:30,000
This one is so beautiful, look.

1644
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:32,520
It's purple.

1645
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:34,000
A purple pearl.

1646
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:35,400
Purple.

1647
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:36,040
Yes.

1648
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:42,000
It's so big.

1649
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,360
There seem to be two inside this one.

1650
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:49,840
Why can't I open it?

1651
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:51,640
Dr. Fang.

1652
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:52,920
It hasn't been opened yet, right?

1653
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:54,200
Not yet.

1654
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:57,040
Do you want me to help you?

1655
01:07:58,480 --> 01:07:59,040
No.

1656
01:07:59,040 --> 01:07:59,560
Dr. Fang.

1657
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:00,160
No.

1658
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:02,440
It's open.

1659
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:10,520
I don't know why

1660
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:11,600
Maybe it's because of my profession

1661
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:12,400
I think Dr. Fang

1662
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:13,200
really looks like he's performing surgery

1663
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,360
This one is very round

1664
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:16,400
This one is so pretty

1665
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:17,560
It's purple

1666
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:18,400
It has a bit of a pinkish sheen

1667
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,520
It has a bit of a pinkish sheen

1668
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Can you see it?

1669
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,080
Can you see it?

1670
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:25,120
I can't see it

1671
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:29,120
That's it

1672
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:31,160
Why don't you open this one?

1673
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:31,680
Okay

1674
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:33,600
This one feels especially big

1675
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:45,320
With those gloves and that knife

1676
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:46,480
You really look like it

1677
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:47,600
I feel like an orthopedic surgeon

1678
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:48,360
performing surgery

1679
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:48,920
Orthopedic surgeon

1680
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:49,720
Not my style

1681
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:53,000
So are orthopedic surgical knives

1682
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:53,960
the same as ophthalmology ones?

1683
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:54,760
They're different

1684
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:56,600
A knife this big

1685
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:58,240
can't be seen in ophthalmology

1686
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,680
Our knives are much smaller than this

1687
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:02,600
Maybe a hundred times smaller

1688
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:04,000
Maybe even more

1689
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:06,760
Just exaggerating a bit

1690
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:16,240
It's opened

1691
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,080
I'll put it here

1692
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:20,080
One

1693
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:31,960
Opened up a white one

1694
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:47,720
Not a single one.

1695
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:48,640
Not a single one.

1696
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:49,440
Impossible.

1697
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:51,200
There are at least three.

1698
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:53,360
I don't believe it.

1699
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,800
Feel it yourself and you'll know.

1700
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:56,240
What about there?

1701
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:00,520
There is.

1702
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:01,560
One.

1703
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
This one has quite a shape.

1704
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,560
This is one of the ones on the outside.

1705
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:06,880
There must be some inside.

1706
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:09,600
You're really good at reading people.

1707
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:12,520
Honestly, that look in your eyes...

1708
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:14,520
Even girls who see it would feel a bit...

1709
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:15,800
Unable to resist.

1710
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,320
There must be some inside.

1711
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:21,880
But this one is really big.

1712
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:24,040
It's bigger than all the others.

1713
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:26,080
Really.

1714
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:27,640
And it's very round.

1715
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:30,360
Let's put this away first.

1716
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:30,880
Okay.

1717
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:32,320
Actually, something like this...

1718
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:33,800
The color is quite nice.

1719
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:34,600
It's rather unique.

1720
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:35,600
It could be made into a necklace.

1721
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:37,200
That would be quite meaningful.

1722
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:38,280
It can be made into a necklace.

1723
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:39,360
Yes.

1724
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:40,160
It's more natural.

1725
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:41,320
But if you want to...

1726
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,880
Drill a hole here.

1727
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:43,480
Right.

1728
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:44,520
That's possible.

1729
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:45,160
Alright.

1730
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:46,080
Sit here.

1731
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,920
This can even be processed on the spot.

1732
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:50,160
I like this one.

1733
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:56,520
What's wrong?

1734
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:58,800
We made eye contact.

1735
01:10:58,800 --> 01:10:59,520
What's wrong?

1736
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:00,200
What are you doing?

1737
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:01,520
Feels like a romance drama.

1738
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,320
What's going on here?

1739
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:10,000
How do I do this?

1740
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:12,440
Let me think.

1741
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:16,120
I thought it was something serious.

1742
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:18,080
Next time, after finishing, too.

1743
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:19,560
We should keep this style as well.

1744
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:21,880
Is it in the middle?

1745
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:27,360
Pretty much.

1746
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:31,360
This, and stepping on that.

1747
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:31,960
A sewing machine?

1748
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:34,440
No, it feels more like a surgical microscope.

1749
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:39,240
It even has a machine.

1750
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:44,680
Try first to see if it fits in.

1751
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:45,560
It's here.

1752
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:52,120
I think so.

1753
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:53,960
On this pointy part.

1754
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:55,960
Then just push it right in.

1755
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:04,120
See? Perfect.

1756
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:14,960
It's pretty.

1757
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:16,400
Is it supposed to be like this?

1758
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,400
Wait, let me see where the swan's head is.

1759
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,480
The head is here.

1760
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:23,640
What are you laughing at now?

1761
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:35,760
So perfect.

1762
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:37,640
It really looks like a swan's wing.

1763
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:38,920
It really does.

1764
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:39,360
Right?

1765
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:40,720
Honestly, it really does.

1766
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:43,840
You do it.

1767
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:47,960
I should've let you do this.

1768
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:48,920
Why?

1769
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,600
I think this suits me.

1770
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:51,600
That one suits you.

1771
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:56,640
That's so sweet.

1772
01:12:58,560 --> 01:12:59,800
So the reason you wanted me to make this

1773
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,040
is because you wanted it.

1774
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:04,400
I'll make one for you.

1775
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:08,760
I'll make one for you.

1776
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:12,120
My little plan got exposed.

1777
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:19,880
Alright, I'll give this one to you.

1778
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:20,720
White swan.

1779
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:23,320
I'll give you the white swan.

1780
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:36,760
It's so pretty.

1781
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,400
Did you expect

1782
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,200
it would be this kind of project today?

1783
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:44,920
No.

1784
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:46,400
I just feel like

1785
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:47,520
doing crafts can help train

1786
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,320
my patience and attention to detail.

1787
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:50,880
Last time you said

1788
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:52,320
when we were talking about those building blocks,

1789
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:53,960
you mentioned something about spatial sense.

1790
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:54,680
Yeah.

1791
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:56,320
I like spatial sense.

1792
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:56,880
Or something like that.

1793
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:58,800
Because it's about building spaces.

1794
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:01,680
Because that's what I studied.

1795
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:03,760
Like designing spaces and stuff.

1796
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:06,880
And I used to make models by hand.

1797
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:07,400
Yeah.

1798
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:09,840
Why did you choose that one?

1799
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:10,400
The box.

1800
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:20,680
Why?

1801
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:22,360
Because when I came in,

1802
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:23,800
there were two boxes outside.

1803
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,560
I could pick the person I wanted.

1804
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,280
At that time, it should have been

1805
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,560
a blue box and a green box.

1806
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,040
Yes, at that time.

1807
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:44,080
There was no logic then.

1808
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:45,200
Actually, thinking carefully, I should have

1809
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:46,120
chosen the blue box.

1810
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:49,480
The blue one.

1811
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:50,760
A double meaning.

1812
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:52,720
Thinking about it, I should have picked the blue box.

1813
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:57,040
It's obvious, right?

1814
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:01,400
I didn't know at that moment.

1815
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:02,720
What was going on.

1816
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:06,560
Maybe because the smaller one was easier to hold.

1817
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:13,760
Even with a fifty-fifty chance, I still picked wrong.

1818
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:23,880
I felt a little disappointed inside.

1819
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,440
It's okay, today you have

1820
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:30,640
You have the white swan now.

1821
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:41,640
It's beautiful.

1822
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:51,680
Try it on.

1823
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:53,040
Okay.

1824
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:56,440
It's pretty.

1825
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,200
Let's figure out how to wear it.

1826
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
I put it on myself.

1827
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:08,520
I need you to help me put it on.

1828
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:10,840
Can you do it?

1829
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:15,360
I'm not sure how to fasten it.

1830
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:21,280
Is it this part...

1831
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:23,360
I've never worn a necklace before.

1832
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:26,840
Even though he doesn't know how, it's still a plus.

1833
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:28,360
Turn around.

1834
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:31,600
He's making a move.

1835
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:32,800
Strike when it's time to strike.

1836
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:43,920
So sweet.

1837
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:53,920
I'm loving this.

1838
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:55,400
Alright.

1839
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:57,000
Thank you.

1840
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:57,600
How is it?

1841
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:07,960
You're grinning foolishly again.

1842
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:09,480
I'm happy.

1843
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:10,520
I can't help it.

1844
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:20,160
It's so sweet, I'll get cavities.

1845
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:21,280
It's too sweet, you know?

1846
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,040
It's just a bit too sweet.

1847
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:23,600
This is a bit...

1848
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:24,720
I like it.

1849
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:25,440
I like it too.

1850
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,120
I really like this couple.

1851
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:29,040
They're such a good match.

1852
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,440
I like it.

1853
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:31,880
The gentle, soft-spoken kind.

1854
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:33,160
I just like watching this kind of thing.

1855
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:34,160
They're both so gentle.

1856
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:36,760
The guy too.

1857
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:37,920
The more I look, the more pleasing they are.

1858
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:40,200
Let's start naming this pair.

1859
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:46,520
The "Ruyi" pair.

1860
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:48,160
"Ruyi."

1861
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:49,160
Is that okay?

1862
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:49,840
It's okay.

1863
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:50,400
It's fine.

1864
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:51,800
Sure.

1865
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:55,920
Let's put it aside for now.

1866
01:17:58,360 --> 01:17:59,200
Thank you.

1867
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:01,000
You're welcome.

1868
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:11,240
I look really funny.

1869
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,640
Then when I look at you, I grin foolishly too.

1870
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:20,160
Yeah, why do you...

1871
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:21,800
When we first met,

1872
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:23,040
why did you keep...

1873
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:23,640
smiling?

1874
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:24,200
Yeah.

1875
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:24,880
Happy

1876
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:25,920
What are you happy about?

1877
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:32,720
I'm just happy that I met someone right after coming in.

1878
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:35,480
What?

1879
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:41,280
A beautiful person.

1880
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:43,240
A beautiful person.

1881
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:47,440
A beautiful person.

1882
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:51,320
That's so sweet.

1883
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:57,880
When they talked about this part,

1884
01:18:58,760 --> 01:18:59,560
was it the same as us,

1885
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:00,240
watching it now?

1886
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:01,200
It's that kind of

1887
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,640
heart-pounding feeling.

1888
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:03,960
Maybe their hearts were beating even faster than ours.

1889
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:08,480
So at that time,

1890
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:09,160
when you were chosen (swapped),

1891
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:10,440
did you feel excited?

1892
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:15,320
You mean on the first day,

1893
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:16,440
when you were chosen (swapped) to go to Huaniao Island?

1894
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:17,840
Not excited.

1895
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:20,240
Not excited.

1896
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:23,240
I hoped

1897
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:24,520
not to be chosen (swapped).

1898
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:25,920
I hoped

1899
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,080
not to be chosen (swapped).

1900
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:31,960
The gentlest voice

1901
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:33,280
says the most determined words.

1902
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:39,720
What's wrong?

1903
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:41,680
I'll say it myself.

1904
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:44,920
You're waiting for me to ask you.

1905
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:49,040
So would you

1906
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,800
for example, on something like WeChat,

1907
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:57,040
do you often say you want to chat on it?

1908
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:01,080
Is it necessary?

1909
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:04,480
Like, if the other person is busy,

1910
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:05,720
then you can tell me in advance.

1911
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:06,640
What are you busy with?

1912
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:08,720
What if he doesn't tell you in advance?

1913
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,000
Then how does he explain it afterwards?

1914
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:13,800
Busy.

1915
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:15,000
Busy with what?

1916
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:16,080
Work.

1917
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:19,600
I think it depends on how well I know the other person.

1918
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:20,200
It's just that

1919
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:21,800
if I think he's someone

1920
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:22,720
who makes me feel at ease,

1921
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:23,720
very honest,

1922
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:24,520
right,

1923
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:26,080
then I don't think I would

1924
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:27,240
overthink it too much.

1925
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:33,040
So are you the kind of person who lies?

1926
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:35,560
This question—

1927
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:37,480
Who would admit they lie?

1928
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:41,680
If I lied, I would tell her right away.

1929
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:43,920
After a while, I'd tell her

1930
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:45,280
what I just said wasn't true.

1931
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,680
Is it that you can't lie, or you don't want to?

1932
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:56,720
If you want to know

1933
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:57,800
whether this is true or not,

1934
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:58,800
you can ask me to swear.

1935
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:06,040
I was just thinking, I also wanted to—

1936
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,320
There was something else I wanted to ask, but I forgot.

1937
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:11,440
Take your time to remember.

1938
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:13,680
Are you someone who cares a lot about looks?

1939
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:18,320
Me?

1940
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:19,800
I used to think I wasn't.

1941
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:22,840
So I guess I am, after all.

1942
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:26,080
But I think, compared to caring about looks,

1943
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:27,880
I'm more attracted to intelligence.

1944
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,600
Like, you don't have to explain everything

1945
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,240
in great detail or very clearly,

1946
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:33,800
and the other person can still quickly understand.

1947
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:38,720
I think it's about

1948
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:40,400
having some things in common,

1949
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,000
so you can have shared topics to talk about,

1950
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,520
but the other person should also

1951
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:44,400
have differences as well.

1952
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:50,440
Let's talk about something simple.

1953
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:50,920
Okay.

1954
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:52,400
Was what we just talked about difficult?

1955
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:53,960
There's something even simpler.

1956
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:57,600
Let's start by talking about food.

1957
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:58,920
Alright.

1958
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:00,680
Is there a dish you especially like?

1959
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:05,360
I really like one.

1960
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:06,120
Hot pot.

1961
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:07,680
Hot pot.

1962
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:08,800
Spicy crayfish.

1963
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:09,960
Isn't that pretty hard to make?

1964
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:10,920
Not really.

1965
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:12,760
When do you want to eat it?

1966
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:15,360
When do you want to eat it?

1967
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,640
When do you want to eat it?

1968
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:18,840
I want to eat it every day.

1969
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,000
I want to eat it every day.

1970
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:23,120
So what are you good at making?

1971
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:24,480
The thing I'm best at.

1972
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:27,400
The best at.

1973
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,880
Maybe it's that...

1974
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:32,400
Spicy crayfish.

1975
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:36,120
That's good.

1976
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:37,840
Is it the one you just mentioned?

1977
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:39,000
Or is it not the one you just mentioned?

1978
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:41,120
Is that really what you're best at?

1979
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:41,840
It really is.

1980
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:43,040
I make crayfish often.

1981
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:49,000
His expression changed.

1982
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:49,720
It became more intense.

1983
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:49,960
Just like that.

1984
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:51,760
Very certain.

1985
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:54,760
I haven't opened the gift you gave me yet.

1986
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:57,280
I'll open it now.

1987
01:22:58,760 --> 01:22:59,680
What is it?

1988
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,280
Imagine your daily life.

1989
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:20,360
You really can't tell what it is just from the box.

1990
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:37,960
Like

1991
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:41,560
It's exactly the color I like.

1992
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:45,480
It's related to sleep.

1993
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:46,760
And it's good for the eyes.

1994
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:48,040
Carefully selected by ophthalmologists.

1995
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:49,600
Do you feel that the cabin

1996
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:50,800
at night

1997
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:51,400
is very bright?

1998
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:52,000
The lights are very bright.

1999
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:52,640
Yes.

2000
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:54,560
I was just thinking yesterday

2001
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:56,640
if I should bring my own eye mask.

2002
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,720
No need.

2003
01:23:57,720 --> 01:23:58,800
I prepared one for you.

2004
01:23:58,800 --> 01:23:59,920
He's very assertive.

2005
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:00,800
Getting more and more assertive.

2006
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,000
They're really good at dating.

2007
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:04,320
It's just like a TV drama.

2008
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:07,240
Thank you.

2009
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:09,960
So what is this?

2010
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:11,520
This is a pillowcase.

2011
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:13,560
And

2012
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:15,680
Thank you.

2013
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:16,640
An eye mask.

2014
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:17,240
A pillowcase.

2015
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:18,800
And one is for tying

2016
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:19,840
your hair.

2017
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:22,280
I hope that in the cabin

2018
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:23,760
and in your future life

2019
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,240
you can have a good sleep every day.

2020
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:30,520
Thank you, I really like it.

2021
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:32,160
I'll wear it to sleep tonight.

2022
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:35,440
Okay.

2023
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:50,200
They really know how to talk.

2024
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:51,000
I really like this.

2025
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,440
The two of them have great chemistry.

2026
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:53,760
Yeah.

2027
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:56,200
Every time the camera catches their eyes,

2028
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:59,120
I feel like you can't hide anything in your eyes.

2029
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:00,400
All your true feelings are there.

2030
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:03,080
So every time Rulan

2031
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:03,640
opens her eyes,

2032
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:05,200
when she opens her big eyes,

2033
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:07,080
and then there's Xiaofang,

2034
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:08,480
his determined eyes

2035
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:09,960
when he looks at Rulan,

2036
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:11,800
I just feel

2037
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:13,520
like they're in love.

2038
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:15,440
I think it's that feeling

2039
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:16,640
when she says she wants to eat something,

2040
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:18,280
and he says, "I'll make it for you anytime."

2041
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:19,400
"Do you want to eat it every day?"

2042
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:20,440
That just feels like

2043
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:21,520
they want to be together every day.

2044
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:22,640
I just think

2045
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:24,000
they're kind of sending that signal.

2046
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,800
And he's really good at giving gifts too.

2047
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:28,200
Yeah, that gift was really

2048
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:29,440
it touched my heart too.

2049
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:29,920
Yeah.

2050
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:30,800
He really gets it.

2051
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,600
Even the choice of color and everything.

2052
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:33,120
I know all about it.

2053
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:34,080
If her name wasn't Rulan,

2054
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:34,840
if she were called Rufan,

2055
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:36,280
it would be pink.

2056
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:38,640
Everything is completely customized for her.

2057
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:39,520
But that wouldn't happen.

2058
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:42,280
If it were me, I'd make it with pearls.

2059
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:43,320
And string them together.

2060
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:46,800
I was just about to say

2061
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:47,400
they made necklaces.

2062
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:49,000
This part really touched me the most.

2063
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:49,480
I just thought of something.

2064
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:50,520
Then there was a whole string of them.

2065
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:53,200
If it’s with Ru Lan,

2066
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:55,120
it’s just making a sweet one.

2067
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:56,000
If it’s with someone else,

2068
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:56,920
we make a whole string.

2069
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:58,000
Let’s keep it as a memento.

2070
01:25:58,560 --> 01:25:58,960
Yeah.

2071
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:00,800
Do you know what I like the most?

2072
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:02,040
The line I think is super romantic.

2073
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:03,040
Do you know which one?

2074
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:05,400
Which one?

2075
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:09,120
It’s when she asks, “Will you lie?”

2076
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:09,200
Then Mr. Fang says something.

2077
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:09,280
Then Mr. Fang says something.

2078
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:10,160
Then Mr. Fang says something.

2079
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:12,480
He says, “If you want to test me next time,

2080
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:13,520
just let me swear an oath.”

2081
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:16,400
That means he

2082
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:17,240
gave one of his

2083
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:19,480
controllable secrets

2084
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:21,320
a secret

2085
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:22,880
and then told the other person

2086
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:24,280
saying, next time if you want to

2087
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:25,000
control me

2088
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,560
I’ll definitely listen to you

2089
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:27,720
do you get it?

2090
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:28,680
At that moment, I said

2091
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:29,920
I’m giving you my remote control

2092
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:30,360
Right

2093
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:31,960
You also want a remote like this

2094
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:34,000
Right, don’t you think it feels like

2095
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
he’s giving you this part of himself

2096
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:36,280
to you

2097
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:36,920
Letting me

2098
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:39,400
control it? And only I know

2099
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:42,880
This is all high-quality conversation

2100
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:43,640
Asked by two people

2101
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:44,200
this question

2102
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:45,480
is actually pretty bold

2103
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:47,720
It’s not just small talk

2104
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:50,080
that you can just brush off

2105
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:51,560
when answering this question

2106
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:51,920
Right

2107
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:53,560
Hey, Hani

2108
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:54,920
Can you say a couple of lines?

2109
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:55,560
People here

2110
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:56,400
You can ask anyone

2111
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:00,360
Let me pick someone

2112
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:01,520
I think that’s even harder

2113
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:02,880
Just go with the flow

2114
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:03,920
Are you into looks?

2115
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:05,120
Are you into looks?

2116
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:05,920
Me?

2117
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:12,840
A good-looking appearance can catch my attention instantly.

2118
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:14,720
But an interesting soul can

2119
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:16,320
hold my heart for a long time.

2120
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:19,040
Here comes the quote of the season.

2121
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:19,560
Everyone,

2122
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:23,360
I think both sides, during this process,

2123
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:24,640
have shown more

2124
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:26,280
of their true selves.

2125
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:27,120
Their sense of freshness and fondness

2126
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:28,560
for each other

2127
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:29,760
is what keeps this connection

2128
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:31,200
moving forward.

2129
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:33,160
Alright,

2130
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:35,320
first, let's congratulate

2131
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:36,080
our friend here

2132
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,400
for receiving

2133
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:38,720
a Heartstone.

2134
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:39,520
That's right.

2135
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:40,520
Next,

2136
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:41,120
let's take a look at

2137
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:42,280
the second group's date.

2138
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:43,120
Who will it be?
