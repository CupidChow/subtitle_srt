1
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,040
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,360
We're back again.

3
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,560
Let's introduce ourselves first.

4
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,760
Hello, everyone.

5
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,760
I'm a Heart Signal observer from Xiaohongshu.

6
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,360
Meng Zhang.

7
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,560
I'll keep you company.

8
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,400
Hello, everyone.

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,040
I'm a Heart Signal observer from Xiaohongshu.

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:40,960
Han Tao Ren'er.

11
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,800
Welcome.

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,080
Alright, hello, everyone.

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,360
I'm from Heart Signal.

14
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,120
Season eight's Xu Rulan, Lanlan.

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:47,840
Hello, everyone.

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm from Heart Signal.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,680
Season eight's Lu Yuan, Xiaoyuan.

18
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,480
Hello, everyone.

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,600
I'm from Heart Signal.

20
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,480
Season eight's Ke Ailin, Duoduo.

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,800
Hello, I'm today's host.

22
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,320
I'm from Heart Signal.

23
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,840
Season eight's Jin Yuxing.

24
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,400
Welcome, Host Jin.

25
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,520
Thank you, Teacher Duoduo.

26
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,160
Let's put on our headphones and continue.

27
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:08,880
Let's keep watching.

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,560
Okay.

29
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,600
So beautiful.

30
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,320
All of Yuxing's descriptions

31
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,120
are so vivid.

32
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,320
I don't know why.

33
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,520
Hearing you say it now

34
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,320
these words again

35
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,080
just feels so like you.

36
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,880
Like something I'd say, right?

37
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,040
What's on your mind?

38
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,240
I think I'm really

39
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:41,920
a bit slow about this.

40
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,480
What do you mean?

41
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,680
It's just a stage in feelings.

42
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,720
A process of getting to know each other.

43
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,240
Is this timing too late?

44
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,560
It was the end of The House

45
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,440
when we were living together.

46
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,360
Then she asked this question.

47
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,120
But I didn't realize

48
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,000
what she meant.

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,200
Whether it was too late.

50
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,240
I actually answered her later in the car.

51
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,640
I think it's not too late.

52
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,600
Even though The House was ending,

53
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,400
it's almost over,

54
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,120
but I think

55
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,520
we're just starting to know each other.

56
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,720
It's only just begun.

57
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,400
Yes.

58
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,480
I also want to ask

59
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,520
the others.

60
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,560
When do you feel

61
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,080
it's too late?

62
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,960
I might feel

63
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,280
the person I like

64
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,840
has already made their choice.

65
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,160
What about Lanlan?

66
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,080
When do you think it's too late?

67
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,360
Too late.

68
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,240
I think

69
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,640
she and Dr. Fang were never too late.

70
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,120
He's more impatient.

71
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,280
Did you understand at that moment?

72
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,320
I understood then.

73
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,040
We were just out of sync then.

74
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,120
Our communication was out of sync.

75
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,480
I think it's probably

76
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,560
a matter of pace.

77
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,160
Because I think both Chi Chi and I

78
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,280
are slow-paced people.

79
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,840
We're both slow-paced.

80
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,880
Yeah, those two.

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,760
I think their core is the same.

82
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,360
They're in sync.

83
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,880
Who asked?

84
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,360
Are you going to fly kites?

85
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,400
He really cares.

86
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,920
I couldn't hold it in then.

87
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,640
He didn't want to miss your big moment.

88
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,520
I ship it.

89
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,160
Starting to "hate" again.

90
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,840
Can't take it anymore.

91
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,680
Do you need it?

92
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,800
No.

93
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
Not yet.

94
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,440
I'm pretty happy right now.

95
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,200
If I need it, anytime.

96
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,360
Yes, call the roll.

97
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,000
Today's host, Xiao Jin.

98
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,680
So good-looking.

99
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,000
This graduation photo is really special.

100
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,200
So good-looking.

101
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,040
This is youth.

102
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,000
Gave me goosebumps.

103
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,360
This gift is amazing.

104
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,280
Don't worry.

105
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,360
Be happy every day.

106
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,280
I thought it said Wang Lechen.

107
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,080
"I hate you."

108
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,840
Xiaoyuan really thinks of others.

109
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,840
I get why you said

110
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,200
"I hate you."

111
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,360
The subtext is

112
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,360
I hate you for making me like you so much.

113
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,960
What if I can't let go?

114
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,400
That's what's behind it.

115
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,440
Alright, little mouth.

116
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,560
Little mouth.

117
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,680
Little mouth.

118
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,480
Perfect reading comprehension.

119
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,880
Flying high.

120
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,200
This scene is so youthful.

121
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,560
Free for me.

122
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,400
That's the perfect compliment.

123
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Thinking "I hate you."

124
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,560
Thinking "hate you."

125
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,880
It feels like the two of them

126
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,400
remembered each other's casual words

127
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,160
without even realizing it.

128
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,680
Then they prepared surprises for each other.

129
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,200
In a relationship,

130
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,400
being truly seen is

131
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,920
a precious thing.

132
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,600
Yes.

133
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,720
They really care.

134
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,720
So when you watched it live today,

135
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,640
seeing the tears and happiness back then,

136
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,480
how did it feel,

137
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,120
was it any different?

138
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,280
I was really moved at the time.

139
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,440
Just like I said before,

140
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,720
because almost no one before

141
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,720
had ever done this

142
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,640
to such an extent for me.

143
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,760
Back then, honestly,

144
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,520
the tears just came

145
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,280
without me realizing.

146
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,280
But looking back now,

147
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:03,840
I feel so happy.

148
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,640
Really joyful.

149
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,200
After watching this part,

150
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,880
is there anything that

151
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,280
left a deep impression on you?

152
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,160
Mainly, Xinjiang was just stunning.

153
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,120
It felt like

154
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,560
our story didn't even matter.

155
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,600
Xinjiang was the real beauty.

156
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,440
Every frame looked like a painting.

157
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,480
You two, in that place,

158
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,240
right there,

159
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,280
every moment felt so romantic.

160
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,120
Like a work of art.

161
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,400
But my favorite scene

162
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,560
was actually you two

163
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,720
standing in the sunlight,

164
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,880
watching the kite together,

165
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,800
as it flew far away.

166
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,160
The sunlight shining through you both.

167
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,560
When Wang Lechen first took out the kite,

168
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,600
he told me to write down

169
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,480
my sadness and regrets on it.

170
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,840
So when the kite flew away,

171
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,040
our worries would fly away too.

172
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,600
But at that moment,

173
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,240
I wrote blessings for him instead.

174
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,200
So he wrote some

175
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,280
blessings for me too.

176
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:53,960
And I thought

177
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,360
Xinjiang is a magical place.

178
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,000
It's just that

179
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,120
maybe because we saw

180
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,080
we wrote blessings,

181
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,600
the blessings wouldn't fly away.

182
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,160
So in the end, it came back down.

183
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,240
You have to keep the blessings

184
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,920
close to the people around you.

185
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,040
Yes.

186
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,520
So beautiful.

187
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,840
Suddenly realized

188
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,480
you're glowing, right?

189
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,160
How did you all pick your seats

190
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,400
in the car?

191
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,680
Everyone rushed over

192
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,280
and just sat down.

193
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,440
It was all spontaneous.

194
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,480
Dr. Fang would always choose to sit

195
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,920
It's all fate, just fate.

196
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,880
What else could it be?

197
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,960
When Dr. Fang is with Lanlan,

198
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,520
it really feels different.

199
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,280
His whole mood

200
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,800
gets a lot brighter.

201
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,600
You mean when he's with you,

202
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,200
is it a different vibe?

203
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,800
Yes, that's right.

204
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,480
When he's with me, it's like

205
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,040
Yuxing, I really want to go home.

206
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,000
But with Lanlan, it's

207
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,480
Where are we heading from?

208
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,200
When I was sitting there,

209
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,160
I just knew

210
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,320
he was going to ask that.

211
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,040
Yeah, I was just waiting.

212
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,200
Counting down in my head.

213
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,160
Three, two, one.

214
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,760
Okay, he asked.

215
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,160
That's why I laughed.

216
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,520
So at that moment,

217
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,520
did you know Chichi's answer?

218
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,360
Honestly,

219
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,800
I never actually asked

220
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,400
who Chichi's answer was.

221
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,440
First of all,

222
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,120
I think it's something

223
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,040
she needs to figure out herself.

224
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,320
And with Chichi's personality,

225
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,080
she wouldn't

226
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,240
ask others for

227
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,480
the answer to her own problems.

228
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,400
She's not that kind of person.

229
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,040
She's very

230
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,920
independent and decisive.

231
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,080
Since I'm not her,

232
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,480
I can't really give her advice.

233
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,400
Yes.

234
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,400
Just like Zihan now,

235
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,920
he needs to figure out

236
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,520
what he really wants.

237
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,840
So pretty.

238
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,320
All the gorgeous girls together.

239
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,440
Showing off their heart signs.

240
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,440
Looks great.

241
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,560
I feel like at the time,

242
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,600
none of us realized

243
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,360
Zihan was feeling that way.

244
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,320
But actually, Zihan

245
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,200
isn't someone who

246
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,480
shows his feelings

247
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,480
in front of all his friends,

248
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,360
especially when he's down.

249
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,160
When we saw him,

250
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:37,920
at that moment,

251
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,640
when we took the group photo,

252
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,360
Zihan was actually

253
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:40,840
doing fine.

254
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,840
Yes, that's right.

255
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,000
It's just when we didn't see him,

256
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,360
he was... yeah.

257
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,520
Let's keep watching then.

258
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,400
Why is "Little Bunny" nodding?

259
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,080
Gossip-watching emoji.

260
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,400
Just waiting here.

261
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,800
Not bad at all.

262
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,440
This emoji

263
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,240
It's all because I type too slow.

264
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,200
I love watching you two chat.

265
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,000
Best friends' conversations

266
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,720
are so fun to watch.

267
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,160
Flashback.

268
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,240
Avoiding it.

269
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,280
Still remembered at that moment.

270
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,120
About to cry.

271
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,840
Stubborn.

272
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,880
But he's different with you.

273
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,280
Being nice to others isn't always people-pleasing.

274
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,000
Maybe they're just genuinely kind.

275
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,360
I just saw it earlier.

276
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,400
Chichi mentioned Zihan.

277
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,640
She said he has a people-pleasing personality.

278
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,640
But actually, Zihan is more about

279
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,480
really caring about Chichi’s feelings.

280
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,920
So I’m quite curious too.

281
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,680
In a romantic relationship,

282
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,880
do you prefer

283
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,120
what kind of way to get along?

284
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,760
Is it partner first or self first?

285
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,040
Love yourself first, then love others.

286
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,200
Love others after.

287
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,160
If I’m willing to

288
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,200
do something for this person,

289
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,320
reflect on myself,

290
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,360
or make sacrifices for them,

291
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:16,760
that means

292
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,760
I truly like this person.

293
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,200
I really care about them.

294
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,240
So I think

295
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,120
there’s no absolute answer.

296
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,000
But I think

297
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
But I think

298
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,880
Changing for someone is fine,

299
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,480
but you must hold on to

300
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,480
some things about yourself.

301
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,440
You still need to stick to

302
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,320
You can’t just

303
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,800
give up everything for someone

304
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,760
without limits.

305
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,320
Right, yes, that’s spot on.

306
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,840
Yuan seems thoughtful.

307
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,720
I agree.

308
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,520
Because I’m also someone

309
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,400
who thinks self should come first.

310
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,240
Self first.

311
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,360
I just thought about it deeply.

312
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,800
Because in close relationships,

313
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,760
I don’t want my partner

314
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,680
to sacrifice too much for me.

315
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,280
I hope they can

316
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,760
focus on their own life.

317
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,720
Both sides, based on

318
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,680
being whole as themselves,

319
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,920
then we can have

320
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,560
an intimate relationship.

321
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:02,600
An intimate relationship.

322
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,920
Yes, I think so too.

323
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,040
But in a relationship,

324
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,800
I think it depends on the situation.

325
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,040
It depends on the issue.

326
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,000
For small things,

327
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,640
my personality is

328
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,520
I’d put my partner first.

329
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,560
It doesn’t really matter.

330
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,240
If they insist on hotpot,

331
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,160
let’s go.

332
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,960
Right?

333
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,240
I think everything tastes good anyway.

334
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,200
Doesn’t matter.

335
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,080
Yeah, it’s fine.

336
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,600
But for things

337
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,160
that are more important,

338
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,600
like my boundaries,

339
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:27,920
I think

340
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,360
or

341
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,680
defending my own self,

342
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,560
I can’t please you

343
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,600
by just going along with you.

344
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,400
Or by trying to appease you.

345
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,480
I can’t do that.

346
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,520
I hope both of us

347
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,200
can face this issue directly.

348
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,120
Because in the future,

349
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,800
this could become

350
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,880
a huge obstacle for us.

351
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,640
We’d better solve it early.

352
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,480
And then

353
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,240
everyone talked a lot

354
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,880
about relationship issues

355
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,640
and their own opinions.

356
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,640
Next, there’s a little game.

357
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,760
Let’s do something light.

358
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,600
Let’s have some fun.

359
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,680
Let’s see how well you know

360
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,480
the guys in The House.

361
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,000
Do you really know them?

362
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,320
Have you paid close attention?

363
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,480
To some of their

364
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:08,920
traits?

365
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,960
Traits, yes.

366
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,560
There’s a prize for this game.

367
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,680
What prize?

368
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,000
The prize is

369
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,520
the Heart Signal Sports Day’s

370
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,560
Heartbeat Necklace.

371
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,520
It’s beautiful.

372
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,880
So pretty.

373
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,640
Yeah, take a look.

374
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,200
So lovely.

375
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,400
I know, Ruilong.

376
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,440
You’re really quick.

377
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,040
Ruilong.

378
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,520
Got it right, didn’t I?

379
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,800
Jiao-ge.

380
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,720
Other girls, keep it up!

381
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,280
Next one.

382
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,040
Okay.

383
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:48,720
I think this one

384
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,360
should be pretty obvious.

385
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,640
Who is it?

386
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,200
It’s...

387
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,320
It’s...

388
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,800
It’s...

389
00:22:59,320 --> 00:22:59,840
It is.

390
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,480
Yes.

391
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,320
It’s Xiao Fang.

392
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,920
Right, no glasses frame.

393
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,080
Xiao Fang without glasses.

394
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,320
That big grin gives it away.

395
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,320
Who’s this?

396
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,600
This is...

397
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,360
Which one is this?

398
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,920
Chen-ge.

399
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,560
And next.

400
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,440
Zi Han.

401
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:20,880
Zi Han.

402
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,440
Zi Han.

403
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,600
I think it’s actually pretty clear.

404
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,800
Lips.

405
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,520
Lips.

406
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,600
Thick lips.

407
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,520
The upper and lower lips are just right.

408
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,800
Jin Yuxing.

409
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,760
Upper lip.

410
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,080
Upper lip, right?

411
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:33,720
Isn’t it because...

412
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,120
Is this the sixth one?

413
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,160
Because we only have six guys.

414
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,840
Yeah, that’s right.

415
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,400
Guessed every single one.

416
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,280
Guessed every single one.

417
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,200
Awesome.

418
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,240
So that means...

419
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:49,280
I’m giving this Heartbeat Necklace

420
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,400
this set to

421
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,040
our two new friends.

422
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,680
Hope you come play again next time.

423
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,760
Thank you.

424
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,360
Thank you.

425
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,160
It’s the same necklace as Ruilong and Jue’er’s.

426
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,360
They’re a pair.

427
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,360
Ruilong and...

428
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,960
The necklaces are a pair.

429
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,240
The necklaces are a pair.

430
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,480
Maybe I’m not saying this well...

431
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,320
Because this is

432
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,880
our Heartbeat Necklace.

433
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,760
It also carries The House’s

434
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,720
blessings for you two.

435
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,880
Wishing you, no matter

436
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,520
if it’s friendship or love,

437
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,920
may good things and luck follow you.

438
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,760
Yes.

439
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,400
Thank you.

440
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,400
You can share this with your partner

441
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:24,840
or with friends, either way.

442
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,160
Thank you.

443
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:26,960
Glad you could join us.

444
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,600
Thank you.

445
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,400
So next,

446
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,120
let’s keep watching.

447
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:32,400
Alright.

448
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,320
Sure!

449
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,600
It’s my turn.

450
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,640
Is this the roof?

451
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,520
No.

452
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,280
There’s a spot by the door

453
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,440
where you can sit.

454
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,720
So thoughtful.

455
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,280
What is it?

456
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,200
“Chen-ge’s Special Mix”

457
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,480
Sorry.

458
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,200
Jin-ge got called out.

459
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,680
I was totally stunned.

460
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,080
Sorry.

461
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,080
Apologies.

462
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,080
Happy.

463
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,680
Xiao Yuan is also a Master of Mishearing.

464
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,800
Long distance basically

465
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,120
makes

466
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,920
issues between you two bigger.

467
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,080
Not bigger,

468
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,720
just that solving problems

469
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,000
costs a bit more effort.

470
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,400
Long distance does have more challenges.

471
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,520
Because when you’re communicating

472
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,840
just through text, it feels cold.

473
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,560
And then,

474
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,720
when you’re anxious,

475
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,000
reading those messages

476
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,040
can make you misunderstand things.

477
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,320
You can’t really

478
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,480
feel each other’s emotions in the moment.

479
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,120
So when there’s conflict,

480
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,200
face-to-face is definitely

481
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,120
more convenient and direct.

482
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,480
I think you also need to figure out

483
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,600
what you need in this relationship.

484
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,080
What do you want?

485
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,200
Do you need support,

486
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,320
or maybe acceptance,

487
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,440
emotional companionship and resonance,

488
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:22,120
or do you need them in your daily life

489
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,200
to help solve all kinds of problems?

490
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,400
When those needs are different,

491
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,480
your view on long distance

492
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,080
becomes pretty clear.

493
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,440
Who wouldn’t want a friend like that?

494
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,160
I do.

495
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,280
Two ENFJs (MBTI personality types)

496
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,960
and an ENFP (MBTI personality type).

497
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,680
That’s hilarious.

498
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,960
Sitting on pins and needles, right?

499
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,000
Take another one.

500
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,320
Pat your hand.

501
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,040
So, Duoduo, may I ask you something?

502
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,200
Looking back at your departure then,

503
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,240
how do you feel about it now?

504
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,560
Actually, when I see myself leaving,

505
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,960
I feel it was a very complete moment.

506
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,080
Because our journey together

507
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,240
was how we got to know each other.

508
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,440
And then, through this journey,

509
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,160
we ended the summer in The House.

510
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,640
we wrapped up our summer in The House.

511
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,040
I was truly moved.

512
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,120
Because during this trip, Duoduo

513
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,480
didn't form a romantic relationship,

514
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,880
a close romantic bond,

515
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,760
but actually built

516
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,560
many deep connections.

517
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,320
She had meaningful exchanges

518
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,560
with everyone on a soul level.

519
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,240
So, with Duoduo, I felt

520
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,040
things that go beyond Heart Signal.

521
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,360
There were so many.

522
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,760
Duoduo is someone with

523
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,080
a truly strong core.

524
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,320
I think this summer,

525
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:31,800
I also gained

526
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,840
a wonderful friendship.

527
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,560
That's right.

528
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,440
But I also hope you find

529
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,480
someone you truly trust.

530
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,120
Thank you.

531
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,120
Today, we also watched

532
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,920
Xiaoyuan's trial romance trip.

533
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,000
He went all the way to Xinjiang.

534
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,200
So, Xiaoyuan, I want to ask you,

535
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,520
when this journey ended,

536
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,720
for you,

537
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,760
how did you feel about it?

538
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,640
My first feeling was that it was great.

539
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,520
Because in Xinjiang,

540
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,880
while in Xinjiang,

541
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,800
I communicated more with Chen.

542
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,880
We talked a lot more.

543
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,520
We also spent more time together.

544
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,920
We got to

545
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,320
understand each other's thoughts better.

546
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,880
He also made up for

547
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,800
many regrets in my life.

548
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,440
And he also made up for

549
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,040
some things missing

550
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,640
in his own life.

551
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,080
So, during this journey,

552
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,880
we gained even more.

553
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,080
We both felt Heart Signal.

554
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,800
And it gave us

555
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,720
more support between us.

556
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,160
While enjoying the present,

557
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,600
we could heal some past regrets.

558
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,960
I think that's a wonderful thing.

559
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,880
And that's all for

560
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,320
today's "Watching Heart Signal with You."

561
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,000
How does everyone feel after watching?

562
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,120
I think when sensing my own Heart Signal,

563
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,920
I'm a bit slow with feelings.

564
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,480
It was only after rewatching

565
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,360
that I realized there were

566
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,720
so many emotions and subtle expressions

567
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,640
that I didn't notice

568
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,880
while I was actually there.

569
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,600
I didn't notice them.

570
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:57,920
That's right.

571
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,560
If I talk about my feelings,

572
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,200
I think, as everyone said,

573
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,280
it's all an experience.

574
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,600
And during this journey,

575
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,760
I felt all the kindness.

576
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,360
I truly felt lucky.

577
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,240
And very happy.

578
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,680
Mainly because

579
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,520
everyone is genuine.

580
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,200
Yes.

581
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,840
Up to now, I hope

582
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,600
no matter what happens in The House,

583
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,160
whatever the outcome is,

584
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,440
everyone can thank themselves

585
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,920
for their honesty and courage.

586
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,720
Say it to yourself,

587
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,640
thank you for being you.

588
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,320
Awesome.

589
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,400
Applause.

590
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,320
Before, I watched at home

591
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,760
as an observer.

592
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,080
Just watching you all.

593
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:38,840
But coming here,

594
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,160
I truly felt

595
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:40,840
your friendships,

596
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,840
your feelings,

597
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,080
your emotions.

598
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,880
It made me feel so happy.

599
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,920
It made me truly happy.

600
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,320
So today,

601
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,280
it was so worth it for us to come.

602
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,200
I never thought I'd cry here.

603
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,360
So I want to ask,

604
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,480
when can we

605
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,000
watch Confession Night directly?

606
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,360
I want to see it too.

607
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I really want to see it.

608
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,560
But honestly,

609
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,360
I think today,

610
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,640
watching the show together

611
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,520
feels completely

612
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,640
different.

613
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,040
Asking questions live is fun.

614
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,200
So I think

615
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,160
everyone watching at home

616
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,360
can invite their friends

617
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,200
to watch our show together.

618
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,000
Or go on Xiaohongshu

619
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,600
and discuss with others online.

620
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,320
You can get the same

621
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,880
shared viewing experience as us.

622
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:28,240
We have small gifts for you.

623
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,720
Thank you.

624
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,320
So cute!

625
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,040
We also prepared

626
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,840
some gifts for our two new friends.

627
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,120
It's our Heartbeat Puppy.

628
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,080
So adorable!

629
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,520
They can even stick together.

630
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,760
So, let's all

631
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,400
let's all

632
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,320
take a group photo

633
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,360
to capture this beautiful moment.

634
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:51,720
Okay.

635
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,160
Alright.

636
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:52,960
Great.

637
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,000
Watching Heart Signal with You

638
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,480
Heart Signal never ends

639
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,000
See you next time
