1
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,560
You say "start" and we start.

2
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,240
That's awesome.

3
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,440
Actually, I didn't see it.

4
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,040
I got excited and missed it.

5
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,920
I saw it.

6
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,520
I saw it too.

7
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,440
The referee really missed it.

8
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,160
Requesting a "rematch."

9
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,960
"Rematch."

10
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,920
Watching you.

11
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,360
Let's do it.

12
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,040
Come on.

13
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,400
Time to test my dance skills.

14
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:39,440
Time to test my dance skills.

15
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,800
What's going on?

16
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,680
Let me tell you.

17
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,240
I practiced several times in Xinjiang.

18
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:49,680
I'm telling you.

19
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,880
Then let's do it.

20
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,520
Start.

21
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,080
Okay.

22
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:55,800
Then let's do it.

23
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,440
Start.

24
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,360
Both of us can dance.

25
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,280
Now it's our turn to choose.

26
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,360
One, two, three, like this.

27
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,400
In order, okay?

28
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,800
Raise your hand if you pick one.

29
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,680
Me.

30
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,480
I pick too.

31
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,720
Raise your hand if you pick two.

32
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,960
Raise your hand if you pick three.

33
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,440
You guys split the votes so well.

34
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,800
You guys are good at this.

35
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,560
So now it's two points.

36
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,840
Three points.

37
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,800
One point.

38
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,440
Congratulations to us.

39
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,600
Chichi and Herry's team

40
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,040
wins the team leader spot.

41
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,080
Now it's our turn.

42
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,560
Time to test our brains.

43
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,080
You're blocking my view of them.

44
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,440
Aren't you watching the host?

45
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,720
Aren't you watching the answerer?

46
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,120
First question.

47
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,480
Who was the first to bring cake

48
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,480
back to Heartbeat Apartment?

49
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,760
Quick, answer!

50
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,440
You go ahead.

51
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,240
This one's pretty tough.

52
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,760
I know who it is too.

53
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:26,600
You go.

54
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,400
Chichi.

55
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,720
That's right.

56
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,560
One point.

57
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,680
The cake for the house's birthday.

58
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,640
Right, we ate it at the Western restaurant.

59
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,280
Second question.

60
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,120
The gym wall in Heartbeat Apartment

61
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,240
is what color?

62
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,360
You can't even remember this?

63
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,600
Purple.

64
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,280
That's right.

65
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,640
So impressive.

66
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,240
Awesome.

67
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,600
This one's a bit hard.

68
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,480
This one's a bit hard.

69
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,080
Listen to the question.

70
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,040
How many languages does Rui Long speak?

71
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,680
He doesn't even know himself.

72
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,480
He forgot for a second.

73
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,720
Does Shanghainese count?

74
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,800
He only knows one phrase.

75
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,200
Buzz in!

76
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:22,960
Duoduo.

77
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,120
I think there are

78
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,160
German,

79
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,720
Chinese,

80
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,440
English,

81
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,840
French,

82
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,200
Spanish.

83
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,800
It's fine, just say how many.

84
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,440
Five.

85
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,920
I think that's correct.

86
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,720
Okay, Duoduo gets one point.

87
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,760
My main languages are

88
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,000
Chinese, German, English, and French.

89
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:46,720
Thank you.

90
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,200
And the rest are just "add insult to injury."

91
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,920
"Add insult to injury."

92
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,040
"Add insult to injury."

93
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,400
"Add insult to injury."

94
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,080
That's called "icing on the cake."

95
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,560
"Add insult to injury" means when things are bad.

96
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,080
That one's "icing on the cake."

97
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,000
Next question.

98
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,080
Okay.

99
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,840
Next question.

100
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,560
Quickly name

101
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,520
all the Kang Sifu Moli Cha flavors.

102
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,400
Your eyes are so determined.

103
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,760
Your hand is just like this.

104
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,640
Like a machine.

105
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,960
Say them quickly.

106
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,640
Jasmine Pure Tea,

107
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,280
Jasmine Flower Tea,

108
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,200
Jasmine Honey Tea,

109
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,240
Jasmine Longjing,

110
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,400
Jasmine Pomelo Tea.

111
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,520
Correct.

112
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,880
Three, one.

113
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,920
Way ahead.

114
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,320
I thought someone would compete with me.

115
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:31,560
You guys.

116
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,840
Buzz in!

117
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,280
Which three girls' moms

118
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,480
have visited Heartbeat Apartment?

119
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,400
Duoduo.

120
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,960
Duoduo was quick on this one.

121
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,960
Did you buzz in?

122
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
My mom,

123
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,120
Chichi's mom,

124
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,240
Xiaoyuan's mom.

125
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,480
Okay, Duoduo gets two points.

126
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,560
This one's easy.

127
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,760
At the open day sports meet,

128
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,040
did the boys from 801 win tug-of-war

129
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,120
or the boys from 802?

130
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,840
It's easy.

131
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,240
Don't put so much pressure on me.

132
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,160
I'm thinking.

133
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,640
802, second floor, right?

134
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,480
Right, Duoduo gets three points.

135
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,440
You hesitated.

136
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,840
Second floor, right?

137
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,320
On the dog-walking diary,

138
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,640
Which boy's name

139
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,960
shows up the most often?

140
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,800
Yifan

141
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,200
Jin Yuxing

142
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,000
Yes, it's definitely Jin Yuxing.

143
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:20,960
Right.

144
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,520
Score one point.

145
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,240
Go for it!

146
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,720
Go for it!

147
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,640
Next question.

148
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,760
Match point.

149
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,280
Guys,

150
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,400
get excited for us!

151
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,360
Go for it!

152
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,720
Yifan, go for it!

153
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,760
This one.

154
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:38,640
This one.

155
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,160
It's him.

156
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,960
You might not actually know.

157
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,440
At the Open Day sports event,

158
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,720
who were the two announcers?

159
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,920
Zhang Jin and Zeng Zhaohao.

160
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,480
Correct.

161
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,160
Correct.

162
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,600
Is this the last one?

163
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,320
This is the last one.

164
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,760
If Duoduo gets this one right,

165
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,640
it'll be a tie.

166
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,120
Go for it!

167
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,560
In Heartbeat Apartment,

168
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,840
the first hot pot cooking—

169
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,760
was it in 801 or 802?

170
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:00,920
Duoduo.

171
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,640
802.

172
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,560
We cooked it together.

173
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,360
Yes, the 802 kitchen.

174
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,240
Sorry.

175
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:08,800
Match point.

176
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,360
It's match point.

177
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,640
You two face off again.

178
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,200
We'll come up with our own question.

179
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,280
Who's best at making up questions?

180
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,120
This "Game King" here.

181
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,560
Why am I getting all the pressure?

182
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,920
Game King.

183
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,400
Right.

184
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,560
I'm under a lot of pressure.

185
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,200
I need to think of one.

186
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,080
A question that's pretty fair.

187
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,320
Let me think.

188
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,400
Any question you ask,

189
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,760
the three of us will be knocked out.

190
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,480
Don't worry.

191
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,120
I remember now.

192
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,440
On the second Open Day,

193
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,800
who made the Mao Xue Wang dish?

194
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,800
No one's jumping in?

195
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,400
I got squeezed out, sorry.

196
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,160
Yes, Jiao Ge.

197
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,960
Too easy.

198
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,440
Add one point.

199
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,320
Duoduo wins.

200
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,680
Alright.

201
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,880
The newcomer takes the lead.

202
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,840
Awesome.

203
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,320
Thank you, thank you judge, thanks.

204
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,480
That's my style.

205
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,760
Come on.

206
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,360
Push-up high five.

207
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,560
I've been waiting for the next event.

208
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,720
Should we take off our shirts?

209
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:17,800
That's intense.

210
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,440
Anyone want to be team leader?

211
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,200
They want to pick internally.

212
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,160
No.

213
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,560
Wait, is it a double-handed clap?

214
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,480
How do you do a double-handed clap?

215
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,760
Single hand, bro.

216
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,000
What double hand?

217
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,920
Single hand.

218
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,160
Single hand clap, got it.

219
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,040
You, double hand.

220
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,800
A bit nervous.

221
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,160
A bit nervous.

222
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,680
Haven't done this in ages.

223
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,360
Alright, let's go.

224
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:41,880
Three.

225
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,400
Two.

226
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,120
One, go!

227
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,040
One.

228
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,600
One.

229
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:51,960
Two.

230
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,960
Very standard.

231
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,040
Betting a man's pride.

232
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,640
So steady.

233
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,120
Twenty.

234
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,600
Twenty-one.

235
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,040
Twenty-two.

236
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,720
Twenty-two.

237
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,080
Right now,

238
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,240
on the faces of the three guys,

239
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,200
there's not a hint of

240
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,200
change.

241
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,200
Means it hasn't even started.

242
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,160
I think Jin Yuxing will win.

243
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,560
I think Jin Yuxing will win too.

244
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,240
He trains every day.

245
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,240
Day after day.

246
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,280
Rui Long is strong too.

247
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,520
Rui Long said last time he could do eighty.

248
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,680
Rui Long said last time he could do eighty.

249
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,520
They start at two hundred.

250
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,400
Today, we're going to wreck our hands.

251
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,360
Thirty-nine.

252
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,520
I give up.

253
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,560
Jiao Ge has dropped out.

254
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,560
That "Super Soldier" guy—

255
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,400
Super Soldier Rui Long.

256
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,080
Jin Yuxing said, "I didn't win the sports event,

257
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,600
so I have to win this one today."

258
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,720
I think Jin Yuxing will win.

259
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,680
I think Jin Yuxing will win too.

260
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,880
Jin Yuxing is steadier.

261
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,000
Forty-three.

262
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,000
That's the limit.

263
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,320
Forget it.

264
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,160
Awesome.

265
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,720
So cool.

266
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,640
So impressive.

267
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,360
Jin Yuxing.

268
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,600
Has won our

269
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,120
team leader spot.

270
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,280
So, the three team leaders

271
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,880
have all been chosen.

272
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,640
This one.

273
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,720
Duck helmet.

274
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,120
This one's pretty funny.

275
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,760
Alright, we'll go with this.

276
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,200
Okay.

277
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,960
So, we'll be this team.

278
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,760
We'll go with this.

279
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,480
Okay.

280
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,200
I feel like this is a big move.

281
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,000
Let me check.

282
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,800
You can use anything in the house

283
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,200
as your prop.

284
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,640
Okay.

285
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,360
Let's go.

286
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,000
Alright.

287
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,480
Let's go.

288
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,120
Do you want me to put this on you?

289
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,920
How do you want to wear it?

290
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,440
Just hang it on me.

291
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,160
Just put it on my head.

292
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,840
It really works.

293
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,960
Just hang it right on.

294
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,800
I can wear that headband.

295
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,720
Let's try "romantic" first.

296
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,480
For two people.

297
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,000
Sure.

298
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,120
Then let the teacher help us try.

299
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,680
Okay.

300
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,360
Teacher, try it first.

301
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,920
Let's take a couple shot first.

302
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,720
Alright, come on.

303
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:46,360
Come.

304
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:46,640
Come.

305
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,680
I'll carry you.

306
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,000
Move down a bit.

307
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,160
My poor back.

308
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,400
Here we go.

309
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,480
We can be romantic.

310
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,160
We can be romantic.

311
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,760
Kind of like "Wolf Granny."

312
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,240
Does it look like "Wolf Granny?"

313
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,760
Let's put on one more.

314
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,240
There are five of us.

315
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,080
We're five "dogs."

316
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,760
Sorry.

317
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,400
Sorry, I said what I really think.

318
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,400
Five "dogs," that's wild.

319
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,400
That's a bit sad.

320
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,680
Quick, five "dogs" here.

321
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,880
Ready, three, two, one.

322
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,600
This is real joy.

323
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,520
Let's take a few more.

324
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,000
Impressive.

325
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,120
Let's shoot something else.

326
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,880
Ready, three, two, one, throw.

327
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,320
I want it to flip.

328
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,720
I want that flipping vibe.

329
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,240
Especially your outfits today.

330
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,720
They really fit the theme.

331
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,440
All I can say is—

332
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,240
Look up there.

333
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,760
We're a bit more dramatic this way.

334
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,560
Just happy.

335
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,200
Yeah, this works.

336
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,920
Yes, this is fine.

337
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,920
Let's take a "Capture the Joy" shot.

338
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,720
Come on.

339
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:39,920
Look at me.

340
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,400
Give me your hand.

341
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,560
Strike a pose.

342
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,360
Like this.

343
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:49,920
Right here.

344
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,240
I'm holding this, right?

345
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,000
Pinch my cheek.

346
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,920
And there's that one.

347
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,200
Capture "X."

348
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:17,800
Let's go.

349
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,080
Alright, we're done shooting.

350
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,480
Let's play with the bubble gun.

351
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,000
"Battle."

352
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,080
Your hands do get cold easily.

353
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,200
They're really cold.

354
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,160
Are your feet cold?

355
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,280
Do your feet get cold easily?

356
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,000
Don't you feel it's chilly?

357
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,360
No, it's me who feels it.

358
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:22,880
Is it you?

359
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,000
Let's see a Chinese doctor.

360
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,880
Ask Duoduo about Chinese medicine.

361
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,880
Get some treatment.

362
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,200
Cold constitution.

363
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,120
Pick nine photos first.

364
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,680
Then choose three more, okay.

365
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,200
This set is actually good.

366
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,560
You're so fair-skinned.

367
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,320
Let's pick these two sets.

368
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,640
This one's good.

369
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,240
I think so.

370
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:52,960
Sure.

371
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,240
This works.

372
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,640
This one's nice.

373
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,200
It's decided.

374
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,240
Rock, paper, scissors.

375
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,320
Paper.

376
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,680
Rock, paper, scissors.

377
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,960
You were slow.

378
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,640
No, I wasn't.

379
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,800
Rock, paper, scissors.

380
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,120
Paper.

381
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,360
Let's look together.

382
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,440
Come on, let's check it out.

383
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:17,720
Photo one.

384
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,280
Photo one.

385
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,120
Photo two.

386
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:19,760
Two.

387
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,480
Yes, that's the one.

388
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,560
Romance is for you guys.

389
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,320
Absolutely.

390
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:23,840
Alright then.

391
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,680
This one.

392
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,920
I think these few

393
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,200
Just pick one where no one's blinking.

394
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,040
I think we can pick a solo shot.

395
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,360
His is fine too, I think.

396
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:32,960
I'm good with it.

397
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,000
Let's be honest.

398
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,200
We took quite a lot.

399
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,480
This one has a vibe.

400
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,440
Yeah.

401
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,640
This one's good.

402
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,560
I think this one's nice too.

403
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,000
Yeah.

404
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,720
This is romantic.

405
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,640
Anyway, this one's definitely cute.

406
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,320
Isn't it supposed to be about joy?

407
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,000
Show the photos.

408
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,840
Guess what we mean.

409
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,600
Then we'll pick one.

410
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,720
They answered correctly.

411
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,200
I said—

412
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,080
That's right.

413
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,120
They might say "future."

414
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:52,640
That's it.

415
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,080
Let's go.

416
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,960
I'll sit across from Lanlan.

417
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,840
Sit where I can reach the food.

418
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,120
Where I can grab from both sides.

419
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,080
I'll sit here.

420
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,720
Okay.

421
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,840
I want some egg.

422
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,200
Lanlan said I didn't get a bite.

423
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,480
I'll serve everyone some egg first.

424
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,640
Go have a couple bites.

425
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,040
Thank you.

426
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,200
Eat more.

427
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,040
Thanks.

428
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,280
One spoonful is enough.

429
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:37,760
Thank you.

430
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,440
That's enough.

431
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,280
It's tasty.

432
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,200
From start to finish.

433
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,880
First meeting and last meeting,

434
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,720
always passing things to everyone.

435
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,280
Let's take a look at the rules first.

436
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,520
Except for your own group's photos,

437
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,280
everyone will

438
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,480
score the photos of the other two groups.

439
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,920
The highest score is ten.

440
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,160
The photo with the highest score

441
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,640
will receive a special prize.

442
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,880
The first theme

443
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,160
is romance.

444
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,840
Romance.

445
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,160
What did I see?

446
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,120
What did you see?

447
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,880
So sudden.

448
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,360
That shot really has a vibe.

449
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,840
We just happened to

450
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,920
come up with this idea together.

451
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,400
Ours was on a rainy day.

452
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,320
This is a man's kind of romance.

453
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,560
It's something every guy wants

454
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,080
on a rainy day—

455
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:45,720
to get soaked in the rain.

456
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,520
Yeah, getting soaked.

457
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,480
And then tossing the umbrella.

458
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,320
I think it's a really joyful

459
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,240
moment of letting yourself go.

460
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,000
That's our take

461
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,440
on what romance means to men.

462
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,240
Understanding.

463
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:55,920
Yeah.

464
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,680
As for our group,

465
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,400
mainly,

466
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,320
we think the word "romance"

467
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,200
is actually tied to love.

468
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,280
But the word "love"

469
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,240
is like an umbrella.

470
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,600
It might tilt sometimes,

471
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,240
but whether it's family, romance, or friendship,

472
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,040
this umbrella has no set definition.

473
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,600
Sometimes, when you're alone,

474
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,080
your umbrella might accidentally fall.

475
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:17,760
Or something else happens.

476
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,200
You don't always have to look down.

477
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:20,880
Look up instead.

478
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,000
Maybe you'll find

479
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,760
someone unexpected

480
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,800
appearing from the light

481
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,640
to shield you from the rain.

482
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,760
Today's rainy day

483
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,640
really fits our own definition.

484
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,120
We actually think this theme

485
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,040
is also part of the romance journey.

486
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,120
Herry (Liu Zihan)

487
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,200
I think picking a good set of photos

488
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,400
comes down to a few basics.

489
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,400
First, it should fit the theme.

490
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,800
Second, the composition should look good.

491
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,600
Third, it needs to show emotion.

492
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,040
I think "capturing romance"

493
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,240
really happened on our confession night.

494
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,240
Those moments and scenes.

495
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:17,760
And here,

496
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,680
it's like yesterday all over again.

497
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,840
Yeah, yesterday replayed.

498
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:21,960
Right.

499
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,200
Yeah, for me,

500
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,440
it's a really great

501
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,200
"capturing romance" theme.

502
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,280
Let's score first, everyone.

503
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,560
How do we score?

504
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,520
I think they're all pretty good.

505
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,960
I think we should deduct two points from the boys.

506
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,480
That's fair.

507
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,800
Let's go with the girls' group.

508
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,640
Girls' group.

509
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,600
This one really reached a new level.

510
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,480
We give the boys' group eight.

511
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,800
And the girls' group ten.

512
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,520
Brothers' group, eight.

513
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,640
Sisters, ten.

514
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,000
Then brothers, seven.

515
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,120
Sisters' group gets eight.

516
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,160
Congratulations.

517
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,120
Alright, let's present the award.

518
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,440
Thanks to our award presenters.

519
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,800
Let's stand one on each side.

520
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,680
He asked why I'm in the middle.

521
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,760
What am I supposed to do?

522
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,560
Rui Long

523
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,480
This scene is really

524
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,760
You talk, then I talk.

525
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:35,760
You go.

526
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:36,760
I'll go.

527
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,360
Okay.

528
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,760
Simply put,

529
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,520
happiness is the two of us.

530
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:41,920
Alright.

531
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,560
Rui Long's smile is so healing.

532
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,400
With Weini and Nicole,

533
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,440
there were still lots of happy times.

534
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,920
We dressed them up.

535
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,080
Played with them.

536
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,000
We just feel

537
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,680
it's not just the three of us who were happy.

538
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,600
It's the happiness of the whole Heartbeat Apartment.

539
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,200
The apartment is kind of like

540
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,280
a world wrapped in bubbles.

541
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,160
But bubbles

542
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,920
eventually burst.

543
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,480
Then things end and pass by.

544
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,920
But we still

545
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,760
have hope for what's next.

546
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,320
First,

547
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,760
this is a "shopping cart" from confession night.

548
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,480
Confession night was really joyful.

549
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,160
And there are ninety-nine balls inside.

550
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,440
It makes us think about what we might

551
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,040
do together in the future.

552
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,200
Splashing in puddles together in summer.

553
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,960
Renting a motorbike.

554
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,200
You navigate, I drive.

555
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,560
If we get lost, we'll have a picnic.

556
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,160
Those are definitely happy things.

557
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,320
This one of Rui Long

558
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,400
feels like a life photo.

559
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,080
Yes.

560
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,680
So for my score, I might

561
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,640
I'm really impressed.

562
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,480
Congrats to the brothers' group (second group).

563
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,800
The "Joy Never Expires" award.

564
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,880
For the last theme,

565
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,200
the "X" theme is a custom one.

566
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,160
Let's get right to it.

567
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,760
Our group happens to be first.

568
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:49,840
Can you tell

569
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,000
what's in our eyes?

570
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,400
Light.

571
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,480
That's right.

572
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,320
It's light.

573
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,960
Yes, there really is a light in our eyes.

574
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,720
Because I think life in the apartment

575
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,160
let us experience summer twice.

576
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,360
At first, when the apartment ended,

577
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,400
it felt like summer was over too.

578
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,240
But when I checked the date,

579
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,280
it seemed like summer had just begun.

580
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,960
So when it comes to the future,

581
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,480
we have big hopes and expectations.

582
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,280
I hope that everyone here

583
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:21,680
all of us,

584
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,640
our friendship in the future

585
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,480
can last for a very long time.

586
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,640
So for us,

587
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,480
this definition

588
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,320
captures a sense of future and hope.

589
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,120
The "x" in this photo

590
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,880
should stand for memories

591
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,800
and blessings.

592
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,440
The memories part is obvious,

593
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,760
because the two of us are the only ones

594
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,720
who started the Dating Getaway in the apartment.

595
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,080
I think pressing the button this time

596
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,880
is a truly

597
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,360
meaningful moment for us.

598
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,560
And lastly, it's about blessings.

599
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,160
When we took the photo,

600
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,160
you only needed to press it once

601
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,840
for it to light up.

602
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,320
But we kept pressing it again and again,

603
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,200
twelve times for twelve people.

604
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,520
We hoped to press it many, many times,

605
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,480
even if some people in the apartment

606
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,200
didn't find someone who made their heart race,

607
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,960
I hope everyone from the apartment

608
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,200
after leaving the apartment

609
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,240
can find someone

610
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,800
to press the Dating Getaway button with

611
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,240
and feel that spark together.

612
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,240
Its tone is dark,

613
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,160
but actually,

614
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,920
we just wanted to use the dark tone

615
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,080
to express

616
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,440
that the future is full of unknowns,

617
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,040
but also full of hope

618
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,360
and endless possibilities.

619
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,960
So my wish for everyone is:

620
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,560
Anything is possible in the future.

621
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,200
Never set limits for yourself.

622
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,160
Let's start scoring now.

623
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,440
How many points do the guys give?

624
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,040
Ten.

625
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,120
Why does this photo make you

626
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,160
look as tall as me?

627
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,360
I'm wearing heels.

628
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,520
We're not the same height!

629
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,400
Everyone gives ten.

630
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,160
Alright.

631
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,280
For this "x" capture,

632
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,000
I give it

633
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,480
nine points.

634
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,280
And then,

635
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,960
the sisters' group gets ten.

636
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,960
Think about it again.

637
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,040
Because that one point

638
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,360
is for not adding anything extra.

639
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,400
I think I'll deduct it for that.

640
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,480
If you add something,

641
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,120
I'll consider giving the full score.

642
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,080
Actually, the sisters and brothers

643
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,280
are tied.

644
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,840
Then let's accept the award together.

645
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,960
You two are on stage again.

646
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,840
It's clear you put a lot of effort in.

647
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,000
Never-ending Story Award.

648
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,320
Okay.

649
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,280
Never-ending Story (Award).

650
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:46,760
Come on.

651
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,880
Where should we go next time?

652
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,240
Shanghai or Hangzhou?

653
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,080
Shanghai.

654
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,480
Shanghai.

655
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,760
Shanghai.

656
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,800
Or maybe Jiaxing?

657
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,080
We can go in the future.

658
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,120
Actually, we could often

659
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,160
just pick a time in the group chat

660
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,360
and all go out together.

661
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,840
On weekends.

662
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,600
Because we've never

663
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,640
gone out together before.

664
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,480
Right.

665
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,000
I'm curious,

666
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,120
what are your

667
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,760
hopes for what's next?

668
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,600
I think life in the apartment

669
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,480
really taught me

670
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,640
different perspectives

671
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,160
and feedback about myself.

672
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,360
If it's good,

673
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,120
I'm very grateful.

674
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,800
If it's negative feedback,

675
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,720
I'll think about it seriously

676
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,800
and try to improve.

677
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,600
In the future,

678
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,280
I will also

679
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,680
keep accepting different

680
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,200
kinds of feedback

681
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,320
and keep growing.

682
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,000
I hope

683
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,880
my future life

684
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,200
is spent with all of you.

685
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,560
For the two of us,

686
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,960
living well is more important than anything.

687
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:24,680
Yes.

688
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,000
I really do

689
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,960
I also hope that after

690
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,440
leaving the apartment,

691
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,600
our friendship keeps going,

692
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,320
and we meet up often.

693
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:36,720
Yes.

694
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,920
Living life well is what matters most.

695
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,520
I think

696
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,400
while immersed in the apartment,

697
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,720
I didn't really feel much.

698
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,920
But looking back now,

699
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,680
I can feel I've changed.

700
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,400
For me personally,

701
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,680
I'm more complete.

702
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,600
For my future path,

703
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,400
I'll be more grounded.

704
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,040
So I'm really looking forward

705
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,000
to life after the apartment.

706
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,600
And now I have many more

707
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,880
reasons to go to Shanghai.

708
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,800
I think that's great.

709
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,600
Let's all raise a glass together.

710
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,040
See you next weekend.

711
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,200
See you next weekend.
