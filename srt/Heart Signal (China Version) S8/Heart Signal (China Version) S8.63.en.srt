1
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,160
Shall we raise our glasses and start eating?

2
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:41,800
Let's raise our glasses.

3
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,560
Come on.

4
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,560
Have a pleasant journey.

5
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,240
Cheers.

6
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,640
We've met again.

7
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,200
Enjoy the trip.

8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,160
Here we meet again.

9
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,800
Cheers.

10
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,600
Let's eat.

11
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,400
I'll try this soup first.

12
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,760
For crab, do you want the claw or the pincer?

13
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,520
The claw.

14
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,120
This counts as the claw.

15
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,280
Either is fine, you choose for me.

16
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,160
Just put it here.

17
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:17,720
Okay.

18
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,120
Do you want some turtle?

19
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,680
I don't eat it.

20
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,280
I care about looks when I eat.

21
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,160
Care about what when eating?

22
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,440
Also care about looks.

23
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,760
Do you want some?

24
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,520
No, really.

25
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:36,960
No, really.

26
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,840
It's fine, I just ate.

27
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,720
Okay.

28
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,520
I just had a little.

29
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,200
You're so considerate.

30
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,760
Thank you.

31
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:46,920
Brother Herry (Liu Zihan)

32
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,120
Caretaker personality.

33
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,600
I think today's food is delicious.

34
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,600
It's tasty.

35
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,800
Today's food is good.

36
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,360
I think so too.

37
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,520
Today's food is really delicious.

38
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,840
What's this bowl for?

39
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,400
Thank you.

40
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,760
No idea.

41
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,480
Can I have a small piece?

42
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,360
Of the turtle.

43
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,080
Turtle, sure.

44
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,360
Yeah, I just want to try it.

45
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,000
Thank you.

46
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,120
Teacher Zihan is quite

47
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,160
funny.

48
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,560
I said I wanted to try turtle.

49
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,400
I've never had turtle before.

50
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,920
He gave me a piece of chicken.

51
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,200
Is there other meat in here?

52
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,120
I thought it was just turtle.

53
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,200
I get it now.

54
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,400
This dish is called "Turtle and Chicken Surprise."

55
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,280
This is definitely chicken.

56
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,640
Let me do it.

57
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,760
I thought it was all turtle inside.

58
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,280
I said the texture feels kind of off.

59
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,640
No one announced the dish name.

60
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,880
Do you want some lily?

61
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,360
This lily is sweet.

62
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,280
It's delicious.

63
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,080
Do you want some?

64
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,600
If you want, I can swap it for you.

65
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,480
She wants to laugh whenever you talk now.

66
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,160
Eating lily is kind of abstract.

67
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,240
I'll take this turtle

68
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,200
and swap it with you, okay?

69
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,000
Sure, no problem.

70
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,400
I can tell.

71
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,360
Now I want turtle.

72
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,600
"Turtle and Chicken Surprise" with you all.

73
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,400
I want "Turtle and Chicken Surprise."

74
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,560
Saying goodbye to you all.

75
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,200
I'll go with Teacher Duoduo.

76
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,720
What's wrong?

77
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,600
I know the bond with chicken feet runs deep.

78
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,800
But I've had a lot of this already.

79
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,280
Then I'll do it.

80
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,080
Why are you laughing again?

81
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,240
They're so weird.

82
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,360
What's up? Share with us.

83
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,480
I'll draw you another one tonight.

84
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,240
Draw one for me.

85
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,400
Lan Lan, draw one for me.

86
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:58,920
Sure, I can.

87
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,920
I'll draw one for you.

88
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,320
Have you seen his drawing of Yuxing?

89
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,080
No.

90
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,120
You even showed Lan Lan your drawing.

91
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,240
Don't move.

92
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,840
Just look, just draw.

93
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,200
This angle is pretty good.

94
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:16,800
I can only

95
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,760
I can only draw you like this.

96
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,160
I'm done drawing.

97
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,960
I'm done.

98
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,520
Sorry.

99
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,320
I didn't show it to anyone else.

100
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:33,920
Didn't show it to anyone else.

101
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,480
No wonder she kept looking at me and laughing today.

102
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,360
It kind of looks like me.

103
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,800
It's Doctor Fang, the "soulful artist."

104
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,880
Let's go for a walk.

105
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,760
Let's go.

106
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,720
No, the lyrics of the love songs we picked

107
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,120
are all so sad.

108
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,520
So sad, but some things

109
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,760
really hit home.

110
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,480
They hit so close.

111
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,200
Yeah, they really do.

112
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,360
So true, really.

113
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,600
Now I get how love songs are written.

114
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,280
Yeah, I never felt that before.

115
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,760
Right.

116
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,640
Tasting the bitterness of love.

117
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,480
You know it's bitter from the start.

118
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,400
But

119
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,280
I don't think love itself is bitter.

120
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,400
It's like your own recipe.

121
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,800
Depends on how you season it.

122
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,040
Yeah.

123
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,040
Just like this short trip of ours.

124
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,200
I was surprised too.

125
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,360
But I could kind of guess it.

126
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,920
About his choice.

127
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,320
Maybe it wasn't his choice.

128
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,240
So at that moment, I thought of Lechen.

129
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,360
Because when I think of him,

130
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,080
I really feel much better.

131
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,120
That night, watching his fireworks,

132
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,200
I was truly happy.

133
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,840
This feeling inside me

134
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,240
just keeps climbing higher.

135
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,240
The two of them truly embody

136
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,880
The brave enjoy the world first.

137
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,680
The brave and the lucky ones.

138
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:27,880
Yes.

139
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,880
You added that ending.

140
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,840
Because there are plenty of brave people here.

141
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,680
Yeah, there really are plenty of brave people.

142
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,160
Alright, it's sealed away now.

143
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,440
Hey, film a transition shot for me.

144
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,440
I've been looking forward to this.

145
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,920
Sure.

146
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,320
How do you want to shoot it?

147
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,520
Just head that way.

148
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,520
So I walk that way, right?

149
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,120
Yeah, I'll go.

150
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,720
Should I follow you, or what?

151
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,360
That works too.

152
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,240
I'll follow you.

153
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:13,720
Okay.

154
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,040
Let's go.

155
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,960
Alright, you're out of sight now.

156
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,760
Can't see you anymore.

157
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,320
You're out of view.

158
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,840
You're walking like it's a runway.

159
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,360
Let's see.

160
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,240
Looks good.

161
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,240
Got the transition shot.

162
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,040
That's good.

163
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,120
I'm really happy with this Xinjiang trip.

164
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,880
That's it.

165
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,320
Just shoot this.

166
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,640
I can't learn that dance.

167
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,160
Let's take a couple of film shots.

168
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,600
Brought the film camera but didn't use it.

169
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,520
Let me take a photo of you.

170
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Take a cool photo of me.

171
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,320
Just look cool, that's enough.

172
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,520
Do you want full body or half body?

173
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,000
Either is fine.

174
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,000
Alright, three, two, one.

175
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,680
What kind of photo do you want?

176
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,920
Hand me the sunglasses.

177
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,800
Strike a pose.

178
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,640
Three, two, one.

179
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,240
Okay.

180
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
This one should be perfect.

181
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,120
I trust your skills.

182
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,440
Let's sit for a bit.

183
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,920
What did you think when you saw the graduation gown?

184
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,720
Didn't expect it.

185
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,720
Really didn't expect it, huh?

186
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,960
That's great.

187
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,920
When did you start thinking about it? On the plane?

188
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,080
Yeah.

189
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,120
What did you originally want to write on the kite?

190
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,040
I actually really wanted to

191
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,520
write some worries on it.

192
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,640
Then cut them off.

193
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,040
But I ended up writing something positive, right?

194
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,840
Yeah, because you set a good example.

195
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,760
I think I

196
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,440
suddenly wanted to change direction.

197
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,280
What worries did you want to write?

198
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,160
Way too many.

199
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,680
You could've left some for me.

200
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,720
There's no end to worries.

201
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,440
Let's fill both sides, front and back.

202
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,920
We can eat now.

203
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,040
I don't think I've ever sat outdoors

204
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,160
and eaten from sunrise to sunset.

205
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,160
If we can eat until dark now,

206
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,520
we're really good eaters.

207
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,320
Do you want any condiments?

208
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,960
No, I'm good.

209
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,720
You like to mix them.

210
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,960
What condiments do you mix?

211
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,960
Just scallions.

212
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,120
Cilantro.

213
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,120
Add some garlic, soy sauce, and vinegar.

214
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,680
That's it.

215
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,280
You don't want sesame paste?

216
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,240
I don't eat sesame paste.

217
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,080
You don't eat sesame paste?

218
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,120
You're really different from when I first met you.

219
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,680
You gave me a totally different vibe.

220
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,160
I'm really curious.

221
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,400
When you all first met me,

222
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,560
what did you think I was like?

223
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,320
Like, when something sad happens,

224
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,760
I can quickly detach.

225
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,520
And I stay calm about everything.

226
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,760
That's actually true.

227
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,040
It was like that for the first two days.

228
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,440
By the third day, I showed my real self.

229
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,040
Didn't talk to you much on the third day.

230
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,960
Wasn't it the dinner party?

231
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,440
Yeah, I was upset.

232
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,240
So after spending time with me,

233
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,200
do you think the me you first met and

234
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,480
the me after we talked

235
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,440
are very different?

236
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,440
Not really.

237
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,040
Just that the impression is deeper now.

238
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,680
So at first,

239
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,360
the impression I gave you was

240
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,520
like how I am now.

241
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,120
Just

242
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,480
a little girl.

243
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,640
Just someone who's been through

244
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,440
a few things, a little girl.

245
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,520
Still an immature little girl.

246
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,480
Not immature.

247
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:14,920
I mean,

248
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,200
that's why I say

249
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,560
you've been through things.

250
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,120
I just feel like the impression you give me

251
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,480
is that you're very strong at your core.

252
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,120
But in that strength,

253
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:31,480
there's so much unspoken pain.

254
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,680
So much silence.

255
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,120
That silence has shaped you too.

256
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,720
Let's talk about something happy.

257
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,520
I think that's great.

258
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,320
It's just bittersweet memories, right?

259
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,520
I think you're really amazing now.

260
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,960
But you said before that you're boring.

261
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,960
I don't think that's true.

262
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,920
You have a rich inner world.

263
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,240
I can totally feel it.

264
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,160
Really?

265
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,320
I don't even feel it.

266
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,480
I can sense it when we talk.

267
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,760
No, I feel like my inner world is pretty messy.

268
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,080
Messy but full.

269
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,280
It's so chaotic.

270
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,840
It's colorful.

271
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,080
My mind is fighting every day.

272
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,840
It's colorful.

273
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,680
This heat wave is blowing right at my face.

274
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,920
Scoot over a little closer.

275
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,640
It's fine, I'm getting a facial sauna.

276
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,440
Yesterday we warmed up by the campfire.

277
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,240
What?

278
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:42,880
Yesterday.

279
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,680
Say it again.

280
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,520
Warmed up by the campfire.

281
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,840
Say it faster.

282
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,640
Campfire.

283
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,880
Today it's the heat wave.

284
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,240
Okay, I'll blow it your way now.

285
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,720
Give me a facial sauna too.

286
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,440
My only regret today is

287
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,040
not getting the kite up in the air.

288
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,920
The kite flying high.

289
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,800
I think maybe later.

290
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,680
We can still fly it again.

291
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,280
Sure.

292
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:10,640
Let's do it later.

293
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,520
Feels like the wind will pick up soon, right?

294
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,960
We'll fly it later.

295
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,960
Did you tell it?

296
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,640
Did you send a message?

297
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,640
Say it now.

298
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,640
Say it now.

299
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:19,960
Okay.

300
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,760
Wait for a bit of wind later.

301
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,280
I'm getting roasted out here.

302
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,080
First time sunbathing till eight thirty at night.

303
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,640
Do you always eat this slowly?

304
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,560
You seem like a sloth.

305
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,440
No, I actually eat fast.

306
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,760
My dad eats super fast at home.

307
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,880
So I feel I can't make him wait too long.

308
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,440
That's why I eat quickly myself.

309
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,080
Then can't you just

310
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,000
ask the other person to eat slower?

311
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,400
Eat together?

312
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,840
Why not say it?

313
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,680
I know my dad too well.

314
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,440
But do you know what he's thinking?

315
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,080
What do you mean, what he's thinking?

316
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,480
Like, do you know his true feelings?

317
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,680
I do. Are you sure?

318
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,240
He just

319
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,680
isn't good at expressing himself.

320
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,240
Do you feel you missed out on

321
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,840
some parental affection in childhood?

322
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,360
Yes.

323
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,120
Why?

324
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,040
No company.

325
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,080
No sharing, no response.

326
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,000
Not none, just very little.

327
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,800
How come?

328
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,200
Were they busy with work or what?

329
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,240
Yeah, our family was busy back then.

330
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,880
Both of them had their own things going on.

331
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,440
So I often

332
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,640
barely saw my dad.

333
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,480
Is there something you most want to say to your dad?

334
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,600
What I'd most want to say to my dad

335
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:53,960
Actually, at home

336
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,280
I rarely talk with my dad.

337
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,680
I can tell.

338
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,080
Has he ever

339
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,640
said anything mushy to you?

340
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,640
I don't think so.

341
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,000
Later, I found something from my elementary school days.

342
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,200
A letter my dad wrote to me.

343
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,280
The last line he wrote was

344
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,800
"You'll never know how much Dad loves you."

345
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,080
That was the only

346
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,480
heartwarming thing I've ever heard from him.

347
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,760
So are you proactive in expressing

348
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,960
things like "I love you"?

349
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,200
Would you?

350
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,680
I might want to.

351
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,160
I hope to give others what I never had

352
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,040
and really wished for.

353
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,880
To give that to someone else.

354
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,760
To make up for it.

355
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,080
To compensate for it.

356
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,280
Compensate by giving to others.

357
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,080
Let them feel the regret I might've felt.

358
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,320
Eating feels great.

359
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:50,960
So good.

360
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,880
Let me soak up some more sun.

361
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,160
Feels so nice.

362
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,240
Suddenly I'm starting to like the mountains.

363
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,840
So beautiful.

364
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,200
Where should I sit?

365
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,400
Right here.

366
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,360
I got this ready for you.

367
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,160
Stick it on.

368
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:20,640
Thanks.

369
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,440
You stick it on first.

370
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,880
Have you ever gone to the movies alone?

371
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,480
No.

372
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,680
Thinking about it, I don't think I have.

373
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,360
But I've thought about it many times.

374
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,280
Feels too lonely, right?

375
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,800
Do you remember

376
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,000
there was a chart

377
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,080
What was it?

378
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,760
A chart of loneliness levels.

379
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,800
Which level do you think you'd reach?

380
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,600
My loneliness level

381
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,680
is probably pretty low.

382
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,400
If I really want to be alone

383
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,200
I don't think being alone is loneliness.

384
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,600
It's just me sorting myself out.

385
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,520
I think loneliness is more like

386
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,240
when you really want to talk to someone

387
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,280
but can't find anyone.

388
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,760
Like when you really want to

389
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,000
go to the movies alone

390
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,800
and don't know who to text.

391
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,680
So that means I'm truly lonely, huh?

392
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,640
You really don't know who to text?

393
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,600
Really.

394
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,320
You still have to tell someone about this.

395
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:24,720
And then

396
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,200
Explain what's up.

397
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,680
The thing is, I don't know who to tell.

398
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,200
About going to the movies.

399
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,400
I think it really needs

400
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,200
a good atmosphere.

401
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,280
And two people can enjoy it together.

402
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,000
The kind you can actually sit through.

403
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,600
Do you want to watch with the opposite sex?

404
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,640
You can watch with a friend of the same sex.

405
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,600
I didn't say with the opposite sex.

406
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,000
I just mean at least

407
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,480
Even between friends of the same sex

408
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,720
there can be misunderstandings.

409
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,120
I just think watching movies

410
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,080
I don't mind what genre it is.

411
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,520
I do mind.

412
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,400
Then let's watch what you like.

413
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,480
But what if the other person doesn't like it?

414
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,480
Isn't that kind of awkward?

415
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,720
You really don't need to overthink it.

416
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,600
And that time was funny because

417
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,840
there were only two people in the theater.

418
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,200
Me and one other person watched that movie.

419
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,440
That's nice.

420
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,000
Then I sat way in the back.

421
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,240
I just watched the movie there.

422
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,640
What holiday was it back then?

423
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,160
I really enjoy eating alone.

424
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,440
And having hotpot by myself.

425
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,360
I truly enjoy eating alone.

426
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,520
Hotpot alone is fun too.

427
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,240
And going to the doctor alone.

428
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,720
That feels so real, so alive.

429
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,960
Now I always go to the doctor alone.

430
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,440
Because I don't want others to know.

431
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,920
Just some minor aches and pains.

432
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,000
At that time, I was in a state of

433
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,440
deep inner struggle,

434
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,160
feeling very anxious.

435
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,840
But after I went, I realized

436
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,720
there were so many patients in ER,

437
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,680
my pain seemed so small in comparison.

438
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,280
That feeling.

439
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:51,720
Yeah.

440
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,360
Do you know why I want to fly a kite?

441
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:55,640
Actually,

442
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,360
Didn't you say you read books?

443
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,280
And listen to music.

444
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,480
What I really want is

445
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,840
to make up for some childhood regrets.

446
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,280
I remember the last time was when I was little.

447
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,920
It was at a square near my home.

448
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,880
Flying a kite there.

449
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,040
It was a Saturday.

450
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,160
After that,

451
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,360
I never touched a kite again.

452
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,080
Why?

453
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,840
Never had the chance.

454
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,440
To fly a kite again.

455
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,120
Everything just sped up.

456
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,280
I noticed, in the cabin,

457
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,040
or when we go out together,

458
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,440
many things you do are about

459
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,720
searching for what you missed in childhood.

460
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,360
That's part of it.

461
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,920
But I see more of myself

462
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,160
in you, like a reflection.

463
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,440
From your past experiences,

464
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,840
I might understand a bit more.

465
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,160
Maybe I kind of know

466
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,840
what you want.

467
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,880
These regrets, for us,

468
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,040
maybe we never had the chance

469
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,520
to face them.

470
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,040
They might stay with you for life.

471
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,760
Or else I'd cry my eyes out today.

472
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,160
Cheers.

473
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,440
Cheers.

474
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,400
That's nice.

475
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,720
You'll sleep well tonight.

476
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,800
Hope so.

477
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,200
Bye.

478
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,200
See you tomorrow.

479
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,280
This is Via Ferrata.

480
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,560
I want to try this.

481
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,800
This is Via Ferrata.

482
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,040
And rock climbing.

483
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,200
I want to play.

484
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,120
You guys go ahead.

485
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:50,800
You go ahead.

486
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,560
I'll watch from below.

487
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,400
I'll watch from down here too.

488
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,600
My knees can't handle this.

489
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,840
Well,

490
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,720
You guys go ahead.

491
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:55,920
Okay.

492
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,400
Go ahead.

493
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:56,960
Let's go.

494
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,440
Let's go.

495
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,200
There are two routes.

496
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,560
Easy and hard.

497
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,800
Which one should we pick?

498
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,120
I'll take easy.

499
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,640
Easy.

500
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,760
Easy.

501
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,000
Relax.

502
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,840
Yeah.

503
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,520
Thanks.

504
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,160
How about the hard mode?

505
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,760
Then you two take the hard route.

506
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,360
You two go for the hard route.

507
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,400
We'll take the easy route.

508
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:23,800
Yeah.

509
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,200
What do you think, Jiao?

510
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,640
You want the hard route?

511
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,320
I'll go for the hard route.

512
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,760
Easy route.

513
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,800
What's going on?

514
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,240
I'll go first then.

515
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,800
Which one is the easy route?

516
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,760
I'll follow your route.

517
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,360
Just go on your own, right?

518
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,800
Wherever Jiao goes, he goes.

519
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,120
What did he choose?

520
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,360
He picked the brave mode.

521
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,080
Then I'll take this one.

522
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,520
Okay.

523
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,320
You two are way too fast.

524
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,400
I can't even find Jiao.

525
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,400
Is Jiao still here?

526
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,760
He should be on the upper level.

527
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:18,960
I'm up here.

528
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,040
I'm watching you guys.

529
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,720
This part up here is fun.

530
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:25,760
Really?

531
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,040
Because there's only one rope.

532
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,360
Nothing else.

533
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,760
It's really tough.

534
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,720
It's brave mode now.

535
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,880
Let her go first.

536
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,680
I'm afraid I'll wobble as soon as I get up.

537
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,000
Do you need a bit of challenge?

538
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,360
So easy.

539
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,560
I can tell.

540
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,640
No.

541
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,840
Didn't you say it was too easy?

542
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,400
Is this the challenge you gave?

543
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,360
That's it?

544
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,080
Doctor Fang.

545
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,200
What?

546
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:09,880
That's all there is.

547
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,600
Is that it?

548
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,000
That's still not enough.

549
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,200
Then go back and do it again.

550
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,160
Come on, choose.

551
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,960
Balance beam or this, or this?

552
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,840
Up to you.

553
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,920
This one.

554
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,640
Which one? This one.

555
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,400
This balance beam.

556
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:22,800
Okay.

557
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,760
I've decided to switch.

558
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,920
Doctor Fang, you go first.

559
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,200
You go first.

560
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,880
Yeah, you can change the order.

561
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,680
I'll go first.

562
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,440
Do you two have any sneaky plans?

563
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,080
I really want to step on you.

564
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,200
What did you say?

565
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,680
Can we go one on the left, one on the right?

566
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,320
Who wants to go left and right with you?

567
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,400
I should've stayed down there with Duoduo.

568
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,160
Give it a kick.

569
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:09,720
You kick it for him.

570
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,360
It's useless, doesn't help.

571
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:12,560
Doesn't help.

572
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:16,880
Jiao-ge

573
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,360
Jiao-ge is the real brave one.

574
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,120
This thing up here is actually pretty fun.

575
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:26,440
Really?

576
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,480
You think it's fun, huh?

577
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,240
Jiao-ge, I want to come up.

578
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:29,880
Jiao-ge

579
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:31,600
What?

580
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,360
You want to come up?

581
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,080
This one's pretty tough.

582
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:42,880
You're so fierce.

583
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,240
Bet you couldn't tell, right?

584
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,120
No, I could tell by looking.

585
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,200
But when you actually did it,

586
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,760
it's still a bit surprising.

587
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,240
It's still a bit surprising.

588
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,480
I really want to give her a kick.

589
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,960
So naughty.

590
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,000
I'm telling Lan Lan.

591
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,240
She said she wanted some excitement.

592
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,840
Doctor Fang, I'm at the finish now.

593
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:16,920
Be careful.

594
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:18,920
No problem.

595
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,160
No problem.

596
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,200
It's a small thing.

597
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,760
I even did the splits for you today.

598
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:31,960
It's fine.

599
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,240
"Help!"

600
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,080
Is that okay?

601
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,240
Not exciting enough.

602
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:42,920
Take this route.

603
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,320
Okay.

604
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:43,800
This one's a bit better.

605
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,000
You two are kind of...

606
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,920
Kind of going at "light speed."

607
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:55,560
Are we fast?

608
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,400
Yeah, you're sticking so close.

609
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,640
You have to chase closely.

610
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,720
Learned something new again.

611
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,280
Gained some new insight again.

612
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,240
It's really fun.

613
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,240
Super cool.

614
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,080
That thing up there.

615
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,440
Lan Lan is the real deal here.

616
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,040
She totally changed after going up.

617
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,960
There's cake here.

618
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,040
The cake you like.

619
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,200
How is it?

620
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,120
You tell me.

621
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,040
In this setting, what do you think

622
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,400
is the one thing you need most?

623
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,520
Right now?

624
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,320
Yeah.

625
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,920
Like, if you're camping outside

626
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,920
but don't have any other gear,

627
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,120
what would you want most?

628
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,400
What do you mean, no other gear?

629
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,040
Like a speaker.

630
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,560
Game console, movie screen, or phone.

631
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,840
Or something else.

632
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,880
Definitely a movie screen.

633
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,760
Because you can play music on it,

634
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,600
and watch movies too.

635
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,400
That's pretty versatile.

636
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,800
Right?

637
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,240
It has to be multifunctional.

638
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,560
Like, the kind that comes with

639
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,240
Just a movie screen.

640
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,400
I think it should have a speaker.

641
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,880
And a projector, like that.

642
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,240
Then you can only watch movies on it.

643
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,400
Only movies, huh?

644
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,720
Then I'd pick a speaker.

645
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,480
Music.

646
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,080
Music really can

647
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,120
make people feel relaxed and happy.

648
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,040
Are you also the type

649
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,720
who always plays music at home?

650
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,600
I actually like playing music alone.

651
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,480
Me too.

652
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,280
Especially when showering,

653
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,000
I play some music.

654
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,360
Singing along by myself is pretty

655
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,200
enjoyable.

656
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,840
Actually, about your question,

657
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,400
the gear isn't that important.

658
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,840
I think people matter more.

659
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,160
I think, for you,

660
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,120
who would you most want to be with here?

661
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,520
That question is more important.

662
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,240
Because sometimes,

663
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,360
even when waiting for a flight,

664
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,840
in a boring situation,

665
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,400
if the people around you are

666
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,200
different, then

667
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,120
it's still fun.

668
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,120
Sometimes I think the journey

669
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,120
isn't that important.

670
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,760
But the process really matters.

671
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,840
Even just being on the road,

672
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,640
can be happy.

673
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,720
I also think the process matters more.

674
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,800
Where you've been is just a result.

675
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,680
I think that result

676
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,880
is something most people can get.

677
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,960
But your journey is unique.

678
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,840
Most people can get the result?

679
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,680
Yeah, like for example,

680
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,240
say I've been to

681
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:04,760
somewhere.

682
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,720
I've been there too.

683
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,960
But everyone sees different scenery.

684
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,520
It's different.

685
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,640
So what they see is their journey.

686
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,840
And who you go with is part of it too.

687
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,320
That's part of the journey.

688
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,440
And what happens along the way

689
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,400
is also part of the journey.

690
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,520
And my favorite thing is sharing

691
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,800
fun stories with good friends

692
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,840
funny moments.

693
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,120
Or funny moments with family.

694
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,440
Or childhood stories.

695
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,720
They're really interesting.

696
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,640
Those happy memories,

697
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,000
You told me before,

698
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,360
You told me before,

699
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,920
the scar on your hand is from

700
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,120
when you fell as a kid?

701
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,360
It looks a bit like a crescent moon.

702
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,320
Yeah, I think it's super cool.

703
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,560
It does look pretty nice.

704
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,120
Right? It's got character.

705
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,280
You sound so proud saying that.

706
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:00,680
What?

707
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,680
If someone else fell,

708
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,800
they wouldn't get such a cool scar like mine.

709
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:15,960
Let's go for a walk together.

710
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,000
Sure.

711
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,520
Okay. It's comfortable sitting here.

712
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,640
Are you doing okay?

713
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,320
These past two days,

714
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,400
I've actually been fine.

715
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,160
I really like how you are right now.

716
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,200
It left a deep impression on me too.

717
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,280
It feels like, during your time in the cabin,

718
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,240
in such a unique environment,

719
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,560
you've been able to

720
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,480
make a small

721
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,680
but different transformation.

722
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,800
It's like slowly finding that missing piece

723
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,520
and finally discovering it.

724
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,200
I used to think I never

725
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,520
had that piece at all.

726
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,720
But now I've found it again

727
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,880
and brought it back.

728
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,720
I've put it back into my own picture.

729
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,000
I'm so envious.

730
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,800
I feel like mine...

731
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,440
Is this mine?

732
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,440
It's yours.

733
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,760
Because I have the floral tea.

734
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,800
I remember that.

735
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,840
That's hilarious.

736
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,400
We all have to go through it.

737
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,840
Fate always has its best plan.

738
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,040
In my view,

739
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,560
I think being in a relationship,

740
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,440
or interacting with someone,

741
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,240
is itself

742
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,600
a process of self-improvement.

743
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,440
It's a state of growth.

744
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,040
Yes, the people and things you encounter

745
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:18,880
might all be

746
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,800
meant to help you

747
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,440
become more complete.

748
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,000
If I care about someone,

749
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,320
I hope they're happy.

750
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,320
Yes.

751
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,760
And if,

752
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,120
if we're lucky,

753
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,440
maybe we can be happy together.

754
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,680
But if,

755
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,640
luck isn't on our side,

756
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,680
or fate isn't right,

757
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,440
then I wish them happiness.

758
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,800
If you can be happy,

759
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,880
that's what I wanted from the start.

760
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,720
What you just said

761
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,000
actually answered my doubts.

762
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,400
I think...

763
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,240
But I feel that when you sense

764
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,080
happiness,

765
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:51,800
these emotions,

766
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,720
even sadness, it's actually a good thing.

767
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,800
It shows

768
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,200
you're immersed in

769
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,440
a truly sincere

770
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,440
relationship with everyone.

771
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,480
It means you also

772
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,360
are sincere when you're with me.

773
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,800
You're genuine.

774
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,840
You truly care when we're together.

775
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:03,840
That's enough for me.

776
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:04,720
That's enough for me.

777
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,920
As long as everyone

778
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:06,920
does their best

779
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,400
and puts their heart into it, that's enough.

780
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,000
As for the outcome, how I choose,

781
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,600
how you choose,

782
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,040
I think it matters, but it doesn't matter.

783
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,000
Whatever the result, it won't affect you.

784
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,920
I'm here to eat.

785
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,800
Come, I'll save you a seat.

786
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,880
I'm saving this great spot for you.

787
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:33,800
That's nice.

788
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:37,640
Keep lying down.

789
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,000
How's your conversation going?

790
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,480
Of course, we're chatting well.

791
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,840
We're having a pretty good talk.

792
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,240
Because Jiao and I were in the cabin,

793
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,160
just talking nonstop.

794
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,880
He's a really gentle person.

795
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,360
At our four-person dinner that day,

796
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,680
I asked them a question.

797
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,840
The question was,

798
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,720
Rate something from one to ten now.

799
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,640
But you can choose what to rate.

800
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:01,960
You pick one to rate.

801
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,400
And then compare

802
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,000
your first day and now.

803
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,200
You can pick anything.

804
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,600
Then rate it yourself.

805
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,560
I'd definitely choose my comfort level.

806
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,720
On day one, I was at zero.

807
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:13,480
And now?

808
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,080
To be safe, you could say minus twenty.

809
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,800
Minus twenty.

810
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,680
Now I think I'm at nine.

811
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,320
Hey, bro.

812
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,120
Now I think I'm at nine.

813
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,720
Come on.

814
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,080
Minus twenty.

815
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,080
Can you see the Big Dipper now?

816
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,000
No, I can't.

817
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,800
We could see it yesterday.

818
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,960
Or maybe your eyesight is just great.

819
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:35,920
Duo Duo, you answer one.

820
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,840
Pick anything and rate it one to ten.

821
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,840
Compare day one and today.

822
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,640
Okay, I'll pick one.

823
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,000
My sense of belonging in the cabin.

824
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,840
On the first day, it was

825
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:45,840
minus twenty.

826
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,360
Minus twenty is the baseline, right?

827
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,000
Today, it's a perfect score.

828
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:52,480
Yeah.

829
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,480
I just asked them in the car

830
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,280
some other questions.

831
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,280
What questions?

832
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,560
You all haven't heard these yet.

833
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,760
Everyone shares one thing

834
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,320
about their own

835
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,280
friendship and romance

836
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,480
that are totally different

837
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:02,920
preferences.

838
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,400
I'll go first.

839
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,000
Go ahead.

840
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,520
Friends.

841
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,160
I like gentle people.

842
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,920
The kind who can do a split.

843
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,240
Of course, if you mean physically flexible,

844
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,360
having flexible ligaments works too.

845
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,880
Flexible ligaments and a soft heart.

846
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,080
Just kidding, I mean gentle people.

847
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,440
Whether it's a gentle personality

848
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,640
or a gentle way of expressing.

849
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,280
For relationships, I like

850
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,280
people who act differently

851
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,400
in social settings and private moments.

852
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,440
A big contrast.

853
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,120
I like people with contrast.

854
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,280
Actually, this contrast you mention,

855
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,600
I take it to mean

856
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,680
someone shows one side to others

857
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,480
and saves their truest self

858
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,040
just for you.

859
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,080
Exactly.

860
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,840
It's a kind of privacy, really.

861
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,280
Yeah.

862
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,920
All my friends are genuine.

863
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,080
Many of my friends are

864
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,360
not exactly the same as me,

865
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,000
but at least seventy or eighty percent similar.

866
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,840
Relationships.

867
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,520
I think it's also about

868
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,440
preference.

869
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,000
Like that privacy you mentioned.

870
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,520
Privacy.

871
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,400
Yeah, same idea.

872
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,640
Makes sense.

873
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,000
I think with friends,

874
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,640
I'm more optimistic.

875
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,640
More positive.

876
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,920
I want the vibe around me

877
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,600
to be full of positive energy.

878
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,400
Yeah.

879
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,520
But in relationships,

880
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,800
I prefer someone more delicate, like you said.

881
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,160
I prefer someone more delicate, like you said.

882
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,160
Someone who can pick up on emotions.

883
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,520
Yes.

884
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,800
Who notices

885
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,800
the little details.

886
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,520
Makes sense.

887
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,560
Makes sense.

888
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,160
Actually, a lot of our answers overlap.

889
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,840
The points you mention

890
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,920
can't fully sum up

891
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,880
what's in your heart.

892
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,040
Of course.

893
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,720
It's just a simple answer, after all.

894
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,000
I want to head back for a bit.

895
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:03,640
Okay.

896
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,160
I really like walking with my hands behind my back.

897
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,840
They always say I look like

898
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,680
a boss inspecting things.

899
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,360
You do look like that.

900
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,640
Or like

901
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,840
an old security guard.

902
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,720
Can you hold this for me?

903
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,120
Never mind, just leave it here.

904
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,960
Lie down anywhere, any way.

905
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,120
Come on, let's fight.

906
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,760
You took my pillow away.

907
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:07,960
Whose is this?

908
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,600
It's Lan Lan's.

909
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,840
Xu Rulan is a really smart girl.

910
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,280
How would you rate me?

911
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,200
You?

912
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,200
Let's change spots.

913
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,560
Over there, by the door.

914
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,040
Let's go.

915
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:26,960
Honestly,

916
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,360
I think your white outfit today

917
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,080
looks really nice.

918
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,320
Thanks.

919
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,160
How's it in here?

920
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,160
Yesterday, we had a deep talk here.

921
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:38,880
Sesame, open the door.

922
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,320
Rate me.

923
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,280
Rate you on what?

924
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,280
Take out your paper.

925
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,240
Didn't we finish rating already?

926
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,160
I'm serious, I'm sure about it.

927
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,400
I even wrote it all down on paper.

928
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,280
Really?

929
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:11,720
Yes, really.

930
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,720
You wrote it down on paper?

931
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,640
I really am a...

932
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,840
The second half of that sentence...

933
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,560
You can...

934
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,560
stay skeptical about it.

935
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,240
You don't have to think too deeply.

936
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,560
The noun or adjective before that

937
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,320
is a very...

938
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,960
I think it's a trait I have.

939
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,320
The latter part...

940
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,360
is just a way to show it.

941
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,720
Being smart can't just

942
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,640
show in your cooking

943
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,360
or your quick learning skills.

944
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,720
What about me? How would you describe me?

945
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,800
Serious.

946
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,200
I'm serious.

947
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,160
I separate things.

948
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,800
My friends say when they first meet me,

949
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,440
I'm very...

950
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,080
aloof and distant.

951
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,760
Didn't we talk about this before?

952
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:57,800
That's really how I am.

953
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,440
It's just...

954
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:04,360
I also slowly open up.

955
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,240
And become more...

956
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,760
willing to talk.

957
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,400
Because before, honestly,

958
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,240
I didn't know what to say.

959
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,880
Do you think I look fierce?

960
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,400
When you don't smile, you do look fierce.

961
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,960
Like when I'm zoning out,

962
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,080
or my expression

963
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:23,680
is really calm,

964
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,800
that's just how I look.

965
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,160
So you're just zoning out?

966
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,960
I honestly have no thoughts at all.

967
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,920
They ask, "What's wrong with you?"

968
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,160
"Are you angry or something?"

969
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:35,960
Yeah.

970
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,320
Tonight, I think your vibe

971
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,320
was kind of intimidating.

972
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,560
Tonight,

973
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,440
at dinner,

974
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,760
my mind was already blank.

975
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,840
At that moment, I just kept

976
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,800
thinking about my craving for good food.

977
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,440
I just wanted to fill my stomach.

978
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,960
Are you the type who's full of energy in the morning

979
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,800
and then slowly uses it up?

980
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,600
Or do you not have much energy in the morning

981
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,280
and need to recharge at noon?

982
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,440
I think it depends.

983
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:00,960
For me,

984
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,120
it's not like I can recharge

985
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:02,960
just by sleeping.

986
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,040
You need to do things to recharge.

987
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,080
I think chatting like this

988
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:07,840
is pretty recharging.

989
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,320
What about you?

990
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:14,560
Same as you.

991
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,880
Talking makes me feel good.

992
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:17,680
Yeah.

993
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,360
Actually, sleep only recharges me

994
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,280
just

995
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,600
physically.

996
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,880
Yeah, for my emotions,

997
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,520
it doesn't help much.

998
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,600
What drains your energy the most?

999
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,080
For example,

1000
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:31,600
when everyone's quiet,

1001
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,440
and no one talks,

1002
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,800
my mind starts racing,

1003
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,840
thinking of a topic to discuss.

1004
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,920
How can I liven things up?

1005
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,520
That's when I start to feel drained.
