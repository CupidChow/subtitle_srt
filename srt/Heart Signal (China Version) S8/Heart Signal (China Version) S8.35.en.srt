1
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,400
What's this, a slingshot?

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,400
Did you play with one as a kid?

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,720
A slingshot.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,560
Looks like a slingshot.

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,040
Where should I aim it?

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,240
Where is it, please?

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:20,920
You didn't see it?

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,920
I didn't see it.

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,440
Can you see it?

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,720
Did you hit it? Or did you hit the top again?

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,960
But I don't know where I hit.

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,680
Where is it?

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,760
Is this how you aim it?

14
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,320
I got it in, did you see?

15
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,200
You got it in.

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,400
I think you hit that.

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,360
I realized you have to aim higher.

18
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,480
Aim higher.

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,400
Yeah, just don't let it

20
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,440
block your view.

21
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,000
Then judge its

22
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,000
I think I know how to play now.

23
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,160
I got it in again.

24
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,240
You got it in again.

25
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,040
So close.

26
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,200
Just missed by a little.

27
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,400
Honestly, I have no idea where to aim.

28
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,840
Let me see.

29
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,520
I think you should aim a bit lower, yeah.

30
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,000
That works.

31
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:18,680
Okay.

32
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,040
Didn't get any in.

33
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,160
So close.

34
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,280
Forget it.

35
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:26,840
Let's go.

36
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,920
Should we try that one?

37
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,440
Sure.

38
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,640
Alright.

39
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,880
Let me tell you both something.

40
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,040
While climbing up,

41
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,440
don't pull the rope.

42
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,280
And the rope should

43
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,120
always stay at chest level.

44
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,520
Don't let it go outside your hands.

45
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,640
Want to come down?

46
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,240
Hold a rock hold with one hand.

47
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,240
Hold the rope at your chest with the other.

48
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,960
Use your toes

49
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,520
to gently push against the wall.

50
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,320
If you're facing away,

51
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,120
be sure to use your hands or the soles of your feet

52
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,920
to support yourself.

53
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:52,960
Okay.

54
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,640
So,

55
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,280
really,

56
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,160
this is real climbing.

57
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,680
This thing

58
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,520
Actually, these cloth shoes

59
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,560
are a bit slippery.

60
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,200
We're really rock climbing.

61
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,560
Actually,

62
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,040
If he doesn't grab this,

63
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,040
I think it's still

64
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,800
Is that round clock a bit hard for you?

65
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,280
The round part is a bit tough.

66
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,480
I'm more worried about getting down.

67
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,920
If you lean back, you'll go down.

68
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,280
Climbing this isn't actually scary.

69
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,320
It's just about how high you want to climb.

70
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,480
I think that's a bit scary.

71
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,520
Imagine yourself at the top of a mountain.

72
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,520
Yeah.

73
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,640
Do you like hiking?

74
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,480
I like hiking.

75
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,200
It's exhausting.

76
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,840
So how do you get down?

77
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,720
Just lean back.

78
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,880
Then use your feet like this.

79
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,560
Support the board a bit.

80
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,320
Then you'll go down.

81
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,880
But what if I can't get down?

82
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,400
Wait a second.

83
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,480
Seriously, just lean back and you'll be fine.

84
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,960
Won't I just fall?

85
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,040
No, there's a buffer force.

86
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,440
Right.

87
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,880
Just like that.

88
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,800
That's how you'll go down.

89
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,080
It'll have a slow pull.

90
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,960
Like bungee jumping.

91
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,280
Isn't this pretty thrilling too?

92
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,080
So scary.

93
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,680
I think it's pretty fun.

94
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,760
That felt awesome to me.

95
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,920
Do you dare to try it?

96
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,840
But I think it can only

97
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,080
be done by one person at a time.

98
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,400
Since you want to play so much, I'll let you go first.

99
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,040
Really? You really want to play, right?

100
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,400
Are you scared?

101
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,640
No, I just think you really want to play.

102
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,200
I do want to play.

103
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,240
Yeah.

104
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,960
It's fine if I go first then.

105
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,200
You really seem eager to try this.

106
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,720
What's wrong? You don't want to play?

107
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,800
No.

108
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,280
Because...

109
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,760
You were the one who volunteered first.

110
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,240
I think that's fine.

111
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,560
Just now when we sat

112
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,200
on the first swing,

113
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,520
I thought the same.

114
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,800
But once we were in the air,

115
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,160
No, I was just looking out for you.

116
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,880
I was worried you'd get nervous.

117
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,600
How could I?

118
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,040
Thank you.

119
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,880
I'm already exhausted from climbing up here.

120
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,280
Turn a bit.

121
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,640
Okay, a bit higher, turn like this.

122
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,360
Stand here.

123
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,400
I made it here myself.

124
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,840
Not bad.

125
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,120
Really?

126
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,560
You're already out of breath.

127
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,000
No, I'm just tired from climbing the stairs.

128
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,840
Okay, step down one level.

129
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,800
From here, it doesn't look that high.

130
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,320
Yeah.

131
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:02,800
Exactly.

132
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,560
Alright, now sit down and let your body hang.

133
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,040
Feels like I'm about to be grilled.

134
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,280
Kind of.

135
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,480
Like a roast pig.

136
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,240
Roast pig, I was just thinking that too.

137
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,680
Feels like a roast pig.

138
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,640
Below is that tomato and egg dish.

139
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,600
Then the roast pig.

140
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,040
After eating it.

141
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,800
Alright, ready, three, two...

142
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,480
One, go!

143
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,960
Are you okay?

144
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,640
No.

145
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,040
I think my neck...

146
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,200
Then maybe you shouldn't play these kinds of games.

147
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,480
Are you alright?

148
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,680
Then maybe we shouldn't play this kind of thing.

149
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,040
We? You mean both of us?

150
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,200
I think it's just you.

151
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,040
Yeah, you.

152
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,280
I think you shouldn't play this kind of

153
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,680
this kind of

154
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,800
free-fall game.

155
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,400
I just came down.

156
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,200
How did I look?

157
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,320
Very cool.

158
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,040
Really cool.

159
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,320
And when you dropped in here,

160
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,320
we couldn't see you.

161
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,440
Then we asked if you were okay.

162
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,120
But you didn't respond.

163
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,000
I was really worried.

164
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,800
Because I was already "cooked."

165
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,360
I think, well...

166
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,280
How do you feel?

167
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,200
My neck hurts.

168
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:29,960
Really?

169
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,120
Did you get that weightless feeling?

170
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,480
Let me try.

171
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,320
Why do you look like you're up to something?

172
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,840
You want to play, don't you?

173
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,120
Of course I want to play.

174
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,200
I always feel like you have this

175
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,680
pretending-to-be-tough vibe.

176
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,520
That's just your imagination.

177
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,720
These stairs are a bit high.

178
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,080
It's actually not that bad.

179
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,840
Why does this feel like walking into a trap?

180
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,920
Wait a second.

181
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,200
I'm really fine.

182
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,200
Can we still go back now?

183
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,800
Just close your eyes and it'll be over.

184
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,880
Can't go back?

185
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,440
Just close your eyes and it'll be over.

186
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,920
Okay.

187
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,640
Three, two, one, go!

188
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,720
Can you talk?

189
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,960
Are you alright?

190
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,000
I feel like the world is so quiet.

191
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,800
What is it?

192
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,000
This world is so quiet.

193
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,000
Why?

194
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,440
I don't know either.

195
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,560
It's just so peaceful.

196
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,560
I was almost scared stiff.

197
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,920
It's actually pretty fun.

198
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,320
It's quite

199
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,440
moving and unforgettable.

200
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,760
What should we play, you tell me.

201
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,160
How about we go over there and take a look?

202
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,360
One trampoline for each of us.

203
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,320
I jumped so high!

204
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,840
It's really bouncy.

205
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,160
Sure.

206
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:45,840
Let's start.

207
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,840
Awesome!

208
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,120
Okay.

209
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,360
How was the experience?

210
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,200
Very good.

211
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,920
Do you think I'm a bit smart?

212
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,040
Of course.

213
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,440
I feel like this

214
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,240
isn't easy.

215
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,200
Compared to things like badminton

216
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,360
or tennis,

217
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,480
I think this is harder.

218
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,040
When I was a freshman,

219
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,720
in my first semester,

220
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,480
I learned baseball.

221
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,920
There's basically no baseball in Switzerland.

222
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,600
It's rare in Europe too.

223
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,960
Yeah.

224
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,760
Switzerland is really beautiful.

225
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,160
Actually, for me, Switzerland

226
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,280
my impression still

227
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,760
stays at

228
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,160
the movie "Heidi and Grandpa".

229
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,080
From that film.

230
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,360
Do you know it?

231
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,240
Yeah.

232
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,600
So what do you usually do in Switzerland?

233
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,760
There's actually not much to do in Switzerland.

234
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,560
Mostly just hiking.

235
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,680
Would you want to

236
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,760
live here long-term in the future?

237
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,000
I'll see how things go.

238
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,120
And then decide when the time comes.

239
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,880
Where would that be?

240
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,720
I really want to try your cream puffs.

241
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,240
Cream puffs? Sure!

242
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,680
I loved eating them when I was a kid.

243
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,760
Did you go to school in Shanghai when you were little?

244
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,160
Yeah, when I was eleven or twelve.

245
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,480
I often went to my friend's house.

246
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,360
I ate one almost every week.

247
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,160
Which flavor do you think is the best?

248
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,760
There's cocoa flavor,

249
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,880
cream flavor,

250
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,640
and matcha flavor.

251
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:02,840
I want to try

252
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,680
the matcha one.

253
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,480
Okay.

254
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,880
I really love matcha.

255
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,760
I'll have a cocoa matcha one.

256
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,560
Alright.

257
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,080
I like going to

258
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,520
I've even tried

259
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,800
making these at home myself.

260
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,360
That must be pretty hard.

261
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,040
It's hard to make ones this big.

262
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,640
But I'm pretty good at baking bread.

263
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,480
I've baked bagels before.

264
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,960
And also

265
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,080
ciabatta.

266
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,320
Yeah.

267
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,800
And European-style bread.

268
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,280
There's the kneading process.

269
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,160
First,

270
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,800
knead the dough for a while.

271
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,240
Then let it rest.

272
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,000
Knead again, rest again.

273
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,760
So baking bread for a whole day

274
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,480
takes about six to twelve hours.

275
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,680
When did you start baking bread?

276
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,480
Just a couple of years ago.

277
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,600
I had an oven.

278
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,120
So I started making it at home.

279
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,200
Do you usually eat that kind of bread?

280
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,640
Yeah, I do.

281
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,840
Actually, when I was a kid,

282
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,040
I baked quite a lot too.

283
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,200
My grandma really loves

284
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,040
making things herself.

285
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,800
They also grow their own vegetables.

286
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,720
There's a garden.

287
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,440
And all the bread is homemade.

288
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,040
I remember

289
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,120
I often baked with my grandma

290
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,600
either bread or cookies.

291
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,600
Baking is pretty therapeutic.

292
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,640
Especially making those

293
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,960
little people-shaped ones.

294
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,040
But I haven't made those.

295
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,760
Like drawing patterns on bread.

296
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,880
Scoring patterns on European bread.

297
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,880
After scoring, you look at it

298
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,880
and compare it to what you imagined.

299
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,160
See how different it is.

300
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,360
How do you make the patterns?

301
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,640
Flip it over and place it here.

302
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,720
Then score it little by little.

303
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,920
Like the wheat stalks on the side.

304
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,160
But many times,

305
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,160
it doesn't turn out the way I imagined.

306
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,120
I'm really terrible at drawing.

307
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,960
If you want me to draw,

308
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,840
that's way too hard.

309
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,360
How long have you been living on your own?

310
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:19,040
Actually, it was when I came to Shanghai.

311
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,520
That's when I left my parents.

312
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,800
I used to live at home before.

313
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,040
Yeah.

314
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,120
But after I got to Shanghai,

315
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,000
I wasn't living completely alone.

316
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:28,880
At first,

317
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,720
I stayed with a friend's family.

318
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,920
Then I lived with a friend.

319
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,240
They all work in Switzerland.

320
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,520
Me and my sister are also in Switzerland.

321
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,160
Honestly, I often feel that

322
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,920
some things I learned in college

323
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,760
have nothing to do

324
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,080
with the work I do now.

325
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,760
I was nervous that night.

326
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,760
What should I do?

327
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,680
If I have to talk to him tomorrow

328
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,080
and bring this up,

329
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,720
I'm worried my German

330
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,120
might sound too awkward.

331
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,960
No, it won't.

332
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,160
German is really hard.

333
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,440
I feel like I've struggled

334
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,720
with German for so many years.

335
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,400
Really?

336
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,160
Because I went to elementary school in Shanghai,

337
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,000
at a local school.

338
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,760
It was in Chinese and English.

339
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,360
So there was no German at all.

340
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,800
I only started learning German in middle school.

341
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,720
It seemed like all my math classes in a week

342
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,840
except one were replaced with German lessons.

343
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,720
And then

344
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,240
Was it just you?

345
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,200
Yeah, only me.

346
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,000
And every week,

347
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,120
I had eight extra hours of German classes.

348
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,120
I did that for several years.

349
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,080
Especially Swiss German,

350
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,920
it doesn't have much grammar.

351
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,080
But standard German

352
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,880
has grammar that's incredibly hard.

353
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,200
And writing it is so difficult.

354
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,680
The pronunciation is totally different from the writing.

355
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,560
But actually, spelling is pretty easy.

356
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,920
If you give me a text,

357
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,600
I can read it all without a problem.

358
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,520
I struggled through it with tears.

359
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,120
Same with Chinese.

360
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,720
But I think learning languages

361
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,960
has been really tough for me.

362
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,960
I'm good at math.

363
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,600
So I'm not that good at languages.

364
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,760
Memorizing things is hard for me.

365
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,840
You speak a lot of languages.

366
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,320
It's because of your environment growing up.

367
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm also a science student.

368
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,720
So before,

369
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,840
I wanted to study architecture,

370
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,280
urban planning,

371
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,040
or

372
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,360
fashion design.

373
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,800
I really love fashion design.

374
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,800
But I ended up not doing it by accident.

375
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,800
You can still do it now.

376
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,840
You model anyway.

377
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,840
You could design your own clothes.

378
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,880
The ones you like.

379
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:48,800
Yeah.

380
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,280
And do photoshoots.

381
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,080
I'm working in fashion now too.

382
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,400
It's for export.

383
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,840
But I communicate

384
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,800
with people in Russia.

385
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,200
I use English for that too.

386
00:16:59,440 --> 00:16:59,840
And also,

387
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,560
when I speak more English than German,

388
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,200
my German

389
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,440
gets worse.

390
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,240
So you only work with

391
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,360
Russia?

392
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,880
Or do you also

393
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,680
expand to Germany and Switzerland?

394
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,360
I'm trying.

395
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,560
I'll keep working on it.

396
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,760
You're really good at squash.

397
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,840
This is actually my first time playing.

398
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,640
We're doing pretty well.

399
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,920
My mom said,

400
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,240
Not bad.

401
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,320
Try new sports.

402
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,840
I kind of wish my mom was here.

403
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,760
But they've already gone back.

404
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,840
It's not easy for them to come.

405
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,280
Where are they now?

406
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,080
She's teaching in my hometown in Liaoning.

407
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,200
Do you know north, south, east, and west?

408
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,440
I have to recite them.

409
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,040
Up is north, down is south, left is west, right is east.

410
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,640
So you need that too?

411
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,680
Up is north, down is south, left is west, right is east.

412
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,600
That must be from when you were little.

413
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,320
Your mom talked to you more.

414
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,160
Right?

415
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,400
Of course.

416
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,960
I'm Chinese.

417
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,720
It'd be great to travel every day.

418
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,120
I haven't been to Switzerland yet.

419
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,480
When can I go?

420
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,640
And share it with you.

421
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,360
Finally arrived at the place

422
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,760
where you saw the scenery before.

423
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,280
It's beautiful.

424
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,000
Really nice.

425
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,240
I came to your city.

426
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,840
She's hinting to the other person.

427
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,360
I want to visit where you grew up.

428
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,040
Yeah.

429
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,360
I'll be the tourist and just follow you.

430
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,840
I still think there's not enough time.

431
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,280
I feel like I'm not that close

432
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,680
with the friends upstairs yet.

433
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,480
As for Yifan, it was the day before yesterday.

434
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,760
We had a chat.

435
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,520
I think Yifan is really nice.

436
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,120
And her job is exactly

437
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,120
what my parents

438
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,520
would envy.

439
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,480
They want me to be more stable.

440
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,960
I said, then I'll find

441
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,920
a partner with a stable job, is that okay?

442
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,360
Including...

443
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,080
Actually, I told my mom about you.

444
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,520
She really likes you.

445
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,600
She uses her mom's words to express her feelings.

446
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,480
She really likes you.

447
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,680
Then she told me,

448
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,480
Such a good kid.

449
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,640
I could tell right away.

450
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,760
It made me a little embarrassed.

451
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,120
I'm not that great.

452
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,520
You're pretty good.

453
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,280
Because I understand.

454
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,560
Like, for example,

455
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,160
using

456
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,720
mom's tone to express it.

457
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,800
But I think Wang Jue

458
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,800
might be more like friends

459
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,320
with her mom.

460
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:08,720
Yeah.

461
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,720
She's kind of like

462
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,640
sharing secrets with a best friend.

463
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,600
Wanting her best friend's advice.

464
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,360
That kind of feeling.

465
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,680
Yeah, probably.

466
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,720
I want to have

467
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,320
a tomato and egg cooking contest with you.

468
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,000
We need to pick a day.

469
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,560
Thursday.

470
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,320
Thursday.

471
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,000
Is that okay?

472
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,080
Sure.

473
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,680
Then Thursday it is.

474
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,480
I'll come back early.

475
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,360
Before they get back.

476
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,280
Make both dishes.

477
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:41,960
Put them there.

478
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,600
Yeah.

479
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,160
Okay.

480
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,840
There can't be any obvious

481
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,240
like you said, putting lots of chili.

482
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:47,880
Oh, I see.

483
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,240
I wouldn't put chili

484
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,360
in tomato and egg.

485
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,120
You don't put chili in tomato and egg, right?

486
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:52,920
I wouldn't.

487
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,920
But didn't you say you like strong flavors?

488
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,240
But mine and yours

489
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,600
will definitely taste totally different.

490
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,320
Because you add sugar.

491
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:05,920
I add sugar.

492
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,200
Let's play that game

493
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,560
where you choose between two options.

494
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,200
Okay.

495
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,000
Soy milk with sugar or without sugar?

496
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,560
With sugar.

497
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,800
With sugar.

498
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,960
Burger or sandwich?

499
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,880
Burger.

500
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,720
Burger.

501
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,440
Then, drumstick or wing?

502
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,400
Wing.

503
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,520
Stay up late or go to bed early?

504
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,840
Stay up late.

505
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,920
Stay up late.

506
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,200
Thanks.

507
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,080
Be careful not to fall.

508
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,240
I noticed you really like blue.

509
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,440
I mean, in your clothes.

510
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,360
You've been wearing blue a lot these days.

511
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,160
Very often.

512
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,720
Yeah.

513
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,240
It looks good.

514
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,680
I want to eat this.

515
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,600
Go ahead.

516
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,000
I loved eating those sticky rice rolls when I was a kid.

517
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,120
Me too.

518
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,480
They have it here.

519
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,080
Don’t we have eight-treasure rice during New Year?

520
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,240
Sticky rice rolls should definitely be savory.

521
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,040
Are you crazy?

522
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,440
Sticky rice rolls are definitely sweet.

523
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,640
They must have red bean paste inside.

524
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,880
Pickled mustard.

525
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,440
Red bean paste.

526
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:29,960
Pickled mustard.

527
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,600
I know you mean that kind of breakfast.

528
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,600
Yeah, breakfast.

529
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,960
The kind with pickled mustard and pork floss.

530
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,520
Pickled mustard and pork floss.

531
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,360
Sticky rice roll.

532
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,360
Yeah, what kind of strips?

533
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,040
Pork tenderloin strips.

534
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,400
See, sticky rice should go with something sweet.

535
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,520
Isn’t what you have sweet?

536
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,520
Yeah, it tastes great this way.

537
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,320
Yeah.

538
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,200
But for breakfast, that’s a lot.

539
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,120
If it’s as big as a rice roll, it gets too much.

540
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,120
I rarely eat breakfast.

541
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,520
Rarely eat breakfast.

542
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,840
I never used to eat breakfast.

543
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,920
But I realized

544
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,240
As I get older, I can’t skip it anymore.

545
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,640
It’s bad for my stomach.

546
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,400
So now I eat some bread.

547
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,800
Or cake and stuff like that.

548
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,840
What time do you usually go to work?

549
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,920
Eight forty-five.

550
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,680
The latest is eight forty-five.

551
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,880
I get up at eight twenty.

552
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,800
I’m really good, let me tell you.

553
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,800
I do things really fast.

554
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,040
I leave the house super quickly.

555
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,840
I brush my teeth and wash my face after getting up.

556
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,000
Five minutes.

557
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,920
Same here.

558
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,600
I just brush my teeth, wash my face, and go out.

559
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,720
Sometimes I don’t even comb my hair.

560
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,840
I just go out with my hair down.

561
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,840
I can’t imagine that.

562
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,280
Do you remember

563
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,400
When we first moved into the cabin,

564
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,800
You made me zongzi.

565
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,640
That breakfast.

566
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,840
When I left, I even

567
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,800
wore a hat and sunglasses.

568
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,480
Sneaky.

569
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,720
I had no idea what you were up to.

570
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,200
Usually, when I get out of bed,

571
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,080
I’m the type

572
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,240
who gets up as soon as the alarm rings.

573
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,240
If I have something to do, I jump up right away.

574
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,640
I’m up in two seconds.

575
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,400
I plan my time precisely.

576
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,400
For example, if I need to be there at eight,

577
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,560
I count backwards.

578
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,560
How much time I need.

579
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,240
Subtract that time.

580
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,000
It’s very precise.

581
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,880
Yeah, like during the commute.

582
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,040
Subtract the commuting time.

583
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,480
Right.

584
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,480
Then set my wake-up time.

585
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,960
Leave five to ten minutes.

586
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,000
Yeah, me too.

587
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,920
And if

588
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,760
I get up at eight twenty,

589
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,120
I set an alarm for eight twenty,

590
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,040
eight twenty-two, and eight twenty-five.

591
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,800
Then

592
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,600
I have to leave at twenty-five past.

593
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,360
The twenty-five alarm rings too.

594
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,560
I order a ride while brushing my teeth and washing my face.

595
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,360
After I’m done,

596
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,520
I go straight downstairs and get in the car.

597
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,240
And then I’m off.

598
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,560
What about lunch?

599
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,920
There’s a cafeteria for lunch.

600
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,160
But sometimes I order food myself.

601
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:31,960
Order delivery.

602
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,800
I go to bed a bit earlier than you.

603
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,280
I go to bed a bit earlier than you.

604
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,280
I sleep earlier than you.

605
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,000
If I don’t sleep before midnight,

606
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,440
I’m tired the next day.

607
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,120
That’s a good habit.

608
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,320
My ideal is

609
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,520
to fall asleep before midnight.

610
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,520
That’s everyone’s ideal, for sure.

611
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,080
Want to grab something to eat?

612
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,760
Let's go.

613
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,360
So much protein.

614
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,480
A day for building muscle.

615
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,360
How do you feel?

616
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,400
Are you exhausted?

617
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,360
It's a bit tough.

618
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,920
I'm worried about you.

619
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:22,760
How's your body holding up?

620
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,680
I'm okay, but it was really fun.

621
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,280
It's been a long time since I last dived.

622
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,280
Which activity do you like most?

623
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,680
Actually, I like surfing the most.

624
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,360
Why?

625
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,400
Because...

626
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,120
I think it's totally different from

627
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,880
what I imagined.

628
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,360
Surfing is the most challenging.

629
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,840
But what you enjoy most is

630
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,840
scuba diving.

631
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,720
The most challenging one.

632
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:46,880
That's great.

633
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,760
I've got another activity to try.

634
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,120
You put a lot of thought into it.

635
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,760
Really thoughtful.

636
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,000
Many of my friends

637
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,880
I always try to get them interested.

638
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,360
Let's go diving.

639
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,280
We can go together next time.

640
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,440
Why do you like diving?

641
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,200
I think

642
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,960
it's probably also

643
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,520
a way for me to escape.

644
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,360
Escape into the ocean.

645
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,880
Yeah, exactly.

646
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,320
Like when you're really in the city,

647
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,480
and work gets overwhelming,

648
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,080
there are so many unhappy things.

649
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,320
When you stay underwater,

650
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,320
everything around you feels so quiet.

651
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,160
When you're sitting on the ocean floor,

652
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,200
in front of you

653
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,760
there are lots of fish,

654
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,560
many creatures,

655
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,560
and all around you

656
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,480
there are

657
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,840
lots of coral.

658
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,920
Behind you might be a beautiful view.

659
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,720
And in front of you

660
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,560
there could even be

661
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,160
a bottomless cliff.

662
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,000
You just sit on that slope,

663
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,480
and space out.

664
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,960
Then you look up,

665
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,840
and see your bubbles rising.

666
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,960
You see

667
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,160
how far you are from the surface.

668
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,120
It's so deep below.

669
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,160
You feel like

670
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,920
you've left the world behind.

671
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,920
Actually, today I

672
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,520
tried what you just described.

673
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,960
When I was sitting down there,

674
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,600
I looked up,

675
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,800
tilted my head and saw bubbles.

676
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,120
Yeah, I saw those bubbles

677
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,880
rising and then popping.

678
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,120
Sometimes I feel like when I learn something,

679
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,240
I just tried surfing recently,

680
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,960
I already feel pretty good at it.

681
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,760
I think I was really brave.

682
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,000
The first time I tried,

683
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:29,680
Just now,

684
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,320
when you turned my head,

685
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,120
I was worried you might fall.

686
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,280
Of course I know.

687
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,520
You were protecting me.

688
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,160
But what I mean is,

689
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,480
I was so scared the first time,

690
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,480
but much braver the second time.

691
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,600
Every time I make progress,

692
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,400
even small breakthroughs, I tend to magnify them.

693
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,720
Honestly, I think I'm pretty awesome.

694
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,480
Yeah.

695
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,600
Facing conflict head-on.

696
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,600
Facing your inner fears.

697
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,560
So I think

698
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,160
it's great.

699
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,160
From my perspective,

700
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,520
how do I see you?

701
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,040
I think you're a great person too.

702
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:04,800
That's why I think diving

703
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,640
is actually pretty fun.

704
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,800
It's a lot like being in a relationship.

705
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,880
You have to trust each other.

706
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,400
You have to solve problems together.

707
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:16,720
Because

708
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,280
like before,

709
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,080
I ran into a lot of problems underwater.

710
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,080
It was a lot like a strong current.

711
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,800
The current was really powerful.

712
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,800
When you're in the ocean,

713
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,160
you can't fight against that force.

714
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,200
One time really stuck with me.

715
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:28,600
I was

716
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,520
holding onto the person below me,

717
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,200
and that person

718
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,000
was holding onto a piece of coral.

719
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,040
Then

720
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,000
the two of us just floated there.

721
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,840
For the first time, I felt

722
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,080
that my dive buddy

723
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,440
really saved my life.

724
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,240
That's a life-saving bond.

725
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,240
Yeah.

726
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,000
Honestly, this experience

727
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,280
made me more responsible.

728
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,960
Is it becoming, or awakening?

729
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,440
The problems you face are different.

730
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,400
Well,

731
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,320
there, you face

732
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,120
life-or-death issues.

733
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,480
But in daily life,

734
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,120
it feels like you think

735
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,120
the problems aren't a big deal.

736
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,520
But actually, those problems

737
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,160
still need to be solved.

738
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,080
That's because

739
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:08,640
you're already

740
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,920
a very responsible person.

741
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,360
Otherwise,

742
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,240
do you think just one dive

743
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,440
can change a person?

744
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:16,920
You never know.

745
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,080
Try it next time.

746
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:21,920
I've been in the ocean before.

747
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,280
I just handed myself over

748
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,200
to a stranger coach.

749
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,840
He put a life ring on me,

750
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,640
and pulled me along.

751
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,440
That's how it was.

752
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,480
So I think

753
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,080
it's still because

754
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,240
you're already that kind of person.

755
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,240
Maybe this just woke it up in you.

756
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,840
Just like how I chose

757
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,760
the health track now.

758
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,720
Are you eating or drinking?

759
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,120
I'll just have some soup.

760
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,480
Do you want anything else?

761
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:55,920
That's all.

762
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,160
No mushrooms or anything.

763
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:57,560
Okay.

764
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,520
Want to try a bite?

765
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,560
Sure.

766
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,120
Give it a try.

767
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:00,920
Thanks.

768
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,120
Thank you.

769
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,040
Can we add more soup and cook it again?

770
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,240
But it won't be as flavorful.

771
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,000
Darn it.

772
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:36,600
Darn it.

773
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,040
Used the wrong pot.

774
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,560
No wonder it wasn't moving.

775
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,080
Unbelievable.

776
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,760
Luckily, there's water underneath.

777
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,600
I was wondering why the water isn't boiling.

778
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,920
Mine is already boiling.

779
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,240
Should we add more salt?

780
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,320
I don't know, I haven't tasted it.

781
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,360
Maybe I should try it.

782
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,560
Go ahead and taste it.

783
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,520
Is it salty?

784
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,000
No, it's not that salty.

785
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,640
Why are you holding chicken bouillon?

786
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,800
This is salt.

787
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,080
Just add a little salt.

788
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:27,840
It enhances the flavor.

789
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,000
Should we add it?

790
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,360
Just a little.

791
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,000
Drink something lighter.

792
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,240
Don't drink too much salty stuff.

793
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,280
I only used a little seasoning.

794
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,480
You don't want meat.

795
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,440
No winter melon either.

796
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,120
Is there winter melon?

797
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:45,640
Yes.

798
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,320
Mushrooms are fine.

799
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:46,880
Mushrooms.

800
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,160
Sometimes winter melon gets cooked like this.

801
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:51,960
You can't really tell.

802
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,680
I'm heading back now.

803
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,160
Okay.

804
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:15,800
Okay.

805
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,160
This time, we don't have to guess.

806
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,280
Let's get the answer directly.

807
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,880
Let's take a look.

808
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,480
At the message content.

809
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:08,840
Alright, let's do it.

810
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,720
I had a great time today.

811
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,040
Hope your neck gets better soon.

812
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,600
Maybe feeling a spark and being suitable

813
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,480
are two different things.

814
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,440
Thanks for playing squash together today.

815
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,360
And having dinner.

816
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,160
Two newbies battling each other was hilarious.

817
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,840
I saw an even better side of you today.

818
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,360
Riding the roller coaster was a bit tiring.

819
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,160
But even if I could do it again,

820
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,840
I'd still get on without hesitation.

821
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,240
Emotional roller coaster.

822
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,720
Please don't feel pressured.

823
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,000
Just go with your heart.

824
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,760
No one needs to change themselves for anyone.

825
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,800
Or feel uncomfortable

826
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,920
about who they are.

827
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,600
Alright, let's check the girl's message.

828
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,160
Playing squash for the first time was fun.

829
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,080
I thought about the question in the car.

830
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,680
A dive buddy is my standard.

831
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,080
Safe companionship.

832
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,120
Mutual trust.

833
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,120
Enjoying together.

834
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,240
Thank you for your book.

835
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,280
I'll talk to you after I read it.

836
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,680
Even though we're both not good at

837
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,720
those activities today,

838
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,440
the claw machine

839
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,520
surprisingly made me

840
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,680
see a new side of you.

841
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,280
Your calm and patient side.

842
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,880
You look pretty cute in pink.

843
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,600
During today's date,

844
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,960
did you feel a spark?

845
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:38,760
Alright.

846
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,280
How about this one?

847
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,400
This is

848
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,880
the content of our heartwarming messages.

849
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,840
Everyone,

850
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,440
thanks for your effort.

851
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,360
Let's feel the spark together next time.
