1
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,680
Here we come.

2
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,440
This moment deserves applause.

3
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,320
Hello, everyone.

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,320
I'm from Heart Signal.

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,640
I'm Liu Zihan from season eight.

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:26,920
Hello, everyone.

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm from Heart Signal.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,800
I'm Wang Lechen from Hangzhou, season eight.

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,120
Hello, everyone.

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm from Heart Signal.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,880
I'm Sun Xing from season five.

12
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,320
Hello, everyone.

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,320
I'm from Heart Signal.

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,320
I'm Xue Zheyang from season five.

15
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:34,920
Hello, everyone.

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,960
I'm from Heart Signal.

17
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,040
I'm Chen Zonglun from season five.

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,800
Last episode,

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,400
we saw Liu Zihan's entrance.

20
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,200
Everyone must be looking forward to

21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,720
what happens next.

22
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,880
We're really excited.

23
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,320
Since everyone's so excited,

24
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,240
why don't we

25
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,440
play a little game?

26
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,000
What game?

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,760
What game?

28
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,560
This game

29
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,400
can test how in sync the Heartbeat Boys are.

30
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,720
How well do we really connect?

31
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,000
We're definitely in sync.

32
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,080
Game rules:

33
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,880
Each of the five guests holds a mystery bag.

34
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,480
Each bag contains several items.

35
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,160
After hearing the question,

36
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,520
all five will simultaneously

37
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,840
take out one item as their answer.

38
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,800
If everyone chooses the same item,

39
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,600
that's team synchronization.

40
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,760
That means the challenge is a success.

41
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,080
There will be three rounds in total.

42
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,520
If synchronization isn't achieved in three rounds,

43
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,480
team synchronization

44
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,080
Why?

45
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,880
Look into my eyes.

46
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,520
Tell me why.

47
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,720
Why should I pick this?

48
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,080
then the Tuning Plan will be activated.

49
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,440
Got it?

50
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,720
How does the Tuning Plan work?

51
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,320
How do we tune?

52
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,160
Switch teammates.

53
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,920
We'll explain tuning later.

54
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,560
Let's go.

55
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,920
Two friends are a bit different.

56
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,440
Wearing clothes inside out.

57
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,600
Definitely need to go inside and change.

58
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:55,960
Right.

59
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,480
Right.

60
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,680
Go back to the cabin and change.

61
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,480
What's with your car?

62
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,280
Driving.

63
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,480
You're changing in the car?

64
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,040
Why should I pick this?

65
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,880
Why?

66
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,960
Maybe because there's a little train.

67
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,400
You two chose differently.

68
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,080
First, explain

69
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,480
why you picked this item.

70
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,080
The computer broke.

71
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,400
Go back to the cabin.

72
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,360
You're going back again?

73
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,840
Why do you love going back so much?

74
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,960
Ask the female guest for help fixing it.

75
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,120
Yeah, ask the female guest.

76
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,240
Help fix it.

77
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,360
Got it.

78
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,680
Tap it, give it a pat.

79
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,560
It'll work eventually.

80
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,120
Makes sense.

81
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,720
Totally reasonable.

82
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,760
Pry it open and fix it.

83
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,120
Right.

84
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,040
You can use this to turn screws too.

85
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,320
We're thinking the same, right?

86
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:53,800
Right.

87
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,880
Repair expert.

88
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,800
Professional.

89
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,640
What are you doing?

90
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,600
What are you up to?

91
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,800
What are you doing?

92
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,920
What do you want to do?

93
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,640
What are you doing?

94
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,320
Where are you going?

95
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,560
What are you doing?

96
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:19,920
No.

97
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,440
You want to...

98
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,400
Why?

99
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,160
Look into my eyes.

100
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,840
Tell me why.

101
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,200
Why?

102
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,280
Baby, why?

103
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,800
Baby, why?

104
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,120
No.

105
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,120
Forty degrees heat.

106
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,200
Shouldn't we go for a train ride then?

107
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,880
Wouldn't it be better to go home and enjoy the AC?

108
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,440
Can't afford an air conditioner.

109
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,480
You adjust it yourself.

110
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,320
You're about to be transferred.

111
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,640
Sorry, we have to accept it.

112
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,360
Not us.

113
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:44,640
You.

114
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,160
You.

115
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,120
So close, almost there.

116
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,080
But we have to accept the result.

117
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,360
That's the "Tuning Plan."

118
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:52,840
Come on.

119
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,360
Let's see how to tune the frequency.

120
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,440
"Tuning Plan" activated.

121
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,080
Now we need to do it together.

122
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,160
Viral Group Dance Challenge.

123
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,160
Complete the performance to succeed in tuning.

124
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,280
If you pick me, it's guaranteed to fail.

125
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,840
Definitely a failure.

126
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,440
Darn it, feels like I've been...

127
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,880
...set up.

128
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,960
Are you...

129
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,680
Are you that person?

130
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,120
The "undercover"?

131
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,520
Is it?

132
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,520
Everyone would think to take the cabin.

133
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,960
You brought out a car.

134
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,800
There's a mole! We have a mole!

135
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,480
We're playing "Who's the Undercover."

136
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,280
The crew prepared these for us—

137
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,160
Thoughtful anti-awkward sunglasses.

138
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,720
You're not afraid of awkwardness, it's fine.

139
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,360
You're not afraid.

140
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,160
I'm embarrassed.

141
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,200
Awkward.

142
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:40,960
Give me one.

143
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,480
Let's do it.

144
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,440
Right hand, right?

145
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,360
Then left hand.

146
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,840
Then right hand again.

147
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,840
Then right hand again.

148
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,000
Do we need to split into groups?

149
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:07,880
Honestly,

150
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,560
I'll stand in the middle.

151
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,280
Thanks.

152
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,880
Okay, I'll stand on the left.

153
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,680
I'm on the left too.

154
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,480
You're on the left too?

155
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,040
We only need the left side.

156
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,480
Okay.

157
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,200
Then we realized there's no right side.

158
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,040
No right side.

159
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,520
Start with the right hand on top.

160
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,320
Then the left hand.

161
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,360
Then open up.

162
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,800
Then it's...

163
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,600
Then...

164
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,120
Like this.

165
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:36,880
Like this.

166
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,240
Then like this.

167
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,120
Then slowly...

168
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,400
Go up.

169
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:39,840
Come down.

170
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,560
Then come down again.

171
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,520
Then again...

172
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,440
Then turn?

173
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:43,960
Do we need to turn?

174
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,040
Then flip your hand.

175
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,560
Flip your hand again.

176
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,360
After flipping your hand...

177
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,080
Got it.

178
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,120
Got it.

179
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,240
After they finish shaking...

180
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,640
Then you step forward.

181
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,760
We'll stand behind him.

182
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,760
Then the order...

183
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,840
Should go from low to high.

184
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,920
I'm at the very bottom.

185
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,240
You're at the bottom, I'm here.

186
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,240
Then I'm here.

187
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,480
Let's go.

188
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,360
Awesome!

189
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,720
Great!

190
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,520
Even though in the game,

191
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,560
we might lack some teamwork,

192
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,600
but the Heartbeat Boys in dancing

193
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,720
are definitely in sync, I believe.

194
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,320
Really in sync.

195
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,600
I don’t even know when to make a move.

196
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,760
Can we do that move again?

197
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,040
Do it again.

198
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,280
Can you do a hip twist?

199
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,040
Can you twist your hips?

200
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,760
If you mess up later,

201
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,880
it’s that move.

202
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,600
Sorry.

203
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,440
Let’s keep watching then.

204
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,800
Secretly.

205
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,840
You invited someone.

206
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,440
I bet it’s not Xu Rulan.

207
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,880
Does Xu Rulan even need to be secretive?

208
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,360
Chichi (Sun Hanqing).

209
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,680
Yeah, I think it’s Chichi (Sun Hanqing) too.

210
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,000
Why?

211
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,200
She was the first girl he met.

212
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,440
The first girl he saw

213
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,720
was Sun Hanqing, right?

214
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,160
Usually, the first one you meet

215
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,360
is the one you invite.

216
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,120
Because she leaves the deepest impression.

217
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,280
It could be Duoduo (Ke Ailin).

218
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,480
Chichi (Sun Hanqing).

219
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,040
You got it right.

220
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,640
No, this is definitely a setup.

221
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,600
It’s definitely a trap.

222
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,120
Maybe not.

223
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,720
This is

224
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,040
a smoke bomb.

225
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,360
I bet a cup of tea it’s Duoduo (Ke Ailin).

226
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,840
I bet a bite of fruit it’s Chichi (Sun Hanqing).

227
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,120
I bet you all a glass of water.

228
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,720
If you guess right, you’re awesome.

229
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,200
You’re awesome.

230
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,240
Here we go.

231
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,040
So who will we choose?

232
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,200
Who is 8202?

233
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,760
Who is 8202?

234
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,000
There are two people in 8202.

235
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,200
Duoduo (Ke Ailin) and Xu Rulan.

236
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,120
Wang Yifan.

237
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,600
Wang Yifan.

238
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,000
Chichi (Sun Hanqing).

239
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,240
Amazing!

240
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,960
You guessed right!

241
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,280
I got it right.

242
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,000
Congrats!

243
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,160
So,

244
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,200
Feed me some fruit.

245
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,960
Come on.

246
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,960
He’s feeding you fruit.

247
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,520
He.

248
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,920
You guessed right.

249
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,480
Yeah, you have to feed me fruit.

250
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,360
I get to choose, right?

251
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,160
You don’t get to choose.

252
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:58,880
This is pineapple.

253
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,880
What is this?

254
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,320
Is it guava?

255
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,800
Want to try it?

256
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,680
No, thanks.

257
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,880
My cheeks are about to fall off.

258
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
So delicious.

259
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,400
So sweet.

260
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,640
So cool.

261
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,720
Kayaking.

262
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,040
This date is pretty good.

263
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,680
This is really

264
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,640
This...

265
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,200
Two people per kayak.

266
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,880
Yuan Xiangqin (character name).

267
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,720
Let’s go!

268
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,320
Go!

269
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,880
No wonder I couldn’t paddle then.

270
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,400
Doing the opposite is a skill too.

271
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,680
What?

272
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,360
You’re such a social butterfly.

273
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,840
Full boyfriend power.

274
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,280
And you can help out too.

275
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,600
You’re so good at dating, bro.

276
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
So good at dating.

277
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,240
You guys are hilarious.

278
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,280
Such a perfect match.

279
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,280
So in sync.

280
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,120
Just like you.

281
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,480
Perfect match.

282
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,800
Made for each other.

283
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,160
Getting a bit heated.

284
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:10,840
There’s plenty of time ahead.

285
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,640
I attract so many mosquitoes.

286
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,080
Stick on another one.

287
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,840
Can’t you stick it yourself?

288
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,200
Can't stick it on.

289
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,920
Interesting.

290
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,800
You're just jealous.

291
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,000
Getting started.

292
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,560
In a moment, he will...

293
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,920
His "deadly" dose.

294
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,440
Lethal dose.

295
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,200
Chili pepper.

296
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,960
She said it herself.

297
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,880
You should open the lid first.

298
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,120
She said it herself.

299
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,160
She spoke her true feelings.

300
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,480
There's more to this?

301
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,360
Take initiative and you'll have a story.

302
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,840
She really can cook.

303
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,560
Who?

304
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,000
Eat up. (Sun Hanqing)

305
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,640
I thought you were praising me.

306
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,560
Weren't you?

307
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,840
I already know you can cook.

308
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,440
It's already dark.

309
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,160
Trying to get you to talk.

310
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:05,600
Getting you to talk.

311
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,320
Pretty good.

312
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,440
So similar.

313
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,760
I have to say, they're a perfect match.

314
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,680
A match made in heaven.

315
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,760
Why so fierce, Zihan?

316
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,240
Am I fierce?

317
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,840
Maybe I was nervous then.

318
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,240
Of course, very nervous.

319
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,400
You're really good at this.

320
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,480
Why?

321
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,520
What's the mailbox?

322
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,960
Everyone has a mailbox.

323
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,800
And a key.

324
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,320
Each day, one person

325
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,360
can open it once.

326
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,320
If any of you

327
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,520
open someone else's mailbox,

328
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,680
that day you'll have

329
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,320
a train ride together.

330
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,640
Got it.

331
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,360
You guys have a lot of activities.

332
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,440
Who secretly opened it?

333
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,280
Who could it be? Who is it?

334
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,280
Someone cares about you.

335
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,600
Caring about you.

336
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,000
Say something.

337
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,320
Say something.

338
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,320
My heart skipped a beat in that moment.

339
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,040
That was so sweet.

340
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,000
She opened the mailbox.

341
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,840
So gooey.

342
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,640
Did you know it was her at that moment?

343
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,520
I had no idea.

344
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,160
Absolutely no clue.

345
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,280
So sweet.

346
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,720
The vibe is amazing.

347
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,520
It's a real train.

348
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,600
No.

349
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,920
Really?

350
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,080
I thought it was just for show.

351
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,400
This is so beautiful.

352
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,280
This is actually part of your daily life?

353
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,080
A date activity.

354
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,160
A date activity.

355
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,960
Feels like this season has so many

356
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,200
brand new space designs.

357
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,800
Like this train and other things.

358
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,680
I never

359
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,600
could have imagined these things before.

360
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,520
It keeps getting better.

361
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,760
It keeps getting better.

362
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,760
Thank you.

363
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,080
How about another season?

364
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,000
Youth never comes back.

365
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,160
In a blink, I'm thirty.

366
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,240
Time to retire and go home.

367
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,400
Did you write this?

368
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,800
This is so proactive.

369
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,000
That's really bold.

370
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,360
Oh my god.

371
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,360
Nice.

372
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,480
Nice.

373
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,480
Met someone.

374
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,640
That's deep.

375
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,280
You put a lot of thought into it.

376
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,560
You really

377
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,320
know what you're doing.

378
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,480
My ears are a bit red now.

379
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,600
Now my ears are ringing.

380
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,240
She protects herself so much,

381
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,440
yet still takes the initiative

382
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,520
to ride the train with you.

383
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,960
That's a big

384
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,800
Yes,

385
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,680
step forward.

386
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,120
I'm really touched.

387
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,160
"Heartfelt Whispers" are

388
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,920
those cards where

389
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,960
everyone writes a few questions.

390
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,120
You want to use

391
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,400
these five questions

392
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,040
to learn something about the other person.

393
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,760
Can I invite you all to write some too?

394
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,520
Want to give it a try?

395
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,480
Sure.

396
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,920
Okay, please share

397
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,000
your "Heartfelt Whispers."

398
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Let me read mine.

399
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,880
Your view on family.

400
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,520
What is it like?

401
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,600
Because this might determine

402
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,120
whether this person and I

403
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,480
can have a lasting relationship.

404
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,520
I think that's pretty important.

405
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,560
I might ask her

406
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,960
in her eyes,

407
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,040
what are the five most attractive

408
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,320
qualities about me?

409
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,360
Tall and fair.

410
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,440
That's an open-ended question.

411
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,360
And then,

412
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,720
Teacher, I want to report him.

413
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,120
What is he laughing at?

414
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,520
Chen, your turn.

415
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,120
Preferred way to travel.

416
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,200
How do you resolve conflicts?

417
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,080
How do you resolve conflicts?

418
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,920
Your ideal day off.

419
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:44,960
Your ideal day off.

420
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,920
The hobby you've stuck with the longest.

421
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,560
Or a sport.

422
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,120
And lastly,

423
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,400
the wish or goal you most want to achieve right now.

424
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,560
Wish or goal.

425
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,640
Interview.

426
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,280
Interview.

427
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,360
Interview.

428
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,960
Not bad, Chen.

429
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,480
Chen, you're so down-to-earth.

430
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,280
It always starts with past experiences.

431
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,320
Resume.

432
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,080
Aren't you all about resumes?

433
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,560
Your next question should be

434
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,360
how to meet deadlines.

435
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,560
How do you meet deadlines?

436
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,800
If you have five projects

437
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,400
at the same time,

438
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,200
how do you prioritize them?

439
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,160
If you have

440
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,120
five girls pursuing you at once,

441
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,080
how would you rank them?

442
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,200
How would you arrange it?

443
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,440
Then ask him first,

444
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,600
if three girls

445
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,840
want to help you open a can,

446
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,400
how would you arrange for them to open it?

447
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,120
Between you and your parents

448
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,200
what is their way of getting along

449
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:39,760
like?

450
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,240
How

451
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,280
How do you get along with your father-in-law in the future?

452
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,600
Before, during, and after marriage

453
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,080
Before, during, and after marriage

454
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,800
daily life and etiquette

455
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,200
what are your thoughts on that

456
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,360
Do you often go on blind dates?

457
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,320
"scheming"

458
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,040
You started talking about marriage right away

459
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,280
Just now it was about daily life

460
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,920
Now it's straight to marriage matters

461
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,760
In a close relationship

462
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,240
it's all about marriage

463
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,200
Everything is about getting married

464
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,280
Marry or not

465
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,360
I'm a bit older than you guys, right?

466
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,200
I do need to think about it

467
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,080
about this matter

468
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:10,640
That's true

469
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,800
Looks like Xue Ge thinks about things

470
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,240
in a more mature way

471
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,200
It's time to get married

472
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,120
You're about ready too

473
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,720
What about Liu Zihan?

474
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,320
What I wrote now

475
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,240
When facing problems

476
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,560
do you actively look for solutions

477
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,760
or just wait passively?

478
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:22,600
Actually, I think

479
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,040
this is a really crucial point

480
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,040
If both people are

481
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:25,760
passive types

482
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,520
and don't solve problems

483
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,760
it will turn into a rift

484
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,280
You need to actively fix it

485
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,480
Sometimes, in the short term

486
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,600
you can't see a great future

487
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,280
or whatever

488
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,320
But if you have confidence

489
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,200
it will work out

490
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,680
That's great

491
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:42,560
Okay

492
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,280
Actually, today

493
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,360
we've prepared something

494
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,520
special for everyone

495
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,760
It's

496
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,840
the Wish Bottle

497
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:48,920
Everyone can

498
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,000
write in this bottle

499
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,920
what you want to say to the next

500
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,480
Watch Heart with You guests

501
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,360
Or it can be

502
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,640
something you want them to do

503
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,040
There are also messages from last episode's

504
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:57,760
Watch Heart with You guests

505
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,000
written for us

506
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,320
Let's each pick one, okay?

507
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,560
I'll take the blue one

508
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,920
First come, first served

509
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,600
Got it

510
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,320
Send me a gift if you win

511
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,800
The same one

512
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,400
Everyone's setting traps

513
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,480
Mine is from Yang Kaiwen

514
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,840
Wishing everyone the best

515
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,800
Mine is

516
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,600
Send a photo in the house

517
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,800
of your happiest moment

518
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,360
If not, send a funny one

519
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:20,760
Mine is

520
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,120
Let the next person write my wish

521
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,320
Change your Xiaohongshu profile picture

522
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,240
to the person on your right for 12 hours

523
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,760
After the show airs

524
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,000
you have to use my photo

525
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,200
Congratulations

526
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,840
Just pick the most handsome one

527
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,440
Let's write down our wishes

528
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,480
Weren't you going to leave your WeChat ID?

529
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,000
Can you really say it this quickly?

530
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,040
Hello, my name is Xue Zheyang.

531
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,240
My WeChat ID is...

532
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:55,960
Hello.

533
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,280
May I ask, what are your views on marriage?

534
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,720
Hello, want to get married?

535
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,360
Hello, do you want to get married?

536
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,400
Before, during, and after marriage—

537
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,200
About daily life and necessities.

538
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,440
This is so hard.

539
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,920
I think it's hard too.

540
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,520
How should I write this?

541
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,440
I think the task-based ones are pretty fun.

542
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,400
Everyone's setting traps.

543
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,040
What kind of trap would you set?

544
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:19,760
Me?

545
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,200
Set one up.

546
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,280
I think their way—

547
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,520
Sending something is not bad.

548
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,280
Sending something.

549
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,520
Yeah, what do you think?

550
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:25,720
Send me 500 yuan.

551
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,240
Why did you write so much?

552
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,320
Are you writing a love letter?

553
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,040
Is this a confession?

554
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,200
I really like you.

555
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,120
My WeChat ID is...

556
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,160
Everyone, read your notes.

557
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,160
Let's all read them out loud.

558
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,320
Let the next guest

559
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,880
choose the person in the house who impressed them most

560
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,480
and say something heartfelt to one of the opposite sex.

561
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,160
Hello.

562
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,560
Please take a photo of this moment.

563
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,440
Send it to me on WeChat, thanks.

564
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,880
Actually, the moment isn't that important.

565
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,680
Right?

566
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,280
Don't add the wrong WeChat ID.

567
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,520
See, what I wrote is very proper.

568
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,160
Please post on Xiaohongshu now.

569
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,720
The photo should be you with your arms around

570
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,440
the people on both sides in a group photo.

571
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,560
Make it a close-up.

572
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,240
Add a caption.

573
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,280
Let's be lifelong friends.

574
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,720
Heart emoji.

575
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:06,560
Okay.

576
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,640
A loving family.

Pick a place and take me bungee jumping.

578
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,720
Post a photo of us together.

579
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,400
If you don't have one,

580
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,320
just post a nice photo of yourself.

581
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,360
Post it on Xiaohongshu.

582
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,760
Awesome.

00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,320
I send my best wishes.

586
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,680
I wish myself

587
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,320
Finally, should we take a group photo too?

588
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,640
To capture this moment—

589
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,600
this wonderful time.

590
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,240
Sure.

591
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:28,680
Alright.

592
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,800
Watch Heart with You, the heartbeat never ends.

593
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,600
See you next time.

594
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,600
Bye-bye.
