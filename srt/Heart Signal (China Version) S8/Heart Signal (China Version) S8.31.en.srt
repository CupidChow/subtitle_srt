1
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,120
What's this?

2
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,600
Park time.

3
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,600
I set up a wishing tree.

4
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,800
So romantic.

5
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,520
That's really impressive.

6
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,840
It's like a romantic drama.

7
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,720
Before I went to bed last night,

8
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,480
I was still making wishes.

9
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,120
I wished I could ride a little train too.

10
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,360
I picked it up next door to you.

11
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,120
The soundproofing is that bad?

12
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,440
Her smile is so sweet.

13
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,280
Our Heartbeat Apartment is about to have

14
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,360
an open house event.

15
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,720
A sports day.

16
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,200
The guys will invite their

17
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,360
bros to visit Heartbeat Apartment.

18
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,280
Do they have outside help?

19
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,360
So many people.

20
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,600
Today is so exciting.

21
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,520
One, two.

22
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,640
Here they come.

23
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,400
One, two.

24
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,800
Going all out for love.

25
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,880
The tension is too thick.

26
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,080
Look.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,280
They're getting closer as they jump, look.

28
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,680
Oh my.

29
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,640
When one side is in sync, the other gets messy.

30
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,320
Tired, right?

31
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,920
We can

32
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,840
rest for the first minute and thirty seconds.

33
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,120
Then jump twice.

34
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,280
Darn it.

35
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,200
Let's give it a try.

36
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,240
I'll do it.

37
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,560
This one.

38
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:29,880
I'll do it.

39
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,280
This one.

40
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,120
Xiaoyuan is really brave.

41
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,240
One, two, three, four.

42
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,480
Our Heartbeat Apartment

43
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,760
is about to have a Double Choice Date.

44
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,880
They're all yours.

45
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,760
It's my turn to give you one this time.

46
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,720
Thank you.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,640
You're welcome.

48
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,680
Both tickets are for you.

49
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,160
Both are for you.

50
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,200
Are you free tomorrow?

51
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,360
Meeting great friends

52
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,600
is also a wonderful thing.

53
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,360
Two tickets.

54
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,080
Yeah.

55
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,800
If possible.

56
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,520
I think you owe me one.

57
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,680
So cute.

58
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,040
When jasmine blooms, it's the signal of a heartbeat.

We're here!

97
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,320
First, let's welcome our new friend.

98
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,520
Xie Yilin.

99
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:56,680
Xie Yilin.

100
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,560
Hello, everyone.

101
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,880
I'm so happy to be here.

102
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,960
Last night,

103
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,440
I caught up on all the previous episodes.

104
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,560
It was so exciting.

105
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,160
So much fun, I really want to join you all.

106
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,440
What's up with this hand gesture?

107
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,960
Because on my bucket list,

108
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,800
there's something I've never achieved.

109
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,880
It's having two men fight over me.

110
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:15,920
Two men competing for me.

111
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,440
I've always thought

112
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,600
about romantic dramas.

113
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,280
I'm so envious.

114
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,360
But I think with your personality,

115
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,480
it should be pretty easy.

116
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,640
They'd just fight,

117
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,600
but not for me.

118
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,600
Next,

119
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,640
let's welcome back

120
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,760
Minghao!

121
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,600
Hello, everyone.

122
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,360
Actually, I think Rulan,

123
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,040
Xiao Jiao,

124
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,640
and

125
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,760
Dr. Fang,

126
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,160
are all quite interesting.

127
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,320
Watching them gives me

128
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,720
a lot of thoughts.

129
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,920
At the wishing tree,

130
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,560
I did feel bad for Xiao Jiao,

131
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,160
but that part really

132
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,800
touched me.

133
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,200
Because he did

134
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,640
so much.

135
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,920
He was so thorough.

136
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,000
Every detail was perfect.

137
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,960
Even the blanket and everything made me think

138
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,480
he's so attentive.

139
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,560
He must be someone who really takes care of others.

140
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,920
If you're with someone like that,

141
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,360
you can just be a "fool" and relax.

142
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,880
And then Yuxing,

143
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,280
Yifan and Chichi,

144
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,400
I think these three

145
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,800
have a subtle dynamic too.

146
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,840
Lechen's group,

147
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,040
at first,

148
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,920
Luyuan gave a lot of positive feedback to the boys.

149
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,360
It's all positive reinforcement.

150
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,840
The way those two get along

151
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,520
is really comfortable.

152
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,040
But Duoduo and Lechen,

153
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,440
Duoduo gives a lot.

154
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,680
Duoduo is like a passionate sun.

155
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,640
So I'm really looking forward

156
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,400
to today's

157
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,600
story and how it will unfold.

158
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,720
I also want to ask Minghao a question.

159
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,280
You just mentioned Xiao Jiao and

160
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,640
Dr. Fang and Lanlan.

161
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,800
Do you personally hope

162
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,080
for one side to win in the end?

163
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,240
No, I just think he's very observant.

164
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:40,800
His observation skills are impressive.

165
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,640
He's really good at observing.

166
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,640
I actually need to get to know Rulan better.

167
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,720
Because I think only

168
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,640
by understanding what kind of person Rulan is

169
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,720
what kind of person she is,

170
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,880
can you make a choice.

171
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,040
Because every girl is different.

172
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,880
Some people

173
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,000
look for a sense of security.

174
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:52,760
In that case,

175
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,280
they might like someone like Xiao Jiao.

176
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,800
All along,

177
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,000
he can nurture her with love.

178
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,080
But if

179
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,760
she's someone

180
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,320
who wants more

181
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,480
passion in a relationship,

182
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,800
more excitement,

183
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,560
then she might choose Dr. Fang.

184
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,000
So I'm still not sure yet.

185
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,720
Last week at Heartbeat Apartment,

186
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,880
we started our

187
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,160
Double Choice Date invitations.

188
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,400
Everyone bravely

189
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,240
seized

190
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,400
the chance to go on a date

191
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,480
alone with their crush.

192
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,360
So this week,

193
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,520
during the Double Choice Dates,

194
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,560
their signals

195
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,880
might change in

196
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,600
unexpected ways.

197
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,800
Alright, this round of Double Choice Dates

198
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,400
will take place over two days.

199
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,520
Let's first take a look at

200
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,200
the first day's dates.

201
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,440
Zi Han.

202
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,280
The dog is so cute.

203
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,040
Chi Chi.

204
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,040
Look at that smile.

205
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,120
Hello.

206
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,720
Hi.

207
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,320
Both of them came too.

208
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,440
I brought two friends today.

209
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,240
See, as soon as you arrived,

210
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,440
they came over to you.

211
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,920
Hello.

212
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,040
Winnie.

213
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,560
You like pets, right?

214
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,680
So I brought you to a pet shop.

215
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,160
That's great.

216
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,720
He knows what she likes.

217
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,600
And this morning,

218
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,280
didn't you make that drink?

219
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,000
Try it.

220
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,640
Did you make this?

221
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,560
I got up early and made it this morning.

222
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,440
Nice.

223
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,000
I heard you like this.

224
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,840
Yes.

225
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,800
It's good.

226
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,960
I'm satisfied.

227
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,640
Let me get dressed first.

228
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,840
This is the dog's playground.

229
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,120
A pet family park.

230
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,120
Enjoying the countryside life.

231
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,840
The height is just right.

232
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,000
Is it okay?

233
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,480
Yes.

234
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,120
Try it first.

235
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,120
You try it first.

236
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,920
It's fine, I can do it.

237
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,440
How about putting it in first?

238
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,240
Let's get it in first.

239
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,840
I think it should try it.

240
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,280
Come on, "Little Bee".

241
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:43,920
Come here, "Little Bee".

242
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,080
"Little Bee".

243
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,040
"Little Bee".

244
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,760
Yeah, Corgis swimming are super cute.

245
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,040
Its outfit is adorable.

246
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:52,880
Be careful.

247
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,880
It's fine.

248
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,960
Look, it's already moving.

249
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,400
Is it okay?

250
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,600
Can it swim?

251
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,760
It looks comfortable.

252
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,640
It's starting to soak.

253
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,640
It seems pretty comfy.

254
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,200
It's swimming so well.

255
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,360
Awesome.

256
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,160
Looks like it's having fun now.

257
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,120
So well-behaved.

258
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,600
Good boy.

259
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,200
Swimming so well.

260
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,640
I really like this activity.

261
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,560
I think when you're dating,

262
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,160
this is a great activity.

263
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,480
Surfing now.

264
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,760
Good boy.

265
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,240
Cool.

266
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,920
It's like playing with a kid.

267
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,200
Like a family of three.

268
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,000
With one kid.

269
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,640
Yeah.

270
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,000
So cute.

271
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,320
Little butt.

272
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,880
Winnie.

273
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,600
It's okay, kids always dream of going far.

274
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,840
You can't keep them close when they grow up.

275
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,640
The dog says, you two play.

276
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,120
We look like

277
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,240
"stay-at-home parents".

278
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:01,920
Yeah.

279
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,120
"stay-at-home parents".

280
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,920
Let them go when they're grown.

281
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,480
You can't keep them by your side forever.

282
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,280
He's totally into her now.

283
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,240
His heart is racing.

284
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,680
I think he wasn't really in the mood before.

285
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,520
When he wasn't in the zone.

286
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,520
You know, he was relaxed and chill.

287
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,400
He felt at ease.

288
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,800
But now that he really likes this girl,

289
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,400
he's actually

290
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,240
Yeah.

291
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:38,880
kind of awkward.

292
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,800
It's just like Ma Boxian.

293
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,400
Exactly the same.

294
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,320
Weini.

295
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,360
Okay.

296
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,080
A famous Tianjin snack.

297
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,000
Goubuli.

298
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,360
The guy is pretty interesting too.

299
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,760
Goubuli buns.

300
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,600
Over here, Weini.

301
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,280
We're taking her for a bath now.

302
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,320
She needs a bath and some grooming.

303
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,280
Come on, "Boss Wei".

304
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,200
I've never bathed a dog before.

305
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,240
Here, put her down first.

306
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,920
"Boss Wei", stretch your legs.

307
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,880
Alright.

308
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:11,960
Boss Wei.

309
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,160
Today is the day

310
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,960
for your spa massage.

311
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,080
I'm Technician No. 1.

312
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,600
I'm Technician No. 2.

313
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,400
He's Technician No. 2.

314
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,760
Let us know if you're satisfied today.

315
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,360
You've never bathed a dog either.

316
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,280
Me neither.

317
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,280
First time.

318
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,880
Such unprofessional technicians.

319
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,600
Yeah.

320
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,000
Good thing she can't understand us.

321
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,920
True.

322
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,800
Where are you going?

323
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,320
Boss Wei.

324
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,640
Boss Wei wants a back massage.

325
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:40,600
Come here.

326
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,520
Let me massage you.

327
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,840
Massage a bit.

328
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,720
So cute.

329
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,640
Is this too much pressure?

330
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,520
Let me know if it hurts.

331
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,320
You sit for too long usually.

332
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,040
Your neck seems a bit stiff.

333
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,400
Crack an egg.

334
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,560
Let me coat you with egg wash first.

335
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,000
He talks in a cute way.

336
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,400
Good thing she doesn't understand Chinese.

337
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,440
I love serving clients like this.

338
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,120
He's pretty good at making Chichi laugh.

339
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,600
Funny.

340
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,600
And Chichi totally

341
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,440
is starting to get his jokes.

342
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,160
Punchlines.

343
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,960
Let me show you a technique.

344
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,480
Bad dog.

345
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,600
Actually, this is how I imagined

346
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,880
a romantic relationship.

347
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,800
Your fantasy?

348
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,760
You imagine a lot of scenarios.

349
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,920
Try everything in these thirty thousand days.

350
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,680
Otherwise, life would be so dull.

351
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,640
(Weini) gets a drying treatment.

352
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,400
Let the professionals handle it.

353
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,960
Look how tired she is.

354
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,800
Are you tired too?

355
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,640
A little bit.

356
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,440
Do you want some?

357
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,280
I'll do it.

358
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,520
Sneaking a peek.

359
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,960
There's not this much food at home.

360
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,080
You have to go out to eat.

361
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,200
The guy is funny.

362
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,360
Are you hungry?

363
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,600
Taking the chance to ask her out for a meal.

364
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,640
Hey, feed me too.

365
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,120
Finish eating.

366
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,080
Sit for a while.

367
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,520
Sit for a bit.

368
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,400
Wait for

369
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,720
Weini to come back.

370
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,240
Okay.

371
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,080
Feels like he's always thinking about something.

372
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,720
The machine broke again this morning.

373
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:47,920
Why?

374
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,160
Yeah, I think so.

375
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,120
Used too much powder.

376
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,680
The first two cups didn't come out at all.

377
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,000
Then I fiddled with it for almost an hour.

378
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,360
He's quietly mentioning it.

379
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,680
What he did this morning.

380
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,520
That's how we got this.

381
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,680
He wants some credit.

382
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,040
You seem so attentive.

383
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,760
Look at that smile.

384
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,720
Satisfied.

385
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,000
What's your usual lifestyle like?

386
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,280
Is it more refined?

387
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:13,760
Or

388
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:15,880
Casual?

389
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:16,960
Home is best.

390
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,680
Everything is

391
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,160
Very organized.

392
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,520
So you spend a lot of time alone?

393
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,640
Yeah.

394
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,720
If you divide your free time

395
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,480
into ten parts,

396
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,320
Ten.

397
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,760
Right, total is ten.

398
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,880
Then you split it into

399
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,280
Alone time,

400
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,000
Socializing,

401
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,120
With friends, and with a partner.

402
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,240
If you divide it into three,

403
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:40,880
How would you split it?

404
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,200
If I have a partner, I think

405
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,960
Alone: 2, Social: 3, Partner: 5.

406
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,160
That's exactly how I'd split it.

407
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,640
Exactly the same?

408
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,520
Why do you split it like that?

409
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,880
Tell me your reason.

410
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,760
Because I feel like

411
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,680
I need a lot of companionship.

412
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,360
What do you think can

413
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,240
make a couple's

414
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,480
relationship grow quickly?

415
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,240
Just ask directly.

416
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,480
That's a great question.

417
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,400
I think it's doing

418
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,880
everyday things together.

419
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,160
Grocery shopping.

420
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,680
Do you like grocery shopping?

421
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,560
I love grocery shopping.

422
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,840
I don't even know what to buy.

423
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,200
Not really picking anything.

424
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,440
Yeah, just wandering around.

425
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,040
Yeah.

426
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,280
Yeah.

427
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,920
They're really similar.

428
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,800
I like it too.

429
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,840
I just push the cart in,

430
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,640
and leave with an empty cart.

431
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,640
Leave with an empty cart.

432
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,920
Yeah, empty cart.

433
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,000
Yeah, me too.

434
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,560
The two of them seem

435
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,880
really compatible.

436
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,200
Why is grocery shopping so important?

437
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,600
It's a homey setting.

438
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,560
And grocery shopping

439
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,400
really shows what the other person likes.

440
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,560
And it's so happy.

441
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,560
It's that feeling of daily life together.

442
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,920
It's already washed and dried.

443
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,160
We cleaned it really well.

444
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,600
Yeah.

445
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:32,920
Weini.

446
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,640
Want to take a photo with us?

447
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,040
Weini.

448
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,120
So cute.

449
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,080
So cute.

450
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,480
So cute.

451
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,880
So cute.

452
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,240
Yeah, I love it.

453
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,840
Just had a bath.

454
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,160
It's raining.

455
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,240
Dirty again.

456
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,120
So fast.

457
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,240
Awesome.

458
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,600
You go ahead, I'll set it up for them.

459
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,800
Step up, come on.

460
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,160
Come here, Nicole.

461
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,160
Slow down.

462
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:25,520
Come on.

463
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:25,960
Nicole.

464
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,040
Come in.

465
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,120
Sit here.

466
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,480
You sit here.

467
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,880
Little gestures.

468
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,920
Help her pull out the chair first.

469
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,200
Do you have any food restrictions?

470
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,680
It's usually like this.

471
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,760
I want to eat fries.

472
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,240
I like fries.

473
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:49,640
Here.

474
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,400
You like fries.

475
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,400
You know how I solve problems?

476
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,480
Small problems, I eat fries.

477
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,960
Big problems, I eat cake.

478
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,600
Fries for small things, cake for big things.

479
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:01,960
So all your problems in life

480
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,880
can be solved.

481
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,440
Right.

482
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,840
That's great, really nice.

483
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,120
I love celebrating birthdays.

484
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,320
Do you like celebrating your own or others' birthdays?

485
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,520
My own.

486
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,720
When I'm in a bad mood,

487
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,320
I celebrate my own birthday.

488
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,920
Bad mood means birthday time.

489
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,680
It's not just once a year.

490
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,200
No.

491
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,280
As long as I buy a birthday cake,

492
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,480
it's my birthday.

493
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,600
And I have to make a wish.

494
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,160
Make a birthday wish.

495
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,800
So you have lots of wishes every year.

496
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,680
Yes.

497
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,480
Chi Chi's vibe

498
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,200
is like running out of a castle,

499
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,680
like a little princess.

500
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,800
What do you think is your best quality?

501
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,360
I'm very resilient.

502
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,680
Very resilient.

503
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,600
But sometimes, emotionally,

504
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,720
I'm kind of

505
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,320
timid.

506
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,680
You're more passive.

507
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,680
No, I'm not passive.

508
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,160
I'm actually pretty proactive.

509
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:52,720
But

510
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,320
if I don't get positive feedback,

511
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,520
I will

512
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,080
back off.

513
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,040
That's exactly what I said before.

514
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,840
My answer was exactly the same.

515
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,840
Not a single word different.

516
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,520
Those two are amazing.

517
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,480
We're so alike.

518
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,480
We're really alike.

519
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,000
He's so happy.

520
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,040
Those two seem

521
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,640
really compatible.

522
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,520
Sometimes,

523
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:31,840
you

524
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,280
really meet someone

525
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,480
who's just like you,

526
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,720
and it can be scary.

527
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,680
Why?

528
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,800
Because I feel like I'm being seen through.

529
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,280
Like I'm transparent, you know?

530
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,320
It's because we're so alike, you know?

531
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,120
I understand him too well.

532
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,280
We're really too similar.

533
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,200
It's like if two people are playing chess,

534
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,240
it feels like meeting your match.

535
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,920
I'm a bit younger than you.

536
00:20:59,360 --> 00:20:59,600
Yeah.

537
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,200
Thanks.

538
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,320
What do you think, for example,

539
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,920
What do you think, for example,

540
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,320
What do you think, for example,

541
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,520
in a relationship,

542
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,760
what's the most important thing?

543
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,600
You have to be compatible in daily life.

544
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,720
On the same wavelength and complementary.

545
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,600
Actually, in my opinion,

546
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,040
I think being complementary is more important.

547
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,560
Being complementary is more important.

548
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,520
Being on the same wavelength is about hobbies and interests.

549
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,480
But I think

550
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,840
you need to complement each other emotionally and in personality.

551
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,640
Otherwise, it's easy

552
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,880
to have conflicts.

553
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,000
I kind of agree.

554
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,080
But complementary people might have more clashes.

555
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,440
Because you're different.

556
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,160
Really?

557
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,520
I think similar people

558
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,400
are more likely to clash.

559
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,760
Do you think similarity is more important or

560
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,240
being complementary?

561
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,800
I don't think it's important.

562
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,160
With similar people, maybe we'll do

563
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,760
lots of interesting things together.

564
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,920
But sometimes complementary people are also

565
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,640
everyone will

566
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,040
take a long time to adjust.

567
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,440
It's hard to find two people

568
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,720
who are instantly compatible in this big world.

569
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,600
I like what the guy said.

570
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,520
This part.

571
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,320
Why?

572
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,720
Because I think everyone

573
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,080
has a different relationship.

574
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,720
Each one is unique.

575
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,560
Being complementary has

576
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,440
its own advantages.

577
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,440
Similarity has its own benefits too.

578
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,680
It's about loving the person themselves.

579
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,320
That's enough.

580
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,960
If you're similar,

581
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,800
find the fun parts you share.

582
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,240
If you're complementary,

583
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,120
you can find complementary aspects.

584
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,520
to make the relationship better.

585
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,400
So,

586
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,360
I won't

587
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,720
focus on comparing these two.

588
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,120
If I think this person is great,

589
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,000
I'll just focus on them.

590
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,960
And do things that belong

591
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,320
just to the two of us.

592
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,040
I brought some desserts.

593
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,880
This is the mille-feuille.

594
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,160
Yeah.

595
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,640
There's cake she likes.

596
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,360
She smiled.

597
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,760
Eating cake again.

598
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,520
Every time you eat cake, you can make a wish.

599
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:32,800
And then your wish can come true.

600
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,920
And then your wish can come true.

601
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,760
That's it, I'm in love.

602
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,720
Should we make a wish first?

603
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,880
Stick a french fry in.

604
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,680
Dip it in (ketchup).

605
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,120
Yeah, stick it (in the cake).

606
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,880
You don't want to ruin it.

607
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,400
Kind of don't want to ruin it.

608
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,200
Then I'll hold it.

609
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,160
Hold it up.

610
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:54,960
Then

611
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,160
Stick it on the edge.

612
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,040
You can make two wishes today.

613
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,040
One big wish and one small wish.

614
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,640
There's both fries and cake.

615
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,640
Happy birthday to you.

616
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,400
Happy birthday to you.

617
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,920
Thank you.

618
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,120
Happy birthday to you.

619
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,000
Happy birthday to you.

620
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,960
Happy birthday to you.

621
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,840
Happy birthday to you.

622
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,240
I love these childish things.

623
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,640
So romantic.

624
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,320
Yeah.

625
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,920
Thank you.

626
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,120
Blow out the candles.

627
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,920
Blow out the candles and eat it.

628
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,920
Okay, I'll eat it.

629
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,360
Yeah.

630
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,400
Thank you.

631
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,200
You eat.

632
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,160
So in your daily life,

633
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,480
are you someone who values rituals?

634
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,440
Like, on your ten-thousandth day of life,

635
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,760
I’d definitely go out and celebrate big.

636
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,600
What day of your life are you on now?

637
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,160
I forgot.

638
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,240
But I think ten thousand days

639
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,840
was last year or the year before.

640
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,960
How did you celebrate?

641
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,840
I definitely invited friends out.

642
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,600
We had a big meal together.

643
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,200
Yeah.

644
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,320
What about your nine-thousandth or eight-thousandth day?

645
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,360
I didn’t keep track back then.

646
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,080
That’s interesting.

647
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,480
Does that count as having a sense of ritual?

648
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,600
It does.

649
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,680
That’s so romantic.

650
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,640
Let’s go.

651
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,160
Let’s go.

652
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,040
Heading home.

653
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,880
Actually, those two

654
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,520
are a good match.

655
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,800
It’s my first time seeing fries stuck in a cake.

656
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,720
We just mentioned having a partner,

657
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,240
having a partner,

658
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,960
having alone time,

659
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,080
and socializing.

660
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,840
How do you

661
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,240
balance your life among them?

662
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,160
For me, socializing is two,

663
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,760
and being with my partner or alone is eight.

664
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,000
That’s because

665
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,920
when we talk about a lot of things,

666
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,920
we’re perfectly in sync.

667
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,680
I can say whatever I want.

668
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,720
It’s just a perfect match.

669
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,640
It’s like I’m

670
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,760
spending time with myself.

671
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,280
I think

672
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,640
socializing is one,

673
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,320
five for my partner, four for alone time.

674
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,040
First, I think alone time

675
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,840
shouldn’t be less than three or four.

676
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,000
But in my life,

677
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,160
I’d leave one or two for socializing.

678
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,440
Because you still need friends.

679
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,880
If my partner says

680
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,520
she hopes I don’t socialize,

681
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,600
I can skip socializing.

682
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,600
Minghao,

683
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,640
can I ask you something?

684
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,480
You just said you need at least

685
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,760
three for alone time.

686
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,320
But if two people are in the same space,

687
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,360
we don’t have to talk.

688
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,520
You do your thing,

689
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,120
and she does hers.

690
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,440
Because I’m a very sensitive person,

691
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,560
I get affected by

692
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,760
certain sounds

693
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,840
or someone’s presence.

694
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,040
As long as someone’s there,

695
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,640
I’ll care about it.

696
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,160
I’ll pay attention.

697
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,000
Highly sensitive person.

698
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,560
I care a lot.

699
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,240
If I’m alone,

700
00:26:59,240 --> 00:26:59,680
it’s impossible.

701
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,040
Even when I’m doing my own thing,

702
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,560
I might still think of her.

703
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,560
For me, partner is seven,

704
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,600
two for alone time, one for socializing.

705
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,440
I think my partner should come first.

706
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,560
It should be a big part.

707
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,000
That’s just me.

708
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,120
When I’m not in the honeymoon phase,

709
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,000
if I am, then it’s nine.

710
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,360
Because at the start of a relationship,

711
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,920
I love being attached to my partner.

712
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,600
Even 9.9.

713
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,360
Yeah.

714
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,280
We’re basically attached at the hip.

715
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:27,720
Exactly.

716
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,680
Of course, that’s if circumstances allow.

717
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,000
Since we both work,

718
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,080
we don’t get much time together.

719
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,800
I really respect work.

720
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,240
My partner will be busy and all.

721
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,160
Outside of that,

722
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,720
I think we should be together.

723
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,280
Is there anything

724
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,960
more important than us being together?

725
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,080
But as time goes by,

726
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,160
it drops to seven.

727
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,320
At first, it’s nine.

728
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:47,960
9.9.

729
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,280
Even 9.999.

730
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,760
If it were me,

731
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,160
I’d probably be

732
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,960
social

733
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,640
zero

734
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,040
lover nine, alone one.

735
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,240
No socializing.

736
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,240
I don’t need to socialize.

737
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,320
All my friends know

738
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,240
I’m totally the type who ditches friends for love.

739
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,680
Once I’m in a relationship,

740
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,080
I forget about all my friends.

741
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,120
That’s just like me.

742
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,240
I’m the same, always choosing love over friends.

743
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,240
Yeah.

744
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,560
Ever since you got married,

745
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,280
we haven’t talked for years.

746
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,200
We really lost touch.

747
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,280
Honestly, it depends on your partner.

748
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,560
Because my husband is

749
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,680
a super social person.

750
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,640
So when I’m with him, he’s always like

751
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,520
Who are we meeting today?

752
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,160
Who are we meeting again today?

753
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:25,440
So,

754
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,360
I usually just

755
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,000
get some socializing in that way.

756
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,040
That’s how it is.

757
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,040
I like being in the same space,

758
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,720
you do your thing,

759
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,640
I do mine,

760
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,360
and that’s enough for me.

761
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,120
Me too.

762
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,120
I’m pretty similar to you in that way.

763
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,280
It’s just too late now.

764
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,200
Let’s meet in the next life.

765
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,640
We’ll make plans for the next life.

766
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,160
Let’s talk about this life first.

767
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:48,840
Okay?

768
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:51,800
But I think

769
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,240
this is a good topic.

770
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:52,800
Everyone can

771
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,000
share with us.

772
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,920
Our viewers

773
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,320
can also go on Weibo

774
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,440
and join the discussion.

775
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,880
How you split time between yourself, friends, and your partner.

776
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,720
On this topic,

777
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,840
let’s all speak freely.

778
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,760
Our official account

779
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,080
will interact with you in real time.

780
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,600
You might get featured.

781
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,160
And win surprise prizes.

782
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:09,920
We hope everyone

783
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,520
can join us

784
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,440
and start interacting now.

785
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,160
Come in.

786
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,600
Hello.

787
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,160
You seem different today.

788
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,760
Your eyes look so bright.

789
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,600
I actually had trouble sleeping last night.

790
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,360
I was worried I’d have dark circles today.

791
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:30,720
But it’s fine.

792
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,160
I have this

793
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,920
Marubi Peptide Red Pen Eye Cream.

794
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,560
It has 25% high-concentration peptides.

795
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,920
After staying up late, using this before makeup

796
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,800
makes it go on really smoothly.

797
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,880
No cakiness at all.

798
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,040
Just roll it on

799
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,080
and the puffiness goes away super fast.

800
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,320
The massage tip is nice and cool.

801
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,320
It feels amazing.

802
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,440
It’s pretty convenient too.

803
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,280
I usually wake up

804
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,440
with puffy eyes too.

805
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,440
I’ll give it a try.

806
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,240
Of course.

807
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,920
Who’s this?

808
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,000
Yuxing.

809
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,640
Yuxing.

810
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,880
This is Yifan and Yuxing.

811
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,440
It’s their second date already.

812
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,520
Hello.

813
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,040
Hi.

814
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,520
These flowers are for you.

815
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,760
A thank-you for our last date.

816
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,200
Thank you.

817
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,920
Handmade shop.

818
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,320
There are lots of handmade items here.

819
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,360
I think they’re pretty delicate.

820
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,920
Some are really unique.

821
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,200
Yeah.

822
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,000
Here’s the instruction manual.

823
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,840
Should I switch seats with you?

824
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,480
It’s fine.

825
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,640
I’ll move over a bit.

826
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,840
Standing on tiptoes.

827
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,400
Her little feet are keeping the beat.

828
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,320
So happy.

829
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,280
You cut the fabric.

830
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:18,880
I'll sew it.

831
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,880
Or should we do it together first?

832
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,280
Let's start with this.

833
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,760
Let's piece this together first.

834
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,280
Okay.

835
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,720
Sure.

836
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,400
He moved a bit to the side.

837
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,400
Come on.

838
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,000
Does the table have to be this far from me?

839
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,520
She's really brave to do this.

840
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,360
This is a physical attraction.

841
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,560
I was just about to say that.

842
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,560
Do you think she noticed the guy...

843
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,160
...trying to avoid her a bit?

844
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,440
She definitely noticed.

845
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,520
Getting close.

846
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,800
So this is...

847
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,600
Wrapping the eyes.

848
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,880
How about I hold it while you wrap?

849
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,960
Would that be faster?

850
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:09,920
Okay.

851
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,440
Is that alright?

852
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,280
This seems...

853
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,200
Your hands are too big to hold it.

854
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,120
Wait, I should...

855
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:26,760
Switch.

856
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,480
Yeah.

857
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,280
I'll hold it.

858
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,680
Okay, I'll hold it.

859
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,600
Tie a knot to secure it first.

860
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,240
Wrap it more later.

861
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,640
Done.

862
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,080
Cut it off, you do it.

863
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,360
I'll cut the fabric then.

864
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,120
She really likes him.

865
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,800
The girl likes him a lot.

866
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,520
When it wasn't in the middle...

867
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,880
It actually looks like a bullfrog.

868
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,960
But it's still nice.

869
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:16,960
Nicely done.

870
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,280
Start with these two.

871
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,600
This one.

872
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,280
The wind chime below.

873
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,640
There's a blank piece of paper.

874
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,640
You can write a blessing.

875
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,080
What should we write?

876
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,360
Yu.

877
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:33,560
Yu.

878
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,560
She's been thinking of words related to Yu.

879
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,520
Write "Smooth Sailing."

880
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,200
Because it relates to "wind" too.

881
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:44,960
Smooth Sailing.

882
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,840
It's connected to wind.

883
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,120
But "Smooth Sailing" feels like...

884
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,640
...it only represents me.

885
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,600
Does your name have any meaning?

886
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,480
Yu Xing.

887
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,000
Everything goes smoothly.

888
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,160
Smooth Sailing.

889
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,560
Everything goes smoothly.

890
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,160
Write it down.

891
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,520
Secure it first.

892
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:16,960
Done.

893
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,240
Tied up.

894
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,600
Great job.

895
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,080
There's a big difference in feelings.

896
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,280
Yeah, this...

897
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,480
The level of affection is so different.

898
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:38,920
Someone like her...

899
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,840
It's wonderful to love someone from the heart.

900
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,480
Just slow down a bit.

901
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,280
Actually, I'm really hungry.

902
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,760
My stomach was growling while making the wind chime.

903
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:57,920
So...

904
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,280
The age range of your friends...

905
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,400
...should be about the same as yours.

906
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,360
I have a lot.

907
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,000
Born in 2000.

908
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:05,920
The youngest is...

909
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,600
Born in 2006.

910
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,440
He's the little brother on the team.

911
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,160
So do you feel that being with Gen Z...

912
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,080
...there's any...

913
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,080
...generation gap?

914
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,120
Yifan is Gen Z.

915
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:26,920
There will be.

916
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,280
For example?

917
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,040
I think people of every age group

918
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,560
have their own

919
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,080
favorite things and interests.

920
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,560
You need to understand and accept that.

921
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,440
Because after all, you’ve also

922
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,880
been through that age yourself.

923
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,800
Our company has a lot of Gen Z employees.

924
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,400
And I feel

925
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,800
young people really are the future.

926
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,360
Feels like a job interview.

927
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,480
But in many workplaces,

928
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,240
there are fixed mindsets.

929
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,200
They think

930
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,600
Gen Z isn’t reliable.

931
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,240
That’s their stereotype.

932
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,400
They assume you don’t know

933
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,320
They think

934
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,040
you don’t understand these things.

935
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,760
You don’t understand cultural relics.

936
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,800
You don’t get these things.

937
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,640
But I push myself

938
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,160
and set strict goals.

939
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,080
You have to learn it within this time.

940
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:23,960
That’s rare.

941
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,800
I think

942
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,240
having a responsible work attitude,

943
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,000
professionalism,

944
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,400
and strong skills,

945
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,480
that’s real talent.

946
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,000
It’s really rare.

947
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,040
They’re not talking about relationships at all.

948
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,000
It’s just a workplace discussion.

949
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,240
It’s like the boss admiring a great employee.

950
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:49,840
Like my

951
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,760
boss at work,

952
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,000
she’s the same age as my mom.

953
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,240
Your mom is so young.

954
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:56,440
Yeah.

955
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,120
You’re young too.

956
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,240
Sorry.

957
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,200
People who can be friends with me

958
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,360
are usually those who give me feedback.

959
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,240
Maybe it’s because

960
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,200
I grew up with my grandparents

961
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,560
or my other grandparents.

962
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,000
Yeah.

963
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,760
Plus, a lot of other factors later on.

964
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,200
After my mom and dad separated,

965
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:22,720
many things she said

966
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,280
were about pursuing her own happiness.

967
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:24,840
I think

968
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,120
no matter when in life,

969
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:27,800
or what stage,

970
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,960
if you’re unhappy,

971
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,640
and want to chase your own happiness,

972
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,920
you can do it anytime.

973
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,520
No need to let other things

974
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,040
hold you back.

975
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,440
I feel like my mom is the type

976
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,520
who tries her best

977
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,720
to take care of my feelings.

978
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,480
Even when I’m in Shanghai,

979
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,080
she buys lots of food and drinks

980
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:19,960
and sends them all to me.

981
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,720
Every day when I get home,

982
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,440
there’s a pile of packages waiting for me.

983
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:25,800
And then

984
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:27,600
I feel

985
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,920
I can sense

986
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,280
she’s showing her care

987
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,240
by doing all this,

988
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:34,760
giving you love.

989
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,520
Love.

990
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:36,800
Telling you

991
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,240
Mom still loves you.

992
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,120
Yeah.

993
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,680
Yifan still longs for companionship deep down.

994
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,200
But just now,

995
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,240
when you talked about your mom,

996
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,160
I really felt it too.

997
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,120
It touched me.

998
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:53,880
Because

999
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,440
when I was a kid,

1000
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,720
I was very empathetic.

1001
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,400
I cried a lot.

1002
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,680
Watching those dramas,

1003
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,200
I'd cry at touching scenes.

1004
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:02,960
You know?

1005
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,800
Me too.

1006
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,400
I was sensitive as a kid.

1007
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,120
But my dad always said,

1008
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,080
as a boy,

1009
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,240
I shouldn't be so

1010
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:11,760
well,

1011
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,400
easily moved to tears.

1012
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,960
So later on,

1013
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,880
I tried to hold myself back.

1014
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,080
I avoided watching those things.

1015
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:19,880
And gradually,

1016
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,680
I closed off some parts of my emotions.

1017
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,200
I shut them down.

1018
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,960
He opened up too.

1019
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,360
That really moves me.

1020
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,760
Yeah, because that's rare.

1021
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,880
When you see someone open their heart,

1022
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,960
really open up inside,

1023
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,640
your instinct is

1024
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,200
to share your own story,

1025
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,080
to show your soft side.

1026
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,040
And tell her,

1027
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:42,960
you want her to know

1028
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,640
she's not alone.

1029
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,560
She's not by herself.

1030
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,680
But that's a good thing.

1031
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,680
But there's one thing

1032
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,000
I'd never say to my son.

1033
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,320
I'd never tell him boys shouldn't cry.

1034
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:49,800
Yeah, I think it's fine to cry.

1035
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,000
Yeah, I think it's totally okay.

1036
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
It's fair—if you have feelings, let them out.

1037
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,920
Everyone cries.

1038
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,400
How could you say

1039
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,320
boys can't cry?

1040
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,200
I feel like your slowness

1041
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,720
is just

1042
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,480
a protective shell on the outside.

1043
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,360
And there are so many

1044
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,920
cool and quirky things about you.

1045
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,920
Like washing the mop in the rain.

1046
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,560
It actually makes sense,

1047
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,960
but it's also funny.

1048
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,720
Is that it?

1049
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,720
Just soaking up some rainwater.

1050
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,920
That's their shared memory.

1051
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,280
I think

1052
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,360
sometimes your thoughts jump around.

1053
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,920
But every time you do,

1054
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,080
you land right where my thoughts jump too.

1055
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,960
You always hit the same spot as me.

1056
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,040
And every time you do,

1057
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,520
my eyes light up.

1058
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,440
I think, "That makes sense!"

1059
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,840
It really does.

1060
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,000
So direct, so clear—just tell him.

1061
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,120
I like you this way.

1062
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,120
Yeah, I only do that

1063
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:05,920
with real friends.

1064
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,400
That's when I share

1065
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,480
all kinds of ideas.

1066
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,880
Only with true friends.

1067
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,840
Because we haven't spent much time together.

1068
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,880
But after the mop-washing thing,

1069
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,880
we started to connect.

1070
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,240
I found it really fun.

1071
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,120
Then I started to explore

1072
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:30,760
and thought,

1073
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,440
what's this slow-paced person's

1074
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,600
heart really like?

1075
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,120
There's something about Yifan that I understand.

1076
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,520
Because I think Yifan is

1077
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,600
a very smart girl.

1078
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,080
But why couldn't she figure it out?

1079
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,080
I've been thinking about it.

1080
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,480
Do you remember the card draw?

1081
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,760
She drew a picture at that time.

1082
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,560
It was of Yuxing's dog.

1083
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,520
But then,

1084
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,960
The real situation on Yuxing's side was

1085
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,960
"Why haven't you picked yet?"

1086
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,920
"You still haven't picked."

1087
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,880
"You still haven't picked."

1088
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,360
"If you don't pick, who dares to choose that card?"

1089
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,640
Among his friends,

1090
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,080
everyone was pushing him.

1091
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,440
Saying, "This was obviously drawn for you."

1092
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,640
"You should take it yourself."

1093
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,000
That stuck with me.

1094
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,800
His emotions then

1095
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,720
clearly felt like

1096
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,400
inside his heart,

1097
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,400
he wasn't really

1098
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,200
expecting much from that card.

1099
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,840
But on Yifan's side,

1100
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,240
she didn't experience that.

1101
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:36,600
Yeah.

1102
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,000
She saw Jin Yuxing holding her card

1103
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,600
and coming to date her.

1104
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,240
So Yifan must have thought

1105
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,520
"You like me."

1106
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,680
She would definitely think

1107
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,760
it's mutual.

1108
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,800
And she's the only girl with short hair.

1109
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,320
It must be me.

1110
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,520
She was very sure, right?

1111
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,200
So in this situation,

1112
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,000
how could she

1113
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,440
understand it from an objective perspective?

1114
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:56,480
What does his "cautious" mean?

1115
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,720
What does "good friend" mean?

1116
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,600
I think that's hard.

1117
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,280
Or maybe,

1118
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,440
she doesn't have

1119
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,960
much experience.

1120
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,800
And about love,

1121
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,440
she has beautiful hopes.

1122
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,280
So she thinks

1123
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,120
even if the other person doesn't like me,

1124
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,280
I'll use my sincerity

1125
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,080
to win him over.

1126
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,000
Or maybe,

1127
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,120
I just don't want to regret it.

1128
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,760
I don't think she's unaware.

1129
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,000
Yeah.

1130
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:19,360
Yeah.

1131
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,000
Or maybe I just

1132
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,760
want to

1133
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,560
love someone this way.

1134
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,000
Love someone.

1135
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,360
It's actually very possible

1136
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,280
that in this process,

1137
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,640
she uses her

1138
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,840
sincerity, she uses her

1139
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,160
way of loving

1140
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,200
to open up another side of Yuxing.

1141
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:35,760
Or maybe,

1142
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,440
Yuxing, through this process,

1143
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,160
becomes more certain

1144
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,720
that they need some space.

1145
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,600
This date

1146
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,040
is still

1147
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,240
very important

1148
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,000
for both of them.

1149
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,760
It's a valuable experience.

1150
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,280
Because without this kind of communication,

1151
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,160
maybe the two of them

1152
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,000
would still be

1153
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,080
going at their own pace,

1154
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,840
just observing each other.

1155
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,560
Yeah.

1156
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,360
Yeah.

1157
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,600
Let's look forward to

1158
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,000
the next group's date.

1159
00:43:59,000 --> 00:43:59,600
Let's see

1160
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,440
what will happen next.

1161
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,440
Another romantic story.

1162
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,640
Motorcycle.

1163
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,760
That's so cool!

1164
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,640
Super cool.

1165
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,280
Yeah.

1166
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,000
Such a hormonal vibe.

1167
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,040
Pulling out the big moves.

1168
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,200
Wang Lechen.

1169
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,960
So handsome.

1170
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,040
Who's this?

1171
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,600
Lu Yuan.

1172
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,040
Hi

1173
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:56,760
How did you come down from up there?

1174
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,080
What else would I do?

1175
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,080
I thought you'd come from that way.

1176
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,160
Should I make a grand entrance on a motorcycle?

1177
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,240
Wait a sec.

1178
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,600
Let me check the weather.

1179
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,400
The rain's actually lighter now.

1180
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,200
It's a bit lighter.

1181
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,040
So, what do you think?

1182
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:10,960
We're riding motorcycles today.

1183
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,240
They all know how to ride.

1184
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,320
Sit in the back.

1185
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,480
Are you interested?

1186
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:20,680
I'm interested.

1187
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:21,520
Interested.

1188
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,360
Let's ride.

1189
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,800
Okay, let me get you a helmet first.

1190
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,240
Alright.

1191
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,880
This size should work.

1192
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,280
Three, two, one.

1193
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,240
Three, two, one.

1194
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,040
Put on the helmet.

1195
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,000
I like this kind.

1196
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,840
Okay, is this alright?

1197
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,000
Don't rush to close it yet.

1198
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,080
It's stuffy inside.

1199
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,280
Let me try.

1200
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,720
Can I fit my helmet on?

1201
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:03,840
It's a bit small.

1202
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:04,880
Yeah.

1203
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,720
It's fine.

1204
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:07,800
This needs to be...

1205
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,240
Don't move yet.

1206
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,560
This is pretty flirty.

1207
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,240
This little move.

1208
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,520
Hold still.

1209
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,200
That's nice.

1210
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,440
After putting on the helmet,

1211
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,800
then tap her helmet.

1212
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:36,960
Right.

1213
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,600
Silly

1214
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:38,720
Goofball

1215
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:39,800
So sweet

1216
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,080
Drink some tea to cut the grease.

1217
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:46,880
Put on your raincoat.

1218
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:50,880
You need a jacket too.

1219
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:51,480
Put it on.

1220
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,240
Thanks

1221
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,920
The two of them are already...

1222
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:58,360
So cool

1223
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,280
I saved the cool one for you on purpose.

1224
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,000
And I get rained on.

1225
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:04,480
I'm getting wet.

1226
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,560
But you can't.

1227
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:06,840
That's kind of sweet.

1228
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,120
You're actually really nice.

1229
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,160
You need to zip it up.

1230
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,360
I can't see.

1231
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,080
I'll zip it for you.

1232
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,360
Yeah, that's it.

1233
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,720
You have to learn to be a "goof" in love.

1234
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,240
Okay

1235
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,040
You're not scared, right?

1236
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,680
Not scared, what's there to be afraid of?

1237
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,360
Really not scared?

1238
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,320
I trust your skills.

1239
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:39,640
I trust your skills.

1240
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,200
She's got a really great personality.

1241
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,240
She looks better the more you see her.

1242
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,680
Do you know how to get on?

1243
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,040
You can step here first, yeah.

1244
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,600
Then hold onto me.

1245
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,680
Your foot goes here in a bit.

1246
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:10,360
Okay

1247
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:12,680
Put it on.

1248
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,120
Alright

1249
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:15,640
Okay

1250
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,600
Let me check the mirror.

1251
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,160
You can't see.

1252
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,080
Alright, that's fine.

1253
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,040
If you need to hold on,

1254
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,640
It's best to hold here.

1255
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,720
You can hug him.

1256
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,040
This is the closest we've seen

1257
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:39,480
between these two.

1258
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,280
It's their most intimate moment.

1259
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,760
The sweetest.

1260
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:45,000
I've decided to buy a motorcycle tomorrow.

1261
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,240
I need to go back.

1262
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:46,720
Sign up for the test.

1263
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,360
Motorcycle license.

1264
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,840
If you need to hold on,

1265
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,440
It's best to hold here.

1266
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:56,720
Both hands here.

1267
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:57,440
Right.

1268
00:48:58,840 --> 00:48:59,640
Then just hold on.

1269
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,200
Are you ready?

1270
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:03,240
Ready?

1271
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,320
I'll take you straight up the mountain.

1272
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,000
Let you feel the speed and excitement.

1273
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,000
Alright.

1274
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,720
Speeding up.

1275
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,000
This is my favorite scene.

1276
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,560
Is this how you imagined it?

1277
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:28,240
Yeah.

1278
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,400
Lechen feels

1279
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,720
quite different today.

1280
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,080
It's really relaxing.

1281
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,360
The scenery outside is beautiful.

1282
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,160
You can't hear anything.

1283
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,440
You have to talk really loud.

1284
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,880
What did you say?

1285
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,040
I said the scenery is beautiful.

1286
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:04,760
Yeah.

1287
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:06,920
Can't hear, right?

1288
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,520
Couldn't hear, now I can.

1289
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:10,880
Those two.

1290
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,560
I like you.

1291
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,840
I can't hear you.

1292
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,400
I like you too.

1293
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,440
Then let's be together.

1294
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:17,360
Okay.

1295
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,320
It'd be great if the weather was even better today.

1296
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,680
The weather's nice.

1297
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,080
Rain feels awesome.

1298
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,120
I'm loving this couple.

1299
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,080
This feels like romance.

1300
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,400
So pretty.

1301
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,000
Knows how to pick a spot.

1302
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,320
I haven't felt this good in ages.

1303
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,640
Nice riding.

1304
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,840
Who are you looking down on?

1305
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:01,680
So romantic.

1306
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,000
Those two.

1307
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,440
I suddenly pictured something.

1308
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:08,920
Like,

1309
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,120
when they're old,

1310
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,560
going out together,

1311
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:12,440
never killing each other's vibe.

1312
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,280
That kind of feeling.

1313
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,280
Racing wheelchairs together.

1314
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,560
A little push.

1315
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,120
You can't catch me.

1316
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:25,000
Who can't catch who?

1317
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,280
I've chased you my whole life.

1318
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,520
And I still can't catch you.

1319
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,920
I can picture it now.

1320
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,400
It's really wonderful.

1321
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:38,280
I'm getting off.

1322
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,000
Careful, it's hot here.

1323
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:42,720
Yeah, the exhaust pipe is hot.

1324
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,120
So thoughtful.

1325
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,120
Nice.

1326
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:52,880
Your raincoat doesn't cover your butt.

1327
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:54,400
It's fine.

1328
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,880
As long as your upper body is covered.

1329
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:56,560
Alright.

1330
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,080
Look, my face is totally soaked.

1331
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:00,960
You didn't put down your goggles.

1332
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:01,560
Did you put them down?

1333
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,200
I did.

1334
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,680
But you can't hear me when I talk.

1335
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,800
That's true.

1336
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,120
This place is so beautiful.

1337
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:12,920
Yeah.

1338
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,800
What's next?

1339
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:15,400
Take you for another ride.

1340
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,160
Let's keep going.

1341
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,680
I haven't been caught in the rain for ages.

1342
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:22,800
Feels great.

1343
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,080
So I wanted to ask you,

1344
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,880
If it rains hard, would you still ride?

1345
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:29,840
Sure.

1346
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,320
If it rains hard, would you still ride?

1347
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:31,880
Sure.

1348
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,600
So determined.

1349
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,600
Anything's fine.

1350
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,920
I'm good again.

1351
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:37,920
Me too.

1352
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,280
Sure.

1353
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,520
You can ride.

1354
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:44,640
Sure.

1355
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,320
That answer is really touching.

1356
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:55,840
The rain has stopped.

1357
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,080
So let's change our plan today.

1358
00:52:59,080 --> 00:52:59,640
We've already gotten wet.

1359
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:00,320
Let's switch to a motorcycle trip.

1360
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,200
Let's do a motorcycle trip today.

1361
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,760
How about we ride back to the cabin today?

1362
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,320
Sure.

1363
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,160
I never heard you mention you could ride a motorcycle before.

1364
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,480
Of course I had to keep some things hidden.

1365
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,120
Compliment him.

1366
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:15,880
Of course I had to keep some things hidden.

1367
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:16,320
Okay.

1368
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,000
Otherwise, there wouldn't be any surprises.

1369
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
It's all hidden.

1370
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:18,840
Otherwise, there wouldn't be any surprises.

1371
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:19,640
Alright.

1372
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:21,600
Just like today.

1373
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:25,680
I really didn't expect it.

1374
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,320
What did you think we'd do today?

1375
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,400
Take a walk in the rain.

1376
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:31,480
Am I that boring?

1377
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,080
Really?

1378
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:33,600
You even nodded.

1379
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,720
I honestly didn't expect what we'd do.

1380
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,240
So what else don't I know about you?

1381
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:43,480
Take a guess.

1382
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:44,960
Just confess.

1383
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,160
If I tell you, there won't be any surprises.

1384
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,040
You've planned it.

1385
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,040
Any more activities later?

1386
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:55,880
Guess.

1387
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:56,680
Guess.

1388
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:57,240
Alright.

1389
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:58,280
Okay.

1390
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:58,800
Guess.

1391
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,480
When they banter like this,

1392
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,280
it actually means they've gotten closer.

1393
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,360
Yes, there's a connection.

1394
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,280
And what the guy means is,

1395
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,600
I've given you the surprise I was hiding.

1396
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,960
And I think his way of hiding things

1397
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:11,920
is actually really clever.

1398
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,800
He lets her discover things bit by bit.

1399
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,480
Turns out this guy

1400
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:16,800
has so many different

1401
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:17,800
sides.

1402
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:18,480
Yeah.

1403
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,720
And it feels like you're different from others.

1404
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,360
Right.

1405
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:23,640
I'll take you down the mountain.

1406
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:25,720
Takumi is going down the mountain.

1407
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:26,880
Alright.

1408
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:27,680
Takumi is going down the mountain.

1409
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,280
What does that mean?

1410
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:29,680
Takumi.

1411
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:30,800
Takumi.

1412
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:31,680
You haven't seen Initial D?

1413
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:32,720
What?

1414
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:33,960
What?

1415
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:34,840
What base?

1416
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,320
What base?

1417
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:37,760
Initial D.

1418
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,720
What's Initial D?

1419
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,120
There's a generation gap.

1420
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:43,240
What?

1421
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:47,560
Jay Chou sang it.

1422
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:48,800
You know "All the Way North," right?

1423
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:50,840
I know.

1424
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,120
Yeah, that's the theme song.

1425
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,920
That's probably a generation gap, sorry.

1426
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,680
Go watch it later.

1427
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,800
I'll do my homework tonight, okay?

1428
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,520
See?

1429
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:08,440
I'll go study right away.

1430
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,600
For you.

1431
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:11,960
Anything is possible.

1432
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,440
Extra points.

1433
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,200
I'll do my homework tonight, okay?

1434
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,680
It's too late.

1435
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,520
Get on.

1436
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:32,160
Yeah, just step on that part.

1437
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:33,880
Okay.

1438
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,640
Going down the mountain.

1439
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,360
See, I really am the "Weather Child."

1440
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:54,800
Nice.

1441
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:55,800
As soon as I came out, the rain stopped.

1442
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,840
It feels so nice after the rain.

1443
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:02,360
Right?

1444
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:03,920
Such good luck.

1445
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,520
I honestly thought

1446
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,520
you were taking me to

1447
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,240
some huge farm.

1448
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,600
Out in the mud.

1449
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,080
Put the umbrella away.

1450
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,360
What are we doing?

1451
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,120
Pressed flowers.

1452
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:20,600
Yeah.

1453
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:23,680
This is really fun.

1454
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:27,440
Did you cut your sunflower?

1455
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:28,200
Not yet.

1456
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:31,120
Give it to me when you’re done.

1457
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:31,760
Then I won’t cut mine.

1458
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,200
Their vibe is pretty relaxed.

1459
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:46,160
All scattered.

1460
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,240
I took my sunflower completely apart.

1461
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:55,920
It still looks nice this way.

1462
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:59,040
This feels so much like a comic.

1463
00:56:59,040 --> 00:56:59,800
Yeah.

1464
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,240
Feels like it’s my first time being this quiet.

1465
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:06,480
True.

1466
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:08,840
True about what?

1467
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:09,440
Yeah, really.

1468
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,080
I just realized today

1469
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:12,760
that you actually have

1470
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,040
an introverted side.

1471
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,480
Honestly, before

1472
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:21,760
I was mostly like this.

1473
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,400
Because when you go out and socialize

1474
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,160
you don’t talk for that long.

1475
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,280
Or that often.

1476
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:28,800
Same here.

1477
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,600
I actually prefer

1478
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,200
just sitting quietly.

1479
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,360
What I really wanted

1480
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,520
was to find a place

1481
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,320
with a beautiful view.

1482
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,040
And just lie down.

1483
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,200
Just lie there.

1484
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,760
When was the last time you cried?

1485
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,600
The last time was pretty dramatic.

1486
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:57,880
Really dramatic.

1487
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,440
My haircut was so ugly.

1488
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,320
I cried on the street.

1489
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:04,160
I cried on the street.

1490
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:05,520
I get it.

1491
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,520
I was wiping my tears

1492
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:14,440
while walking down the street.

1493
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:18,240
You’re pretty tough.

1494
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,440
But if it’s the kind of crying

1495
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,080
where I’m really emotional,

1496
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,960
I honestly don’t cry much.

1497
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:29,520
I’m a strong person.

1498
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,800
Sometimes you don’t have to be so strong.

1499
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,400
That line

1500
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,280
is so sweet.

1501
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,160
That made me happy.

1502
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,720
Then I’ll come to you next time I need to cry.

1503
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,840
So sweet.

1504
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,520
Next time, I’ll come to you to cry.

1505
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,840
Every part should really attract Lechen.

1506
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,600
Record it all for you.

1507
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:57,360
If you cry again,

1508
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,280
it’ll be “evidence in court.”

1509
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:07,760
Yesterday at that sports event,

1510
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,360
your friend asked me

1511
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,760
what it's like spending time with you,

1512
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,640
and what moment left the deepest impression.

1513
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,320
My first thought was actually the little train.

1514
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,360
But on that train,

1515
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,800
after we had a deeper conversation,

1516
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:21,480
I realized

1517
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:23,680
you're not quite like how you seem usually.

1518
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:26,440
I originally thought

1519
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:27,800
you were carefree and easygoing.

1520
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:29,920
But you're not.

1521
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:31,320
Really, you're not.

1522
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,600
Like a super sunny version of Chen.

1523
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,480
I used to be really sunny.

1524
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:40,040
Now you,

1525
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:41,360
it's just a phase.

1526
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:42,320
Yeah, just a phase.

1527
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:43,920
You can't always

1528
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,280
be carefree every single day.

1529
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,000
You have to grow up eventually.

1530
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,440
Those two keep bickering.

1531
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,160
They didn't insult you.

1532
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,040
Why do you talk just like me?

1533
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,640
Seriously, you sound just like me.

1534
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,200
Just like you.

1535
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:03,800
Get a little closer.

1536
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:05,040
That's nice.

1537
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,480
I do the same thing.

1538
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,480
Honestly, I'm really happy.

1539
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,680
Like that day on the island.

1540
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:10,880
Yeah, when we were talking.

1541
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:11,640
Talking about my cold medicine.

1542
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,320
So today I can check on you too.

1543
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:17,920
I'm not sick, I'm perfectly healthy.

1544
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:20,320
When we chat,

1545
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:21,680
I actually use this way

1546
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:23,720
to test

1547
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:27,480
everyone's boundaries, yeah.

1548
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:29,520
When I'm with my friends,

1549
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:30,640
this is really how we talk.

1550
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:31,280
Yeah, I think

1551
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:32,240
it's cool how everyone can

1552
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:33,280
pick up on these jokes.

1553
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,280
And I think that's great.

1554
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:36,640
I'm the one who gets hurt.

1555
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:37,400
You think it's fun.

1556
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:40,920
Your happiness is built on my pain.

1557
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,480
Thanks a lot.

1558
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:45,360
Aren't you happy too?

1559
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:46,360
You're always "mocking" me.

1560
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:47,560
I learned it from you.

1561
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:51,440
This conversation,

1562
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:53,560
they can joke with each other.

1563
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:54,640
It feels so comfortable.

1564
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:56,080
Really comfortable.

1565
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:56,600
It's just

1566
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:57,880
you need this kind of

1567
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:58,920
playful banter.

1568
01:00:58,920 --> 01:00:59,880
Yeah.

1569
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,800
Sometimes it's a bit of pretend offense.

1570
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,240
It's not actually offensive.

1571
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:04,200
Right.

1572
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:07,760
How are you so good at cutting?

1573
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,000
Look,

1574
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:10,720
I'm dissecting it.

1575
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:11,760
Talent.

1576
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:17,320
Pure talent.

1577
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:18,960
You're amazing.

1578
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,080
How did you cut it so well?

1579
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:21,760
Don't flatter me.

1580
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:22,760
I can't handle compliments.

1581
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,760
This part is really awesome.

1582
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:43,520
Come on.

1583
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:46,720
Okay.

1584
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:48,560
Alright.

1585
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:48,960
Alright.

1586
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:52,800
Perfect, I can use this for reading later.

1587
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:55,000
Alright, let's go.

1588
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:56,280
Okay.

1589
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:01,360
That's really nice.

1590
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:03,960
How old is the girl? How old is the guy?

1591
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,320
Le Chen was born in 1998.

1592
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:07,640
Lu Yuan was born in 2002.

1593
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:08,680
That's fine.
