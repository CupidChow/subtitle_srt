1
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,360
So many shoes

2
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,760
Hello.

3
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,320
Hello.

4
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,320
Hello.

5
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,160
Hello.

6
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:06,880
Did you just get back?

7
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,800
Where are you going?

8
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,600
I'm going to

9
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,440
that side, because over here

10
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,000
there doesn't seem to be anyone.

11
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,040
Okay.

12
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,360
Do you want to wait for me?

13
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,360
Do you want to wait for me?

14
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,280
Sure.

15
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,560
You just got back.

16
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,160
Yeah, I just got back too.

17
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,560
No.

18
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,680
Just a few minutes.

19
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,360
You changed your hairstyle.

20
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,360
Yes.

21
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:37,880
It looks really nice.

22
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:39,880
It looks really nice.

23
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,040
Do you know why?

24
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,480
Why?

25
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,720
Because every day I'm

26
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,520
the same.

27
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,000
But it still looks good.

28
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,120
Do you know if the kitchen

29
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,920
has a vase?

30
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,600
A vase?

31
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,000
I don't know.

32
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:58,920
I'll check later.

33
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,480
I want to take your

34
00:02:59,480 --> 00:02:59,880
flowers (the ones from the dinner)

35
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,600
and put them in a vase.

36
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,320
There's one here.

37
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,160
Here.

38
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,600
Really?

39
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,000
There's one more layer.

40
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,080
Do you have scissors?

41
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,600
Yes, I have scissors.

42
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,120
They're here.

43
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,680
Smart.

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,400
As expected of me.

45
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,000
I should have taken it out earlier.

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,560
Pulled it out.

47
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,720
It's fine.

48
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,920
This should just go straight in.

49
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,880
That'll do.

50
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,160
Perfect.

51
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:45,560
Just right.

52
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,360
I'll put it

53
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:47,840
on the coffee table.

54
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,680
Can I borrow an umbrella?

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,480
Sure.

56
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:15,880
Thank you.

57
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,680
Be careful.

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,840
Was it raining when you came back?

59
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,440
When I came back,

60
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,040
it wasn't raining.

61
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:24,760
But

62
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,680
just as I was about to leave,

63
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,360
it seemed to start raining a little.

64
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:26,880
It got heavier.

65
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,440
Then

66
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,240
by the time we finished and came out,

67
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:31,760
it was raining.

68
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,600
Do you want dumplings?

69
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,480
Yes.

70
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,280
If you want them, I'll cook.

71
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,000
If you cook, I'll eat.

72
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,880
If you cook, I'll eat.

73
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,600
How many do you want?

74
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,880
One.

75
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,600
How many?

76
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,000
What kind of filling is in the dumplings?

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,160
Cabbage and pork.

78
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,760
I want one.

79
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,880
No, not "I want one."

80
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,320
What does it mean?

81
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,120
Let me have a taste.

82
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,320
Because I have rice.

83
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,240
We can eat now.

84
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,680
There are only four of us.

85
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,520
It feels lonely.

86
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,560
I'll keep you company.

87
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,000
Dinner's ready.

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,480
Come on.

89
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,360
Let's eat.

90
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,320
Let's eat.

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,360
This is delicious.

92
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,440
So tasty.

93
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,360
Do you want more dumplings?

94
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,680
I thought there were boiled dumplings over there.

95
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,880
Go ask.

96
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,880
Take a plate over.

97
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,440
Your hairstyle looks a lot like his.

98
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,960
You're here.

99
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,600
Aren't there dumplings?

100
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,400
Yes, there are.

101
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,560
How did it get so overcooked?

102
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,000
One.

103
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,200
One for each person.

104
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,080
I think that's about right.

105
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,320
That's fine.

106
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,120
Isn't it the same for you?

107
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,200
Four people, right?

108
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,080
Thank you.

109
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,880
You're welcome.

110
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,160
The dumplings are so delicious.

111
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,280
Can we get someone from over there who can cook

112
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,400
to come over here?

113
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,480
Dr. Fang would be fine too.

114
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,760
Or Wang Lechen would be fine.

115
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,760
Anyone is fine.

116
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,640
Yes, that would really work.

117
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,000
What are you doing?

118
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,720
I'm looking for the satay sauce from yesterday.

119
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,640
It's here.

120
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,840
It's all down here.

121
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,760
You should go to Guangdong.

122
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,720
I prefer this one.

123
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,640
Dipping dumplings in satay sauce.

124
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,720
That's really niche.

125
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,480
I think it's delicious.

126
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,760
Do you guys want some?

127
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,760
You all.

128
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,440
Give me a little.

129
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,160
Okay, I'll give you some.

130
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,800
Is that enough?

131
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,280
That's enough.

132
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,760
Okay, thank you.

133
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,280
Let's have a taste.

134
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,800
Jin Yuxing's flavor.

135
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,160
You should also

136
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,640
add some seasonings you like.

137
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,920
Like those other sauces.

138
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,280
Okay.

139
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,200
I want to eat broccoli too.

140
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,360
I want to eat broccoli too.

141
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,560
Is this it?

142
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,840
I'll get it for you.

143
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,840
Chopsticks.

144
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,360
Take one.

145
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:25,760
Is that enough?

146
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,480
Take two.

147
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,720
I thought you were going to say that's enough.

148
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,640
Thank you.

149
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,960
Is there any shrimp left?

150
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,680
Finally, it's done.

151
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,400
Thank you so much.

152
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,880
I'll go to your place and shop for free.

153
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,920
Sure.

154
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,840
Is that called "California Beef Noodles"?

155
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,920
Or is it "California Beef Noodle King"?

156
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,600
I don't know.

157
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,840
It's a chain store.

158
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,760
Chain store.

159
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,560
Nicole.

160
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,320
Pretend it's your food.

161
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,480
Then let it eat.

162
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,640
Nicole.

163
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,560
I thought Ruilong was eating its food.

164
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,880
Ruilong is hungry.

165
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,280
Hello.

166
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,960
Hello.

167
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,360
Let's see what's here.

168
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,480
No idea what they're doing.

169
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,240
There's another one here.

170
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,280
Game console.

171
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,680
Can you really play games on it?

172
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,880
I want to see.

173
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,120
If there's a chance.

174
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,440
We should adjust it first.

175
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,280
Take a look.

176
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,800
What is it?

177
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,640
What is this?

178
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,000
Sports camera.

179
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,000
I really want to know what this is.

180
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,040
This is for sports.

181
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,320
Please keep your whole body in view.

182
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,080
I should do it.

183
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,280
Single player.

184
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,960
You go, you go first.

185
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,280
Quickly touch the ball.

186
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,400
You have to touch the bottom.

187
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,760
This sport looks so funny on you.

188
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:16,920
Like a little butterfly.

189
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,360
Like a little butterfly

190
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,880
Game center

191
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,000
Found it

192
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,920
Found it

193
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,960
What do you want to play?

194
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,520
Can we play any of these?

195
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,440
Yes, give it a try

196
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,640
But I don't know if it needs to be connected

197
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,720
Do you think it needs to be connected?

198
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,320
It should be connected

199
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,800
It'll work when the time comes

200
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:41,960
It's started

201
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,600
It can be connected

202
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,040
Use the up arrow key

203
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,400
Mine doesn't work

204
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,360
It doesn't work

205
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,400
It's not connected

206
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,960
Can we only use this one?

207
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,200
Use this one

208
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,200
Check if there are any settings

209
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,040
We can connect them.

210
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,000
How do we connect these?

211
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,760
Maybe we can ask them in a couple of days who knows how to do it.

212
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,240
Then have them set it up.

213
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,360
That way we can play in the future.

214
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,640
Alright.

215
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,600
Let's go.

216
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,800
Let's go over there.

217
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,440
Okay.

218
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,680
Does Weini want to come in?

219
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,000
Do you want to come in?

220
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,640
Coming in?

221
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,440
Coming in?

222
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,240
It wants to come in.

223
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,600
Just me.

224
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,880
Before,

225
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,720
even in my normal daily life,

226
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,720
I couldn't really talk.

227
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,120
It was ten times worse than now.

228
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,640
Can you believe it?

229
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,920
So before, for you, it was actually

230
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,800
a bit exhausting.

231
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,480
I gradually got used to it.

232
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,080
Are we going this way?

233
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,400
Actually, I really wanted to come in yesterday.

234
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,200
This feels great.

235
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,720
What can this do?

236
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,200
Games.

237
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,280
There are games.

238
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,280
No, it's just a TV.

239
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,160
I noticed you seemed a bit

240
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,440
distracted yesterday.

241
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,680
Actually, before I came here, I was really

242
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,240
full of worries.

243
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:14,960
Because I was afraid

244
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,080
that I would have a lot of flaws

245
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,440
or that my flaws would be magnified.

246
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,280
Or something like that.

247
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,120
But could it be a matter of perspective?

248
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,480
For example, what you see as a flaw

249
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,000
might actually, in other people's eyes,

250
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,840
be seen as something genuine about you.

251
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,840
Or even

252
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,280
as something that makes you shine.

253
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,720
I think if you can

254
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,760
just relax a bit,

255
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,560
so now I actually

256
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,760
feel pretty relaxed.

257
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,480
I think it's best to just experience the moment.

258
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,200
Try not to overthink things for now.

259
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,560
Even on the first day,

260
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,280
I honestly didn't even know

261
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,120
what I was doing.

262
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,480
But we think you're great.

263
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:58,960
Really?

264
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,800
Yeah.

265
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,760
That's why everyone feels comfortable joking with you.

266
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,640
Do you think joking around

267
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,480
is something people do casually?

268
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,160
On the very first day of meeting?

269
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:05,600
Of course not.

270
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,080
Right.

271
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,640
I think joking around

272
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,880
is actually a really good thing.

273
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,440
It lets you test

274
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,680
where the other person's boundaries are.

275
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,680
That's true.

276
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,440
But

277
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,480
because we girls talk among ourselves,

278
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,160
everyone thinks you're easy to approach,

279
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,200
and also easy to get along with.

280
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,160
That's why everyone feels comfortable joking with you.

281
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,200
The friends you've known the longest,

282
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:24,880
how many years has it been?

283
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,480
Actually, that's me.

284
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,720
Those two friends I met in middle school,

285
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,000
we've stayed close until now.

286
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,600
It's been over ten years.

287
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,040
On my journey growing up,

288
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,960
they've been very important to me.

289
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,120
If I didn't have them,

290
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,760
I can't even imagine

291
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,120
what kind of person I'd be now.

292
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,920
I think it's really great.

293
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,600
Wang Lechen, you give people a very comfortable feeling.

294
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,440
I think it's not just about being easy to get along with.

295
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,040
It's your aura that feels very pure.

296
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,520
I think making people feel comfortable is

297
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,520
really

298
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,040
a rare thing.

299
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,960
Actually, from another perspective,

300
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,920
it's like

301
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,320
for example, I think I'm

302
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,520
someone without sharp edges.

303
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,680
Is it possible that your edges

304
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,600
only show after some distance

305
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,160
has been established?

306
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,880
First, I don't have a temper.

307
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,320
So what?

308
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,520
Actually, that's kind of scary.

309
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,680
I really like that.

310
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,000
Oh, please don't.

311
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,800
So, I actually envy

312
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,120
people like you who are so energetic.

313
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,920
I'm just not like that at all.

314
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,480
No, I think maybe we

315
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,000
just show our energy outwardly.

316
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,200
We express it.

317
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,480
My mom often says I'm like a durian.

318
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,200
It means I look prickly on the outside.

319
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,920
I seem sharp and tough.

320
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,200
But inside, I'm actually soft.

321
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,080
Yes, inside is really

322
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,000
someone who doesn't have much of a temper.

323
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,840
Someone who gets bullied easily.

324
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,120
I think my best friend is a lot like you.

325
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,960
When she's feeling really vulnerable,

326
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,080
she never calls or texts me.

327
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,080
But after she shares with me,

328
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,640
I end up crying right away.

329
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,840
I tell her,

330
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,640
I say, you don't have to worry about bothering me.

331
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,000
I never feel like you're a bother.

332
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,240
I need to feel needed.

333
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,400
So do you think you're

334
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,840
someone who lacks a sense of security?

335
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,560
I think security is something you give yourself.

336
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,000
If I feel there's enough trust,

337
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,040
I don't need the other person to give me security.

338
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,720
Because I think people's hearts have warmth.

339
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,920
You can feel it.

340
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,360
Whether it's genuine or fake.

341
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,680
You can sense it.

342
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,200
Are you still

343
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,280
someone who can't say no?

344
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,360
In my daily life,

345
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,640
I'm not really good at refusing people.

346
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,880
But if you keep doing this,

347
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,800
don't you feel like it's draining you?

348
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,600
Don't you?

349
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:43,960
I don't think so.

350
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,000
I feel like I'm helping them.

351
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,640
When they're happy, I'm happy too.

352
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,760
Because I truly want the best for them.

353
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,360
I have a friend.

354
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,040
When she broke up with her boyfriend,

355
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,800
it happened in the morning.

356
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,480
I went to see her that morning.

357
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,240
If I put myself in her shoes,

358
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,480
I would need someone

359
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,800
to be there for me.

360
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,000
But in this regard,

361
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,400
I'm actually the complete opposite of you.

362
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,920
I'd rather they didn't come.

363
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:08,680
Because you...

364
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,280
Because I don't like to trouble others either.

365
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,040
You don't like to trouble others, right.

366
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,160
Let's go.

367
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,040
Want to do push-ups?

368
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:29,880
You...

369
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,480
You do that one.

370
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,040
Let's do ten.

371
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,600
Start.

372
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,600
It's definitely more tiring than just doing ten.

373
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,440
And it's the abs, too.

374
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,600
You have to use your abs as well.

375
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,200
You also need to engage your core.

376
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,600
Maybe today isn't too tiring.

377
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,640
You worked out and you're still not tired?

378
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm not tired during the day.

379
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,960
I slept well.

380
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,680
Do you think Yiwu is far from Shanghai?

381
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,720
This kind of distance is okay.

382
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,320
I think

383
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,680
You don't have to see each other every day when dating.

384
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,760
But if it's

385
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,920
What about the next step after dating?

386
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,920
The next step?

387
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,280
Then you have to think long-term.

388
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,720
Think long-term.

389
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,600
Hangzhou is actually quite close to Shanghai.

390
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,280
The high-speed train is really fast.

391
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,720
You can get there in under an hour.

392
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,480
Just dozens of minutes.

393
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,440
The distance between Hangzhou and Shanghai

394
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,640
Sometimes

395
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,160
might be shorter than

396
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,160
going from one district to another within Hangzhou.

397
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,120
From one district to another.

398
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,680
About the same.

399
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,960
That's how it is.

400
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,960
Should we continue?

401
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,880
Let's keep going.

402
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,720
How many are you planning to do?

403
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,680
I don't know.

404
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,600
I thought you were counting.

405
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,520
Let's keep going.

406
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,480
Okay.

407
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,720
Are we still doing more?

408
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,880
Then let's just do one last one.

409
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,720
That day, I heard Wang Lechen mention a little bit.

410
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,440
He also said your family is very happy.

411
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:44,720
Yeah.

412
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,440
Your parents' love is very fulfilling.

413
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,360
Your parents' love, right?

414
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,120
Right.

415
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,840
My dad is also the type

416
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,520
who grew up with my mom by his side.

417
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,520
They were childhood sweethearts.

418
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,120
My dad was my mom's first love.

419
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,280
In our family, my mom never cooks.

420
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,680
The kitchen is only my dad's territory.

421
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,360
At home, my mom doesn't cook either.

422
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,640
The only thing my mom can make is soup.

423
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,480
Pork rib and corn soup.

424
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,360
Just this one soup.

425
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,920
I've only ever had this one soup since I was little.

426
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,240
That’s Jiao Ge (Jiao Zhiheng)

427
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:16,840
Your family is like

428
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,520
her (Ke Ailin)’s family

429
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,160
the same.

430
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,480
Wang Lechen said

431
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,160
her family is also similar to mine.

432
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,040
I think the two of us are very alike.

433
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,800
It’s because we are

434
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,440
ENFJ (Protagonist personality type)

435
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,040
personalities.

436
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,840
I think families like this

437
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,200
give their children a lot of freedom.

438
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,840
They let the children have the final say.

439
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,760
They let the kids grow up completely free-range.

440
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,760
Actually, both of us are like that too.

441
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,840
ENTJ (Commander personality type) as well.

442
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,720
We also grew up free-range.

443
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,760
But maybe

444
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,080
maybe the difference between T (Thinking type) and

445
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:39,600
F (Feeling type)

446
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,880
is in communication.

447
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,200
When I had conflicts as a child,

448
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,520
my dad would write me letters.

449
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:45,600
My dad would write me letters.

450
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,520
I have a lot of handwritten letters.

451
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,240
My dad would also write love letters to my mom.

452
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,760
We have the most envelopes in our house.

453
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,400
My dad is a very sensitive person.

454
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,680
He’s very delicate emotionally.

455
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,280
Then you must be too.

456
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,800
What’s your dad’s personality type?

457
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,200
My dad is a Cancer.

458
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,560
My dad is also a Cancer.

459
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,400
My mom is a Taurus.

460
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,640
My mom is also a Cancer, but...

461
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,480
But

462
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,160
I think our dads probably

463
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,920
are quite similar.

464
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,720
At least when it comes to love, they're very alike.

465
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,760
Yeah.

466
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,040
My dad is someone whose happiness depends on my mom's happiness.

467
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,200
If she's happy, he's happy.

468
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,080
If my mom feels fulfilled, so does he.

469
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,680
His MBTI personality type

470
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,280
is what?

471
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:23,800
I think my dad's

472
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,440
MBTI personality type

473
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,280
is probably

474
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:25,960
ENFP

475
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,360
or ENFJ.

476
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,600
Yeah, my mom is probably

477
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,240
ENTJ

478
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,120
or INTJ.

479
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,800
My mom is a very

480
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,360
T (Thinking) and J (Judging) type person.

481
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,480
Did you go see Nicole?

482
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,680
I didn't.

483
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,800
But they said she's already gone to the bathroom.

484
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,800
Do you want to go check?

485
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,400
Sure.

486
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,920
The rain has stopped.

487
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,280
Has it stopped?

488
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,360
A little.

489
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,200
You came back really late today.

490
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,640
Yeah.

491
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,280
What time did you get here?

492
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,640
I was actually pretty late too.

493
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,520
I hadn't been here long.

494
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:09,960
Really?

495
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,440
It's been about half an hour.

496
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,440
Hello.

497
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,480
Check if it's frozen yet.

498
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,640
Is there enough ice?

499
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,440
Is it enough for you?

500
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,840
I feel like I'm a "water monster."

501
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,240
I can drink

502
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,600
three liters a day.

503
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,960
That much?

504
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,400
I'm not joking.

505
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,760
A real three liters at least.

506
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,760
Drinking water is so good.

507
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,760
But sometimes I feel like I might

508
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,080
get "water intoxication" from drinking too much.

509
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,080
Don't drink more than 300 milliliters at a time.

510
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,840
That's enough.

511
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,400
But sometimes I drink a whole liter at once.

512
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,640
You drink a whole liter in one go?

513
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,280
No,

514
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,280
not in one go.

515
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:04,840
It's just that

516
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,400
I have a big one-liter cup.

517
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:06,760
And it's

518
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,800
a cup with a straw.

519
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,840
I just keep it by my mouth.

520
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,440
Whenever I want to drink,

521
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,560
I just take a sip from the straw.

522
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,120
Yeah.

523
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,400
Its fur is too tangled.

524
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,440
Don't you want to brush it?

525
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,400
It says someone is eating my food.

526
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,240
I want to eat some too.

527
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,560
Only when two people fight over food will they eat.

528
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,040
Right.

529
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,400
So what do you usually like to do?

530
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,360
I work out on weekends.

531
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,520
Pilates.

532
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,320
So you're really busy on weekdays, right?

533
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,160
And then I feel like

534
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,840
weekends are really precious.

535
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,800
I don't want to just

536
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,200
lie at home.

537
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,720
I feel like I have to go out.

538
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,080
Like exercising or meeting friends.

539
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,840
That's pretty

540
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,320
disciplined.

541
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,120
You still do that after work?

542
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:04,800
Really?

543
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,200
This kind of thing is fine.

544
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,960
I would want to eat this too.

545
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,720
But the chocolate you just gave me

546
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,400
was so, so sweet.

547
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,760
Don't say it's sweet.

548
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,000
But it

549
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,760
really is sweet.

550
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,520
Is it good?

551
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,600
It's good.

552
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,800
It's pretty tasty.

553
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,240
No more.

554
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,400
Isn't today (Children's) Day?

555
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,520
You have to eat something sweet on a holiday.

556
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,600
Yeah, like the first day we came to the cabin.

557
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,720
We had to eat cake.

558
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,520
I think the first day at the cabin

559
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,560
is like the cabin's birthday.

560
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,920
It feels so ceremonial.

561
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,520
I'm actually pretty into rituals.

562
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,360
Yeah.

563
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,320
Even though now,

564
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,960
I have to work from Monday to Friday,

565
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,120
I still think

566
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,800
that after-work hours really belong to me.

567
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:56,760
That's how it is.

568
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,000
So a lot of young people nowadays

569
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,680
after work,

570
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,360
just keep playing on their phones

571
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,240
and stay up late before going to bed.

572
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,080
But I think

573
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,400
that doesn't really make the best use

574
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,800
of your time.

575
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,760
It depends on each person's perspective.

576
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,440
Right?

577
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,760
Some people might just want to scroll on their phones for a bit.

578
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,840
Others might

579
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,640
Actually, I really wanted to walk the dog yesterday.

580
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,800
But at that time,

581
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,840
when I asked, were you not there?

582
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,320
Were you there?

583
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:26,800
You were there.

584
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,800
I asked at the dinner table yesterday.

585
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,120
I didn't hear it.

586
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,600
Did I hear it?

587
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,200
Did I not hear it?

588
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,560
I don't know.

589
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,640
But I did ask.

590
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,080
I said,

591
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,520
"Does anyone want to walk Nicole?"

592
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,360
Me.

593
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,160
I really might not have heard you say that.

594
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,120
Otherwise, I would have said

595
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,320
I want to go.

596
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,400
Do you want to go for a walk now?

597
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,080
Although,

598
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:55,560
it's too late.

599
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,760
Then we can go tomorrow.

600
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,360
Okay.

601
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,080
What do you want to eat?

602
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,240
Anything is fine.

603
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,360
I'm not picky.

604
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,600
Not picky.

605
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,120
What do you have?

606
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:11,880
Something that cooks quickly.

607
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,800
Whatever is easier for you.

608
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,280
Stir-fried watermelon.

609
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,360
Stir-fried apple.

610
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,000
You can stir-fry two bunches of greens.

611
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,080
Stir-fried greens.

612
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:21,720
Yeah.

613
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,920
Isn't that convenient?

614
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,760
Are you sure?

615
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,880
I'm sure.

616
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,520
No need to cut, just stir-fry them as they are.

617
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,880
Stir-fry four bunches.

618
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,200
I think next time I can bring some lard.

619
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,720
Vegetables taste best stir-fried with lard.

620
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,280
Be careful, it's hot.

621
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,160
Thank you.

622
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,840
This is the first time I've eaten something shaped like this

623
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,480
such an artistic-looking steamed egg.

624
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,280
You have to eat this with a spoon.

625
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,680
I'll try the first bite.

626
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,280
Let me give it a try.

627
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,120
It's fine.

628
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,320
It should be edible.

629
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,200
Of course it's edible.

630
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:11,880
Why wouldn't it be edible?

631
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,680
As long as it's cooked, it's fine.

632
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,120
It's pretty tasty.

633
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,920
The first day I met you, I thought

634
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,000
you didn't smile much.

635
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,600
You didn't seem like a cheerful person.

636
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,200
Yeah.

637
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,320
Yeah.

638
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:28,920
That's right.

639
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,520
Except for when, for some reason,

640
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,840
you were just sitting there grinning.

641
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,080
You seemed like a very serious person.

642
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,920
Yeah.

643
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,480
But actually, I'm not.

644
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,880
Then I'm the opposite of you.

645
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,480
You look very cheerful.

646
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,560
But I'm actually very serious.

647
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,280
I just look serious, that's all.

648
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,200
On the first day, I still

649
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,480
looked pretty cheerful, didn't I?

650
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:51,880
Yeah.

651
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,960
You were probably wearing blue that day.

652
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,160
That's right.

653
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,160
What did you do today?

654
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,240
I was reading papers today.

655
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,240
Are you leaving tomorrow?

656
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,240
Yeah.

657
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,240
Smart.

658
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,680
I'll be back the day after tomorrow.

659
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,520
We still haven't made spicy hot pot yet.

660
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,520
Can we make it the day after tomorrow?

661
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,640
I'll think about it.

662
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,720
Because I don't know yet

663
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,240
what time I'll be back tomorrow.

664
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,120
Or you could make one tomorrow and another the day after.

665
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,720
You're already bossing me around, huh?

666
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,360
Just a little.

667
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,120
That's enough.

668
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,200
I won't wish you a halftime champagne celebration just yet.

669
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,000
Alright.

670
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,640
Let's talk about it when I get back.

671
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,720
You shouldn't have much of a problem with this.

672
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,840
The defense will definitely be fine.

673
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,160
Then you can bring back a roast duck when you come.

674
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,040
Sure.

675
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,640
Bring back a Peking duck.

676
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:03,640
Okay.

677
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,520
Let's go.

678
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,600
Hello, everyone.

679
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,520
Hello.

680
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,000
Hello.

681
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,520
Have you eaten?

682
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,640
I have, but I'm hungry again.

683
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,040
We brought a lot of fruit and—

684
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,320
Fruit, right?

685
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,680
And that bread.

686
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,360
Let me take a look.

687
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,320
These?

688
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,920
This one feels so soft.

689
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:33,800
Yes.

690
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,720
It should taste really good.

691
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,600
Are you busy later?

692
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,040
Are you busy later?

693
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:38,640
No.

694
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,600
Let's go out for a walk.

695
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,200
Sure.

696
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,200
These pants make your legs look so long.

697
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,400
Really?

698
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,440
Really.

699
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,480
I'll wear them every day from now on.

700
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,480
We can go for a stroll in the park.

701
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,280
Okay.

702
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,440
Do you want a drink?

703
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,560
Sure, I'll have a sip.

704
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,280
Thank you.

705
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,120
You're welcome.

706
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,040
Your beef jerky is really delicious.

707
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,040
It's really tasty.

708
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,720
I'm glad you like it.

709
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,320
I'm worried about that bean snack.

710
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,360
It's not the one you like.

711
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,120
It's exactly the same.

712
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,040
Every piece is the right one.

713
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,640
I have another one here.

714
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,400
Thank you.

715
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,640
How did you know I finished eating?

716
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,200
Just now

717
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,600
When the five of us were sitting there

718
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,040
we were talking about how everyone feels

719
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,360
after being in the cabin for so many days

720
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,360
whether it's the life we imagined

721
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,640
Let's sit for a while

722
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,160
Okay

723
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,200
I just think

724
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,160
the only thing that's different from what I imagined

725
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,280
I'm quite surprised

726
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:42,880
It's just that

727
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,320
there's no time for breakfast

728
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,800
Alright

729
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,800
because everyone leaves really early

730
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,440
I thought everyone would have

731
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,680
time to gather together

732
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,280
to make breakfast and chat

733
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,040
Yeah

734
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,920
But it seems like every day we all

735
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,040
rush out early in the morning

736
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,960
And as for the other parts, I think actually

737
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,280
they're pretty much as I imagined.

738
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,800
So it met your expectations?

739
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,320
Yes.

740
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,520
That's quite a different answer.

741
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,520
As for myself,

742
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,680
I think, first of all, my state of mind

743
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,000
is something I need to adjust on my own.

744
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,520
Actually, everyone has their own

745
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,720
difficulties to deal with.

746
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,000
In daily life,

747
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,800
no matter if people are

748
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,000
in different professions

749
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,440
or of different ages,

750
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,360
I think right now,

751
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,400
I've been doing a pretty good job adjusting my mindset.

752
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,280
First, my expectations for this period

753
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,600
because it will be a very

754
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,960
special time in my life.

755
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,640
So I might

756
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,360
use all of my

757
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,840
energy and effort

758
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,680
to get myself into the best possible state.

759
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,920
Whether it's

760
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,120
not letting myself down

761
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,920
or getting along well with everyone.

762
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,480
A group of very smart people gathered together

763
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,560
and they all

764
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,680
are very kind

765
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,800
but they're all very different from each other

766
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,080
I think it's really

767
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:07,880
interesting

768
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,800
Don't you think so?

769
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,760
I think you explained it really well

770
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,240
Really?

771
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,800
I feel like I'm

772
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,240
in class

773
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,000
I'm learning

774
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,600
No

775
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,040
It's just that I arrived late

776
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,120
You're giving me a make-up lesson

777
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,200
What were you all talking about just now?

778
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,080
Can I come pay you the tuition later?

779
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,480
Beef jerky?

780
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,280
If it's food, that's fine

781
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,520
Maybe in a couple of days

782
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,320
there might be a day when I come back very late.

783
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,680
Because my dad's birthday is coming up.

784
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,320
Actually, we talked about dads yesterday.

785
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,720
It was just yesterday.

786
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,840
Duoduo, me, Lechen, and Xiaoyuan

787
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,000
the four of us all talked.

788
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,080
How did you end up talking about dads?

789
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,920
We were talking about parents and family.

790
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,440
Everyone actually shared a lot.

791
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,720
Like our own experiences growing up and stuff.

792
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,440
Lechen and Xiaoyuan's families are pretty similar.

793
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,040
Me and

794
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,640
me and Duoduo's families are more alike.

795
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,400
And both Duoduo and I

796
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,640
our parents were each other's first love.

797
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,200
It's like

798
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,440
so sweet it's almost too much.

799
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:02,800
It feels like

800
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,120
they don't even need kids anymore.

801
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:04,640
Yeah.

802
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,000
Then maybe my family is similar to yours.

803
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,520
Like,

804
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,480
a kid from a really happy family.

805
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,200
My parents were also each other's first love.

806
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,160
The first time my dad saw my mom,

807
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,600
they were really young.

808
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,000
He said when he first saw my mom,

809
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,480
he just

810
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,960
made up his mind right then

811
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,040
that this girl would be his wife one day.

812
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:26,720
And then

813
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,360
That's so romantic.

814
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,360
Even now,

815
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:31,000
he can still describe exactly

816
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,080
the day my mom was riding her bike

817
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,800
and appeared in front of him,

818
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,480
what color clothes she was wearing,

819
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,480
and what her hairstyle was.

820
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,360
How old were they at that time?

821
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,480
High school.

822
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,000
Back then, my mom didn't even know my dad.

823
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,880
They weren't even in the same grade.

824
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,160
Then later, in college,

825
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,760
they both got into the same university.

826
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,040
But they were on different campuses.

827
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,760
And back then, transportation wasn't convenient.

828
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,760
They had to take really long rides.

829
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,600
My dad would

830
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,760
take a long trip just to see my mom.

831
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,600
That's amazing.

832
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,600
I think it's really beautiful.

833
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,240
So I think

834
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,880
this shaped my expectations about love.

835
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,360
This also shaped my expectations about love.

836
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,360
It's always been a very idealized state.

837
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,560
I think a child's view on relationships

838
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,600
is actually related to

839
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,120
their parents.

840
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,800
Parents have a big influence.

841
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,440
It's not even something they teach directly.

842
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,360
It's more about leading by example.

843
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,240
It's just seeing it.

844
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,400
Just purely observing.

845
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,240
You just feel like

846
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,240
the world is supposed to be like this.

847
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:20,840
Yeah.

848
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,680
Hello.

849
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,480
Hello.

850
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,680
You guys went for another walk, right?

851
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:28,560
Yeah.

852
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,600
You walked three laps.

853
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,440
Yeah.

854
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,760
So much fruit.

855
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,880
Tomorrow morning when you go to work,

856
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,920
you can grab some bread and desserts over there.

857
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,080
Great, let me take a look.

858
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,000
Is your butter rice cake edible?

859
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,880
Yes, you can eat it.

860
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,320
But do you need to toast it first?

861
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:49,960
Or maybe...

862
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,880
If you want it warm, you can toast it.

863
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,680
Sure.

864
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,360
I'll come back and have one later.

865
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,120
I want to eat one too.

866
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,480
Have a lychee.

867
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,920
It's so sweet.

868
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,600
Just like you.

869
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,880
So greasy.

870
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,080
Expired candy.

871
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,760
Not as sweet as your words.

872
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,400
Even greasier.

873
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,040
You two are really neck and neck.

874
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,240
If you have to work early tomorrow,

875
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,320
you can come to the first floor to get the breakfast I bought.

876
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,080
Or,

877
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,280
next time, you can put it here.

878
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:33,880
Put it here.

879
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,480
Okay, teacher.

880
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,720
Got it.

881
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,680
Or you can just leave it at my door.

882
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,520
Okay.

883
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,600
You're really a good person.

884
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,760
One plate for each person, then put them there.

885
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,280
Okay.

886
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,760
Have all the plates here been washed?

887
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,840
Yes.

888
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,520
Alright, very good.

889
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,960
I'll take four.

890
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,680
Does anyone want to eat?

891
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:10,960
Yes.

892
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:11,800
Yes.

893
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,480
Go ahead and eat.

894
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,600
Enjoy this cake.

895
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,120
It's super delicious.

896
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,840
I don't mind gaining a few pounds.

897
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,080
I'm so happy.

898
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,640
I have another cake.

899
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,560
Ruilong.

900
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,960
As long as you open it,

901
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:39,800
she'll eat it.

902
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,960
It depends on whether you open it or not.

903
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,480
It depends on whether you open it or not.

904
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,240
It's the main one.

905
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,200
Let's do it tomorrow.

906
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,680
Luckily, I almost ate it.

907
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,240
Yeah.

908
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,280
If he opens it, I'll definitely eat.

909
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:47,880
That scared me to death.

910
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,760
It's been a week and I still haven't started learning German.

911
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,000
German.

912
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,240
How do you start (the class)?

913
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,680
He spoke German.

914
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,800
Let's learn.

915
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,600
German, I heard it.

916
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,880
How do you say "beer"?

917
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,680
Beer.

918
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,960
It's just "beer".

919
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,360
But don't you need to use the uvular sound for the "r"?

920
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,480
For "beer", you don't need to.

921
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,720
You only pronounce it in the middle.

922
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,080
Why make it so academic?

923
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,440
I'm defending my thesis.

924
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,600
How do you say "sausage"?

925
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,880
Sausage.

926
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,800
Sausage.

927
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,440
Sausage.

928
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,320
Sausage.

929
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,240
Sausage.

930
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,760
Hot dog.

931
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,400
Don't cough up phlegm.

932
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,960
That's very likely.

933
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,360
I just felt it.
