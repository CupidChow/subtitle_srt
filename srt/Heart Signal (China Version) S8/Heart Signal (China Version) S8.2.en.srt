1
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,240
I'm here.

2
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,720
I'm home.

3
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,920
Xu is home.

4
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,440
Chunye is home.

5
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,040
Home.

6
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,360
Home.

7
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,200
Living in a new house.

8
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,200
This train engine.

9
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,960
So cute.

10
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,120
Train engine.

11
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,640
Actually,

12
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,080
every device you see

13
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,320
has a hidden secret.

14
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,160
Really?

15
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,520
We have experience.

16
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,000
Xu is still quite kind.

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,280
Xu will help cover for you.

18
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,840
Really?

19
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,320
I would just say I understand.

20
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:06,680
I know.

21
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,400
Xu, you're still so thoughtful.

22
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,480
That puts me at ease.

23
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,400
I'm easier to fool.

24
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,160
Why do I feel like it might

25
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,000
be related to our theme this time?

26
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,880
That's a key device.

27
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,200
This is a super important device.

28
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,960
It was in this spot last year too.

29
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,280
Yeah.

30
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,280
I'm used to it.

31
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,440
As long as you turn to this spot,

32
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,080
this should be the key device.

33
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,000
You...

34
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,320
Your apartment layout is really nice.

35
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,920
No, I think the view from your side is better.

36
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,240
You can see all the main installations.

37
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,400
No.

38
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,720
You haven't seen the best part at all.

39
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,840
Where's the best part?

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,720
I've already found the best part.

41
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,440
And it's my favorite.

42
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,600
What is it?

43
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,320
It's this.

44
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,280
Xu, I thought I was the only one who did things like this.

45
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,400
Well, here I am.

46
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,440
Seriously.

47
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,000
When I was little,

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,120
boys who liked me would give me this tea.

49
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,080
Why do I feel like when we were kids,

50
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,880
we were in the same class?

51
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,160
Yeah, we were in the same class.

52
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,120
Classmates.

53
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,800
Who else?

54
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,680
Old friends are here.

55
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,080
Hello, everyone.

56
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,840
Long time no see.

57
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,600
Long time no see, bro.

58
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,880
Hello, Teacher Xu.

59
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,520
Hello.

60
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,760
How's your butterfly?

61
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,720
The butterfly is still in my heart.

62
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,720
Only the four of us should know this joke.

63
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,320
Everyone knows.

64
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,040
This is the same as last year.

65
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,240
You haven't taken this one yet.

66
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,160
No wonder you're curious.

67
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,400
Have you never touched it before?

68
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,640
You took it last time.

69
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,280
I've taken it.

70
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,680
I've had it before.

71
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,440
Just not enough times.

72
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,920
Right, only in the first round.

73
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,840
I think it was two rounds.

74
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,160
No, I think if he stays long enough,

75
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,640
he should be the one who gets the most.

76
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,960
It was a pity about last season.

77
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,320
I hope you can stay longer this season.

78
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,400
You should stay a bit longer.

79
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,040
Really.

80
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,160
Because after you left last time,

81
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,000
we were anxious too.

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,200
And all of us,

83
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,080
dear online friends, were even more anxious.

84
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,000
Really?

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,560
Everyone wanted you to come back quickly.

86
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,440
You watched the ending of last season yourself, right?

87
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,520
I watched it all.

88
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,040
I realized my intuition was pretty accurate.

89
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,480
It was just as I thought.

90
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,480
Not much different.

91
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,200
So smug.

92
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,640
From the first episode, it wasn't much different.

93
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,400
I agree.

94
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,800
As your desk mate, I agree.

95
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,000
It felt like from the first episode,

96
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,840
you could already see the ending.

97
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,440
You can't say that.

98
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,760
Let's look forward to it again this time.

99
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,200
Hope this season can also

100
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,120
have beautiful and handsome people.

101
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,400
It definitely will.

102
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,120
You won't appear in it too, will you?

103
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:56,800
Me?

104
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,520
Yes.

105
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,840
If you appear (in Heartbeat Apartment),

106
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,520
that would be explosive.

107
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,240
I'm telling you, it's possible.

108
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,200
He might be pretending.

109
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:11,920
Really.

110
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,880
Let's look forward to it.

111
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,520
I think this season,

112
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,560
we should have a special theme.

113
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,760
How about we speak honestly this season?

114
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,200
Say whatever comes to mind.

115
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,880
Express yourself directly.

116
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,520
Okay.

117
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,800
The most honest speaker is here.

118
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,200
Hello, everyone.

119
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:44,800
Hello.

120
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,680
Hello, teacher.

121
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,560
My name is Hanikezi.

122
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,280
Hello, teacher.

123
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,240
I am Zhang Chunye.

124
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,480
My name is Hanikezi.

125
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,400
Hello.

126
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:50,880
Hello.

127
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,400
Hello.

128
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:51,920
Hello.

129
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,440
My name is Xu Minghao.

130
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,080
My name is Hanikezi.

131
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,520
Hello.

132
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,200
Hello.

133
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,680
Hello, Teacher Ma.

134
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,200
Hello.

135
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,600
Hello.

136
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,000
You go first.

137
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,680
It's been

138
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,800
many years since I last saw him (Xu Minghao).

139
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,200
I know, I know.

140
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,240
The last time I saw him was in 2018.

141
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,280
2018.

142
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,040
He used to be my partner.

143
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,440
My first show after returning to China.

144
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,520
Sis, you've become prettier.

145
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,040
Really?

146
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,480
Yes.

147
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,960
You're still as handsome.

148
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,280
No, I'm not.

149
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,600
This season, we're all about speaking honestly.

150
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,160
Right? We're telling the truth.

151
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,600
Right.

152
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,640
Yes.

153
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,520
Brother Tao really has gained weight.

154
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,280
Get out of here.

155
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,560
Have you ever seen Brother Tao

156
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,760
at his thinnest?

157
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,440
I have.

158
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,080
He was so thin,

159
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,920
like,

160
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,960
I would use him

161
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,320
to motivate my friends around me.

162
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:35,840
If they wanted to lose weight,

163
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,000
I would use him as

164
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,680
a textbook example.

165
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,560
Back then, he was also like "Little Li Xian."

166
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,480
You're finally speaking the truth.

167
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,440
What do you mean by that "oh"?

168
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,680
Why don't you motivate yourself to lose weight?

169
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,960
Hanikezi.

170
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,200
Have I ever been fat?

171
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,200
Have you ever been thin?

172
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,440
You two are so funny.

173
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,160
You two really are...

174
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,080
You met in 2018?

175
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,040
So back then,

176
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,160
what kind of variety show was it?

177
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,920
A music variety show.

178
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,000
So, was Mr. Ma...

179
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,680
Did you share the stage with him?

180
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,440
No, I was his...

181
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,880
I was playing a tree in the background.

182
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,200
I was the one acting as a prop.

183
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,880
You acted as a prop?

184
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,720
Partner.

185
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,320
Music partner.

186
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,560
You're still very...

187
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,280
You're still easy to fool.

188
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,240
Mr. Ma dares to say it,

189
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,080
and Zhang Chun Ye dares to believe it.

190
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,600
Right?

191
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,440
No, sometimes you...

192
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,800
might have to listen to me.

193
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,000
Why do you want to control others?

194
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,480
No, I don't.

195
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,280
Just kidding.

196
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,720
Just trying to break the ice.

197
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,040
We don't have any ice left.

198
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,080
Now there's ice again.

199
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,320
Hanikezi.

200
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,560
Ma Boqian.

201
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,760
How did you two meet?

202
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,200
The two of us

203
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,240
have a deep history.

204
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,800
He always loses to me.

205
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,280
Let me tell you,

206
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:53,880
he's always been my defeated opponent.

207
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,680
In any show I'm on,

208
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,000
as long as I'm competing with her,

209
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,280
I always lose.

210
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,200
I want to ask,

211
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:04,720
how is Hani doing?

212
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,920
Hani really is

213
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,200
among all our members,

214
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,000
among all our members,

215
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,280
is this your first time on a dating show?

216
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,600
Yes, it's my first time on a dating show.

217
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,000
So how does it feel to be here?

218
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,200
How are you feeling right now?

219
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,600
I think I'm pretty nervous.

220
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,320
Because it's my first time here,

221
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:18,880
and you all

222
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,680
are all old friends,

223
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,280
actually, I really enjoy shipping couples too.

224
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,720
Because I think watching others fall in love

225
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,960
is a really happy thing.

226
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,160
That's true.

227
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,560
It also gives me a lot of inspiration.

228
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,680
Since the scripts I usually work on are about romance too,

229
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,400
I can also see

230
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:30,840
the real

231
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,400
way people today

232
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,240
fall in love.

233
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,040
How everyone breaks the ice,

234
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,120
and how they get together.

235
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,720
It's a bit like being a detective,

236
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,440
looking for clues.

237
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,360
I'm really looking forward to it.

238
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,040
The last time I saw Hani

239
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,200
was when I was watching "HaHaHaHaHa"

240
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,760
I was "getting married"

241
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,200
That was so beautiful

242
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,960
It was really beautiful

243
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,320
And that episode was really good

244
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,360
The atmosphere in that episode was really warm

245
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,760
I saw online that it made a lot of people want to get married

246
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,680
I saw that a lot of people wanted to get married

247
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,600
That episode was truly beautiful

248
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,360
She went to her hometown

249
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,080
She went to Xinjiang

250
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,440
Then she put on the bridal dress

251
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,640
Look at how beautiful she is now

252
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,840
As soon as the music starts

253
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,960
She dances really well

254
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,160
It's just beautiful

255
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,080
Do you want to show us?

256
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,920
Let the music teacher play a piece

257
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,120
Do you want to go first?

258
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,280
You go first

259
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,240
You do a bit

260
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,000
Then I'll dance after

261
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,840
I can't do it

262
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,520
I can't dance

263
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,600
You can

264
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,080
I really can't dance

265
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,760
I'm not joking

266
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,600
He really can't

267
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,240
Yeah

268
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,400
Can Brother Xu dance?

269
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,160
I've been practicing lately

270
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,720
Last season, he and Lin Yichen

271
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,240
did that partner dance

272
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,760
Everyone at the scene was

273
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,880
screaming like crazy

274
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,560
It's still vivid in my mind

275
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,400
It was the first time I felt what it means

276
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,000
to want to "strangle yourself" after dancing

277
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,960
I heard that Xu Ge

278
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,360
really likes shipping couples.

279
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,560
He even follows them offline now.

280
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,760
No, who told you that?

281
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,920
You just said it yourself.

282
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,640
Don't be like that.

283
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,720
Don't "bully" people.

284
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,160
Let me tell you,

285
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,000
someone is finally on my side.

286
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,240
No one will take your side.

287
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,040
Xu Ge, are you

288
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,600
still hanging out with Sister Yang (Yang Ruqing) and the others?

289
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,080
You tell us.

290
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,720
Yes, I went to their house for dinner.

291
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,920
It's true.

292
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,000
You went behind our backs

293
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,760
to have dinner at their place?

294
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,400
Yes.

295
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,720
When did this happen?

296
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,080
A while ago.

297
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,640
It was when they moved into their new house.

298
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,360
And I thought,

299
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,640
I hadn't seen them in a long time,

300
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,600
so I went to their house for dinner.

301
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,640
See, our

302
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,600
"Signal of the Heart" after-sales service

303
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,240
is so good.

304
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,080
We just

305
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,360
go to each other's homes for dinner.

306
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,040
I really

307
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,520
got to eat food cooked by Hou Zhuocheng.

308
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,000
And then

309
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,240
Yang Ruqing showed me

310
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,280
around their house.

311
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,000
They worked really hard all the way.

312
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,560
And how they

313
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,760
put their home together.

314
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,040
They went through a lot in the process.

315
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,400
I just felt

316
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,280
really happy about it.

317
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
The teacher is here.

318
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,600
Teacher.

319
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,000
The teacher is here.

320
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,600
Hello, everyone.

321
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,760
Hello, we meet again.

322
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,440
Teacher Qianzhuang.

323
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,160
Hello.

324
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,920
Hello.

325
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,920
Hello, teacher.

326
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,040
Teacher.

327
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,240
Let's sit and talk.

328
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,080
It's fine, let's sit and chat.

329
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,200
It feels just like being at home.

330
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:22,800
This season,

331
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,160
our whole

332
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,200
the atmosphere of the decor is very different.

333
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,920
And there are many unique designs.

334
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,600
As you can see,

335
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,360
over here there's a

336
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,480
special windmill house.

337
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,960
And over here, there's also a lighthouse.

338
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,000
All of these are related to the story of this season.

339
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,720
Hello everyone, we are Weini and Nicole.

340
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,800
We need everyone to take good care of us.

341
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,760
Please, after work every day,

342
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,000
take us out to have some fun.

343
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,040
I feel like

344
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,720
it's possible to have pets.

345
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,280
Yes.

346
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,240
This season, we've added another segment.

347
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,720
That is,

348
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,160
we're integrating pets into our lives.

349
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:57,960
Really.

350
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,280
I really like this design.

351
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,880
I think having animals really makes a difference.

352
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,200
Is there any design you don't like?

353
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,040
You like every design.

354
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,640
Don't expose me right away.

355
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,040
Sorry.

356
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,480
I really like dogs.

357
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,160
Okay.

358
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,560
This season, we're speaking honestly.

359
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,200
Say whatever you want, just say it back.

360
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,480
Right.

361
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,000
I just like it, so what?

362
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,200
Yeah, I just like it, so what?

363
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,000
There's nothing offensive about that.

364
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,600
Come on, let's do another one.

365
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,760
Change it, I'll give you another chance.

366
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,160
Go ahead.

367
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,800
I know if I say something, it'll "crush" him.

368
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,280
Do you know who is like me?

369
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:25,960
Is it the "crane personality"?

370
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,480
Who?

371
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,200
Sister Yang (Yang Ruqing).

372
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,800
Panicked.

373
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,400
You panicked.

374
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,480
This one's good.

375
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,520
Did Ma Boqian get scared?

376
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,400
Yeah, I got scared.

377
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,280
This one lost.

378
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,040
This one really lost.

379
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,240
And then Ma Ge (Ma Boqian),

380
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,080
he's back again this time.

381
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,680
Right?

382
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,960
Ma Ge (Ma Boqian), speak honestly.

383
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,600
Do you think you prefer season six

384
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,920
or season four?

385
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,040
Which one do I like more?

386
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,680
Yeah.

387
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,200
Season four.

388
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,160
Of course, there are a lot of things that left a deep impression on me.

389
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,720
But I think, relatively speaking, season six

390
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,200
for me,

391
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,600
even though I wasn't there for long,

392
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,760
I only came once,

393
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,480
but just that one time

394
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,880
left a really, really deep impression on me.

395
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,800
Got it.

396
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,960
The corner of your mouth...

397
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,400
Yeah, it's fine.

398
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,760
And then...

399
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,160
True.

400
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,080
At that time, in certain moments,

401
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,040
you could also see

402
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,440
that all the guests inside at the time

403
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,480
actually had some

404
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,000
different chemistry.

405
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,080
It just happened suddenly.

406
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,680
It's way more fun inside than here.

407
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,200
Yeah, I also think it's really fun inside.

408
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,280
So...

409
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,120
Did you guys watch that

410
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,200
"Erben Love Variety" show?

411
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,760
Everyone is really engaged in the discussion.

412
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,000
Who is your main question directed to?

413
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:40,760
Everyone.

414
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,000
Except Ma Boxian.

415
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,240
No, just us.

416
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,480
Wasn't there one last season—

417
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,560
Where the male and female guests asked each other—

418
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,400
Like, "What's your favorite city?"

419
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,120
And then the boy answered—

420
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,040
Manchester.

421
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,240
Manchester.

422
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,160
He said it in English.

423
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:57,800
And because—

424
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,200
There are so many fans of "Signal of the Heart,"

425
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,360
A huge number.

426
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,080
So they wanted to create something themselves—

427
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,520
Make one—

428
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,960
That's more lively,

429
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,120
More authentic,

430
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,800
More like what they experience in daily life,

431
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,960
Like the kind of relationships

432
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,960
You'd have with friends in a dating show.

433
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,280
But I think they're really impressive.

434
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,840
There's a bit of

435
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,200
A playful teasing vibe.

436
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,200
But we also want to thank everyone

437
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,760
For liking our show.

438
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,000
I think their show is so much fun.

439
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,000
If their show needs a host,

440
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,520
I can do it too.

441
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,360
If they need panelists, we can all do it.

442
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,280
And everyone can see—

443
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,360
Chunye just noticed earlier—

444
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,640
There's a special design over there.

445
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,400
This spot every season—

446
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,560
Always has some major installations.

447
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,200
This only happens once a week.

448
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,480
It's the weekday park hour.

449
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,160
The opening time is Monday

450
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,480
from twelve o'clock

451
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,240
to midnight.

452
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,600
Everyone can try for it,

453
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,480
but only one person can use it each time.

454
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,320
And you can't use it again.

455
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:48,720
That's right.

456
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,600
If you want to start

457
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,280
this romantic park hour,

458
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,920
please get an invitation ticket from the machine.

459
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,040
Fill in the date and location.

460
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,120
And choose a bottle of Kang Shifu Jasmine Tea.

461
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,120
Then secretly invite "that person"

462
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,440
for a date.

463
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,880
If your invitation is rejected,

464
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,240
it still counts as your chance used.

465
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,120
Can you open it for us, please?

466
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,440
Here we go, everyone.

467
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,600
Let's do it.

468
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,640
Last night,

469
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,520
when I was going to sleep,

470
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,440
I told myself

471
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,360
that I must get this today.

472
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,120
Be brave and go for it.

473
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:25,880
Go for it!

474
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:26,880
Here I come.

475
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,280
I'm all set and ready.

476
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,080
I'm coming.

477
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,800
I'm coming.

478
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,400
I'm really looking forward to it.

479
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,520
This park is really big.

480
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,440
Come a little closer.

481
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,080
I made this wish today.

482
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,720
The whole universe will hear it.

483
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,680
This scene

484
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,720
is so romantic.

485
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,720
You have to be brave at least once in life.

486
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,680
I follow with just one click.

487
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:45,800
Because of you,

488
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,800
I have this chance.

489
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,840
to walk in the park.

490
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,560
Look, the park gate is closed today.

491
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,760
So the two of them are walking in the park.

492
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,720
It's okay, we still have another chance.

493
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,360
So exciting.

494
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,040
Send an invitation.

495
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,400
Take the little train.

496
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,800
Go start our private secret-sharing time.

497
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,000
Can I have a secret-sharing moment with you?

498
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,200
That's actually pretty bold.

499
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,640
The little train is moving.

500
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,400
I was making a wish before I went to sleep last night.

501
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,000
I also wanted to ride the little train.

502
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,560
I got it.

503
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,080
So I think fate is really amazing.

504
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,200
How can it be so...

505
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,960
...perfectly timed.

506
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,720
This is the...

507
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,240
...happiest thing I've heard all week.

508
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,120
Being able to talk with you about all this today,

509
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,920
I already feel really happy.

510
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,360
It could even go further.

511
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,640
So cute.

512
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,680
It completely fulfills all my ideas of home.

513
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,800
Are you going to walk the dog?

514
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,360
It's just that...

515
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,840
When it's at home, it doesn't want to go out.

516
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,360
But once it's outside, it's really happy.

517
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,440
Puppies never lie.

518
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,800
Puppies are the most sincere.

519
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,520
When you first came over, it was like...

520
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,200
...a princess walking out of a castle.

521
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,880
You always compliment me in just the right way.

522
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,640
Because I always tell the truth.

523
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,360
I'm leaving.

524
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,920
Aren't I pursuing you right now?

525
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,880
Actually, I think with you...

526
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,000
...we really click when we talk.

527
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,160
Maybe that's exactly why...

528
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,040
I feel...

529
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,440
Don't you think...

530
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,840
There might be some connection.

531
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,040
It really is just suitable.

532
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,040
We make the best companions.

533
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:10,760
The feeling you give me

534
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,320
is really like a big iceberg in autumn.

535
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,800
I just want to be alone for a while.

536
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,200
I still feel

537
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,280
Did I put pressure on him?

538
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,160
You didn't pressure him.

539
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,600
He wrote so much to you.

540
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,400
He definitely acknowledges you.

541
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,360
If my difficulties really make things hard for you,

542
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,920
then I can stop making it hard.

543
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,640
When everything goes too smoothly, it's not always a good thing.

544
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,240
It's okay.

545
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,160
I'm really getting so anxious.

546
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,800
This is so touching.

547
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,200
"Idol drama"

548
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,240
Start the trial romance trip right away.

549
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,960
Speed up.

550
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,960
Are you going to let me listen to your heartbeat?

551
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,960
Someone who truly cares about you

552
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,320
will care about everything about you.

553
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,600
Have fun.

554
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,960
I don't dislike you at all.

555
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,720
I like you.

556
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,000
I want to be with you.

557
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,320
Let this feeling

558
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,280
keep going.

559
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,480
I like you.

560
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,880
Just watching this scene feels so romantic.

561
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,720
But actually, this time

562
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,720
we also created a

563
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,240
test

564
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,000
It's

565
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,040
a love personality

566
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,720
test in a travel edition

567
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,400
So, Teacher Qianzhuang

568
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,600
could you share with us

569
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,200
what's special about it this time?

570
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,000
This year

571
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,840
we also combined

572
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,400
the theme that young people really like

573
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,520
which is travel

574
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,520
to develop this assessment

575
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,360
This is also because during travel

576
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,760
people spend a lot of intense time together

577
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,000
We immerse ourselves in travel to

578
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,200
experience each other

579
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,600
We also created this test

580
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,520
to help everyone

581
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,920
more quickly judge from the trip

582
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,000
between me and this person

583
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,640
there might be some

584
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,880
kind of chemistry

585
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,480
and also

586
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,240
in the future, in our relationship

587
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,160
especially in the early, exciting stage

588
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,400
what kind of love personality

589
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,600
we might have

590
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,240
It's easy to see

591
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,120
the other person's flaws

592
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,000
Both strengths and weaknesses are fine

593
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,360
Don't just focus on others' flaws

594
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,360
Look,

595
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,080
no,

596
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:07,720
because I think

597
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,840
a lot of things get magnified.

598
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,320
Then why can't strengths be magnified?

599
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,360
Why does it always have to be flaws?

600
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,360
It can, it's possible.

601
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,280
When you first get together,

602
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,000
when you're infatuated, you only see the good sides.

603
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,320
Right.

604
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,040
Maybe when you travel together,

605
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,120
you start to notice the flaws.

606
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,760
Hani, say something.

607
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,080
Is this your type?

608
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,280
I'm the romantic type.

609
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,440
Is anyone else here a romantic type?

610
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,520
No.

611
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,280
For you, romance is an undying dream.

612
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,120
Your love is innocent and passionate.

613
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,320
That's true, I'm pretty passionate.

614
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,640
You hope to build

615
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,000
a soulmate-like emotional connection with your partner.

616
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,320
You might also care a bit about looks.

617
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,640
You pay attention to your partner's appearance and vibe.

618
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,920
Not that much.

619
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,360
That...

620
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:44,760
I'm not that picky.

621
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,360
I see.

622
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,080
That's not accurate.

623
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,160
Take out the "a bit" part,

624
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,720
then it's more accurate.

625
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:50,880
What you just read

626
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,920
Every sentence felt like

627
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,040
it was about me.

628
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,040
I couldn't help but laugh.

629
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,080
That's exactly me.

630
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,000
A romantic type of lover.

631
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,400
At the beginning,

632
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,080
I would endlessly

633
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,360
magnify the other person's strengths.

634
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,080
Yes, I really do.

635
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,720
In the early stages,

636
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,400
I would see this person

637
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,320
as good in every way.

638
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,320
Everything about them is right.

639
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,560
But when it comes to traveling,

640
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,960
I think it's not just about lovers.

641
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,920
It's the same between friends.

642
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,400
It's also easy to tell

643
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,120
which friends are suitable for traveling together.

644
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,360
And some are not really suitable.

645
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,320
Xiao Ma,

646
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,440
share some key words with us.

647
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,960
You have an innate

648
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,640
Yes.

649
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,360
sense of responsibility for your partner and family.

650
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,920
You believe you must take good care of

651
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,960
your partner and family.

652
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,640
That feels pretty accurate.

653
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,000
I'm quite surprised,

654
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,920
but it also makes a lot of sense that

655
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,760
Xu and Ma Boqian

656
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,600
are actually the same type.

657
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,080
Both are the responsible type.

658
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,040
How could they be the same type?

659
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,160
What do you mean by that?

660
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:39,840
Sorry.

661
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,960
I was just saying...

662
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Mr. Xu, please don't laugh.

663
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,920
You're making me feel awkward.

664
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,280
I'm just expressing a feeling.

665
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,000
Why is it so completely different?

666
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,720
It shows that

667
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,600
in the hearts of these two people,

668
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,640
they both feel

669
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,440
that the happiness of their wives and children

670
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,520
is their responsibility.

671
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,360
Because actually,

672
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,840
my family atmosphere is like this.

673
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,080
I've been influenced by my family.

674
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,880
Like my dad and mom,

675
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,440
my brother and me,

676
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,120
the first thing is,

677
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,240
all four of us are Aries.

678
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,760
Because Aries are also very independent,

679
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,600
so everyone just minds their own business.

680
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,160
We absolutely won't interfere with you.

681
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,280
But things have to be planned well.

682
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,080
They must be well planned.

683
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,200
When the four of us are together,

684
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,320
the first thing is a family meeting,

685
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:19,960
and sharing

686
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,720
the good and bad things that have happened recently.

687
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,000
Second, for example, my mom,

688
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,400
if tonight

689
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,480
all family members

690
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,920
must go to this restaurant for dinner,

691
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,320
my mom would say,

692
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,280
"Just try missing it, I dare you."

693
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,400
It's the same at home.

694
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,680
For example, I wash the dishes on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

695
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,320
My brother does it on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.

696
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,680
And my dad does it on Sunday.

697
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,520
I want to know about my deskmate's

698
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,960
My love personality is

699
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,120
Friendship-type lover

700
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,440
For you,

701
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,760
the best thing in love

702
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,000
is to have a deep friendship

703
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,400
and be built on understanding,

704
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,080
trust, and shared interests.

705
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,560
You value the tacit understanding between each other.

706
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,320
You think couples should not only have love

707
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,240
but also understanding and loyalty.

708
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,400
I think that's very accurate.

709
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,760
Because compared to some fantasies,

710
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,800
I would rather

711
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,320
the two people can be

712
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,520
comfortable together,

713
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,040
and complement each other well.

714
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,240
And not just have love,

715
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,520
but also a deeper level of

716
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:17,960
inner

717
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,280
connection

718
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:19,720
and understanding.

719
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,400
Understanding.

720
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,800
Usually,

721
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,120
you might be together like friends,

722
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,560
but it doesn't lack freshness.

723
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,560
That way, it feels more comfortable.

724
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,520
That way, it feels more comfortable.

725
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,640
It can make love last longer.

726
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,880
I really agree with this.

727
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,200
Because I'm like you,

728
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,480
I'm also

729
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,760
a friendship-type lover.

730
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,760
Now I suddenly feel

731
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,880
I'm also quite like him.

732
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,400
I also think I'm more like

733
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,600
I also feel like I am

734
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,040
this friendship type.

735
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,640
But this description feels a bit one-sided to me.

736
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,160
Because what we're testing here is the infatuation stage.

737
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,240
It's because intimate relationships

738
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,440
are divided into the early stage, the infatuation stage,

739
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,720
the maintenance stage,

740
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,920
and the long-term companionship stage.

741
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,480
Everyone, in these three stages,

742
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,560
will actually experience some changes.

743
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,240
I see, so I'm in the initial stage.

744
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,040
Chun Ye,

745
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,000
what type of lover are you? (Test result)

746
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,680
That's me.

747
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,480
Everything

748
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,280
fits perfectly with these five words.

749
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,200
It's called a passionate lover.

750
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,000
You can feel

751
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,800
your love is as intense as fire.

752
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,960
And you can't help but

753
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,400
experience the rush of adrenaline.

754
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,960
And I really like this sentence:

755
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,920
Only when your heart is racing

756
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,000
can you clearly feel

757
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,320
the existence of love and self.

758
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,240
When you fall in love with someone,

759
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,120
it's like the whole universe is burning.

760
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,840
When you meet someone

761
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,920
who burns as passionately as you do,

762
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,120
you will both experience

763
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,480
an irreplaceable sense of happiness in body and mind.

764
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,360
I totally agree.

765
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:32,880
Absolutely agree.

766
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,840
Agree one hundred percent.

767
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,560
And right now,

768
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,280
as you're saying this,

769
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,360
you're almost burning up yourself.

770
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,040
Yes, it's traveling.

771
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,800
It's still a real test.

772
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,520
Of the relationship between two people.

773
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,160
Of their relationship.

774
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,240
But traveling has an advantage for romance.

775
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,000
There's a benefit.

776
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,120
That is,

777
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,440
In our design this time,

778
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,560
everyone just travels together directly.

779
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,080
This way,

780
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:49,920
everyone can

781
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,960
put aside the labels people carry

782
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,920
and block them out for now.

783
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,680
It's like taking off "colored glasses."

784
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,520
It's like opening a blind box.

785
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,920
I think this is really exciting.

786
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,560
Because this is

787
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,640
throughout the beginning

788
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,640
of the whole process,

789
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,400
what each of us does

790
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,280
for a living,

791
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,920
we

792
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,960
don't know about each other.

793
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,960
It's purely about getting to know the person.

794
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,440
Feeling who they really are.

795
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,160
Yes, I think this is

796
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,640
especially, especially important.

797
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,480
And this is the very essence of love.

798
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,040
It's simply about whether you like the person or not.

799
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,720
Yes.

800
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:15,920
I actually think

801
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,520
everyone can also

802
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,160
use our show's broadcast

803
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,360
to do a little test with your partner

804
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,480
or with your friends

805
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,880
do a small test

806
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,320
and during this process

807
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,560
everyone can continuously

808
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,600
learn about themselves

809
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,880
and get to know each other

810
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,360
for example, everyone

811
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,040
can share

812
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,640
during a

813
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,800
trip

814
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,880
what behavior from the other person

815
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,560
you find most unacceptable

816
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,160
For me,

817
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,280
I actually think

818
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,080
as long as it's not a matter of principle

819
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,120
I can accept it

820
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,800
but if it's a really fundamental issue

821
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,840
for example, when traveling

822
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,080
I think the experience is very important

823
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,840
if the other person is stingy everywhere

824
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,160
and the food and accommodation aren't enjoyable

825
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,280
I would feel a bit bothered

826
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,800
I hope the other person can be more easygoing

827
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,760
and not be too particular

828
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,800
but for other small things

829
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,320
like bickering

830
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,400
I think that's all pretty normal

831
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,040
Because when I was doing this,

832
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,240
I came across a question.

833
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,760
That question really

834
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,280
I won't lie to you,

835
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,720
I didn't know what options B, C, and D were.

836
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,960
It asked me,

837
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,760
During a trip with your partner,

838
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,880
if they did something,

839
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,720
what could you not accept the most?

840
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,160
Guys,

841
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,440
option A was:

842
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,560
During the trip,

843
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,760
they developed feelings for someone else.

844
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,160
When I saw this, I thought,

845
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,360
why even look at B, C, or D?

846
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,040
Why would you even tell me about B, C, or D?

847
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,000
Yeah, me too.

848
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,880
Of course you'd pick A.

849
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,080
If you have feelings for someone else,

850
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:29,960
what else is there to choose?

851
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,840
So now,

852
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,480
I honestly have no idea

853
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,760
what B, C, and D even are.

854
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,320
Alright, let me fill you in here.

855
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,720
What B, C, and D are.

856
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,400
B: Your partner is absent-minded,

857
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,560
constantly on their phone,

858
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,560
and not engaged in the trip at all.

859
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,320
That would make you upset too.

860
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,440
C: Your partner tries to save money

861
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,520
and makes your food, accommodation, and activities really unsatisfying.

862
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,080
That would also make you unhappy.

863
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:53,920
Honestly, I think this question

864
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,920
makes me really unhappy.

865
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,480
Yeah.

866
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,520
You have to pick one.

867
00:25:59,320 --> 00:25:59,920
Then let me

868
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,600
D. Your partner doesn't acknowledge your efforts at all

869
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,480
You're also very angry about this

870
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,040
It means he

871
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,440
I can't even finish reading this question

872
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,320
It means he doesn't need it at all

873
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,400
A, B, C, D (options)

874
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,760
Because this is

875
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,320
in the assessment

876
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,080
a method called forced choice

877
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,920
This is a professional assessment technique

878
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,880
You'll feel like

879
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,120
you're being forced to choose one

880
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,720
the answer that makes you the angriest

881
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,840
At that moment

882
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,040
this feeling in people's hearts

883
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,280
this feeling in people's hearts

884
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,120
subconscious

885
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,400
or rather, what you really

886
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,080
value the most

887
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,640
including which one you choose the fastest

888
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:30,960
It's like

889
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,400
A

890
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,040
Right, when you choose A

891
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,800
you can't even look at B, C, or D anymore

892
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,040
So, I'll let everyone

893
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,600
answer, okay?

894
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,840
Those who think A

895
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,840
Okay, A

896
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,560
B. Your partner is absent-minded

897
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,320
constantly playing on their phone

898
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,880
not engaged in the trip at all

899
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:51,880
Xiao Ma, you chose

900
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,880
Why did you pick B?

901
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,360
No one is talking to him

902
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,320
No.

903
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,280
Because, why did I choose...

904
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,200
Actually, these options...

905
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,200
To be honest,

906
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,560
none of them are ideal.

907
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,800
But if I have to choose, it's B.

908
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,400
As for A,

909
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,080
I think it depends on what stage you're at.

910
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:11,880
Because as I understand it,

911
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,120
this trip is at an early stage.

912
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,880
You two haven't defined your relationship yet.

913
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,200
It's actually just a date.

914
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,240
So during the date,

915
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,560
when she hasn't made things official with you,

916
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,160
this could very likely happen.

917
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,000
It's possible.

918
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,400
Right.

919
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,040
Because for A, what am I...

920
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,600
When I saw the first question,

921
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,200
if you're traveling with your partner,

922
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,640
and she develops feelings for someone else,

923
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,520
she's attracted to someone else.

924
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,880
It's just feeling attracted, having a good impression.

925
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,640
I would feel

926
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,960
grateful to the heavens

927
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,840
for giving me the chance to see through someone.

928
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,800
That is,

929
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,080
I just shouldn't be with her in the future.

930
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,040
I think that's good.

931
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,960
That makes sense too.

932
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,800
Right?

933
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,760
Why did we choose B?

934
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,960
B, because I think

935
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,600
it's a sign of disrespecting the other person.

936
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,200
If that's the case,

937
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,920
maybe in the future when we're together

938
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,800
she might also

939
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,080
have some issues with ignoring the other person.

940
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:02,320
Yes.

941
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,640
And I think when two people are together,

942
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,240
they need to consider each other's feelings.

943
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,360
So I think

944
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,680
even though it's a small thing,

945
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,960
in my opinion,

946
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,120
there might be many things in the future

947
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,360
that aren't really suitable for me.

948
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,880
Alright, next

949
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,360
C: Your partner tries to save money

950
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:20,760
which makes your

951
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,600
experience with food, accommodation, and entertainment

952
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,720
very unsatisfactory

953
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,560
Xu hasn't raised his hand yet

954
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,600
No

955
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,240
Next

956
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,360
D: Your partner completely

957
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,240
does not acknowledge your efforts

958
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,960
and says they don't need them at all

959
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,280
I think I relate more to this one

960
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,640
That's Xu

961
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,960
Sometimes you

962
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,760
try hard to make the other person happy

963
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,200
but you've also experienced

964
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,880
that your efforts

965
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,080
are seen by some people as something you should do

966
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,160
which can actually feel a bit

967
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,600
unfair

968
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,920
Yes

969
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,000
I think so too

970
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Because a trip

971
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,600
and all the effort put into it

972
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,320
should come from both sides

973
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,520
Sometimes

974
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,040
it's not

975
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,360
just your problem alone

976
00:28:59,360 --> 00:28:59,640
Right

977
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,240
It could be

978
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,360
a problem created by both people

979
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,120
I think this is

980
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:05,400
I think this is

981
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,800
something that could really happen during this trip.

982
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,240
Something that actually happens.

983
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:08,680
Yes.

984
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,960
This is where everyone

985
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,200
has a different perspective.

986
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,840
Since everyone enjoys answering questions

987
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,800
so much,

988
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,400
why don't we

989
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,600
do another one, okay?

990
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,480
Okay.

991
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,040
This time, let's make the question a bit gentler.

992
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:19,840
Alright.

993
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,080
When do you usually

994
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,880
most want to travel with your partner?

995
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,440
A. On an anniversary

996
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,800
or on another

997
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,080
special occasion.

998
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,120
B

999
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,800
At the beginning of the relationship,

1000
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,920
you're more likely to want to travel together.

1001
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,480
Please raise your hand if you choose A.

1002
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,320
Those who choose B, please raise your hand.

1003
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,560
Chunye, you go first.

1004
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:51,200
I think the person I can travel with

1005
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,800
must already have a certain

1006
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,320
foundation with me.

1007
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,000
This foundation doesn't have to be very deep.

1008
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,520
Right, you travel a lot.

1009
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,560
But for me, it's impossible

1010
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,880
for an ordinary person to just

1011
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,760
just after meeting

1012
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,480
say, "Let's go,"

1013
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,800
and go out to have fun.

1014
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,440
Going out to have fun is fine.

1015
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,960
But not that kind of trip.

1016
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,400
Right.

1017
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:06,880
Because

1018
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,880
when a relationship just starts,

1019
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,200
maybe your relationship

1020
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,320
isn't that

1021
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,960
solid or doesn't have a clear direction yet.

1022
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,720
So it's even less likely

1023
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,160
that you'll reach the stage of having anniversaries.

1024
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,720
I wouldn't use traveling

1025
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,960
as a pure test.

1026
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,960
I'm exactly the same as her.

1027
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,280
For example, after I get a bit more familiar

1028
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,080
then we can travel together.

1029
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,360
Maybe some small issues

1030
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,400
won't be problems for me anymore.

1031
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:29,680
Right.

1032
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,560
I'm fine with anything.

1033
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:30,840
Yeah.

1034
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,240
But I think

1035
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,080
if we go as soon as we confirm,

1036
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,360
I might be a little worried

1037
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,480
that it might magnify (the flaws).

1038
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,960
I hope there's some trust.

1039
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,400
But from a guy's perspective,

1040
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,240
from a guy's perspective,

1041
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:41,560
it's like

1042
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,440
on anniversaries or

1043
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,240
other meaningful occasions,

1044
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,000
it gives me

1045
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,720
a reason to make this day

1046
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,600
different from

1047
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,040
other days.

1048
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,320
A reason to make it special.

1049
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,080
Because actually, every day

1050
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:50,880
is worth celebrating.

1051
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,360
But on these days, I feel like

1052
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:53,880
we can have

1053
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,640
a small reason,

1054
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,000
and then we can

1055
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
make this day

1056
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,200
a bit cuter

1057
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,360
or more interesting.

1058
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,720
Haitao is really good at

1059
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,840
maintaining relationships.

1060
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,360
He really values rituals.

1061
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,880
Next, let's ask the people who chose B.

1062
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,240
Let's ask Xu why he chose B.

1063
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,280
All you guys chose B.

1064
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:13,600
You

1065
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,560
The three guys

1066
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,800
What are you doing?

1067
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:20,840
I think

1068
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,000
traveling is actually a

1069
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,480
way to get to know each other better

1070
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,240
because usually, like on dates or whatever

1071
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,880
you can't really get to know someone that much

1072
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,120
I've actually experienced this before

1073
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,560
a friend brought his

1074
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,440
girlfriend

1075
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,000
and then we went to

1076
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,720
another place

1077
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,240
and it was a group of friends

1078
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,280
for example, we were at a swimming pool

1079
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,120
and we were having a barbecue

1080
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,240
and we were even worried

1081
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,080
that your girlfriend wasn't coming down to eat

1082
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,080
and wondered if she might be hungry

1083
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,720
and then his girlfriend

1084
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,240
maybe she was just in the room

1085
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,480
eating the buffet by herself

1086
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,320
my friend was actually pretty surprised

1087
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,080
I felt the same way as him

1088
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,120
I think sometimes it's just like that

1089
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,720
when people haven't defined their relationship

1090
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,640
and decide to travel together

1091
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,880
I think at the very beginning

1092
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,160
you can really get to know this person

1093
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,000
if during the trip

1094
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,520
you both feel it's not a good fit

1095
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,720
then just do your own thing

1096
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,680
but the mood just fades away

1097
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,680
No, that's not what you're saying

1098
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,640
that you have to be together the whole trip

1099
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,040
it's just creating a possibility

1100
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,640
Don't rush

1101
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,240
Actually, when I first saw this question,

1102
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,680
I didn't really feel much about it.

1103
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,960
Because I don't have time to travel.

1104
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,480
But then I thought about it.

1105
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,080
When would I actually want to travel?

1106
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,840
Honestly, neither option is something I really want to choose.

1107
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,200
Because when I want to go,

1108
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,760
I would ask the other person's opinion.

1109
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,440
So your option C is

1110
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,320
when everyone wants to go.

1111
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:33,760
That's the best time to travel.

1112
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,520
Just go.

1113
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,800
Because I think anniversaries

1114
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,240
Although

1115
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,640
I'm also someone who values rituals.

1116
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,560
But I don't want to turn anniversaries into

1117
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,080
a rigid routine that we have to follow every time.

1118
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,000
I feel the same way.

1119
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,200
I feel the same way too.

1120
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,720
Maybe it's fine at the beginning.

1121
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,720
But over time,

1122
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,280
it will definitely become a burden.

1123
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,720
And traveling together right at the start,

1124
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,000
I also think

1125
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,040
it's a good way to get to know each other better.

1126
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,160
But I also think it might be a bit too soon.

1127
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,800
But if I had to choose between the two,

1128
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,640
then option B,

1129
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,120
maybe just after meeting,

1130
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:02,720
traveling together,

1131
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,960
should also be

1132
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,320
a pretty interesting experience.

1133
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,480
We're using a trip as a way

1134
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,760
to bring everyone together.

1135
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,800
That way, there will be

1136
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,880
a little surprise.

1137
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,040
All of us

1138
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,840
actually, before coming here,

1139
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,840
each prepared something

1140
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,040
good to bring on the trip.

1141
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,400
So next,

1142
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,760
let's move right into our

1143
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,080
Favorite Travel Items Sharing Session.

1144
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,640
Our

1145
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,200
favorite travel items are already here.

1146
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,800
Everyone can pick for themselves.

1147
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,320
Can I trade with you?

1148
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,240
Sure, of course.

1149
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,800
There's a gift inside your gift.

1150
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,040
A gift within a gift.

1151
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,360
Let's see what it is.

1152
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,480
Time to open the gift.

1153
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,800
Dumbbells.

1154
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,240
Who gave such a great gift?

1155
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,240
Such good taste!

1156
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,360
This is actually quite practical.

1157
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,160
And it suits him well.

1158
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,920
But it's actually a bar of soap.

1159
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,360
Really.

1160
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,320
Don't you think that's kind of scary?

1161
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,800
I was just joking with him earlier,

1162
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,320
saying I was really going to give him a gift today.

1163
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,000
And he actually got my gift.

1164
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,520
Xu, why don't you come up?

1165
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,360
Feels like it should be a pretty awesome gift.

1166
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,360
Because it's really heavy.

1167
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,800
What?

1168
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,280
Slippers.

1169
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,840
That one is mine.

1170
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,200
This is yours.

1171
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,800
A wellness set.

1172
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,200
And a portable kettle.

1173
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,120
This one is pretty good.

1174
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,160
This one is quite nice too.

1175
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,320
This one can boil water by itself.

1176
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,240
It's more hygienic.

1177
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,920
And it's also more convenient to carry.

1178
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,760
So you're such a thoughtful person.

1179
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,920
Can't you tell?

1180
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,360
I need to think about it carefully.

1181
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,680
We have a whole season this time.

1182
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,160
What else?

1183
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,160
There's also those slippers.

1184
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,560
Are you going to use the slippers to hit him?

1185
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,120
To hit him.

1186
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,680
You can also use it to hit someone.

1187
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,640
If two people go shopping together,

1188
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,440
after walking all day, their feet will hurt.

1189
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,320
Then when he comes back,

1190
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,080
he can wear these slippers to relieve it.

1191
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,000
I thought you meant

1192
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,680
to massage acupoints.

1193
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,520
Let the boyfriend kneel as punishment.

1194
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,320
That works too.

1195
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,240
If he behaves well,

1196
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,400
it massages his acupoints.

1197
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,680
If he doesn't, it hits him.

1198
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:28,760
There's one more thing.

1199
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,920
That bag.

1200
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,520
This one?

1201
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,480
Yes.

1202
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,400
What is this?

1203
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,640
A foot soaking bucket.

1204
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:34,960
What's this?

1205
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,280
It's portable.

1206
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:37,760
Yes.

1207
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,160
I'm serious.

1208
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,160
I've really wanted to soak my feet lately.

1209
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,040
This is really

1210
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:42,960
because I heard that soaking your feet

1211
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,000
at night helps you sleep better.

1212
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,440
That's right.

1213
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,600
And if you sleep well,

1214
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,160
your energy and blood flow are better the next day.

1215
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,560
The main thing is,

1216
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,200
when you travel, you walk a lot.

1217
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:50,960
So you get tired.

1218
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,720
This is really a great gift.

1219
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,040
Where can I get hot water?

1220
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,960
I can fill it with hot water.

1221
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,160
I'll soak my feet right here.

1222
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,280
What is this?

1223
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,160
What is this?

1224
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,080
These are acupoint gloves.

1225
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,240
Because I don't really understand acupoints.

1226
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,200
But if you put those on,

1227
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,720
you'll know where you're feeling unwell today.

1228
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,000
You prepared so many things.

1229
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,960
There are also socks.

1230
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,640
There are socks here too.

1231
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,600
Yes, acupoint socks.

1232
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,480
You can press the acupoints.

1233
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,280
Young people these days really like health preservation.

1234
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,880
"Punk wellness."

1235
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,680
Actually, I don't really get it.

1236
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,600
But I still hope I can

1237
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,960
also be kind of

1238
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,400
healthy.

1239
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:22,640
Yeah.

1240
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,880
I feel like yours is probably

1241
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,080
the best of the day.

1242
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,760
Thank you.

1243
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:27,840
Sorry.

1244
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,520
I didn't know you guys were going for this style.

1245
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,040
So far, both of yours are really good.

1246
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,040
I'm so jealous.

1247
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,160
I wonder what mine will be.

1248
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,720
Yours definitely won't be bad either.

1249
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,760
This one is mine.

1250
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,200
It mainly depends on my explanation.

1251
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,400
What is this for?

1252
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,960
No, it's an armrest (pillow).

1253
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,800
Thank you.

1254
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,600
What is this?

1255
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,440
Give it to me, Tao.

1256
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,840
It’s for two hands.

1257
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,760
It’s for two people like this.

1258
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,120
This is how you use it.

1259
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,480
Each person puts in one hand.

1260
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,520
Hold hands inside it.

1261
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,560
What does that mean?

1262
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,360
Come on, let’s hold hands.

1263
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,920
Then I’ll use this hand, here.

1264
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,600
Each person holds one hand.

1265
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,160
Then walk around like this.

1266
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,760
Walk around like this.

1267
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,920
It’s for walking.

1268
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,040
Walk like this.

1269
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,640
Let’s go.

1270
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,440
So cute.

1271
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,480
This is pretty interesting.

1272
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:32,960
Let's hold hands.

1273
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,640
This is quite interesting.

1274
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,760
It's like, right now, at this very moment,

1275
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,600
imagine it.

1276
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,960
If we went out like this,

1277
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,960
wouldn't there be a lot of...

1278
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,120
I mean, we'd get a lot of attention.

1279
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:43,480
Yeah.

1280
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,280
Definitely.

1281
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,240
If you two went out together, you'd definitely turn heads.

1282
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,520
This set I have includes one thing—

1283
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,160
The name of that combo is really weird.

1284
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:52,720
It's called

1285
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,280
the "Sickeningly Sweet, No Apologies" combo.

1286
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,920
So, about this pillow—

1287
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,120
It's from those lyrics,

1288
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,120
like, "Without my arm as your pillow,"

1289
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,080
are you used to it?

1290
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:01,720
If you're not,

1291
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,760
then this pillow will keep you company.

1292
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,760
So, what does this mean?

1293
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,960
Usually, couples just hold hands on the street, right?

1294
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:09,880
But for me,

1295
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,240
I want our love to stand out more.

1296
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,680
Because I'm a passionate lover.

1297
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,240
I hope...

1298
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,960
Let the whole world know.

1299
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:16,760
And I hope

1300
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,160
everyone pays special attention to this.

1301
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,080
Just holding hands normally isn't enough

1302
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,200
to express what I mean by holding hands.

1303
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,760
I want it to be really eye-catching.

1304
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,280
When you see us

1305
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,520
holding hands in the shape of a heart,

1306
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,720
you mean

1307
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,800
he's mine.

1308
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,640
Right.

1309
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,040
I like that.

1310
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,680
Who gave this?

1311
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,600
This seems like mine.

1312
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,040
I gave a pair of gloves, and

1313
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,800
got a phone.

1314
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,360
A camera.

1315
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,560
A camera.

1316
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,520
CCD (camera).

1317
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,080
This is also related to my answer.

1318
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,880
It asks what kind of places you would go to.

1319
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,920
Actually, I prefer going to

1320
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,360
those less popular places,

1321
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,480
cooler spots.

1322
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,680
And most of the time,

1323
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,400
actually,

1324
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,240
I'm not that good at taking photos of us together.

1325
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,600
I'm better at taking photos of you.

1326
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,120
Of course.

1327
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:06,920
I can use film too.

1328
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,240
But I have to take the film back to develop it.

1329
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:08,640
Right.

1330
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,240
And sometimes when a phone tries to imitate

1331
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,200
CCD cameras or film cameras,

1332
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,120
it just doesn't feel the same.

1333
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,640
Yeah, something's missing.

1334
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,600
No matter how much noise you add,

1335
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,880
it still doesn't have that vibe.

1336
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,640
So it's better to just use the real thing.

1337
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,520
I'm seeing a new side of you.

1338
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,240
A different side.

1339
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:18,640
I didn't expect

1340
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,560
you would take photos for others.

1341
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,240
Let me tell you,

1342
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,280
I may seem like

1343
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,360
an impatient person,

1344
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,280
but I'm actually very attentive.

1345
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,760
Alright, my turn.

1346
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,200
What is this?

1347
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,320
A face mask.

1348
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,800
Whose is this?

1349
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:46,720
Mine.

1350
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,440
The teacher's.

1351
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,000
This is a mask that can be used for both warm compress

1352
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,240
and cold compress.

1353
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,240
So with this mask,

1354
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,160
when you use it warm,

1355
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,720
you can really relax.

1356
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,640
And get a good sleep.

1357
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,960
But when you use it cold,

1358
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,000
you can look great in photos.

1359
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:02,760
Thank you.

1360
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,280
Whose is this?

1361
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,480
Mine.

1362
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,480
Headphones

1363
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,160
Headphones

1364
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,280
I chose wired headphones.

1365
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,720
Two people can

1366
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,440
Two people can

1367
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,320
listen to music together.

1368
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,360
I still think

1369
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,640
that music is definitely

1370
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,320
essential when traveling.

1371
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,000
It might let you

1372
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,320
recall

1373
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,480
the scene from that moment.

1374
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,200
Also,

1375
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,920
sharing your favorite music

1376
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,000
with someone else

1377
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,840
I think is also a very romantic

1378
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,520
Yes, sometimes

1379
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,560
scents and music

1380
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,640
are things that can "transport" people

1381
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,760
like a "time machine."

1382
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,000
Sharing my music with you

1383
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,560
really is

1384
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,760
I get your point.

1385
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,360
Bro, that's brilliant.

1386
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:45,960
Absolutely brilliant.

1387
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:46,960
Awesome.

1388
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,720
My gift is just amazing.

1389
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,560
It's really great.

1390
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,720
Whose is it?

1391
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,560
It's mine.

1392
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,800
It's Teacher Haitao's.

1393
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,880
Look, what is this?

1394
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,800
So cute.

1395
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,840
What's this?

1396
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,120
Let me show everyone.

1397
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,840
I really like this.

1398
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,520
This is for singing, I think.

1399
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,280
No, I think it's lipstick.

1400
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,160
A game console.

1401
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,160
You can play games on it.

1402
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,520
But what's its most important function?

1403
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,280
It's a speaker.

1404
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,840
Not even close.

1405
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,920
And it's not just a speaker.

1406
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,280
It's also a

1407
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,200
microphone.

1408
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:49,520
And it's also a

1409
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,440
Look, I can even change my voice.

1410
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,240
Next, let's play a game together.

1411
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,720
Look, it can even sound like a doll.

1412
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,200
A doll! So fun.

1413
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,560
Every day is a happy day.

1414
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,400
Today, everyone is together.

1415
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,400
It's a really joyful island trip.

1416
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,040
Let me sing a song for everyone.

1417
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,920
Accompany you to see

1418
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,120
a meteor shower.

1419
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:16,600
Let's do it together.

1420
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,520
Let's go out.

1421
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,240
Thank you.

1422
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,600
Really.

1423
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,560
Let your tears

1424
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,160
come together.

1425
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,160
Who cares about you?

1426
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:34,960
Okay

1427
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,880
Each of us

1428
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,640
has received

1429
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,760
our travel

1430
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,920
must-have items

1431
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,760
So, as we talk about it

1432
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,200
it's time for us to travel too

1433
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,120
We're finally traveling

1434
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:43,680
Yes

1435
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,400
And this time

1436
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,320
we are

1437
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,280
starting our journey right from the beginning

1438
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,720
and meeting for the first time on this trip

1439
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,160
We

1440
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,760
on this exciting journey

1441
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,000
the first stop will be at our

1442
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,280
island

1443
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,080
Friends, this weekend

1444
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,880
all the guys and girls

1445
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,440
will put aside

1446
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,440
their work

1447
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,360
on the island

1448
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,200
and start

1449
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,600
a two-day vacation

1450
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,640
Just imagine, feeling the sea breeze

1451
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,040
as we gaze at the sunset

1452
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,160
along the horizon

1453
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,040
This feeling

1454
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,320
who wouldn't be moved?

1455
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,280
It feels so romantic

1456
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,400
So, what kind of romantic stories

1457
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,120
will happen between them?

1458
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:21,680
Without further ado

1459
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,480
let's first take a look at

1460
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,800
their first meeting on the island

1461
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,680
We're here

1462
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,880
Come on, let's watch

1463
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,840
Looking forward to it

1464
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,320
Curious

1465
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,360
Here we are.

1466
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,240
Really looking forward to this.

1467
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,880
The scenery in Zhejiang is beautiful.

1468
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:50,920
We’ve arrived.

1469
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,960
Speed up.

1470
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,760
Feels like we’re chasing the sunset.

1471
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:06,960
So beautiful.

1472
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,800
We’re having fun now.

1473
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,000
Let’s see who can swing higher.

1474
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:16,560
I feel like I’m on vacation.

1475
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,080
I feel like I’m on vacation.

1476
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,280
Even though we just met,

1477
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:19,960
it feels like everyone

1478
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,240
has known each other for a long time.

1479
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,680
This place is really nice this year.

1480
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,240
Hello.

1481
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,120
Hello.

1482
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,120
Hello.

1483
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:28,920
Hello.

1484
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,760
He looks like a comic book character.

1485
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,800
So beautiful.

1486
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:41,520
So beautiful.

1487
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,600
It looks amazing.

1488
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,120
So pretty.

1489
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,800
It feels so romantic.

1490
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,840
It has that feeling we talked about yesterday.

1491
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,120
That sparkling water feeling.

1492
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,000
Yeah.

1493
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,280
It's so comfortable here.

1494
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Did you expect to be invited today?

1495
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,880
It's the first time in my life someone has guessed me

1496
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:56,760
so accurately.

1497
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,560
I'm actually quite willing to step into

1498
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,480
the world of introverts.

1499
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,200
Break through that little glass barrier on the outside.

1500
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:00,640
Go in and take a look.

1501
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,560
Go in and take a look.

1502
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,800
He's only interested for a short while, but I'm not like that.

1503
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,000
Then today I can also take a look at you.

1504
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,320
