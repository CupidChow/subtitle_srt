1
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,400
A place for singing

2
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,520
And there's a barbecue grill

3
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,480
I didn't see you today

4
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:47,840
I didn't see you today

5
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,520
I wonder what you did today

6
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,800
If it's not yours

7
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,600
Don't force it anymore

8
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,360
You come

9
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,880
This is just too much of a coincidence

10
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,920
Have you made up your mind
these past two days

11
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,880
about your feelings?

12
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,480
I don't know

13
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,800
Do you think feelings matter more,
or spending time together?

14
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,080
I think being together means

15
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,120
one percent of that spark

16
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,120
and ninety-nine percent of getting along

17
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,080
So do you lean one way or the other

18
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,120
Honestly, I have no idea right now

19
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,880
I'm really confused at the moment

20
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,200
What do you think

21
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:26,520
What do you think

22
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,680
Do you think it's too late now

23
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,200
The best time to plant a tree

24
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,080
was ten years ago

25
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,600
The next best time is now

26
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,120
I think it's fine

27
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,320
I don't think it's too late

28
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,080
I just react a bit slowly sometimes

29
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,000
But I

30
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,040
will try to change myself

31
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,920
Yu Xing is picking up the pace now

32
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,040
But actually, Chichi has already

33
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,760
But actually, Chichi has already

34
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,160
Still, Yu Xing's effort and growth

35
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,720
are worth recognizing

36
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,760
Yes, it's obvious

37
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,480
Wang Lechen

38
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,240
Is it really that hard to be brave

39
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,040
for you?

40
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,400
I can't believe this is our biggest difference

41
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,840
Then you didn't understand

42
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,920
what I meant

43
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,080
Sorry

44
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,360
I'll bow to you in a bit

45
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,680
Alright, I'm happy now

46
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,440
And there's a puppy following us

47
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,800
Then the two of us run together

48
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,560
"Idol drama"

49
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,560
It's exactly like that

50
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,600
Youth is wonderful

51
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,400
Really

52
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,880
Why do I suddenly feel

53
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,840
like I'm watching a teen romance movie

54
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,720
Everything is just so beautiful

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,880
Are we driving out to have fun

56
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,320
I think so

57
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,560
Two cars

58
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,120
How do we drive

59
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,400
I'll drive, I'll take one

60
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,240
I'll drive this one

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,760
What?

62
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,760
I'll take the white one

63
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,840
I like white

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,080
Then you come with me

65
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,040
I'll go with you

66
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,000
Sure

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,080
(Jiao Ge) gave in

68
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,520
Yeah

69
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,680
Jiao Zhiheng probably already gets it

70
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,640
He definitely understands

71
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,080
I'll go in the white car too

72
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,480
You stay here

73
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,240
I'll stay here

74
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:47,800
Red

75
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,480
Red with green

76
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:49,880
Let's just stay here

77
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,400
Darn it

78
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,560
Sit down

79
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,960
Turn on the AC for a bit first

80
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,400
Raise it a little later

81
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,080
It's fine right now

82
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,600
Not cold

83
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,200
Duoduo is really something

84
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,440
I feel

85
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,680
Actually, I could sit over there

86
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,280
Really

87
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,360
I think that's fine too

88
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,880
It's crowded

89
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,080
Not crowded, I'll go over there

90
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,080
If you sleep on the way, I'll be bored

91
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,680
I won't sleep, I'll talk with you

92
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,160
No, you two talk

93
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,440
You two talk

94
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,560
I won't talk, I don't want to

95
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,640
Ran off

96
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,880
I'm here, I really am

97
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,440
I'm so uncomfortable, I don't want this

98
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,600
You still came

99
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,200
I want to come over here

100
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,480
Rear passengers, please fasten your seatbelts

101
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,000
Okay

102
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,560
So they must be

103
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,000
the ones from

104
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,920
the sunset date, right?

105
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,520
I guess

106
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,800
Because it's about that time

107
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,080
They're probably from yesterday's

108
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,080
sunset date

109
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,960
Makes sense

110
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,080
Let's go

111
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,200
We're off

112
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:07,800
Let's go

113
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,480
You're looking at me

114
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,400
Looking at the view, and

115
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,240
accidentally glanced at you

116
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,840
Those two really

117
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,680
are beautiful

118
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,040
But I just blocked the light

119
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,480
Blocked the light

120
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,440
What does that mean

121
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,800
No place to put my hands

122
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,280
Getting nervous

123
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,400
Driving and riding at the same time

124
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,040
No place to put my hands

125
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,680
Are you saying

126
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,000
you want to hold hands

127
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,080
When you weren't here yesterday

128
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,880
I kept wondering

129
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,920
what you were doing

130
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,040
wanted to know what you were eating

131
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,000
if you were having fun or not

132
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,400
Eating tea eggs

133
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,840
And jianbing guozi

134
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,120
Yesterday's jianbing guozi was pretty good too

135
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,000
There was preserved vegetable in the wrap

136
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,720
Did you try the Jinyun Baked Cake last time

137
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,440
Lechen brought it

138
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:38,960
Lechen brought it

139
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,960
I didn't get to try it

140
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,920
Didn't try it

141
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,600
The Jinyun Baked Cake also has preserved vegetable inside

142
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,520
Then I should like it

143
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,720
I've wanted to bring it to you for a long time

144
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,040
Their conversations are always so everyday

145
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,600
I got bitten by so many mosquitoes yesterday.

146
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,440
They're everywhere.

147
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,000
Did what I gave you yesterday help?

148
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,160
My face isn't swollen on this side now.

149
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,080
Right?

150
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,920
Yeah.

151
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,560
Glad I rushed off the highway to buy it.

152
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,640
Duoduo, are you surprised?

153
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,400
What are you looking at?

154
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:28,960
You.

155
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,920
Why are you looking at me?

156
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,080
I just like looking at you.

157
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,080
I don't care, I just like looking.

158
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,720
Why does that sound so familiar?

159
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,160
Sounds like something you'd say.

160
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,600
Yeah.

161
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,400
I don't care, I just like looking.

162
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,080
Bold.

163
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,280
Get out.

164
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,240
This place is amazing, really amazing.

165
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,480
Go straight, just keep going forward.

166
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,880
Are we driving this car?

167
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,600
We can.

168
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,960
Yes, we can explore the garden today.

169
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,160
Let me see how to drive it.

170
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,400
I brought something for everyone.

171
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,920
Kang Shifu Sugar-Free Jasmine Tea.

172
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,600
We can drink it while we play.

173
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,800
Thanks, that's so thoughtful.

174
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,840
Cheers!

175
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,080
Have a great trip.

176
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,360
It smells so fresh.

177
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,800
And it's zero sugar, so no guilt.

178
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,480
Today's weather—

179
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,080
is perfect for this rich floral scent.

180
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,280
Jasmine and green tea blend just right.

181
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:40,960
It's so pure.

182
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,680
Let's go, then.

183
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,320
Let's go.

184
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,000
Go.

185
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,640
Let's go, we're off!

186
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,640
Feeling happy now.

187
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,600
Let me take a cool photo of you.

188
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,440
Like, from behind.

189
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,040
Sitting up straight.

190
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,680
Duoduo and the others are so fast.

191
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,160
Can you speed up, Jiao Ge?

192
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,800
I really did speed up.

193
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,760
Really?

194
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,880
Really, I'll show you.

195
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,840
It's turned all the way up.

196
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,440
They're both super cute too.

197
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,400
The car we drove on day one was better.

198
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:24,800
Fast.

199
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,360
Fast.

200
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,160
What are you guys doing?

201
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,040
What does that mean?

202
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,640
Giving you a full 360 degrees.

203
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,440
Getting a bit dizzy.

204
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,280
Who's dizzy?

205
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,160
Watching you makes me dizzy.

206
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,840
I'm about to get dizzy too.

207
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,000
We're sailing now.

208
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,840
Feels so good.

209
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,800
Speed up, Jiao Ge!

210
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,080
Dr. Fang.

211
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,200
Dr. Fang.

212
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,880
Take a photo of us with your phone.

213
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,440
Okay.

214
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,960
Sure. Is it easy to take?

215
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,360
Yeah, it's easy.

216
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,240
Okay.

217
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,040
I'll keep this speed then.

218
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,360
I think Herry (Zihan)

219
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
they're almost here.

220
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,280
That's way too fast.

221
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,520
Feels like they're driving

222
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,240
the adult version.

223
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,280
We're in the kids' version.

224
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,240
Okay.

225
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,400
We're the first to arrive.

226
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,360
Okay.

227
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,280
Arrived first.

228
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,640
Let's go inside and find a place to sit.

229
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,080
Sit here.

230
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,800
It's really hot today.

231
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,960
Did you guys talk about anything yesterday?

232
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,840
He's so smart.

233
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,240
He tried to get info from her.

234
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,240
I knew you'd ask.

235
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,360
You did it yourself.

236
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,200
You said you wanted to do it.

237
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,320
Saying what you want is enough, right?

238
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,080
Just follow your heart, that's enough.

239
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,320
I'm just following my own heart.

240
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,800
I mainly feel

241
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,040
I've really broken through since coming here.

242
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,800
You—

243
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,440
Because before, I was probably

244
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,080
someone who moved quickly.

245
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,040
Yeah.

246
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,800
I think until the very last moment,

247
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,720
you just don't know.

248
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,600
I think people

249
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,840
can change.

250
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,160
I think you can relax a bit.

251
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,280
Just enjoy life in the house first.

252
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,920
Because it's ending soon.

253
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,200
Cherish the time in the house.

254
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,800
Yeah, cherish it.

255
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,280
I really do cherish it.

256
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,360
I think going out with everyone

257
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,360
is really nice too.

258
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,600
Of course.

259
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,520
Have fun.

260
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,240
Have fun.

261
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,240
It's so hot, like I just showered.

262
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,760
Chasing the sunset.

263
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,360
Okay.

264
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,160
Go, chase, let's start chasing.

265
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,680
Chasing the sunset.

266
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,000
So beautiful.

267
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,400
So pretty.

268
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,520
It was stunning as soon as we came in.

269
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,560
So pretty.

270
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,720
Duoduo and I want a photo together.

271
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,120
Okay.

272
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,960
Three, two, one.

273
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,640
So good-looking, seriously "help!"

274
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,720
Great photo.

275
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,200
So sweet.

276
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,040
So sweet.

277
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,240
Then I'll do this.

278
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,360
Then I don't want it.

279
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:52,840
Then you don't want it, right.

280
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,480
Then I don't want it.

281
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,080
Yeah.

282
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,640
Three, two, one.

283
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,320
So good-looking.

284
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,120
Zihan doesn't seem happy.

285
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,440
Missing Chichi.

286
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,880
Such a beautiful scene,

287
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,240
but the person you want isn't here.

288
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,000
It still feels a bit lonely.

289
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,480
Feels like nothing matters anymore.

290
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,520
Yeah, even the prettiest view isn't pretty.

291
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,400
Zihan, you can go outside.

292
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,000
Zihan, let's go.

293
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,360
Yifan, come a bit closer.

294
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:36,920
Okay, I'll move closer.

295
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,360
Come on.

296
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,400
Then I'll join those two.

297
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,520
Alright, sure, come on.

298
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,280
Do you like this kind of vibe?

299
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,240
It's pretty calm.

300
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:45,800
Yeah.

301
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,240
Let's take two more.

302
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,560
I like it.

303
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,800
Love it.

304
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,680
We've arrived at Qiandao Lake.

305
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,400
Zihan.

306
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,280
Hello.

307
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,320
Hi.

308
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,960
Is he recording this for Chichi?

309
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,840
That's possible.

310
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,240
Should we take a group photo?

311
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,360
Because the sun's setting soon.

312
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,560
Zihan.

313
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,440
Zihan.

314
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,680
The one with the longest arms is here.

315
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,880
The longest arms are here.

316
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,560
You can hold it backwards.

317
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,000
No.

318
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,440
Yeah.

319
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,680
It's fine.

320
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,000
Still looking cool.

321
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,640
Three, two, one.

322
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,040
Looks great.

323
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,720
Looks nice.

324
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,280
The sun has set.

325
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,840
Dusk.

326
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,400
So beautiful.

327
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,040
It really looks amazing.

328
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,640
It's gorgeous.

329
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,320
Sometimes sunsets feel a bit bittersweet.

330
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,960
So do you prefer sunset or sunrise?

331
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,160
Sunset.

332
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,320
The evening sun is always stunning.

333
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,480
But it's close to dusk.

334
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,360
If it's between sunset and sunrise,

335
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,360
which do you like more?

336
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,080
I prefer sunset.

337
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,280
Because sunrise means waking up too early.

338
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,440
It's way too early.

339
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,000
I knew it.

340
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,040
I'm talking romance with you,

341
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,320
and you're talking biology.

342
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:49,840
Then guess.

343
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,680
Guess if I prefer sunrise or sunset.

344
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,120
I think you're an early riser.

345
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,640
You probably like sunrise.

346
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,040
I am whoever I like.

347
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,680
Whatever she likes to watch, I like too.

348
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,680
So annoying.

349
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,520
Aren't you seriously asking?

350
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,760
He just wanted to say that.

351
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,080
Expert.

352
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,560
To be honest.

353
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,760
I really got into this.

354
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,040
Impressive.

355
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,320
Zihan's mindset is basically

356
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,360
What is Chichi doing?

357
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,120
How are they doing?

358
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,960
What are they talking about?

359
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:18,920
No matter how beautiful the view,

360
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,400
if you're not with someone you like,

361
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,920
even beauty feels meaningless.

362
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,880
Even the prettiest view isn't pretty.

363
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,280
He's afraid he's too late.

364
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:24,960
But honestly,

365
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,840
he doesn't need to worry so much.

366
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,000
Looking at it now,

367
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,920
Zihan really seems like

368
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,160
he's going through a stress test.

369
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,480
Just to see how much

370
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,360
he can handle

371
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,160
how much of this

372
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,040
limit he can take.

373
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,040
He has to hang in there.

374
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,440
I'm thinking about something.

375
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,880
Why didn't Duoduo share with him?

376
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,000
That night,

377
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,640
Chichi told her something.

378
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,960
Because if she said it,

379
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,200
Zihan might have felt a bit

380
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,760
But I think

381
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,160
Duoduo's answer

382
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,160
I really like it.

383
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,360
Just because she's Duoduo.

384
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,880
She wouldn't do things like

385
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,920
disrupting others' pace.

386
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,120
Yeah.

387
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,680
Everyone has their own rhythm.

388
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,240
It's not necessary.

389
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,640
She doesn't need to do that.

390
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,320
Like, if I

391
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,320
know something,

392
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,280
I pass it on to you,

393
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:00,880
that kind of thing

394
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,440
isn't right for Chichi either.

395
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,880
But her answer

396
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,320
was really spot-on.

397
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,880
She said, "Just relax and be yourself."

398
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,640
She actually

399
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,720
got the message

400
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,920
across in a clever way.

401
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,800
She did get it across.

402
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,920
And Zihan thought he had no chance then.

403
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,080
What Duoduo told him was,

404
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,640
"This isn't the final moment."

405
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,080
Meaning, you haven't reached

406
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,800
the point where it's totally over.

407
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:21,640
Yeah.

408
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,440
Took the last of the fruit.

409
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,600
Took it all.

410
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,360
All gone.

411
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,280
Can you cut this pineapple?

412
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,240
Right, I'll go ask at the front desk.

413
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,520
Could you help us cut it?

414
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:37,960
Sorry to trouble you.

415
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,520
Thanks for your effort.

416
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,280
Thank you for your help.

417
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,080
Thank you for your help.

418
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,920
Thank you.

419
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:41,920
Okay.

420
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,880
Thanks for your hard work.

421
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,800
Waiting eagerly.

422
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,280
When are they coming?

423
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,520
Do you want to look out?

424
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,600
I'll take a look.

425
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,680
They're back.

426
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,160
Hello.

427
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,520
What are you doing?

428
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,080
I had a feeling you were coming.

429
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,280
So I came out.

430
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,640
Just waiting for the two of us.

431
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,640
Are we the last ones?

432
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,240
No.

433
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,080
We just happened to come out.

434
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,520
Yeah.

435
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,400
Really?

436
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,360
Really, it's true.

437
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,320
It really is true.

438
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,280
They're back.

439
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,720
You must be starving.

440
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,760
Hello.

441
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,640
Come on.

442
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:19,840
Dinner's ready.

443
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,640
Finally, we can...

444
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,560
Start eating, right?

445
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,720
Let's eat.

446
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,000
Now we can relax and eat.

447
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,880
Is there something you want to say to me?

448
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,120
I haven't thought of it yet.

449
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,120
Just keeps nodding.

450
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:49,800
It's because you came.

451
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,880
We can finally eat.

452
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,240
Yeah.

453
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,160
We're really happy.

454
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,800
So now we can...

455
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,400
Start eating.

456
00:18:59,400 --> 00:18:59,920
Alright.

457
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,120
Let's dig in.

458
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,440
Try the beef first, right?

459
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,360
Chichi, do you want this?

460
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,040
This is braised beef.

461
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,120
No, thanks.

462
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,080
It's really crispy.

463
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,720
Chichi, do you want this fried rice?

464
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,240
Rejected twice.

465
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,400
Do you want some?

466
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:37,920
It's delicious.

467
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,760
Thank you.

468
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,320
Better skip the fish soup.

469
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,240
Don't try it.

470
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,440
It's just very strong-tasting.

471
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,680
Some people might not be used to it.

472
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,360
Eating this, the mood's not great.

473
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:24,960
Yeah.

474
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,920
There's fried rice over here.

475
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,400
Anyone want some rice?

476
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,440
Just raise your hand.

477
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,080
Okay.

478
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:38,840
Or...

479
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,480
You can tell me later if you want.

480
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:42,960
I'm really hungry.

481
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,960
No wonder, you drove back and forth.

482
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,400
Thank you.

483
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,040
Where did you go?

484
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,800
We went to an amusement park this afternoon.

485
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,800
And watched the sunset.

486
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,520
Where?

487
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,600
On the deck.

488
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:01,880
What about you?

489
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,680
What did you two do?

490
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,000
Rode a hot air balloon.

491
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,040
Rode a hot air balloon.

492
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,480
Off to romantic Turkey.

493
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,120
That look.

494
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,400
So how long were you up there?

495
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,000
Stayed until...

496
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,560
The sun set behind the mountains.

497
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,560
Was it hot up there?

498
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,040
No, it was cool.

499
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,600
The breeze was really refreshing.

500
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,440
The lawn was really comfortable.

501
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,280
Kind of like...

502
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,120
A golf course lawn.

503
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,480
And there were people there...

504
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,400
Taking golf promo photos.

505
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,880
What is Zihan thinking now?

506
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,840
Want to go upstairs with me?

507
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,320
Sure.

508
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,160
Let's go up.

509
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,680
Okay.

510
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,880
We're about done eating, right?

511
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,080
Pretty much.

512
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,160
Me too.

513
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,280
So let's...

514
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,600
Head out.

515
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,120
Let's go.

516
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:29,920
What's wrong?

517
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,840
So anxious.

518
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,760
Were you happy today?

519
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,440
I...

520
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,040
I talked with Yu Xing today.

521
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,000
And then...

522
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,920
But I still feel...

523
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,960
What I told him is...

524
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,600
I still think it's getting late.

525
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,800
Because I feel really tired.

526
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,480
Interacting with him...

527
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,920
Is pretty exhausting.

528
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,320
I don't know...

529
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,840
How to think about these things.

530
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,440
He's kind of out of order.

531
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,480
And you might be straightforward.

532
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,040
Some people are even backwards.

533
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,360
I'm chasing possibilities with the outcome in hand.

534
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,160
You described it perfectly.

535
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,880
But I still feel there's not enough time.

536
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,360
Can't really tell.

537
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,000
It's just...

538
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,360
Whether I can really...

539
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,000
Enter a close relationship.

540
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,280
But if you really care...

541
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,280
About whether you can be in a close relationship,

542
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,600
You have to...

543
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,600
Think for yourself.

544
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,040
In a close relationship,

545
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,840
What do you want?

546
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,600
And what was your original intention?

547
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,240
What do you really feel inside?

548
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,280
Then do just that.

549
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,080
I'm going out to sit for a while.

550
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,560
Me too.

551
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,080
Let's go.

552
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,640
There's someone over there.

553
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,440
Looks like it's Herry.

554
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,160
I remember he was wearing shorts.

555
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:18,960
Ran into him.

556
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,440
Where are you headed?

557
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,480
I want to find a spot

558
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,320
to sit by myself.

559
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,120
There.

560
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,080
Or maybe there.

561
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,600
Or there's another place.

562
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,160
I'll show you.

563
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:28,800
Where?

564
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:29,640
The lobby.

565
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,720
Actually, there's a

566
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,920
sensor window there.

567
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,840
Once you open it,

568
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,960
there's a

569
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,320
seat outside.

570
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,640
By the bar.

571
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,000
I'll go take a look around.

572
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,240
Okay.

573
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,560
Ran into you here again.

574
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,720
What a coincidence.

575
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,520
You two talk.

576
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,200
Where are you going, Chichi?

577
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,760
Where are you going?

578
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,720
I'm just stepping out.

579
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,240
Darn it, what now?

580
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,960
"Help!"

581
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,600
Are you about to fall asleep?

582
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,760
She went to find Zihan.

583
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,600
Guys,

584
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,600
she went to find Zihan.

585
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,280
This is the first time in ages

586
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,160
she's actually

587
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,560
taken the initiative to find Zihan.

588
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,560
She must've really thought it through

589
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,960
before doing this.

590
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,440
Are you about to fall asleep?

591
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,120
I just dozed off.

592
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,240
So tired.

593
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,640
What will she talk about?

594
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,560
I'm so sleepy today.

595
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,360
Today's (three strengths)

596
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,720
Three strengths.

597
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,720
Got it.

598
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,440
At this moment,

599
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,560
If you say this now,

600
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,000
He's really impressive.

601
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,600
How was today?

602
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,080
Today was

603
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,400
pretty good.

604
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,040
Basically just went

605
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,600
Tired?

606
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:40,880
Not tired.

607
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:41,760
Not tired.

608
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,920
You don't seem yourself today.

609
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,800
Mostly because I drove a lot.

610
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,920
Did you really drive all day?

611
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,320
Would ask.

612
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,400
Why ask that?

613
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,520
Because last night I felt

614
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,800
something was off with you.

615
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,720
Do you have any questions?

616
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,680
Can I just say whatever I want?

617
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,520
You can just say it.

618
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,880
It's fine.

619
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,440
Just say whatever you want.

620
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,120
What do you think of Yu Xing?

621
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,520
Look at him,

622
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,680
That's a great question.

623
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,000
Really well asked.

624
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,680
That's just

625
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,000
Yeah, just straightforward.

626
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,880
It saves a lot of trouble.

627
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,680
What do you think of Yu Xing?

628
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,400
I honestly don't know him well.

629
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,720
Do you think you know me?

630
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,120
Herry.

631
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,480
Still asks questions.

632
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,280
I think

633
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,720
I know you pretty well.

634
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,320
I'm happy now.

635
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:27,800
Zihan.

636
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,280
Honestly, I didn't expect

637
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,880
you'd choose me

638
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,720
right from the start.

639
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I thought you'd get to know more people.

640
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,040
I chose one person firmly because

641
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,680
I don't like being chosen.

642
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,600
So,

643
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,120
I don't want

644
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,840
others to feel

645
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,640
the way I do.

646
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,920
Telling you I'm upset.

647
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,880
I don't want you to feel bad either.

648
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,680
Yeah.

649
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,600
I don't want to choose.

650
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,520
I don't want to be chosen.

651
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:22,680
Right.

652
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,280
So maybe before,

653
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,280
my thoughts on this

654
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,240
were too strong.

655
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,320
And then

656
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,600
there were some

657
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,040
things that got a bit serious.

658
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,120
Do you feel like you're being yourself?

659
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,480
I think this is truly me.

660
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,880
Whatever I do, that's who I am.

661
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,520
Really?

662
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,400
Yes, really.

663
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,320
Honestly, I think I'm pretty accepting.

664
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,800
I don't have any major conflicts, I feel.

665
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,760
I'm very relaxed.

666
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:02,720
No matter how others are,

667
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,320
I can go along and do things with them.

668
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,320
Are you a people-pleaser?

669
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,320
Are you avoidant?

670
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,440
So direct, huh?

671
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,960
Am I?

672
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,800
I think maybe a little.

673
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,120
Seriously?

674
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,320
Am I?

675
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,200
I think so, a bit.

676
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,440
I don't think so.

677
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,360
You don't think so?

678
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,760
What does "people-pleaser" mean?

679
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,000
It means being nice to everyone.

680
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,040
Just to everyone—

681
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,520
kind.

682
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,160
Because I really feel

683
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,520
you get along with everyone

684
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,160
in a very harmonious way.

685
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,880
But my kindness to friends

686
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,400
is only within the friend zone.

687
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,160
They don't get any extra favoritism.

688
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,000
I can spend time with friends every day,

689
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,920
like, say, twenty-four hours.

690
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,840
I give friends two hours.

691
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,360
But the rest

692
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,000
like you said, originally,

693
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,280
twelve or fourteen hours are

694
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,200
spent with my partner.

695
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,120
That's

696
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,920
special treatment.

697
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,680
What do you think?

698
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,240
Is that all you want to ask?

699
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,080
Then you'll get a definite answer.

700
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,240
This kind of talk is so comfortable.

701
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,080
So sweet.

702
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,080
You get me again.

703
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,760
Every sentence has

704
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,200
a clear answer.

705
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,120
It's not just throwing out questions.

706
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,160
I ask back in return.

707
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,600
No wasted words.

708
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,800
You mentioned unfairness to me before.

709
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,280
It's okay.

710
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,440
I think

711
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,120
that's just how it is.

712
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,240
People enter our lives in order.

713
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,680
Anyway, I feel

714
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,800
I just need to do my best.

715
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,280
As long as my conscience is clear.

716
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,080
Like you said the other day,

717
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,720
enjoy the process.

718
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,240
That's pretty important.

719
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,000
So you agree with what I said?

720
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Actually, yesterday

721
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,400
I realized something

722
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,520
that really helped me.

723
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,440
It's that

724
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,560
when you

725
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,360
decide something will end badly,

726
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,800
all the evidence you find

727
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,400
will just confirm

728
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,600
that it's a bad outcome.

729
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,680
So I think

730
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,720
you don't have much pressure.

731
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,840
Just make up your mind.

732
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:21,760
Me—

733
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,840
I'm actually under a lot of pressure.

734
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,040
It's fine.

735
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,120
For us,

736
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,600
I can accept it all.

737
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,120
We all have to learn to make peace with ourselves.

738
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,000
Today, when I saw the sunset,

739
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,360
I thought

740
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,880
first, it's a bit sad.

741
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,240
Because they say sunsets are beautiful,

742
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,440
but they're close to dusk.

743
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,320
It means the day is ending.

744
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,240
But then,

745
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,360
after the sunset,

746
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,960
there's the beautiful blue hour.

747
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,840
And after the blue hour,

748
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,840
there's the starry sky.

749
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,080
After the stars fade,

750
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:11,840
there will be

751
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,280
the sunrise.

752
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,800
Every moment

753
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,400
has its own beautiful view.

754
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,320
Scenery.

755
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,640
So there's no need

756
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,800
to be sad when something ends.

757
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,280
Because when one thing ends,

758
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,320
something else begins.

759
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:28,880
Right.

760
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,480
As long as you know

761
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,400
how to find joy, that's enough.

762
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,240
But honestly,

763
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,480
I really want to ride a hot air balloon.

764
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,040
Come on.

765
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,760
Come on.

766
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,080
Why?

767
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,480
Wasn't the balloon high today?

768
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,160
So if it's not high, you can—

769
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,000
High is not okay.

770
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,560
I can't handle heights.

771
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,040
Just remembered I'm a bit afraid of heights.

772
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,960
You just realized you're afraid of heights?

773
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,760
I just remembered the vibe.

774
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,160
You know?

775
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,000
But up there, I might really start shaking.

776
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,440
What does "shaking" feel like?

777
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,760
Like your legs tremble.

778
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,280
Will they really shake?

779
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,000
I don't know.

780
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,760
No idea.

781
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,160
I want to go too.

782
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,800
Go up and shake a little.

783
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,760
I want to try it too.

784
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,680
Find a chance.

785
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,760
The wind is back.

786
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,560
The wind blew my worries away again.

787
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,480
These two are actually a great match.

788
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,080
This feels so comfortable.

789
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,440
Suddenly, it feels like—

790
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,960
Both of them are really charming.

791
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,360
Because every word Zihan says

792
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,480
is always answered so directly.

793
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,280
I think there's something that hits home.

794
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,280
It's not just that he

795
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,320
answers your questions,

796
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:46,960
he can also

797
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,800
resolve

798
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,240
some of your emotions.

799
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,480
Yeah.

800
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,160
It's okay, when something ends,

801
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,600
there's still the stars and the blue hour.

802
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,560
That makes me feel like

803
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,160
I've tossed all that away over there,

804
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,320
and you can just hold onto

805
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,560
that feeling.

806
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,560
I think this kind of thing

807
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,640
is actually really important for girls.

808
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,400
And he always says, "It's fine."

809
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,320
"I can accept it all."

810
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:04,960
That's a

811
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,840
very comfortable way.

812
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,080
When talking with you,

813
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:07,880
"I like you,"

814
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,920
"but don't feel pressured."

815
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,240
And his little jealous moments,

816
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,240
he shows them too.

817
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,800
Honestly, I really want to ride a hot air balloon too.

818
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,280
Just—

819
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,920
It's pretty straightforward.

820
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,560
I really like it.

821
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,840
I think Zihan is more sensitive.

822
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,120
Because he can sense Chichi's sensitivity,

823
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,280
and even beyond that,

824
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,480
he gives Chichi the security she needs.

825
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,320
He gives her energy.

826
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,280
Yeah, I think

827
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,840
meeting someone who recharges you

828
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,680
is really rare.

829
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,960
What I've learned is that

830
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,000
most people, when faced with this,

831
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,800
might get negative,

832
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,880
might complain.

833
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,360
Yeah.

834
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,400
But Zihan does the opposite.

835
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,280
He can even

836
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,000
have such a high-quality conversation.

837
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,200
That's really rare.

838
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,000
Wait a second.

839
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,040
You're blocking that—

840
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:54,800
the camera.

841
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,760
Don't rush.

842
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,440
Get a little closer.

843
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,960
Turn your right cheek, then—

844
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,320
How did you end up making yourself laugh?

845
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,040
You've taken ten shots already, right?

846
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,800
Yeah.

847
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,320
They're all of us.

848
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,640
We love taking photos together.

849
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,640
I really like this.

850
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,080
What's she thinking?

851
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:42,720
Hello.

852
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,600
Let's go.

853
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,680
You even got my cup ready.

854
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,000
Look, I made you a drink.

855
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,920
What did you make?

856
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,760
Something hard to describe.

857
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,640
What?

858
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,400
"Poison."

859
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,320
Come on, let's go watch the stars over there.

860
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,120
Okay.

861
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,280
Where should we sit?

862
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,480
Right here.

863
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,400
I got this ready for you.

864
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,200
Thank you.

865
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,600
You can try yours first.

866
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,160
You—

867
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,360
Watch your expression.

868
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,120
Hurry up—

869
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,600
Take a big sip.

870
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,400
Then try mine.

871
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,720
Mine tastes good.

872
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,880
We can swap the lids.

873
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,120
This one's good.

874
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:57,800
Okay.

875
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,040
This is really awful.

876
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,280
So I poured mine first.

877
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,720
I thought it would taste good.

878
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,400
I put a lot of effort into it, okay?

879
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:13,840
I can feel it.

880
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,320
It's delicious.

881
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,200
It's delicious.

882
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,200
There's a star.

883
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,320
I just saw several stars.

884
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,960
Just look up there.

885
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,080
That's the Lynx constellation.

886
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,800
That's Leo over there.

887
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,400
Okay, I see it.

888
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,480
Look at this.

889
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,760
Then look at the brightest star.

890
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,600
What's it called again?

891
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,280
Hold it and look.

892
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:44,920
I just—

893
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,080
Checked, but I don't see Sagittarius.

894
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,560
Xiao Yuan is a Sagittarius.

895
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,920
What's that one?

896
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,080
The Milky Way is over there.

897
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,480
The Milky Way is over there.

898
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,080
It hasn't risen yet.

899
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,800
That one's beautiful.

900
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,560
Is Pegasus Sagittarius?

901
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,280
Tap over and check.

902
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,600
Tap over and check.

903
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,240
Seems not.

904
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,600
No.

905
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,320
Still not showing.

906
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:18,840
No.

907
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,040
Good things take time.

908
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,080
She's so eloquent.

909
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,680
After your time in the house,

910
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,200
After your time in the house,

911
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,280
is there anything you really want to do?

912
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,440
Really want to.

913
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,320
Go traveling.

914
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,800
Go traveling.

915
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,320
Have you decided where?

916
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,720
To Inner Mongolia.

917
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,400
What for, to ride horses?

918
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,920
I want to see the grasslands in Inner Mongolia.

919
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:55,720
What's wrong?

920
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,560
Today's grassland isn't enough?

921
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,520
It's enough.

922
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,400
Don't like it.

923
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:02,960
I like it.

924
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,520
I like it.

925
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,040
How nice.

926
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,960
I think you have to go while you're young.

927
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,520
Because—

928
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,840
The scenery you see at twenty

929
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,800
and at thirty

930
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,440
is really different.

931
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,960
Take me, for example—

932
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,920
I'm probably a bit like

933
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,200
living in the moment.

934
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,240
Like, for instance,

935
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,320
if I want to go somewhere today,

936
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,680
if time and circumstances allow,

937
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,440
then I'll definitely go.

938
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,000
So right now, your

939
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,760
view on money is

940
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,920
about spending ahead of your means?

941
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,440
No, I really haven't

942
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,120
done that in a long time.

943
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,400
But I used to spend way too much.

944
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,880
People often say that I'm

945
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,880
a real spendthrift by nature.

946
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,080
Spendthrift.

947
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,480
Spendthrift.

948
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,040
I've accepted it now.

949
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,200
Everyone calls me a spendthrift.

950
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:06,920
You too.

951
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,520
Darn it, the two of us...

952
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,280
So who gets the money?

953
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,240
Who manages the money?

954
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,960
We both see each other in our future.

955
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:18,600
Yeah.

956
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,280
They already look like a family.

957
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,640
So who gets the money?

958
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,320
Feeling shy.

959
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:40,600
I want to ask you—

960
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,840
When did you first text me?

961
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,760
When was it?

962
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,640
Let me think.

963
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,840
When you asked me to walk the dog.

964
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,800
When you were on the island,

965
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,080
you didn't send me a single message.

966
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,160
Blushing.

967
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:08,480
No.

968
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,360
I texted you on the first day on the island.

969
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,360
No, what about the second day?

970
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,400
Yeah, at dusk on the second day,

971
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,720
what were you thinking?

972
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,120
At dusk on the second day...

973
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,600
What else could I be thinking?

974
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,400
Were you thinking about Yu Xing?

975
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,160
What?

976
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,160
You're so annoying.

977
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,000
You're so annoying.

978
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,520
You're so annoying.

979
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,480
Restrain yourself a bit.

980
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,600
Don't hold back.

981
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,360
If you hold back, then I will too.

982
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,440
Don't hold back.

983
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:51,400
Then I won't.

984
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,000
If you restrain yourself, I will too.

985
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,280
You guys, don't hold back.

986
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:55,720
That's what being in love is.

987
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:56,360
Yeah, why hold back?

988
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,720
This is already being in love.

989
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,280
I'm really curious.

990
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,360
Why at the (Open Day) dinner

991
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,560
were you so

992
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:02,720
straightforward that day?

993
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,960
This is a good spot.

994
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:07,600
Yes.

995
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,280
Can I sit here then?

996
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,200
No, you can't.

997
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,120
No, I mean me—

998
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:13,760
No.

999
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,800
You sit here, it's convenient.

1000
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,720
You're not saying a word, huh?

1001
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,160
You just secretly enjoy it every day.

1002
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,880
So actually, that night

1003
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:23,560
I wanted to find you.

1004
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,720
That night,

1005
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,560
I just wanted to ask you.

1006
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,360
Maybe at the (Open Day) dinner,

1007
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,440
some of my

1008
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,400
overly forward actions

1009
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,280
might have made you feel pressured?

1010
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:33,320
No.

1011
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,720
It's not your fault, blame him.

1012
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,960
Blame me.

1013
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,720
Well done.

1014
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:41,480
Being too forward—

1015
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,360
did it make you feel pressured?

1016
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,440
At that moment, I was already

1017
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,000
No.

1018
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:49,920
But that wasn't pressure.

1019
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,000
I just suddenly

1020
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
got flustered.

1021
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,960
Suddenly seeing you like that,

1022
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,200
I actually felt a bit

1023
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:56,960
happy.

1024
00:45:58,840 --> 00:45:59,800
surprised.

1025
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,200
Surprised.

1026
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,400
Clear-headed.

1027
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:04,880
Surprised.

1028
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:05,760
Surprised.

1029
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:06,640
Yeah.

1030
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:08,200
So cute.

1031
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:09,960
Every single question

1032
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,160
makes you blush after you ask.

1033
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,240
Feeling shy.

1034
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,720
Because honestly, in between,

1035
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,240
for a while we were just

1036
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,200
blending into the crowd.

1037
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,640
It was hard for us to find a chance

1038
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,280
to talk alone.

1039
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:26,800
Yeah.

1040
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,400
It had to be me asking to walk the dog.

1041
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,560
You said this afternoon

1042
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,480
that about giving others

1043
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,800
surprises,

1044
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,760
your view has changed.

1045
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,760
Surprise.

1046
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,880
It seems like everything I prepared

1047
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,480
was just for you.

1048
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,040
That's pretty nice.

1049
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,480
It's a new experience for me too.

1050
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,920
So in your daily life, do you think you

1051
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,680
need these kinds of surprises to

1052
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:11,560
well,

1053
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,280
spice things up?

1054
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:12,920
Yeah.

1055
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,360
If it happens often, it's not a surprise.

1056
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,120
I mean, I'm still

1057
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:23,120
someone whose life is pretty ordinary.

1058
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,560
Crying once or twice a week is enough.

1059
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,560
Can't cry every day.

1060
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,960
So should we skip the next surprise?

1061
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:28,680
No way.

1062
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,400
It's been ages since I got a surprise.

1063
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,400
You put in so much effort, so I should

1064
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,680
accept it, at least.

1065
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:37,720
But now that you've said it,

1066
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:38,920
doesn't that ruin the surprise?

1067
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,520
There wasn't a surprise anyway.

1068
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,920
Were you still hoping for one later?

1069
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,520
Not anymore.

1070
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,200
That's the right attitude.

1071
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:50,960
They're looking back on

1072
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:51,680
when the two of them

1073
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,440
first met each other,

1074
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,560
and felt that spark.

1075
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:55,080
Back then,

1076
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:55,880
the feelings really started to grow.

1077
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,000
The feelings really started to grow.

1078
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:57,880
Yeah.

1079
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,680
Actually, when you talk about looking back,

1080
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,480
I think it's something important

1081
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,480
between two people.

1082
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,840
Because it makes you remember

1083
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,720
those moments,

1084
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,240
like when you

1085
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:07,960
were sneaking glances at me,

1086
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:08,480
and I was sneaking glances at you.

1087
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:09,560
Yeah.

1088
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,280
Honestly, that was

1089
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,920
a wonderful thing.

1090
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,160
That's where your story really began.

1091
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:15,920
Yeah.

1092
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:16,760
And the two of them

1093
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,880
can comfortably

1094
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:19,760
pick up on each other's

1095
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:20,880
topics.

1096
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,240
Right? They can talk about anything.

1097
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,720
Share anything at all.

1098
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,000
It's all fine.

1099
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,480
Are you still happy with things now?

1100
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,920
I think you shouldn't stress too much.

1101
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:37,200
Based on last night and this morning's

1102
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,280
discussions,

1103
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:39,880
I think in the house,

1104
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:40,680
it's impossible for you

1105
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:42,840
to fully understand someone.

1106
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:45,920
I think that's

1107
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:47,680
just really

1108
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,080
I mean, I feel

1109
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,000
you have to take your time together.

1110
00:48:58,880 --> 00:48:59,960
Do you think your pace in the house

1111
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,160
is fast or slow?

1112
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:01,720
Fast.

1113
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:03,440
Super fast.

1114
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:04,840
Super fast.

1115
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,840
Mainly, I really

1116
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,960
might be someone in real life

1117
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,680
whose pace is actually very slow.

1118
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,400
If you

1119
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,400
in your past relationships,

1120
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,040
which part of your time did you

1121
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,600
spend with your partner?

1122
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:24,720
Just on weekends.

1123
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:25,960
Not just weekends.

1124
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,640
After work, too.

1125
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:28,920
Maybe even on regular days.

1126
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,280
It's exhausting.

1127
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,680
Really exhausting.

1128
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,880
So do you willingly

1129
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,440
give up your rest time

1130
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,840
to be with her, or is it

1131
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,640
just about fulfilling

1132
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,720
your duties as a partner?

1133
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,440
To be with her.

1134
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,640
I often have to rush over, and I feel

1135
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,680
I need to make up for things with time.

1136
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,720
Because honestly,

1137
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:00,920
it's like a long-distance thing,

1138
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,280
there's just not enough time together.

1139
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,240
Right, so if you're missing companionship,

1140
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,240
you need to spend time

1141
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,880
to make up for that.

1142
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,000
Like maybe

1143
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:15,800
on that day,

1144
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,880
you suddenly argue over something,

1145
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:19,320
and then you have to

1146
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,480
go see her that night.

1147
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,600
At that moment, you don't care about

1148
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,000
the time or anything.

1149
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:24,920
Nothing else matters.

1150
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:25,920
All that stuff.

1151
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:26,840
You just feel like

1152
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,920
I have to be there today.

1153
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,200
If I don't go today,

1154
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,560
it's all over. Darn it.

1155
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,560
You're such a "romantic expert."

1156
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,480
But it's really exhausting.

1157
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,360
I can feel it.

1158
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:44,360
So,

1159
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,920
when you asked me that

1160
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,080
out of the blue that day,

1161
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,040
it actually hit me a bit.

1162
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,200
Yeah.

1163
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,320
It's because

1164
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,800
those two relationships

1165
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,640
were both long-distance.

1166
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,720
And both lacked companionship.

1167
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,480
I'm also someone who really needs

1168
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,400
companionship.

1169
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,080
So do you think

1170
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,080
how much time together per week is

1171
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,680
No, you can't set a number.

1172
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,880
It totally depends on mood and situation.

1173
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:16,840
Depends on the situation.

1174
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,440
Maybe at that time,

1175
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,480
my mood and state

1176
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,600
were different from now.

1177
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,400
Our Xinjiang trip is almost over.

1178
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:37,720
It's been great.

1179
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,200
I think coming here

1180
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,080
left me with no regrets.

1181
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,560
Feels really good.

1182
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,920
They still managed to express

1183
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:54,640
their own

1184
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,080
thoughts.

1185
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,160
The purpose of the Dating Getaway is

1186
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,640
to help them spark

1187
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,560
so we can talk about this together.

1188
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:03,720
Right?

1189
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,000
Next, we need to

1190
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,280
pack up our bags properly

1191
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,680
and return to our

1192
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:09,960
Signal of the Heart apartment.

1193
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:10,840
So next,

1194
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:11,920
on our return day,

1195
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:12,960
what kind of

1196
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,320
things will happen?

1197
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,920
Let's keep watching and see.

1198
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,520
Hello.

1199
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:03,360
Hello.

1200
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:06,400
Where's your luggage?

1201
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,680
I put my luggage over there.

1202
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:08,200
Okay.

1203
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:08,800
It's over there.

1204
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:10,480
I'll leave mine here for now.

1205
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,040
Alright.

1206
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,600
Hello.

1207
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,920
It's too heavy.

1208
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:15,800
Hello.

1209
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:16,440
Hello.

1210
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:17,720
Good morning.

1211
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,040
Hello, Dr. Fang.

1212
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:19,840
Hello.

1213
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:26,920
Why is it, Herry?

1214
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:27,920
I still feel

1215
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,360
like I haven't woken up yet.

1216
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,360
I already have a stiff neck.

1217
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,240
Didn't you notice today feels

1218
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,440
like my neck can't move?

1219
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:33,760
Okay.

1220
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,320
Actually, I prepared something

1221
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,000
Is she leaving?

1222
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,240
What do you mean?

1223
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,640
No, wait a second.

1224
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:57,720
What is it?

1225
00:53:58,960 --> 00:53:59,760
Let's do this first.

1226
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,200
Everyone wrote a little note.

1227
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,040
Let's take a look.

1228
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,120
Look, Zihan.

1229
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,440
My "emotional anchor."

1230
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,000
Is leaving.

1231
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,400
Where to?

1232
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,440
And then...

1233
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,240
I bought a gift for each of you.

1234
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,400
This one's for Chichi.

1235
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:42,960
Thank you.

1236
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:45,880
It suits you so well.

1237
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:47,640
What about Lanlan's gift?

1238
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,560
It's a bracelet.

1239
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:50,520
Thank you.

1240
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,680
I noticed you love wearing bracelets.

1241
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:54,640
So I got you one

1242
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:55,800
with a special meaning.

1243
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:56,320
I think it matches you.

1244
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:56,680
Thank you.

1245
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:57,640
Style.

1246
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,080
A thought of peace.

1247
00:54:59,320 --> 00:54:59,720
Yes.

1248
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:00,400
That's right.

1249
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,160
Thank you.

1250
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,840
Yifan's gift is in the house.

1251
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,440
It's a pet travel bag.

1252
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,720
This one's for Dr. Fang.

1253
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,360
A cup with a badminton theme.

1254
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:11,880
Thank you.

1255
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:13,720
This one's for Yu Xing.

1256
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:14,600
Dried tangerine peel.

1257
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:15,240
Thank you.

1258
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,680
Because I think he uses the house's

1259
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:18,840
dried tangerine peel the most.

1260
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:19,280
Thank you.

1261
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:20,440
This one...

1262
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:21,800
is for you.

1263
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:22,720
It's perfect for you today.

1264
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,240
Because it's a pillow.

1265
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:25,160
Alright.

1266
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:25,840
Thank you.

1267
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,920
And this one's for Jiao Ge.

1268
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,400
Thank you, it's huge!

1269
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,240
The first time I got a gift from you,

1270
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,520
it was a panda pillow.

1271
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:34,720
Then I swapped with you

1272
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,640
Then I swapped with you

1273
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:38,000
for a little panda blanket.

1274
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Thank you.

1275
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
I really love pandas.

1276
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:40,280
Really.

1277
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:42,480
That's awesome.

1278
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:43,760
That's awesome.

1279
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:44,840
This gift of yours

1280
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,080
really touched my heart.

1281
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:50,840
So great.

1282
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,240
When did you prepare this?

1283
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:07,680
I'm not really into it.

1284
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:08,920
Because first, I'm

1285
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:10,320
a cheerful person.

1286
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,480
And I chose to join this trip

1287
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,200
also because I

1288
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:18,320
heard more than one friend say

1289
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,440
"Duoduo, I hope you stay with me longer."

1290
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,200
So I feel really lucky

1291
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,440
to have made this decision.

1292
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,400
Because at the party, I also said

1293
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,240
when we finish,

1294
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,240
we must have fun together.

1295
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,680
On the upcoming Dating Getaway,

1296
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,080
do you have any wishes you want to fulfill?

1297
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,800
Afterwards, we can all

1298
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,240
go on another trip together.

1299
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,040
Alright.

1300
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,240
So we keep our word.

1301
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,720
I think that's really nice.

1302
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:58,360
Yes.

1303
00:56:59,280 --> 00:56:59,920
Yes.

1304
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,320
I started with this journey,

1305
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:08,720
and ended with this journey.

1306
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,920
I think leaving at this moment

1307
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:11,600
is actually the best decision.

1308
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:12,560
It's truly the best decision.

1309
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:13,800
And a full stop.

1310
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:24,880
From my point of view,

1311
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,720
I've seen everyone these days

1312
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:29,600
lighting up each other's lighthouses.

1313
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,120
From my perspective, I see

1314
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,240
a sky full of stars.

1315
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:41,960
So, what I wanted to say was

1316
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,320
Saying goodbye can be a light thing

1317
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,880
Because on this journey

1318
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,480
it has already gone far beyond

1319
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,520
my own idea of what a crush is

1320
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:52,360
Hello, everyone

1321
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,840
My full name is Ke Ailin

1322
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,000
My nickname is Duoduo

1323
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,560
I'm from Wuhu, Anhui

1324
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:59,720
Let me introduce all my friends to you

1325
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:01,440
Hello

1326
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,480
Hello

1327
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:06,600
Would you like some chocolate?

1328
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:07,520
Yes

1329
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,160
Do you want me to share something with you?

1330
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:11,560
Yes, please

1331
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:12,920
I think girls will always

1332
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,240
be kind to those who are sincere

1333
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,520
Go for it, Jiao Ge

1334
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:17,480
You should be more confident

1335
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,040
You are very charming

1336
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:22,440
I just

1337
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:23,680
don't even dare to date anymore

1338
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,040
Maybe it's better to stay single forever

1339
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:26,760
No, it won't

1340
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,320
Ruilong, you are a great person

1341
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:29,320
Irreplaceable

1342
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,440
Truly irreplaceable

1343
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,480
Yes, there will be someone for you

1344
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,760
I think you just need to wait patiently

1345
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,480
I'm not myself, yet I am myself

1346
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:38,000
Yeah

1347
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,520
Anyway, life is all about

1348
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:40,560
experiencing

1349
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:41,400
experiencing

1350
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,320
Everything else doesn't

1351
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:43,840
matter

1352
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:44,760
Yeah

1353
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,280
I think everyone is saying goodbye

1354
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,080
It's just a matter of timing

1355
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:53,640
I think it's pretty good

1356
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:54,840
Feels pretty good

1357
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,560
Please pat my hand

1358
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:03,800
Yeah

1359
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:04,880
I think it's pretty good

1360
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,720
I really want to play with you too

1361
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:13,400
Duoduo

1362
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,440
Everyone wants to play with me

1363
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:15,120
Don't worry

1364
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:16,440
Don't regret coming to the house

1365
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,160
Duoduo

1366
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:24,120
I'm here

1367
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,080
I'm glad you came

1368
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:29,320
Don't feel pressured

1369
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:30,800
Making decisions

1370
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,920
usually comes with some pressure

1371
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,400
That's how life is too

1372
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:39,880
I need feedback

1373
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:40,960
No problem

1374
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,160
I think it's still a matter to work on

1375
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,320
to separate it

1376
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:44,920
Judge actions, not intentions

1377
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:47,120
If you truly like someone

1378
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:48,920
First of all

1379
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,000
I hope you're happy

1380
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:50,920
If possible

1381
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,200
I hope we can both be happy

1382
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:53,480
Do you have any questions?

1383
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:54,240
No questions

1384
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,840
My "mission" ends here

1385
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,600
I think from now on

1386
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,640
you all need to be braver

1387
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,480
After spending so many days with you

1388
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,520
I've been very happy

1389
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,520
Don't cry

1390
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:33,400
I hope that out there

1391
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,640
you'll find your own answer

1392
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,160
Every time Duoduo is mentioned

1393
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:00,280
When we see Duoduo

1394
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:01,560
she always brings

1395
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:03,040
her own special

1396
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:04,320
energy and warmth

1397
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:05,080
to all of us

1398
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:06,200
She is truly

1399
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,320
someone who can heal herself

1400
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:12,840
That's true

1401
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,120
The greatest energy Duoduo gives us

1402
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:16,360
is teaching us to learn

1403
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:17,600
how to love ourselves

1404
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,080
Because if someone

1405
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:20,160
knows how to love themselves

1406
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,480
and learns to love

1407
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:22,720
and appreciate themselves

1408
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,400
that energy is

1409
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:24,560
truly limitless

1410
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:25,520
And this energy

1411
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:26,560
can also inspire

1412
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:27,960
everyone around us

1413
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:30,800
I think what she just said

1414
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,200
had a few lines

1415
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:34,160
that really touched me

1416
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,120
She said more than one

1417
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,280
friend told her

1418
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,000
"Duoduo, can you stay with me a bit longer?"

1419
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:40,160
One

1420
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:41,800
The second is

1421
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,160
"My mission ends here"

1422
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,440
"From now on, you all need to be brave"

1423
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:47,600
Sometimes I wonder

1424
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,120
if Duoduo hadn't joined this season

1425
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:49,600
this house

1426
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,720
would be so different

1427
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,120
You know,

1428
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,760
how important a friend like Duoduo is

1429
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:57,920
She brings us so much

1430
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:58,840
energy

1431
01:01:59,200 --> 01:01:59,960
And then

1432
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:01,440
she taught me so many things

1433
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:04,520
I think she's really

1434
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:05,640
open with herself

1435
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,720
She doesn't put up many walls

1436
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:09,000
towards the world

1437
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:09,600
or others

1438
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:12,200
She is, at every moment,

1439
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,520
her most genuine self

1440
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,760
and she's always willing

1441
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:15,720
to show that to others

1442
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:17,160
I think that's

1443
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:18,960
a truly precious quality

1444
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,000
I hope she keeps it

1445
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,520
I hope Duoduo out there

1446
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:23,920
can find her happiness

1447
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,520
Because truly,

1448
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,240
she's a wonderful person

1449
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:29,600
I hope after this show

1450
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:31,680
she finds her own answers

1451
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:32,800
I hope she finds someone

1452
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,440
who can give her energy too

1453
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:37,400
So here we are

1454
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:38,520
We thank Duoduo

1455
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:39,360
and wish Duoduo well

1456
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:40,080
Thank you, Duoduo

1457
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:40,520
Thank you

1458
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:41,800
Thank you, Duoduo

1459
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:42,960
Thank you, Duoduo

1460
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:44,840
You're amazing

1461
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:47,440
You are pure energy for people like us

1462
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:48,760
You must remember

1463
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:49,960
Alright

1464
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,880
Our journey far away

1465
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:53,120
ends here

1466
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:54,720
After saying goodbye to Duoduo

1467
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:55,680
everyone will return to

1468
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:56,800

to face the final confession

1471
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,120
Let's look forward to

1472
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:03,960
our final moments

1473
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:04,520

what will they be?

1476

the final episode of season eight

01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:21,240
the final episode of season eight

1495
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:23,720
Three, two, one

1496
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:26,040
This is beautiful

1497
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:26,680
Let me give you some

1498
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,200
Yes, you see, this is real happiness

1499
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,360
Here it comes

1500
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:33,400
Six, five, four, three, two, one

1501
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,240
Six, five, four, three, two, one

1502
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:38,040
So fast

1503
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:38,320
It's really

1504
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:39,240
the last night

1505
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:40,400
Dear Cupids

1506
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,160
Our Confession Day

1507
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:44,040
This season's confessions

1508
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:45,680
will end in couples

1509
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,520
or not becoming couples

1510
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:48,840
just two outcomes

1511
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:50,880
Can't wait

1512
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:52,120
It's the end

1513
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:55,080
They're confessing in Xinjiang

1514
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:55,440
They're confessing in Xinjiang

1515
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:01,000
So beautiful

1516
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:02,880
Pretty cool

1517
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:03,200
Pretty cool

1518
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:05,920
Lanlan

1519
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,240
The excitement is here

1520
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:16,240
I'm so nervous

1521
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:16,800
I'm so nervous

1522
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:25,960
This sweetness

1523
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:29,840
Honestly, I want to keep every frame

1524
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:31,040
Honestly, I want to keep every frame

1525
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:32,800
and every second etched in my mind

1526
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,320
and every second etched in my mind

1527
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:39,920
Once connected, I suddenly go blank

1528
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:43,800
If I get the chance

1529
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:46,440
I want to make breakfast for you often

1530
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:49,560
Not trying

1531
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:52,720
to walk with you through these mountains and rivers

1532
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:53,680
side by side

1533
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:53,840
side by side

1534
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:54,960
I think this would be my final regret

1535
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,000
I think this would be my final regret

1536
01:05:58,520 --> 01:05:59,360
Who could it be

1537
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:00,480
Hello

1538
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:04,280
Hello

1539
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:05,160
Hello

1540
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:10,040
Who will end up as a couple

1541
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,600
I understand you

1542
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:15,600
I probably know

1543
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,320
what you want

1544
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,760
Or else I’ll cry my eyes out today

1545
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,240
Can we stand side by side

1546
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,440
Who wants to stand next to you

1547
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:28,920
I think our chat now is

1548
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:29,680
pretty energizing

1549
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:36,240
Your metaphors are so abstract

1550
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,320
Abstract?

1551
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:38,040
What are you saying again

1552
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:39,720
What are you saying again

1553
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:40,680
I really wish

1554
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:42,000
my brain could reboot every day

1555
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:44,960
Why is the bunny nodding

1556
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:46,520
Gossip-watching emoji

1557
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:49,680
How did it suddenly

1558
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:50,880
start from frame zero

1559
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,160
I really couldn’t hold it in then

1560
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:58,040
I shipped it

1561
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:00,000
Who can handle this

1562
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:01,760
I can’t take it

1563
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,160
Who is it

1564
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:04,800
Yes

1565
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:05,680
It’s Xiao Fang

1566
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:07,120
I saw it on Xiaohongshu

1567
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:08,880
scrolled past an airport photo

1568
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:09,440
Because we
