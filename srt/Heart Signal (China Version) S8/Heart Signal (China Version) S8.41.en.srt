00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,800
Hello

2
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,360
Brother Jiao

3
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,120
Which one of these

4
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,000
is your favorite?

5
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,440
This one.

6
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,280
Picked a green vegetable.

7
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,400
Vegetables.

8
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,840
Easy to cook and tasty.

9
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,360
I just counted, there are

10
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,400
two cold dishes,

11
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,760
five hot dishes,

12
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,600
and in front of each person

13
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,680
there are six small dishes.

14
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,520
Plus a soup.

15
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,800
So much food!

16
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,680
It's different from

17
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,600
what I imagined.

18
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,040
Way beyond expectations.

19
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,120
It's great.

20
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,680
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

21
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,200
Someone's here.

22
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,680
Hello.

23
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,800
Hi, Yifan.

24
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,200
Where should I sit?

25
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,600
Where's a good spot?

26
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,040
Just relax.

27
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,520
If you have trouble picking a seat,

28
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,920
we can all get up.

29
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,080
You can choose first.

30
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,120
It's fine, sit anywhere.

31
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,800
We all just sit randomly.

32
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,520
Yeah.

33
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,560
You pick first.

34
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,120
Then I'll...

35
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,400
Brother Jiao, I'll sit here.

36
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:24,920
Okay.

37
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,280
I feel a bit guilty.

38
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,120
I didn't do anything at the sports event.

39
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,600
And when I showed up,

40
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,440
it was already dinner time.

41
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:41,840
Maybe it's because

42
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,520
seeing your cardboard cutout

43
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,360
that we won.

44
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,920
We could only win by looking at your cutout.

45
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,680
You gave us

46
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,840
a morale boost.

47
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,960
Here they come.

48
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,360
Are they here?

49
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,800
Lanlan.

50
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,720
Guess which number you arrived.

51
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,480
Fourth, since there are already three pairs of shoes.

52
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,440
Hello.

53
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:18,920
Hi.

54
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,640
Hello.

55
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,280
Where do you want to sit?

56
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,320
Me?

57
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:29,960
Anywhere is fine.

58
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,520
Then I'll sit...

59
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,560
Oh, you're sitting here.

60
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,480
I can move my bag too.

61
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,120
Where to sit?

62
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,960
Then I'll sit here.

63
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:39,960
No need to move it.

64
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,280
Finally, you're here.

65
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,000
Let's start eating.

66
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,720
You must be starving.

67
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,440
Delicious.

68
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,360
After we've eaten for a while,

69
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,960
we can swap these dishes around.

70
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,000
Okay.

71
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,360
Thank you.

72
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,520
I want some.

73
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:24,920
Wait a second.

74
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,160
Which one do you want?

75
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,320
I took them all.

76
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,120
This one should be pretty good.

77
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,760
Thanks.

78
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,600
You're welcome.

79
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,520
The four of us didn't

80
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,080
meet on the first day on the island.

81
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,720
But we are all from the same island.

82
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,480
Yeah.

83
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,600
That's right.

84
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,920
So let's think about

85
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:01,760
how we felt when we first met.

86
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,320
How we felt when we first met.

87
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,400
Has anything changed?

88
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,600
Sure.

89
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,760
What do you want to know?

90
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,680
The one who asked should go first.

91
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,840
Digging your own hole.

92
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,640
I feel even happier now.

93
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,680
Yes.

94
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,400
Because on the first day we met,

95
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,120
there was still some unfamiliarity.

96
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,200
But now I feel really relaxed.

97
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,320
At this moment,

98
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,000
it feels like everyone is very familiar.

99
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,840
And we know each other well.

100
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,840
We know what kind of people we are.

101
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,440
So I feel my mood now

102
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,840
is much lighter than before.

103
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,040
Content.

104
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,120
And happy.

105
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,080
Your turn.

106
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,120
I feel

107
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,760
the me from the first day

108
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,880
was probably just

109
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,000
my ordinary self from 2025.

110
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,280
Now, after more than ten days,

111
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,360
it feels a bit like

112
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,440
living in another world

113
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,680
for ten years.

114
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,480
Even though in this world

115
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,480
only a dozen days have passed,

116
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,840
I feel different now.

117
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,640
Go ahead, Dr. Fang.

118
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,840
When I first came in,

119
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,600
I was pretty surprised.

120
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:26,880
Surprised.

121
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,360
Yeah.

122
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,480
Why?

123
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,240
At that time, Rui Long and Lan Lan were there.

124
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,680
One was really handsome,

125
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,560
the other was really beautiful.

126
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,480
And when I came in,

127
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,600
I felt a lot of pressure.

128
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,640
At that moment,

129
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,840
I barely stood for a second

130
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,680
before I sat down.

131
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,840
I probably sat down before they did.

132
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,760
I just sat down.

133
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,560
I was so nervous.

134
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,040
Say something.

135
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:01,880
Me?

136
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,280
Then I’m definitely happier now.

137
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:03,960
Definitely happier now.

138
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,360
At this very moment, I’m happier.

139
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,760
Did you ever think

140
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,160
did you ever imagine

141
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,480
that among the people you met

142
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,440
for the first time,

143
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,080
the three of us would later

144
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,120
become close to you

145
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,040
or people who care about you?

146
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,560
Yes.

147
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,120
I did think so.

148
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,680
Yeah.

149
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,240
Because I really believe in fate

150
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,480
and first impressions.

151
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,440
And my impression of you all

152
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,360
my understanding

153
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,480
hasn’t changed since day one.

154
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,640
It’s only gotten better than I expected.

155
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,040
Let me say something.

156
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,520
Since coming to the house,

157
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,640
for so long,

158
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,240
which dish do you think is the best?

159
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,840
After being here for so long,

160
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,720
including all the dishes from the kitchen,

161
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,720
Yeah, from the kitchen.

162
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,880
I choose hot pot.

163
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,360
Hot pot for me.

164
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,240
I pick the upgraded cilantro beef.

165
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,120
Upgraded cilantro beef for me.

166
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,520
That one should be

167
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,560
looks pretty good.

168
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,600
Not bad.

169
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,080
Upgraded version.

170
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,040
Okay, I’ll choose the spicy pork ribs.

171
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,400
Brother Jiao.

172
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,680
One dish?

173
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,200
Actually, two dishes are both pretty tasty.

174
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,120
It’s

175
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,440
the water spinach and

176
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,480
the pork ribs.

177
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,080
The sweet pork ribs

178
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,800
and the spicy ones.

179
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,560
No need.

180
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,200
No need.

181
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,760
Right?

182
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,160
Missing jasmine tea.

183
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,080
Another bottle, please.

184
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,280
Think of a question.

185
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,000
Since we entered the cabin until now,

186
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,880
what was your happiest

187
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,040
moment?

188
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,360
You can't say it's right now.

189
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,760
A specific moment.

190
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,600
Then my happiest moment was probably

191
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,280
the first mystery date.

192
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,360
When I met

193
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,040
my intuition told me

194
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,840
it was that person.

195
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,200
So I said it.

196
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:08,960
I'll go next.

197
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,800
You go.

198
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,240
It was also when I picked the card for the first time.

199
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,680
You picked it.

200
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,680
I picked it.

201
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,400
Just take this one.

202
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,080
Did you know when you picked it,

203
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,080
or only after you saw it

204
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,160
that you chose right?

205
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,080
I felt I chose right when I picked it.

206
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,960
Around 5 p.m. on June 8th.

207
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,400
What moment was that?

208
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,480
Running.

209
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,120
Eating.

210
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,920
Eating.

211
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,400
The two of us suddenly started running.

212
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,040
Really.

213
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,480
Your turn.

214
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,640
My turn.

215
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,560
If I have to choose,

216
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,680
it would be one day

217
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,200
when the weather forecast said

218
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,640
there would be heavy rain.

219
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,120
But the night before,

220
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,520
I made a wish

221
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,760
that it would

222
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,760
be sunny.

223
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,600
And then

224
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,640
the sun broke through the clouds.

225
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,480
I felt like my wish

226
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,360
would always come true.

227
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,760
See, I said it wouldn't rain today.

228
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,720
When I left home,

229
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,560
I was actually worried about rain.

230
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,400
So that moment made me really happy.

231
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,560
I brought gifts for everyone.

232
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,320
To celebrate.

233
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,280
We're the champion team.

234
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,360
This is for you.

235
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,280
Why don't you open it?

236
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,560
Okay.

237
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,160
Thank you.

238
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,320
More joy, always peace.

239
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,440
That's a nice slogan.

240
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,240
This one's for Dr. Fang.

241
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,840
Thank you.

242
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,240
Badminton.

243
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,520
And this one is for

244
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:03,720
Yifan.

245
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,080
Thank you.

246
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,160
I have one too.

247
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:07,800
Okay, thanks.

248
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,520
Of course you do.

249
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,880
Today's surprise.

250
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,160
It really is a surprise today.

251
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,680
You gave me a stress-relief

252
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,040
Is this a squishy toy?

253
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,640
Yes.

254
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,160
I really need it.

255
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,520
I picked this one especially.

256
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,320
Nice.

257
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,760
It suits me well.

258
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,040
Let me cut it.

259
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:25,920
When you cut it,

260
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,000
be a bit careful.

261
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,880
I'll cut it then.

262
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,400
You cut.

263
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,120
Hope everyone enjoys every day in the cabin.

264
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,720
And keeps being happy.

265
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,240
Thank you.

266
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,720
Thanks to Jiao Ge for the gifts for each of us.

267
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,040
You're welcome.

268
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,120
This bigger piece

269
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,080
is for Dr. Fang.

270
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,640
Now,

271
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,840
you're at your slimmest.

272
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,560
Thank you.

273
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,640
Let me check out this stress toy.

274
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,720
I'm really happy today.

275
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,760
I don't even need to de-stress.

276
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,840
Seriously, don't feel pressured.

277
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,440
Just relax.

278
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,080
But sometimes, stress is

279
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,160
something we put on ourselves.

280
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,160
Yeah.

281
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,600
But

282
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,080
the more it’s like this, I think

283
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,200
the more you need

284
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,600
to talk to friends about it.

285
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,920
I've always been curious about something.

286
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,160
Do you think he’s

287
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,120
someone with a "wall"?

288
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,760
Because a lot of introverted people

289
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,080
have a "wall".

290
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,000
It's not that there's no wall at all.

291
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,840
It's just not a thick wall.

292
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,800
But there’s a thin

293
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:50,840
membrane.

294
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,480
Right.

295
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,160
A membrane, or maybe

296
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:53,560
a curtain.

297
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:53,960
Like a veil.

298
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,120
With a membrane, you can still

299
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,560
see through it clearly.

300
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,520
A veil is harder to see through.

301
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,440
You’re not bothered by the veil

302
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,600
anymore, right?

303
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,240
Actually, there’s one more thing.

304
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,840
Why did I use "wall" as a metaphor?

305
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,440
It’s because

306
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,360
a wall can't be blown away.

307
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:25,960
Yeah.

308
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,800
So I think

309
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,000
that veil

310
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,800
shouldn’t be your problem.

311
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,720
It’s his issue to deal with.

312
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,360
You just need to be happy every day

313
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,640
and do what you want.

314
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,200
Just let your wind blow.

315
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,280
Or be a little sun.

316
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,240
Your light will shine through the veil.

317
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:45,920
It’ll shine in.

318
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,240
Don’t always give him sunshine.

319
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,280
A little rain might be good too.

320
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,640
What?

321
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,240
Are you teaching now?

322
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,200
Don’t always give him sunshine.

323
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,280
Stop giving only sunshine.

324
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,080
I don’t give advice like that.

325
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,400
I think Yifan should just be herself.

326
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,400
Because

327
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,280
skills from advice

328
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,200
aren’t real.

329
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,280
What you get from tricks

330
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,360
doesn’t last.

331
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,120
Sincerity is always

332
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,240
Yes.

333
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:16,760
the ultimate move.

334
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,520
The ultimate move.

335
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,720
Especially for people with a veil

336
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,040
or a wall.

337
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,400
Yes.

338
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,400
Cheers!

339
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,200
Happy Lantern Festival!

340
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,040
Let’s head back to the cabin.

341
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:34,680
Okay.

342
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,240
Let me wash.

343
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:39,720
I’ll wash.

344
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,640
I’ll do the rest.

345
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,200
It’s fine.

346
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,840
It’s my turn.

347
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,640
Let me wash.

348
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,200
Alright.

349
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,480
I’ll wash, you set the table.

350
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,360
Let me wash.

351
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,120
Why?

352
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,840
Because

353
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,600
I think I wash a bit faster.

354
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,680
No.

355
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,440
I’m just kidding.

356
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,720
I just want to wash.

357
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,240
Let’s just say I’m

358
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,120
a more professional dishwasher than you.

359
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,520
How professional?

360
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,520
Do you think Duoduo is professional?

361
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,720
Duoduo

362
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,600
is almost

363
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,320
almost professional.

364
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,240
Did you forget

365
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:18,960
your Tom Yum soup just now

366
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,600
was defeated by me?

367
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,120
Really?

368
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,320
Of course.

369
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,720
Did you say that yourself?

370
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,560
Everyone says so.

371
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,200
They just don’t want to hurt your feelings.

372
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,920
You were over there,

373
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,800
at the restaurant for dinner, right?

374
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,360
Yeah.

375
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,360
What did you eat?

376
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,240
We had a "Manchu Han Imperial Feast."

377
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,000
It still felt like

378
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,040
a mix of Chinese and Western dishes.

379
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,520
What else?

380
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,560
There was that kind of lettuce.

381
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,400
Blanched lettuce hearts.

382
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,520
And winter melon and pork rib soup.

383
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,360
I had that soup again today.

384
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,560
Winter melon and pork rib soup.

385
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,280
I'll go grab a trash bag.

386
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,240
Okay.

387
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,600
You actually don't have to clean up.

388
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,920
Because you didn't eat.

389
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,320
Was it good?

390
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,160
Not really.

391
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,160
The dishes were all over the place.

392
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,400
But when we went in, there was a long table.

393
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,960
There were some dishes on it.

394
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,160
Stir-fried beef with chili.

395
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,280
And winter melon and pork rib soup.

396
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,760
And what else...

397
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,120
Japanese cuisine, steak.

398
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,040
It was a real mix, all kinds of food.

399
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,160
Of course, the food wasn't the important part.

400
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,800
What mattered was

401
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,280
the four of us chatting together, it was fun.

402
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,760
So you knew we went to the dinner?

403
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,520
I only realized when you came back

404
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,680
that it seemed like

405
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,040
a few people were missing, right?

406
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,600
Not missing.

407
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,760
I knew the four of you weren't back.

408
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,600
But I didn't think

409
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,360
you went to that dinner.

410
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,600
Yeah.

411
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,000
I got a text early this morning

412
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,480
saying there was a dinner tonight.

413
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,760
Right when I was about to leave.

414
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,600
When I woke up.

415
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,200
That early?

416
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,400
Yeah, I got a text saying

417
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,760
there's a dinner tonight.

418
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,640
Diligently washing dishes.

419
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,800
A "heartless dishwasher."

420
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,800
Sometimes I just want to be

421
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,360
a "heartless dishwasher."

422
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,200
This pot feels like a mess.

423
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,920
Yeah, a lot of them are.

424
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,960
Hello.

425
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,680
Hi.

426
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,160
How did you two sneak away?

427
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,160
Secretly.

428
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,360
You two look so sneaky.

429
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,160
This one seems okay.

430
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,560
You didn't eat enough?

431
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,600
We did, but can't eat too much at once.

432
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,120
But...

433
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,000
Looks like your dinner tonight

434
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,400
wasn't that great either.

435
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,280
Can't say for sure.

436
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,800
Maybe I was the only one eating.

437
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,960
Why aren't you drinking this?

438
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,080
We want eight-treasure porridge.

439
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,440
But this is sweet.

440
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,160
This one's sweet and spicy.

441
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,760
You can heat it up.

442
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,600
If you want to drink it.

443
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,400
It's really good.

444
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,760
Is there a reward for drinking it?

445
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,960
A reward?

446
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,760
The reward is finishing the whole pot.

447
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,360
It's actually pretty good.

448
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:56,840
You cooked this?

449
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,360
Yeah, I made it.

450
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,680
Let me try.

451
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,280
This corn is really good too.

452
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,280
Who cooked this pot?

453
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,280
This is the one to eat.

454
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,040
Then let's heat it up.

455
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,840
No need.

456
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,840
We'll just have a taste.

457
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,720
Good bro, thanks for giving face.

458
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,880
Take a bite.

459
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,680
There's a hint of coconut aroma.

460
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,640
And a touch of milky fragrance.

461
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,680
So tasty.

462
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,040
It really is delicious.

463
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,280
This is honestly the best I've ever had.

464
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,680
Let's go.

465
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,640
Let's go.

466
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,240
Throw out the trash.

467
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,040
Who is that?

468
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,520
Duo Duo and

469
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,920
Duo Duo and

470
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,640
Chi Chi.

471
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,320
Hello.

472
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,240
Hi.

473
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,680
Yifan, I just had one of yours.

474
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,480
The grape-flavored mint candy.

475
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,600
Okay.

476
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,480
It's so good.

477
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,640
Tasty, right?

478
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,760
Did you guys go work out?

479
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,480
Yeah.

480
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,760
We just finished working out.

481
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,240
We just played badminton.

482
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,520
Played badminton.

483
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,560
We played barefoot just now.

484
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,080
Really?

485
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:07,840
Yeah.

486
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,320
Are you heading back?

487
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:12,760
Let's go.

488
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,280
Going back.

489
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:13,600
Let's go.

490
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,160
Let's head back.

491
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,240
Can we play a bit longer?

492
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,840
It's not impossible.

493
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,840
Because your shoes really are

494
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,920
a bit more convenient.

495
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,040
But I'm worried about my skills.

496
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,080
The two of us are just too good.

497
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,560
You know that, right?

498
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,320
Yeah, we both played barefoot.

499
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,040
You have no idea how we played just now.

500
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,840
We played really well.

501
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,080
If you want to test

502
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:30,920
your skills,

503
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,080
this is definitely a good chance.

504
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:33,920
Sure.

505
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,960
So, where are the rackets?

506
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,360
The rackets are up there.

507
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,480
Right here.

508
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,440
There are only two rackets.

509
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,200
Really?

510
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,960
There's one more upstairs, so three in total.

511
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,040
Let's play, take turns.

512
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,680
There's actually a shuttlecock.

513
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,200
So my wish to play one against three

514
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,680
isn't happening, right?

515
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,120
The wish to play one versus three.

516
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,240
One versus three.

517
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,040
Kid, you're way too cocky.

518
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,680
You'll see soon enough

519
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,720
what it means

520
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,600
to be

521
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,800
a modern

522
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:14,920
modern

523
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,800
Modern what?

524
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,760
what a "modern female player" is like.

525
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,320
Are you playing?

526
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:18,880
Yeah.

527
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:19,640
Then let's play.

528
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,440
Spread out.

529
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,720
He looks super skilled,

530
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,320
but actually,

531
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,920
he's really nervous inside.

532
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,680
His eyes can't keep up with the ball.

533
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,200
And then he

534
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,440
You've already lost in terms of aura.

535
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,720
Really?

536
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,920
But I think you should keep trying.

537
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,600
Go for it!

538
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,440
Chi Chi, honestly,

539
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,640
Jin Yuxing is kind of insulting you right now.

540
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,040
Because he hasn't even moved his feet.

541
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,480
Yeah.

542
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,880
I'm really good at feeding the ball.

543
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,880
Shouldn't you be wearing slippers?

544
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,000
Didn't make it over the net.

545
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,480
Do you guys want to play?

546
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,320
Let me try.

547
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,160
If I beat you wearing these shoes,

548
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:25,600
what then?

549
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,800
Then you must be dreaming.

550
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,440
Dreaming.

551
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:29,920
Alright.

552
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:39,680
Didn't make it over.

553
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,040
Did that go over?

554
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,640
No.

555
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,640
It really didn't.

556
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,000
It came from here.

557
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,800
I made some dried tangerine peel tea for everyone.

558
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,920
You're drinking dried tangerine peel tea right now.

559
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,400
That's right.

560
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,880
Come back later and we'll drink it together.

561
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,280
Okay.

562
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,600
Sorry, that shot was a bit fast.

563
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,680
Why don't you try?

564
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,320
I'll do it.

565
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,400
Here, let me hold this.

566
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,120
What's this?

567
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,160
You just want to

568
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,200
take her dried tangerine peel tea, right?

569
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,920
No way, don't even think about it.

570
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,120
Duoduo is really strong, as expected.

571
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,680
Talk less, do more.

572
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:30,880
Full of

573
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,600
Full of strength.

574
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,400
Full of energy.

575
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,520
Are you the net or am I the net?

576
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,880
I'm the net.

577
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,800
You're the net.

578
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,720
So who's really the net?

579
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,680
You both can be the net.

580
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,200
You two can be the "high-low bouncy net."

581
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:43,880
So I can

582
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,040
stand in the middle and catch the shuttlecock, right?

583
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,280
If I catch it, you both lose.

584
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,560
It's over.

585
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,800
It's finished.

586
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,280
I'm so tired.

587
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,120
Hello.

588
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,440
What are you two doing?

589
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,440
Playing a staring contest.

590
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,280
Nothing much.

591
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,360
Red light, green light.

592
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,440
You're both in the same pose.

593
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,240
Where did you come back from?

594
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,800
The gym.

595
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,640
I'm tired.

596
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,320
It's dried tangerine peel water inside.

597
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,840
Did you just boil it?

598
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,440
Yeah, it's for removing dampness.

599
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,080
Do we add this or not?

600
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,440
I wanted to ask that too.

601
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,600
Come on.

602
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,440
Please have a seat.

603
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,520
Thank you.

604
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,840
Thanks.

605
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,000
Should we both sit here, or...

606
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,320
That's fine too.

607
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,840
You have to work tomorrow morning.

608
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,880
I have to work tomorrow morning.

609
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,280
Me too.

610
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,160
Is there any breakfast over there?

611
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,920
We need to have breakfast tomorrow.

612
00:27:59,280 --> 00:27:59,880
What should we eat?

613
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,080
Eggs.

614
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,080
What to eat?

615
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,680
Me?

616
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,040
Am I allowed to have breakfast?

617
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:08,920
I leave at six.

618
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,520
I came here.

619
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,280
I've never had breakfast here.

620
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,040
You want to?

621
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,120
That's fine too.

622
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,600
The main thing is...

623
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,960
I don't know what ingredients are left over there.

624
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,480
I bought some noodles, do you want any?

625
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,600
Tomorrow.

626
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,400
No, I already bought them today.

627
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,280
You already bought them?

628
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:21,720
Noodles.

629
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,320
Noodles.

630
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,600
Flour or noodles?

631
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,080
Noodles, the long kind.

632
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,760
Actually, flour works too.

633
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,920
Is there any flour over there?

634
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:28,880
There's flour.

635
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,960
I think so.

636
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,360
Yes, there is.

637
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,440
Then I can make dough drops.

638
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,480
You know how to make dough drops?

639
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,400
But are there any tomatoes?

640
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,280
No tomatoes.

641
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,000
What about this?

642
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,360
Aren't there a lot of tomatoes?

643
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,320
Not these tomatoes.

644
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,320
I saw some tomatoes.

645
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:41,880
In my room.

646
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,400
No, our kitchen has some.

647
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,000
Is it tasty?

648
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,840
This one?

649
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,320
It's good.

650
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:47,680
I picked it.

651
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,520
Didn't I pick this?

652
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,520
Smell it.

653
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,120
What did you two actually do?

654
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,800
Picked these.

655
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,680
Just picked these.

656
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,880
We did a lot of things.

657
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,600
Yeah, we did a lot.

658
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,680
Well...

659
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,040
Riding that thing.

660
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,200
On the scooter, picking tomatoes.

661
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,000
Yeah.

662
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,800
I was riding.

663
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,640
And she was picking.

664
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,400
Yeah.

665
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,200
A bit sour.

666
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,280
A little sour.

667
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,280
Kind of sour.

668
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:24,720
Sweet.

669
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,400
Sweet.

670
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,280
Try it.

671
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,800
Taste one.

672
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,200
Eat the really green one.

673
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,280
That one's super sweet.

674
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,480
It's sweet, right?

675
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,720
That's all our love.

676
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,200
Sweet.

677
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,000
I'm not sitting here.

678
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,160
Come, sit.

679
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,680
Or go upstairs.

680
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,000
Go up.

681
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,520
Okay.

682
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,280
What time are you getting up tomorrow?

683
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,360
Around nine.

684
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,360
Nine o'clock.

685
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,480
Can it be later?

686
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,000
Then ten o'clock.

687
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,520
Can you consider the elderly?

688
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,440
Ten o'clock.

689
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,200
A bit later.

690
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,760
Be kinder to yourself tomorrow, okay?

691
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,120
(Just curious) Where do you most want to travel right now?

692
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,400
Right now?
