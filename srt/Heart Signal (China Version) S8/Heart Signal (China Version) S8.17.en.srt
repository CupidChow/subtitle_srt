00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,040
Hello everyone, we are the "Jin Zhao" group.

2
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:27,720
I'm Good Luck (Zhang Jin).

3
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,800
I'm her boyfriend, Zeng Zeng (Zeng Zhaohui).

4
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,600
Fiancé, Zeng Zeng (Zeng Zhaohui).

5
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,320
Thank you.

6
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,560
Why didn't you introduce yourself like this in the first half?

7
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,280
Thank you.

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:37,440
Thank you.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,680
I'm Zhao Qijun.

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,040
This is Yang Kaiwen.

11
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,200
That's right.

12
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,760
I'll say a bit more on Yang Kaiwen's behalf.

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,040
Then she'll have less to say.

14
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,160
That's right.

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,920
Hello everyone, I'm Qiqi (Wang Qi).

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,320
This is my boyfriend Tomo (Zhang Hao).

17
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,560
This is my girlfriend Qiqi (Wang Qi).

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,200
Yes.

19
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,240
Exactly.

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:58,880
They (the guests of "Signal of the Heart" Season 8)

21
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,280
have already chosen their gifts.

22
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,040
They're about to start their dates.

23
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,600
Let's look forward to seeing where they'll go on their dates.

24
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,880
Qiqi (Wang Qi), when you went on your date,

25
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,320
where did you go?

26
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:07,360
Where did you go?

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,520
Our first date was

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,960
surfing in Hong Kong, China.

29
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,800
For our first date,

30
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,360
we went to wash the dog.

31
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:18,960
Yes.

32
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,160
I watched you guys.

33
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:20,920
Yeah.

34
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,000
Right.

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,680
Did you bring

36
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,720
your own pets there?

37
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,200
Yes, he brought his cat and I brought my dog.

38
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,640
So what did you do on your first date?

39
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,680
At the foot of the Imperial City.

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,920
Drank mung bean juice.

41
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,600
That's a rhyme.

42
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,280
Very rhyming.

43
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,160
Before watching

44
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:40,720
Okay

45
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,600
This game is called "Love's Safe Box"

46
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,560
Each team will be blindfolded and put their hands into the box

47
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,600
Touch and guess the item inside

48
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,000
And tell a little story behind the item

49
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,120
What kind of things will there be

50
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,880
for us to touch?

51
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,080
Cockroaches, mice

52
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,080
Snakes

53
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,440
Don't be afraid

54
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:57,920
Are you scared?

55
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,520
Yes

56
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,560
Come on

57
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,440
Bring out the props

58
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,200
Such a big piece of paper

59
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,320
It's not my marriage certificate, is it?

60
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,680
Why is something falling out?

61
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,840
No, it's a

62
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,240
paper bag for holding clothes

63
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,520
This is that...

64
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,440
Do you remember that rainy day

65
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,760
when you gave me a bag

66
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,360
to put over my head? Now I get it

67
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,000
For introverts only

68
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,560
Cut two holes in it, right

69
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,880
The best gift for an introvert

70
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,320
This one already has holes

71
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:27,960
There are holes here

72
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:28,800
Yeah

73
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,680
Both of them are really busy

74
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,280
No one knows what they're busy with

75
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,240
Let's wear this to observe today

76
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,800
So sweet

77
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,320
The "Jin Zhao" team, close your eyes

78
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,840
Hold my hand

79
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,800
You use your right hand, I'll use my left

80
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,600
Why are your faces so close together?

81
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,640
Let's go

82
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,120
What is this?

83
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,760
Let's take it out and feel it first.

84
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,040
Iron.

85
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,920
That time he burned my dress with it.

86
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,240
So how did you solve it in the end?

87
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,320
In the end, I bought a new one.

88
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,560
Then that's a relief.

89
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,120
Actually, she was doing her makeup over there at the time.

90
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,440
We were running late to go out.

91
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,600
I saw her dress was wrinkled.

92
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,600
I thought I'd help her iron it.

93
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,360
Good intentions, bad outcome.

94
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,800
So I ironed it.

95
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,240
As soon as the iron touched it, sizzle.

96
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,280
The dress was ruined.

97
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,520
It got all crumpled up.

98
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,320
The glue melted and it started smoking.

99
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,680
Did Zhang Jin get angry?

100
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,640
She did.

101
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,840
Next.

102
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,600
What's this?

103
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,160
I can already picture it.

104
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,400
What is this thing?

105
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,560
What is this?

106
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,120
What is this?

107
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,640
Headband.

108
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:00,960
Headband.

109
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,080
Are there fireworks on it?

110
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,760
No.

111
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,400
What is this, a headband?

112
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,440
Take it out.

113
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,800
Guess again.

114
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,480
Is it something you wear on your head?

115
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,680
Guess again.

116
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,000
Hairpin flowers

117
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,040
Yes

118
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,720
Here

119
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,000
Wearing hairpin flowers in Quanzhou

120
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,720
Does it look good?

121
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,880
It looks good

122
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,840
It looks good

123
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,920
He wore them too at the time

124
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,880
I think I've seen this episode

125
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,480
That's nice

126
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,600
Watching these stories one by one

127
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,280
The scenes as they happen

128
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,120
True love

129
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,600
Yes

130
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,800
All the little moments of affection

131
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:38,800
That's true

132
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,040
Many small things in our lives

133
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,000
Can all be recorded

134
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,080
I think it's really interesting

135
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,800
After being together for a long time

136
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,200
We rarely use the word "date" anymore

137
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,160
Just going out together

138
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,360
Counts as a little date

139
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,920
So at this stage

140
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,560
The friends of season eight

141
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,520
Their first date

142
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,000
What will it be like?

143
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,040
Let's look forward to it together

144
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,240
Let's watch together

145
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,120
Who is it?

146
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,800
Dr. Fang (Fang Yijiong)

147
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,960
Dr. Fang (Fang Yijiong)

148
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,280
Okay

149
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,040
I really like him

150
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,080
I think Xu Rulan noticed

151
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,600
it was Dr. Fang (Fang Yijiong)

152
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,280
who chose that card

153
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,120
She seemed pretty happy about it too

154
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,760
Yeah

155
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,640
Isn't he going to help her put it on?

156
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,920
He put his own on first

157
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,360
Then he'll help her put hers on

158
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:21,920
Right

159
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,400
So thoughtful

160
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,800
What did they do on their date?

161
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,440
They collected clams

162
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,360
Collected clams and opened pearls

163
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,360
They didn't sit apart

164
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,280
That way they could look at each other

165
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,720
He shared directly with her

166
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,800
his own feelings

167
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,360
Not bad

168
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,840
This signal

169
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,840
Xu Rulan's careful selection

170
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,640
If this clam is big,

171
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,760
will the pearl also be big?

172
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,800
It might be.

173
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,200
Watching this makes me want to open that clam too.

174
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,040
Me too.

175
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,320
I want to go as well.

176
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,640
At this moment, we should

177
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,200
help her open it.

178
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,280
Stand behind her

179
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,520
and hold her hand like this.

180
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,320
What would they talk about?

181
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:25,840
What do you think?

182
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,640
About what?

183
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,800
Will they, through this activity,

184
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,880
open up to each other?

185
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,480
Eventually talk about feelings?

186
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,000
What do you think the first question would be?

187
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,720
What kind of girl do you like?

188
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,000
What kind of boy?

189
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,760
When they open a clam,

190
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,400
they'll ask questions like that.

191
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,000
Do you like this clam?

192
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,520
Then do you like me?

193
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,760
I think any answer is fine.

194
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,840
It's mainly just a way to start a conversation.

195
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,480
Then maybe they'll ask,

196
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,960
the girl opened it first.

197
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,360
Dr. Fang (Fang Yijiong)

198
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,400
You can do it!

199
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,360
It's really purple.

200
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,240
It really is.

201
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,640
That's nice.

202
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:05,960
I think sometimes

203
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,560
when a guy shows a bit of clumsiness,

204
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,960
girls also find it endearing.

205
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,280
This feels just like a TV drama.

206
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,720
Stringing beads.

207
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,880
Romantic.

208
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,320
For example, when the guy is doing it,

209
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,720
the girl watches him.

210
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,280
That's a clear signal.

211
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,400
This date is really great.

212
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,320
Yeah.

213
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,360
Let's go next time.

214
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,760
They've become a couple.

215
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,560
Look, he picked the roundest one.

216
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,440
He gave it to Xu Rulan.

217
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,640
You know him so well.

218
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,400
He wants to save the best for her.

219
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,640
So happy, Dr. Fang (Fang Yijiong).

220
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,920
That was well said.

221
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,960
That's nice.

222
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,880
I really like him.

223
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,920
The three of us guys

224
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,760
are just like rookies.

225
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,320
Sitting here.

226
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,160
This necklace looks great.

227
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,320
Help her put it on.

228
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,080
Even if you can't, you have to say you can.

229
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,640
No way.

230
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,560
I'm shipping them.

231
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,760
That necklace is so pretty.

232
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,200
Yeah.

233
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,280
So pretty.

234
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,080
For Xu Rulan and

235
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,520
Dr. Fang (Fang Yijiong),

236
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,480
Let's wave a big flag for them.

237
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,720
So incredibly happy.

238
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,920
Baby.

239
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,960
You smile too, smile at me.

240
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,520
He managed to meet the person he wanted to.

241
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,000
Say it.

242
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,920
Say it out loud.

243
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,600
Nervous.

244
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,120
Yes, but he's very brave.

245
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,520
A beautiful person.

246
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,800
Okay.

247
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,560
A determined man is attractive.

248
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,000
Very attractive.

249
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,000
I think maybe he can't reply to messages often.

250
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,880
That's a good question.

251
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,400
They're chatting so fast.

252
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,720
Do people all chat like this now?

253
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,400
What is it? She really likes it, right?

254
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,280
Eye mask.

255
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,040
Thoughtful.

256
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,800
Really like it.

257
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,040
I wear it to sleep.

258
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,560
Happy, they're both really happy.

259
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,360
That's so nice.

260
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,040
That's great.

261
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,880
So cool, I want to try too.

262
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,160
Who is this?

263
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,440
Chichi (Sun Hanqing).

264
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,200
I really think Ruilong is handsome.

265
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,600
Zeng Zhaohao is tying your hands here.

266
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,640
You said Ruilong is handsome.

267
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,760
Look up at me, baby.

268
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,120
Why are you feeling hot now?

269
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,440
You're feeling hot, right?

270
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,640
He didn't wrap the hands tightly.

271
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,800
He should do every one.

272
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,800
Finger joint.

273
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,920
Each one should be wrapped around, one by one like this.

274
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,360
You remember now, right?

275
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:18,760
Chichi (Sun Hanqing)

276
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,480
We can't keep complimenting.

277
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,880
If we keep praising, they'll take off soon.

278
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,400
If we keep praising, they'll take off soon.

279
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,560
"Opened up."

280
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,880
"Opened up."

281
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,200
The two of them seem pretty happy.

282
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,200
So sweet.

283
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,880
It's quite natural.

284
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,200
It's like they've known each other for a long time.

285
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,680
This is another pair.

286
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,400
Wang Lechen is on a date with Wang Jue.

287
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,000
Wang Jue.

288
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,320
It seems like they don't have much to talk about.

289
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,920
They don't have much to talk about.

290
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,560
Why are the questions so direct?

291
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,240
They must be talking about her.

292
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,240
A topic she doesn't want to discuss.

293
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,800
Yeah, she's upset.

294
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,560
Yeah, she wants to skip the topic.

295
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,080
I think if he chats like this,

296
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,720
doesn't it show that he actually

297
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,760
wants to

298
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,640
get to know her

299
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,400
or reject her?

300
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,160
I haven't seen your stubborn side yet.

301
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,960
What does "stubborn" mean?

302
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,720
It means being tough-mouthed.

303
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,000
Like having a very stubborn personality.

304
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,400
She still has feelings for him.

305
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,040
It seems like it.

306
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,000
Who is this?

307
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,840
Wang Lechen.

308
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,200
His second match.

309
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,640
Who is his opponent in the second match?

310
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:05,840
It's her.

311
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,800
Duoduo (Ke Ailin).

312
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:09,880
Hide.

313
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,840
Still hiding.

314
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,320
Everyone saw it.

315
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,160
Going to scare him.

316
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,760
So beautiful.

317
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,920
Feels like he and Duoduo (Ke Ailin)

318
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,680
are in a dating state.

319
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,080
The dating state with Wang Jue

320
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,720
The dating state with Wang Jue

321
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,400
is completely different.

322
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:30,760
Coach.

323
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,320
She didn't take over.

324
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,280
Right, she didn't (take over).

325
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,480
Why?

326
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,920
It wasn't given to him by a girl.

327
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,800
Is it a follower card?

328
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,240
Yes, maybe they want to take it slow.

329
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,800
They're both so happy.

330
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,800
That's nice.

331
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,640
Very natural.

332
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,360
They're both quite cheerful.

333
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,040
Yeah.

334
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,400
Take a look back.

335
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,160
Got a hold of it.

336
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,880
Alumni.

337
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,240
They have a lot in common.

338
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,240
Their sports are very similar.

339
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,320
But their personalities complement each other.

340
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,400
Yes.

341
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,720
The two of them must be really happy, this kind of thing.

342
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,320
They're such a perfect match.

343
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:57,840
What's this?

344
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,200
Tap dance.

345
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,520
This is very famous in Shanghai.

346
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,400
That kind of dance.

347
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,280
I want to go too.

348
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,560
Wang Yifan, right?

349
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,960
Jin Yuxing.

350
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,560
Yes.

351
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,160
Alright.

352
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,240
It feels so ceremonial.

353
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,840
Step, step, step.

354
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,920
The one in the back is stealing the spotlight.

355
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,080
They're holding hands.

356
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,200
How come...

357
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,480
We don't need to hold hands.

358
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,800
No need to hold hands.

359
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,640
Teacher.

360
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,080
Awkward.

361
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,400
He remembered.

362
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,760
Trying hard to remember.

363
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,680
So happy.

364
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,200
Okay.

365
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,840
I want to go to this place too.

366
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,360
Let's go.

367
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,000
When we get to Shanghai, let's go too.

368
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,640
Let's go.

369
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,440
It seems like Wang Yifan is more proactive.

370
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,040
Wang Yifan really likes him, seriously.

371
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,200
Love and bread.

372
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,600
An eternal topic.

373
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,360
I think you need bread first.

374
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,280
And then comes love

375
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,560
I think so too

376
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,480
You have your own responsibilities

377
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,800
You can take care of yourself

378
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,080
If you can take care of your family

379
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,360
Then you can also take care of the person you love

380
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,280
That's a responsibility towards her

381
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,000
You need to have this ability first

382
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,720
Only then should you talk about love

383
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,320
Only then should you talk about love

384
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,400
That's how I see it

385
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,320
I feel the same way

386
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,720
I understand, I understand

387
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,520
So you need bread before love

388
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,560
Right

389
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,560
Bread, or rather

390
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,720
The material things we talk about

391
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,600
Actually, maybe more

392
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,360
Are a safety net for love

393
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,240
This safety net is

394
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,640
To prevent you from falling from a high place

395
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,120
It's something

396
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,160
But no one will

397
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:33,960
Because of this safety net

398
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,160
Make your love soar higher

399
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,800
Normally

400
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,280
Most people

401
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,480
Wouldn't make that choice

402
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,280
It's just you

403
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,960
If love comes, you seize love

404
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,120
If bread comes first, you seize bread first

405
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,920
If bread comes first, you seize bread first

406
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,160
If, really

407
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:45,400
Between these two things

408
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:45,800
Between these two things

409
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,960
When they conflict

410
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,520
While respecting your partner

411
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,640
Then make the choice

412
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,520
At least you need to know how your partner

413
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,800
Thinks about this issue

414
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,200
When two people are together, love can turn into familial affection.

415
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,160
He thinks it will.

416
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,640
She thinks it won't.

417
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,880
So, their opinions differ again.

418
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,800
So, what does everyone think?

419
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,720
Will love eventually turn into familial affection?

420
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,240
I don't think so.

421
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,200
For me, it won't.

422
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,280
See?

423
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,040
For me, it absolutely won't.

424
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,480
I think that later on, love might

425
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,520
gain some elements of familial affection.

426
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,120
But it will never completely turn into familial affection.

427
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,640
I wanted to say the same thing.

428
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,520
Because I feel that

429
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,160
we've really been together for six years now.

430
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,720
There are often so many moments

431
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,640
when we can see

432
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,240
stars in each other's eyes.

433
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:30,720
That's what love is.

434
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,080
Yes, I think maybe at the beginning

435
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,400
our love was like this.

436
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,400
But later, our love

437
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,480
became this much.

438
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,480
Maybe at first, our love

439
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,000
was, say, ten milliliters.

440
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,800
Now our love

441
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,680
has become fifty milliliters.

442
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,640
But the water in this cup

443
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,480
is sixty milliliters.

444
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:43,760
Right.

445
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,120
The other ten milliliters have turned into familial affection.

446
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:45,960
The other ten milliliters have turned into familial affection.

447
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,200
There might also be friendship.

448
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,440
And maybe other things mixed in.

449
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,480
I think that in this cup,

450
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,880
the contents are very rich.

451
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,360
Yes.

452
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,160
Because I feel

453
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,800
every time I look into Zhao Qijun's eyes,

454
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,160
Yes.

455
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,160
when I see stars in them,

456
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,760
I always confirm this feeling.

457
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,800
It's a feeling only he can give me.

458
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,560
Well said.

459
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,440
Yes.

460
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,120
I think this is what love is.

461
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,480
Yes, that's really how it is.

462
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,840
Maybe because the two of us

463
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,880
have been together a bit longer than everyone else.

464
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,280
Yes.

465
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,440
Here, use this tissue.

466
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,920
That was beautifully said.

467
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,000
Every year when I watch with you, I end up crying.

468
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,160
That really touched your heart.

469
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,360
That was beautifully said.

470
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,560
It's time for the heart-fluttering text messages again.

471
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,000
Let's take a look

472
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,360
at the messages.

473
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,480
Thank you for your gift and the cake.

474
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,200
Next time, we can try cheese hotpot.

475
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,320
So there will be a next time.

476
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,040
Let it happen more often.

477
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,160
The two of them really get along well.

478
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,400
There's definitely a spark between them.

479
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,120
It's done.

480
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:50,960
It's done.

481
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,800
It ended so quickly.

482
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,720
It's over.

483
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,600
It's over.

484
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,120
I haven't had enough yet.

485
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,600
Play another episode.

486
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,440
Let's have another season.

487
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,880
Please.

488
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,640
Watching their date today

489
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,120
brought back so many memories for us.

490
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,640
Back then, in the cabin,

491
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,200
during some of the dates,

492
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,160
there were many memories.

493
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,840
It was romantic and exciting.

494
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,480
All of it was a sign.

495
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,480
This season,

496
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,200
the guests gave me the impression

497
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,760
that each of them truly

498
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:18,720
during their dates,

499
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,440
their conversations were so close to real life.

500
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,120
Close to life outside the cabin.

501
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,840
Yes.

502
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,040
In my impression,

503
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,360
or in my understanding, I think

504
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,240
being moved, at its core,

505
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,600
is about how you allocate your time.

506
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,680
So, in this process,

507
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,960
through each date, we see

508
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,880
who is willing to show their true self

509
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,080
to the other person.

510
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,200
Actually, that's sending

511
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,240
a kind of signal.

512
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,600
Maybe the signal is wonderful,

513
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,240
maybe it's a bit awkward,

514
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,480
but it's very genuine.

515
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,200
If you pay attention to how time flows,

516
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,840
you'll find the answer you want.

517
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,960
Well said.

518
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,360
Yes.

519
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:45,600
Okay.

520
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,640
Alright.

521
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,880
Let me talk about them.

522
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,400
What I saw today was

523
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,600
the surprise that Fang Yijiong gave me.

524
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,480
A big surprise.

525
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:53,520
A huge surprise.

526
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,160
He's very proactive.

527
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,800
He goes after the girl he likes.

528
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,280
I really hope he succeeds.

529
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,320
I feel

530
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,440
Fang Yijiong and Xu Rulan

531
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,920
that date

532
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,160
left a deep impression on me

533
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,240
because I was just thinking

534
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:04,640
I said

535
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:04,880
why do those two make me feel

536
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,800
why do those two make me feel

537
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,160
make such a strong impression on me

538
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,680
When you watch "Signal of the Heart"

539
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,160
actually, being moved is an instinct

540
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,080
a signal is a kind of test

541
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,760
but for both of these

542
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,880
maybe for us as viewers

543
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,720
it's still not enough

544
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,360
being able to respond to the other's test

545
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,680
I think that's what turns it into fate

546
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,000
that's when it becomes a closed loop

547
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,880
so I feel

548
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,800
Fang Yijiong and Xu Rulan's

549
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,840
During the date,

550
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,720
the two of them actually have a conversation

551
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,720
where they respond to each other.

552
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,840
I can pick up on what you say,

553
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,640
and you can pick up on what I say.

554
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,680
I feel like their connection

555
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,520
or the signals between them

556
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,840
are a bit more obvious.

557
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,440
I think that's pretty interesting.

558
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,080
Of course, I also think that

559
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,560
there might be someone with one-sided feelings.

560
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,040
But I think

561
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,800
there's no need to be too discouraged.

562
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,240
Or anything like that.

563
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:41,960
Because I think

564
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,160
the most heart-fluttering signals

565
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,800
are never sent to a specific person,

566
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,960
but rather to yourself in the house

567
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,600
who is growing this summer.

568
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,560
I think that's the key point.

569
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,040
That was so well said.

570
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,160
Well said.

571
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,400
Everyone should have noticed

572
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,120
that we have something on the table right now.

573
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,960
It's a wish drift bottle.

574
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,440
And then,

575
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,360
this drift bottle

576
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,560
can break through the limits of time

577
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,040
and space.

578
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,920
(It lets) beautiful wishes

579
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,120
spread all over the world.

580
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,640
Yes, it's left for everyone.

581
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,680
I find this scene really familiar.

582
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,120
Really.

583
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,360
It feels like I've seen it somewhere before.

584
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,800
You had a video log before,

585
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,440
on the high-speed train.

586
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,000
It seemed like you were writing in a small notebook.

587
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,240
Or maybe on a cleaning bag.

588
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,800
The reason we wrote that back then

589
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,080
was because we were in a long-distance relationship.

590
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,520
Both of us were traveling between Beijing and Shanghai.

591
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,480
We were constantly going back and forth.

592
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,520
We took the high-speed train between Beijing and Shanghai.

593
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,600
Everyone has taken it countless times.

594
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,640
It connects us with our dreams,

595
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,600
with our families,

596
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,840
and with our loved ones.

597
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,560
So,

598
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,960
we wrote that message on the train

599
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,960
because we wanted to share some of our

600
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,080
wonderful feelings,

601
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,440
some blessings and wishes,

602
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,680
with everyone.

603
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,120
And later on,

604
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,640
many more friends will join us.

605
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,200
They will come to our

606
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,240
"Watch Heartbeat With You" show.

607
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,720
So here, we can write down

608
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,760
some questions

609
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,280
or some things we want them to do,

610
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,800
like small challenges.

611
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,800
Next time on "Watch Heartbeat With You",

612
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,200
those guests will have to

613
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,200
open the notes we wrote.

614
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,400
If there are tasks,

615
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,400
they must complete them.

616
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,320
During "Watching Heartbeat with You",

617
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,440
when it comes to a topic worth discussing,

618
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,240
when the topic arises,

619
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,360
call Tomo (Zhang Hao) to discuss together.

620
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,000
After winning, send me a gift too.

621
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,480
The same one.

622
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,920
Change your Xiaohongshu profile picture

623
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,200
to a photo of the person on your right.

624
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,040
For twelve hours.

625
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,840
Post a

626
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,120
photo from the house that made you happiest.

627
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:19,560
If you don't have one,

628
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,840
then take an ugly photo on the spot.

629
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,440
Post it on Weibo.

630
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,800
Let the next guest help me write

631
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,040
this time's wish.

632
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,200
Wishing everyone gets better and better.

633
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,320
Because I also love saying this to my friends.

634
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,440
The meaning is that whether we meet

635
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,960
or don't meet,

636
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,000
it's the most sincere blessing.

637
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:36,440
Okay.

638
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,800
Alright, let's take a photo together at the end.

639
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,760
Let's capture this moment.

640
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,680
Okay.

641
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,760
Watching Heartbeat with You.

642
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,400
Heartbeat never ends.

643
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,240
See you next time.

644
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,800
Bye-bye.
