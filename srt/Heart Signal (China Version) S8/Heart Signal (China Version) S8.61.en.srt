1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,280
Sit here.

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:09,960
There's another fire pit here.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,160
I really want to light it up.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,320
How do you light it?

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,040
How do you light it?

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:14,800
Rub it.

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,200
Are we just messing around?

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,320
Have you ever watched "Man vs. Wild"?

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:19,560
I have.

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:19,920
You have, right?

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,360
The one with Bear Grylls, right?

12
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,280
Yeah, something like that.

13
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,120
I loved watching it as a kid.

14
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,800
I drew a picture for you.

15
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,080
I'll go get that drawing for you.

16
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:29,800
Okay.

17
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,400
Are you waiting here or...

18
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,160
I'll wait for you here.

19
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:31,920
Okay.

20
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,640
He made a little portrait too.

21
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,640
Do you think you drew it well?

22
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,880
Really well, honestly.

23
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,520
Really?

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,120
Don't you think it looks like you?

25
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,840
Do you know why I drew this?

26
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,640
That's an improvement.

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,920
Didn't I take a photo of you on the boat?

28
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,800
It was this pose.

29
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:23,960
Turn around.

30
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,040
It does look a bit like you.

31
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,280
It's actually pretty cute.

32
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,120
What's this?

33
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,240
It really looks like you.

34
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,840
It really does.

35
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,320
For sure.

36
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,280
It captures your vibe.

37
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,200
I can only draw cartoons like this.

38
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,000
I can't do anything else.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,880
You really did this in one go?

40
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,800
Yeah.

41
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,880
Not bad.

42
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,320
But some details are missing.

43
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,640
You need to fix the hair up here.

44
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,800
You erased some of the details you drew.

45
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,120
How did you notice that?

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,080
I'm very observant.

47
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,360
Just pretend you didn't see it.

48
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,040
I know.

49
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:38,960
You know.

50
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,720
Those two are just giggling here.

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,920
It's pretty cute.

52
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,320
Bye.

53
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:47,960
Bye.

54
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,840
Here they come.

55
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,000
The wind outside feels sweet.

56
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,360
It's alright.

57
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,320
It's sour.

58
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,040
It's alright.

59
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,160
That outfit looks nice.

60
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,320
My jacket.

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,200
How did the talk go?

62
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,200
I think fate is really amazing.

63
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,080
Up to now, with Yu Xing,

64
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,280
we haven't really had any

65
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:24,840
deep

66
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,080
deep conversations.

67
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,840
With Yu Xing,

68
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,400
I feel like we barely know each other.

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,640
How do you feel?

70
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,400
How did you feel after talking?

71
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,840
Honestly, we didn't talk much.

72
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,680
It wasn't deep.

73
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,520
Every topic just ends abruptly.

74
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,200
I noticed

75
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,720
it's always like that.

76
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,080
So today I asked

77
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,040
Yu Xing a question.

78
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,360
I asked, is feeling or getting along more important?

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,080
He said maybe feelings matter more.

80
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,720
So you think feelings matter more too?

81
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,360
I've always

82
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,840
thought feelings were more important.

83
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,680
But this time,

84
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,600
I'm starting to doubt myself.

85
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,280
Because I've always

86
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,560
been someone who believes in love at first sight.

87
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,520
I think love at first sight is more important.

88
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,480
I feel the initial spark is crucial.

89
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,240
And then,

90
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,880
getting along later is important too.

91
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,960
But it's all based on

92
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,760
that first feeling.

93
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,200
But now I think maybe getting along

94
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,600
and fate matter a lot too.

95
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,400
How could it be

96
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,680
How is it possible

97
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,240
so

98
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,000
perfectly timed?

99
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,440
Actually, this time

100
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,880
with Zihan,

101
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,600
on this trip,

102
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,960
I've gotten to know him better.

103
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,000
It feels even more

104
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,680
comfortable being around him.

105
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,600
I've had a great time these past two days.

106
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,680
He really gets me.

107
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,520
So your

108
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,960
preference is...

109
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,600
Honestly, I have no idea now.

110
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,400
I'm totally confused right now.

111
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,680
Dangerous.

112
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,160
Yu Xing is in a risky spot.

113
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,240
Did you talk today?

114
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,040
Did you figure things out?

115
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,880
I don't need to talk it out.

116
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,280
I can just feel it.

117
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,160
I was feeling pretty down just now.

118
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,120
But Yifan came to talk to me.

119
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,320
After chatting, I felt much better.

120
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,720
Yifan and I both agree on one thing.

121
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,400
The journey matters.

122
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,520
The result doesn't.

123
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,280
You can't control the outcome anyway.

124
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,640
If you keep stressing about it,

125
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,840
you'll just make yourself feel worse.

126
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,400
I like how Xiao Jiao is right now.

127
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,440
Last night, I went with

128
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,080
Dr. Fang to get takeout.

129
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,360
We walked there together.

130
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,200
It was way more

131
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,840
fun, relaxed, and enjoyable than I expected.

132
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,000
In my mind,

133
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,640
if you truly like someone,

134
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,840
then I think

135
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,720
liking them doesn't mean you have to be with them.

136
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:08,840
Just...

137
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,360
If she's with someone else

138
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,320
and she's happy,

139
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,920
I'm okay with that.

140
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,480
That's how it should be.

141
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:23,920
I think

142
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,120
actually, everyone is in a

143
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,440
state that's easy to understand.

144
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,240
What I really think is

145
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,240
Zihan's state is

146
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,560
it's just his rational side telling him

147
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,320
not to care about it.

148
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,520
But emotionally, he's actually a bit

149
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,280
he's feeling a bit upset.

150
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,720
Don't forget

151
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,040
this time they met

152
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,440
was right after a two-day trip.

153
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,680
You spent two days with this person,

154
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,560
and both were happy.

155
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,920
As for Zihan,

156
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,680
he said himself

157
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,800
he's someone who needs feedback.

158
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,280
I might think

159
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,400
Zihan still has a chance.

160
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,800
Because Chichi said she's now

161
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,960
really confused.

162
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,120
Before this, she always

163
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,280
had a clear preference.

164
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,080
She had a preference.

165
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,640
Yeah.

166
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,040
Her original preference right now

167
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,680
Her original preference right now

168
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,640
has turned into confusion.

169
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,600
But she only told Duoduo about that.

170
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,760
Zihan doesn't know.

171
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,200
Right.

172
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,280
The difference is he doesn't know about their talk.

173
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,480
So he

174
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,240
at that moment,

175
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,200
saw them chatting up there for so long,

176
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,600
and his mood was actually very

177
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,640
But I feel

178
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,680
in these two days Zihan and Chichi spent together,

179
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,800
it's not just Chichi who felt comfortable.

180
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,920
Zihan should also feel

181
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,680
that when Chichi is with him,

182
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,360
her state

183
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,320
is both good and relaxed.

184
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,880
I think she (Chichi) might be

185
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,880
slowly finding her comfort zone.

186
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,200
With Yu Xing, she always felt

187
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,880
it just ends abruptly.

188
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,720
Yeah.

189
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,880
The topics always make her feel

190
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,480
far from what she imagines or can control.

191
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,440
Actually, Yu Xing

192
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,080
doesn't intentionally ignore

193
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,040
her feelings.

194
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,880
But sometimes he can't see

195
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,160
because

196
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,280
he truly doesn't know

197
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,120
where her emotional needs are.

198
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,280
Because they're not on the same wavelength.

199
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,040
But you know, for girls,

200
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,280
if emotional needs

201
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,280
are never met,

202
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,840
it can be really disappointing.

203
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,120
He can't see her emotional needs,

204
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,560
but Zihan can.

205
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,040
When Chichi says she wants to change,

206
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,680
Zihan will tell her

207
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,960
what change really looks like.

208
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,640
And then tell her

209
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,200
you can

210
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,640
relieve stress in other ways.

211
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,480
Eat something sweet,

212
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,560
have food to ease the pressure.

213
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,040
Zihan always manages to meet

214
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,880
Chichi's emotional needs.

215
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,000
Her hesitation is

216
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,440
Her hesitation is

217
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,600
is feeling more important

218
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,160
or is being together more important?

219
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,760
I think feeling is the key to open the door.

220
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,520
Only with feelings do I want to spend time together.

221
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,720
It depends on the person.

222
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,000
Some people can really, through being together,

223
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,960
develop stronger feelings.

224
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,520
Some people might

225
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,040
start with feelings first,

226
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,760
but after spending time together,

227
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,360
those feelings might fade away.

228
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,280
So this

229
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,320
question

230
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,560
the answer to this question

231
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,760
really depends on fate.

232
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,400
But I personally think both are important.

233
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,600
Feeling is important,

234
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,800
because without feelings,

235
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,920
why would you want to start with someone?

236
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:46,920
Right?

237
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,800
But being together

238
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,440
decides how far you can go together.

239
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,480
So both matter.

240
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,400
In real life,

241
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,120
there are mostly two kinds of feelings.

242
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,800
One is a strong feeling right from the start.

243
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,440
Yeah.

244
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,480
The other is like

245
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,640
developing feelings as you spend time together.

246
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:02,960
So

247
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,680
people usually choose different kinds of feelings,

248
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,280
not just having or not having feelings.

249
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:06,880
Right.

250
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,600
Yes.

251
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,040
Many young people might think

252
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,440
that the strong feeling at the start

253
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,440
is greater than the feeling that grows

254
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,480
slowly while being together.

255
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,080
When people are young,

256
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,440
their values

257
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,200
lean more toward the first kind.

258
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,600
They associate the first kind more

259
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,400
with the possibility of true love.

260
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,840
That feeling that grows while being together

261
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,640
is just a bit of feeling.

262
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,880
It's not necessarily less than

263
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,880
the strong feeling at the start.

264
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,160
Yes.

265
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,240
They're just two different things.

266
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,080
I really agree with this because

267
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,120
feelings

268
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,880
can be very risky.

269
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,560
Often, feelings are just your own imagination.

270
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,440
Really.

271
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,600
A lot of times,

272
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
people interact based on their own imagination

273
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,160
of what someone is like.

274
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,600
I think he's a certain way,

275
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,080
so I expect him to be that way.

276
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,520
But

277
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,760
what is he really like?

278
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,560
You only find out by spending time together.

279
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,440
There's nothing wrong with that.

280
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,400
I just think this is

281
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,480
the biggest risk.

282
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,120
Your disappointment and gap

283
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,760
may come from the real person

284
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,000
being different from

285
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,480
the one you imagined.

286
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,320
Yes.

287
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,040
Let's go.

288
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,600
Next,

289
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,840
let's look ahead.

290
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:14,840
Here we go.

291
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,200
It's about to be revealed.

292
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,880
The only one.

293
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,720
The "Sunset Hour" invitation card.

294
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,160
Whoever sends a name first

295
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,600
will get the final

296
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,840
chance for a "Sunset Hour" date.

297
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,440
Is it a race for speed?

298
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,640
So nervous.

299
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,320
Go!

300
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,920
It's time for the final push.

301
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,120
Final push.

302
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,040
Who is it?

303
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,720
I already know who it is.

304
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,400
First, rule out

305
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,000
Duoduo.

306
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,600
You—

307
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,680
Your guess is actually pretty

308
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,840
thoughtless.

309
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,160
But it's accurate.

310
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,760
Thanks for the pep talk.

311
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,080
Okay.

312
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,040
So, today's

313
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,760
deduction is

314
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,640
just

315
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,800
the final

316
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,760
"Sunset Hour" date

317
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,400
pairing.

318
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,680
Makes me

319
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,520
Every time we get here, I

320
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,040
kind of want to

321
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,000
try something offbeat.

322
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,360
Zihan and Duoduo.

323
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,320
That's way too wild.

324
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,120
Just letting you know,

325
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,600
Ruilong already left.

326
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,920
Don't go too off the rails.

327
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,320
You never know,

328
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,880
what if Ruilong is secretly

329
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,120
back this episode?

330
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,600
You never know.

331
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,040
Okay, I'm just kidding. Alright.

332
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,560
I'm done writing.

333
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,720
Okay, if you're done,

334
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,000
share with us first.

335
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,520
Xiao Fang, Lanlan.

336
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,360
You're so good at guessing,

337
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,640
this is too easy for you.

338
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,680
Pick another.

339
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,160
No, I just want to see those two.

340
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,320
Alright.

341
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:39,840
Sure.

342
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,480
Hani, who did you pick?

343
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,120
Doctor Fang and Lanlan.

344
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,400
Nice drawing.

345
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,920
That's interesting.

346
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,920
Yours is way too easy.

347
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,880
Draw another pair.

348
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,720
Let's think first

349
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,360
about who will make a dash.

350
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:55,800
Okay.

351
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,680
First, Doctor Fang

352
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,880
will definitely go for it.

353
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,920
He's holding back for sure.

354
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,440
Yeah.

355
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,520
And Zihan will definitely go for it.

356
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,200
Right? Will Yu Xing go for it?

357
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:04,760
Yu Xing is—

358
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,800
Yu Xing. That's who I wrote.

359
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,080
I agree with you.

360
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,880
I think he

361
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,880
Let me explain why.

362
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,160
Last time, Yu Xing

363
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,440
didn't get it.

364
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:11,880
So

365
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,280
this time

366
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,160
I get it.

367
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:14,960
So you

368
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,760
wrote which pair?

369
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,600
I wrote Zihan and Chichi.

370
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,640
Because I think that's harder.

371
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,360
Xiao Ma, you picked Zihan?

372
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,960
I'm torn between two.

373
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,280
I'm leaning toward Zihan

374
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,720
or Yu Xing.

375
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,880
Should I switch to Yu Xing's side?

376
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,200
Honestly, I want Zihan.

377
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,640
Because I think Zihan is the final

378
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,840
one to make a move.

379
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,880
But I think right now

380
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,200
he's holding back.

381
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,920
It's Yu Xing.

382
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,360
No matter what, he

383
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,560
can't miss another chance.

384
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,160
Me, Yu Xing.

385
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,040
I drew another pair too.

386
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,560
I'm really looking forward to this pair.

387
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,240
Zihan and Chichi.

388
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,400
You drew it so well.

389
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,840
It's obvious at a glance.

390
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,360
So Hani,

391
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,800
you can only pick one pair.

392
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,440
Only one pair can win, right?

393
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:58,800
Yes.

394
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,040
I think Doctor Fang will go for it.

395
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:03,760
Now we're at

396
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,640
the final moment.

397
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,880
Show your picks.

398
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,720
Okay.

399
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,440
Everything's decided.

400
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,720
Let's see

401
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,480
who our

402
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:16,880
"Sunset Hour"

403
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,640
date pair is.

404
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,040
Who will it be?

405
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,360
Jasmine blooms—it's the signal of love.

406
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,440
Next, we enter

407
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,160
Master Kong Jasmine Tea's romantic moment.

408
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,440
Who will get our "Sunset Hour" date

409
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,840
in the end?

410
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,360
Everyone, let's watch.

411
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,840
Whose pants are these?

412
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,800
That hand looks like Chichi's.

413
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,560
Long hair.

414
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,480
Chichi.

415
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,800
It's Chichi.

416
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,160
Who is Chichi with?

417
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,040
Okay.

418
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,920
Now the answer is

419
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,120
between these two guys.

420
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,960
Yu Xing?

421
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,640
Hello, Yu Xing.

422
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,720
Yu Xing.

423
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,800
Yu Xing. It's Yu Xing.

424
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,160
Hello.

425
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,040
I—

426
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,440
I'm really happy for Yu Xing.

427
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,120
He finally

428
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,200
made his move.

429
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:19,800
Yeah.

430
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:20,720
Come on.

431
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,680
Let's see what Yu Xing does this time.

432
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,800
Hello, Yu Xing.

433
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,800
Hello.

434
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,240
Your hair looks beautiful today.

435
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,160
Thank you.

436
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,480
It's a bit steep over here.

437
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,840
Is it easy for you to walk?

438
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,800
It's fine.

439
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,400
Let me help you.

440
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,440
I'll carry it for you.

441
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,800
So you sent that message yesterday.

442
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:00,680
Yeah.

443
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,000
He finally got ahead.

444
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,440
Yesterday, when I saw the last line,

445
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,240
I didn't think much, I just sent it.

446
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,200
Sent it.

447
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,080
Okay, yesterday I was still

448
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,320
trying to figure it out.

449
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,400
Yeah, I was also figuring it out on day one.

450
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,560
Just the first day.

451
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,800
I thought only matched people would get it.

452
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,240
But I didn't expect

453
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,280
only the first person to send would get it.

454
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,880
So I learned my lesson yesterday.

455
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,560
I didn't finish reading, but I sent it right away.

456
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,600
That's awesome.

457
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,240
When you got the message,

458
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,000
did you not know

459
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,920
who invited you?

460
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,040
I didn't know.

461
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,040
Take your drink.

462
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,920
You might get a bit thirsty.

463
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,160
Let's go.

464
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,360
When I was waiting for you under the tree,

465
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,280
the wind was blowing,

466
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,560
and the leaves on the tree kept

467
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,040
fluttering.

468
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,680
They really looked like green butterflies

469
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,640
resting on the trunk.

470
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,640
It's so unique.

471
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,040
So beautiful.

472
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,640
That must be a young grasshopper.

473
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,440
Its color is so fresh and green.

474
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,400
It jumps so lightly.

475
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,080
You still keep your sense of humor.

476
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,600
Have you ever ridden a hot air balloon?

477
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:19,960
I haven't.

478
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,160
Me neither.

479
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,960
It reminds me of "Up."

480
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:25,960
Yeah.

481
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,440
This should be

482
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,960
our last date.

483
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,000
But no matter how many times,

484
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,400
cherishing the moment is enough.

485
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,360
Seeing this hot air balloon,

486
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,120
I thought of

487
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,400
an episode of "Detective Conan."

488
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:45,800
What?

489
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,840
"The Hot Air Balloon Murder Case."

490
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,680
"Murder Incident."

491
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,000
Did you see this fire?

492
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,600
I did.

493
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,280
Feels like I'm getting roasted.

494
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,440
Do you want to switch places with me?

495
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,280
Because I think your side

496
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,320
is a bit lighter.

497
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,280
It's a bit light.

498
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,360
Sure.

499
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,720
That's thoughtful.

500
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,240
We're taking off.

501
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,760
We're flying so fast.

502
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,160
I think so too, it's really fast.

503
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,400
How did it rise so quickly?

504
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,280
It moves side to side.

505
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,680
How high can we go?

506
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,400
The rope is taut.

507
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,840
The rope is taut.

508
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,480
So beautiful.

509
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,760
It's nice.

510
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,480
You're actually pretty brave.

511
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,920
Really?

512
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,480
You're just leaning on this.

513
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,440
But honestly, we don't need

514
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,760
any seatbelts here.

515
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,920
What?

516
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,680
I mean, honestly,

517
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,760
we don't need to fasten any safety ropes

518
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,680
or anything like that?

519
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:57,720
What's up, you're at it again.

520
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,080
What's up, you're at it again.

521
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,200
No, it's just

522
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,080
for safety reasons.

523
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,480
What?

524
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,760
What are you doing?

525
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,560
Nothing.

526
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,720
I just thought, didn't he say

527
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,560
it gets a bit unstable when rising?

528
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,840
That's actually pretty funny.

529
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,680
You're really nervous.

530
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,960
I'm not nervous.

531
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,520
I'm just a little

532
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,360
rational about it.

533
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,320
Stubborn.

534
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,600
Are we at the highest point?

535
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,160
Yes.

536
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,040
It's much cooler up here.

537
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,680
It is.

538
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,600
The lake's reflection looks like a whale's tail.

539
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,600
It does.

540
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,120
That one looks like a drumstick.

541
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,600
That one looks like a rabbit.

542
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,440
It really does.

543
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,000
And that one looks like

544
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,400
a bear.

545
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,360
I think that looks like a bear.

546
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:01,720
Yeah.

547
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,800
I see its ears.

548
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,600
And its nose and face.

549
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,920
Its mouth is open.

550
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,080
It's really nice.

551
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,560
It's got its own charm.

552
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,080
To me, they all look like drumsticks and wings.

553
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,840
I'm hungry.

554
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,680
So beautiful.

555
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,600
It's nice.

556
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,080
The sunset is almost gone.

557
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,200
Yeah.

558
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,280
When I came earlier, I saw

559
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:34,920
a sign

560
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,800
that said

561
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,400
Life is a vast sea, a journey through endless mountains and rivers.

562
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,120
So do you prefer sunrise or sunset?

563
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,640
Honestly, I like sunset.

564
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,280
Why?

565
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,200
Because I think

566
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,560
the warmth from it is just right.

567
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,480
It's about to turn into

568
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,960
a quiet night.

569
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,200
So do you prefer morning or...

570
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,960
I like sunrise.

571
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,720
Sunrise.

572
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,640
Because sunrise means hope to me.

573
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,240
Hope.

574
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,680
A new day begins again.

575
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,680
The sunset really is beautiful.

576
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,400
It sets so quickly.

577
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,120
It's almost gone now.

578
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,440
This view is just stunning.

579
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,120
I remember you said you love the sea.

580
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,560
Between mountains and sea, you prefer the sea.

581
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,920
I like the sea.

582
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,920
Really?

583
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,720
So, what do you think about mountains?

584
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,960
Mountains? How do I see them...

585
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,880
I think they're very...

586
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,160
Lonely.

587
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,080
Mountains feel lonely.

588
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,400
And quiet.

589
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,760
The sea has the sound of waves.

590
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,800
But mountains...

591
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,240
They're silent and mysterious.

592
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,960
I find the sea even more mysterious.

593
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,000
The sea is full of the unknown.

594
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,680
Mountains give me a sense of...

595
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,160
security and acceptance.

596
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,160
Look at Chichi.

597
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:16,520
She's someone who really...

598
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,560
needs security and acceptance.

599
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,320
Right, that's why she likes mountains.

600
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,040
So that saying...

601
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,200
I think it's pretty good.

602
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,040
Life is a vast sea,

603
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,200
a journey through endless mountains and rivers.

604
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,360
and that's all there is.

605
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,320
Have you read it?

606
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:34,840
No, I haven't.

607
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,680
Is it a book?

608
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,240
Mai Jia's "Life is a Vast Sea"

609
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,560
By Mai Jia.

610
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,400
How do you interpret it?

611
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,360
Life might be like the waves,

612
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,040
or like mountains and rivers,

613
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,960
rising and falling.

614
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,800
There are highs and lows.

615
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,560
But...

616
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,920
that's all there is.

617
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,120
That's all there is.

618
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,440
I think like this...

619
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,360
Staring at this view is so relaxing.

620
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,360
At night, with a gentle breeze...

621
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,920
You can lie down or sit...

622
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,520
and with...

623
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,080
the people beside you...

624
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,440
doing anything together feels nice.

625
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,880
Yeah, just chatting.

626
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,000
Even if...

627
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,480
it's something meaningless,

628
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,920
it still feels meaningful.

629
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,120
I think a hot air balloon...

630
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,360
can bring two people really close.

631
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,680
When you look at the scenery...

632
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,480
it gives you so many feelings.

633
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,800
In that moment, you see so many images.

634
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,320
It's easier then to have...

635
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,920
deeper conversations.

636
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,360
It's perfect for them right now.

637
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,160
We're landing now, right?

638
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,960
Safe landing.

639
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,000
Feel relieved now?

640
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,480
I was never worried.

641
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,160
I've always felt at ease.

642
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,480
Let's go.

643
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,760
You know, my shoes...

644
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,800
step on the grass and it's a hole every time.

645
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,640
Every step is a hole.

646
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,920
If I step harder...

647
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,360
my foot gets stuck.

648
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,400
It deflated so fast.

649
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,160
Stepped into the mud.

650
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,240
Careful.

651
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,280
Right?

652
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:53,640
Stepped into a hole.

653
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,360
Right?

654
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,160
Told you.

655
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,000
So fast.

656
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,480
Really fast.

657
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,560
Feels like we just went up and now we're down.

658
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,520
It really feels like...

659
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,160
our time in the house.

660
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:23,920
Really.

661
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,240
It's over.

662
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,680
Such a sad topic.

663
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,440
Hard to let go.

664
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,640
Watermelon.

665
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,560
Want some?

666
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,680
Watermelon.

667
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:40,880
Thanks.

668
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,480
It might fall.

669
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,200
It's losing its last bit of air.

670
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,400
Actually, life in the house is really...

671
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,640
quite different from my usual life.

672
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,600
My usual life is, relatively speaking,

673
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,080
a bit more passive.

674
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,880
It's just...

675
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,240
I always feel there's more time, more chances.

676
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,640
After coming to the house, I think...

677
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,720
sometimes people really should...

678
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,480
seize the moment.

679
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,960
If right now there's...

680
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,360
a chance to do something you want,

681
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,200
you should do it right away.

682
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,440
Life doesn't give you that many chances.

683
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,880
When it's right in front of you.

684
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,120
I've had this happen before.

685
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:32,960
Things like this.

686
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,880
I've learned some lessons.

687
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,960
Back then, I really wanted to see...

688
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,360
LeBron James play live.

689
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,840
But I thought, forget it.

690
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,800
Because I felt...

691
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,560
maybe next year or another time,

692
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,040
I could go then.

693
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,360
But then I went back home.

694
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,040
And never went back.

695
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,080
You think there'll be another chance, right?

696
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,920
So you always have to seize the moment.

697
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,840
So you always have to seize the moment.

698
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,160
Like yesterday, I really just...

699
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,840
saw a few words.

700
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,040
Sunset Hour date.

701
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,520
And then, right away...

702
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,120
I saw those words...

703
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,560
and I sent it.

704
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,040
And I used your nickname.

705
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,760
Chichi, it was so quick.

706
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,400
Chichi, it was so quick.

707
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:36,920
I guess now...

708
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,760
my phone suggests "cc"...

709
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,920
which means Chichi.

710
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,640
That works.

711
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,400
So how do you see yourself
in the house?

712
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,240
Compared to the self
you know outside?

713
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,720
What's different
between the two?

714
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,440
I think

715
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,240
I never expected

716
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,360
that I would actually be

717
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,920
someone who acts so slowly.

718
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,800
I always thought I was

719
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,600
super decisive and efficient.

720
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,920
Maybe it depends
on the situation.

721
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,200
Like, the work version of me

722
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,000
is different from
the emotional me.

723
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,800
They're just not the same.

724
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,080
Or the family version of me

725
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,240
is also different.

726
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,160
Actually, at home

727
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,160
in front of my parents

728
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,520
I'm not the same as
I am with friends.

729
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,160
It's just different.

730
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,880
How so?

731
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,560
With my parents,

732
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,440
I barely talk.

733
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,920
But with my brother and sister,

734
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,120
I'm just like with friends.

735
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,880
So do you tell them
everything, or...

736
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,040
do you keep some things
to yourself?

737
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,960
No.

738
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,200
Definitely not.

739
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,520
So who do you talk to
when you need to?

740
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,720
Honestly, I rarely
open up to anyone.

741
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,680
I don't really share
negative feelings

742
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:52,280
I don't really share
negative feelings

743
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,680
with other people.

744
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,120
That's just like me.

745
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,080
I'm the same way.

746
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,320
But I think that's not good.

747
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,120
Why not?

748
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,680
I think you should
talk about things.

749
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,560
Depends on what it is.

750
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,160
Some feelings, you know,

751
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,360
just need to be processed
on your own.

752
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,120
After that, you can
solve the problem.

753
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,880
When you're not emotional,

754
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,680
it's easier to handle things.

755
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,480
I think it's more

756
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,360
helpful and efficient.

757
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,120
So, what do you think

758
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,160
about my

759
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,400
"Kim's lecture"?

760
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,160
Did you feel

761
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,520
like I was lecturing you?

762
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,680
I didn't feel lectured at all.

763
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,520
I usually just

764
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,800
share my own feelings

765
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,560
and opinions.

766
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,800
But strangely,

767
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,560
some people think

768
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,600
I'm just arguing.

769
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,760
When I talk to people,

770
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,880
I really want

771
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,720
to hear different opinions.

772
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,400
I hope they'll debate with me.

773
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,360
I want us to have a real exchange.

774
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,600
I want them to be honest.

775
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,120
I'm the same way.

776
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,840
Your hairstyle looks great today.

777
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,680
When you walked over,

778
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,480
you looked like a princess
from a castle.

779
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,240
Really.

780
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,360
How come you're so expressive now?

781
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,240
Because usually

782
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,760
I only

783
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,160
say what I truly feel inside.

784
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,160
Why does it feel like Yu Xing

785
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,560
is suddenly so good at talking today?

786
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,400
Look, the stars are so bright.

787
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,080
Yeah.

788
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,920
Even the regular stars now

789
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,640
shine like the North Star.

790
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,920
The blue is beautiful.

791
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,200
How are you feeling,
tired from playing?

792
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,760
Is the massage chair
strong enough for you?

793
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,520
Is this auto-start?

794
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,560
So relaxing.

795
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,160
Feels like I'll be recharged
in no time.

796
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:15,600
Yeah.

797
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,680
I switched on Relax Mode
ahead of time.

798
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,080
RELAX MODE IS NOW ON.

799
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,760
Please take a good rest.

800
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,840
And these mood lights

801
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,200
are pretty dreamy too.

802
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,320
Just relax for a bit.

803
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,040
This mode is really comfortable.

804
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,680
Let's head out again
in a little while.

805
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,080
Okay, thanks.

806
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,080
Let's go.

807
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,280
I was talking to Duoduo
last night

808
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,080
about how you all chose

809
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,320
this trip

810
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,480
and the outcome.

811
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,080
Yeah.

812
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,720
So what were you thinking
back then?

813
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,640
Stick to what matters.

814
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,360
You think I should stick to

815
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,840
what I believe in?

816
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,320
Everyone should stick to

817
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,560
what matters to them.

818
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,200
That's true.

819
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,840
At first, my idea was

820
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,920
to do what you suggested.

821
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,360
But later, I got

822
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,280
a new perspective
into my

823
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,600
way of thinking.

824
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,080
So I started wondering,

825
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,400
when you girls made
the date choices

826
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,840
how did everyone decide?

827
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,640
Honestly,

828
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,280
about your thoughts,

829
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,920
I can only

830
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,320
guess, more or less.

831
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,880
Because

832
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,680
the date before last

833
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,320
had those date cards, right?

834
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,360
There were two cards
at the time.

835
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,960
I wasn't sure if you

836
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,520
wanted to know

837
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,720
which side

838
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,360
or if you were unsure
about my thoughts

839
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,040
so you made your final choice.

840
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,520
She really cares

841
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,000
about that factor.

842
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,480
That's a factor too.

843
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,920
Another factor is

844
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,160
you have to consider

845
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,760
staying up till dawn

846
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,600
actually affects everyone.

847
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,840
It really does.

848
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,680
Right?

849
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:43,960
If at that time

850
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,440
I don't think it was my choice,

851
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,360
then the problem
couldn't be solved.

852
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,480
What do you think?

853
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:55,720
What do you think?

854
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,360
Is it really late now?

855
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,640
Eight o'clock.

856
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,520
What do you mean by "late now"?

857
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,960
That's not the time you should ask about.

858
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,880
The time right now today.

859
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,080
I see, it's eight o'clock now.

860
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,600
Chichi is asking.

861
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,400
Are we getting to know each other
better now?

862
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,440
Is it too late?

863
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,560
Is our pace too slow?

864
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,520
He said eight o'clock.

865
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,280
Are you talking about fate?

866
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,600
So I think fate is fascinating.

867
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,720
I've kept asking if you think it's late.

868
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,200
Because I really do think it's late.

869
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,520
Is it late?

870
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,560
What I wanted to tell you was,

871
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,320
the best time to plant a tree

872
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,200
was ten years ago.

873
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,720
The next best time is now.

874
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,240
I think it's fine.

875
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,440
I don't think it's late.

876
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,480
After living in the house,

877
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,960
I think seizing the moment matters.

878
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,520
But you're not someone who acts fast.

879
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,480
I've changed myself.

880
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,560
If I hadn't sent

881
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,560
that message first yesterday,

882
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,800
do you think we'd have a chance
to talk today?

883
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,320
To discuss this here?

884
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,240
I just react slowly sometimes.

885
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,160
But I

886
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,800
will change myself.

887
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,040
Yu Xing is picking up the pace now.

888
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,040
But Chichi has already...

889
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,240
Yu Xing is a bit too slow.

890
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,520
He's the slowest of the slow.

891
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,680
Yeah.

892
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,840
I think the timing you're going for

893
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,920
is just slow.

894
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,480
He missed out because he's slow.

895
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,080
And missing out makes him slower.

896
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,920
Their frequencies aren't aligned.

897
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,560
It's like humans can't hear

898
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,280
dolphin frequencies.

899
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,280
The dolphins keep talking,

900
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,320
or the humans keep talking,

901
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,120
but the other side can't catch it.

902
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,280
I think before

903
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,280
today's Sunset Hour date,

904
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,600
we focused more on

905
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,920
Yu Xing not being proactive enough,

906
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,480
or not being fast enough.

907
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,520
But

908
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,280
after seeing

909
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,360
today's Sunset Hour date,

910
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,520
when he finally took initiative,

911
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,160
I actually felt

912
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,880
like I saw other issues.

913
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:16,720
Yeah.

914
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,160
Yu Xing's whole vibe,

915
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,680
the way he handles things,

916
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,000
the way he thinks,

917
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
might all be different from Chichi.

918
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Actually, this date

919
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,520
was the most limiting for them.

920
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,960
In a tiny space,

921
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,600
in that little spot,

922
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,120
you look at me, I look at you,

923
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,000
nothing to do but talk.

924
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,680
Even in this kind of

925
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,120
setting for communication,

926
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,000
they still couldn't connect well.

927
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,400
Of course,

928
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,720
timing is another factor.

929
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,320
You might miss one thing,

930
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,120
and then miss many more after.

931
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,960
If you take one wrong step,

932
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,400
there could be several more after.

933
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,800
You have to work to fix it.

934
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,320
So,

935
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,480
the path you have to take

936
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,360
is longer than others.

937
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,480
You have to do more.

938
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,400
I think all these

939
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,080
are reasons.

940
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:01,880
Because it's not just

941
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,920
one single reason.

942
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,480
It's all the things we just mentioned

943
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,320
added together

944
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,320
that led to this situation.

945
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:08,760
Right?

946
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,200
But Yu Xing's changes and effort

947
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,800
are worth recognizing.

948
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,840
Yes, you can see it.

949
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,160
And at the same time,

950
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,440
let's keep watching

951
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,600
what's happening

952
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,160
on the other side.

953
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,880
I also prepared something for you.

954
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,480
I was just kidding about what I said.

955
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,040
Kidding about what?

956
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,120
I don't like you.

957
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:09,840
You really don't like me.

958
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,240
Just kidding.

959
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,640
You don't like me, huh?

960
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,800
Then no gift for you.

961
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,280
I'm giving up.

962
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,680
I'll go get your gift.

963
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,120
I'll go get your gift.

964
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,880
Gift.

965
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,160
Giving a gift.

966
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,800
Kite.

967
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,800
Kite, flying a kite.

968
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,680
Two people doing something romantic.

969
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,560
What's this?

970
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:50,960
Two gifts.

971
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:51,600
Surprise.

972
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,160
Let me introduce.

973
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:52,560
What's this?

974
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,240
Is it a kite?

975
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,640
This is a kite.

976
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,720
And this is...

977
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,320
a graduation gown I prepared.

978
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,880
He wants to be with her.

979
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,200
Be with her for graduation (trip).

980
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,520
Didn't she miss the graduation trip?

981
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,680
Because she traveled with him,

982
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,080
he took her graduation photos.

983
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:12,600
I think so.

984
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,120
That's a thoughtful detail.

985
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,760
It's detailed and ceremonial.

986
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,600
This is...

987
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,800
the graduation gown I prepared.

988
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,080
She cried.

989
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,920
Don't cry.

990
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,000
Don't cry.

991
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,120
It's really touching.

992
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:42,880
Why does this suddenly feel

993
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,120
like a surprise proposal?

994
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,800
Like pulling out a wedding dress.

995
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,560
Why are you so annoying?

996
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,400
Come on.

997
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,680
I look so ugly right now.

998
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,240
You don't.

999
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,280
Didn't you say your graduation is on the twentieth?

1000
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,800
Are you attending the graduation ceremony?

1001
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,800
And the house messed up
your graduation trip.

1002
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,080
your graduation trip.

1003
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,880
And now we're here in Xinjiang.

1004
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,880
How about we go take photos now?

1005
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,360
Is that okay?

1006
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:28,880
Let's go. Sure!

1007
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,680
Of course!

1008
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,280
My eyes are all teary right now.

1009
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,560
Don't cry.

1010
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,280
I think girls would be really touched.

1011
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,360
This moment is really

1012
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,160
so moving.

1013
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,280
Graduation really is

1014
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,400
pretty wonderful.

1015
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,760
Let's go.

1016
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,640
You really did all this behind my back.

1017
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,680
Mainly because

1018
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,720
I never had a graduation ceremony either.

1019
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,160
I don't want you to have regrets.

1020
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,520
I don't want to leave you with regrets.

1021
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,040
Are you ready?

1022
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,480
Three.

1023
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,920
Two.

1024
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,520
One.

1025
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,400
Your graduation trip is so cool.

1026
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,160
Do you still dislike me?

1027
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,680
You don't anymore, right?

1028
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,640
I want to take a photo with you.

1029
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,240
How do I get up here?

1030
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:27,880
I can't get up.

1031
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,280
You stand.

1032
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,240
Okay, I'll hold the horse.

1033
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,480
Happy graduation!

1034
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,760
When you throw it, I'll snap the photo.

1035
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,920
Alright, let's go.

1036
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,040
It didn't go out.

1037
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,280
It's fine if it didn't fly.

1038
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,400
This one's great.

1039
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,880
Actually, I prepared two sets.

1040
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,280
Let's put them on and take photos together.

1041
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,680
Hope no one says

1042
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,600
I'm trying to look young.

1043
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,240
Graduating together.

1044
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:16,920
So romantic.

1045
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,720
What are you doing?

1046
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,280
We're adults now.

1047
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:25,920
Alright.

1048
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:27,600
Let's go.

1049
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:28,760
Three.

1050
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,360
Two.

1051
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:31,360
Thank you.

1052
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,280
I got to "graduate" too.

1053
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,000
I "graduated" as well.

1054
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,440
Throw it to the side.

1055
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:37,840
Got this one on camera.

1056
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,560
Nice.

1057
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:39,920
This shot is good.

1058
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,600
Unforgettable for a lifetime.

1059
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,080
These two made it.

1060
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,640
Honey, are you here?

1061
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,640
I'm imagining it too.

1062
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,120
I've already stuck my head in.

1063
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,360
Let's go fly a kite.

1064
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:55,800
Why did you want to give a kite?

1065
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,560
I thought

1066
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,720
you could write what you want to say

1067
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:01,600
on it.

1068
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Then let it fly.

1069
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,640
Should we write on the back?

1070
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:05,880
Let it fly.

1071
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,720
I really like this.

1072
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,200
Write to each other.

1073
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,680
Why are you attacking me right away?

1074
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,520
Her wish is about Le Chen.

1075
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,000
Don't worry.

1076
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:33,920
Be happy every day.

1077
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,440
Write for each other.

1078
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,240
That's pretty cute.

1079
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,440
Write wishes for each other.

1080
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,200
Yeah.

1081
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:52,600
Little puppy.

1082
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,720
Come here, come here.

1083
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:09,960
Finished writing.

1084
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:16,560
It's so hot.

1085
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,080
Take off your jacket.

1086
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,000
Are you taking it off?

1087
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:19,720
Yeah.

1088
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,640
What did he write?

1089
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,400
Someone who cares about you
cares about everything about you.

1090
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,440
Love yourself well.

1091
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,480
He wrote so thoughtfully.

1092
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,160
It even made you pause.

1093
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,800
It's too messy.

1094
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,160
No, it's not.

1095
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:00,800
Not at all.

1096
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,240
Someone who cares about you
will always care.

1097
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,440
Don't cry.

1098
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,840
Both sides are so sincere.

1099
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:30,880
What's wrong?

1100
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,360
Don't cry.

1101
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,320
Let's go.

1102
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,080
Can you run?

1103
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,040
I can run.

1104
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:00,600
Then you take it.

1105
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,320
You let go first.

1106
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,800
Then I'll hold this.

1107
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:05,520
You run.

1108
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,400
It's windy here.

1109
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,200
Don't bite.

1110
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,960
So cute.

1111
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,360
Let go.

1112
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:17,680
Yeah.

1113
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,440
Run that way.

1114
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,040
The wind's blowing from there.

1115
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,480
This scene is just beautiful.

1116
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,640
Really.

1117
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,800
You hold it for a bit.

1118
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:43,880
Look.

1119
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,200
It's up.

1120
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,880
Very nice.

1121
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:58,920
Feeling better?

1122
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,280
Yeah, better.

1123
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,520
Cry one more time.

1124
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,520
You really are something.

1125
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,560
So annoying.

1126
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,680
You're bad.

1127
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,760
Cried too much today.

1128
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:15,880
Cried from morning till night.

1129
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,160
I envy that you can cry.

1130
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:24,400
Why do I suddenly feel

1131
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,520
like I'm watching a teen romance movie?

1132
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,720
It's so beautiful.

1133
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,560
And you know Chen Chen's words

1134
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,440
are so powerful.

1135
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,640
Flying up into the sky.

1136
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,200
You feel

1137
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:36,120
that

1138
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,880
it's wonderful.

1139
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,640
How far do we need to let it out?

1140
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,640
Actually, you don't have to go that far.

1141
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:52,880
There should be enough wind up there.

1142
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,960
Then just let out more line, that should work.

1143
00:48:58,840 --> 00:48:59,840
No.

1144
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,640
We need to run.

1145
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,320
Let me do it.

1146
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,440
Pull the line.

1147
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,240
I'll pull the line, you let it out.

1148
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:09,760
Watch your hands.

1149
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:12,880
You two make a good team.

1150
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,640
I think it's coming down.

1151
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:20,480
No way, right?

1152
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,480
Why can't we get it up?

1153
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,640
Is it our fault?

1154
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,600
The wind is a bit weak.

1155
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:32,880
We need to run a bit.

1156
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,080
Give it to me.

1157
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:35,840
Come on, run!

1158
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:36,360
Come on, run!

1159
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,400
I have to get it flying.

1160
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,800
There's a little dog following us.

1161
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,240
Then the two of us run together.

1162
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,000
"It's like a drama."

1163
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
It totally is.

1164
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,040
Being young is wonderful.

1165
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:56,840
It really is.

1166
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,200
The wind's picking up!

1167
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:04,920
It's so beautiful.

1168
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,800
The wind is blowing now.

1169
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,320
This is all so poetic.

1170
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,720
Honestly, I want to cry right now.

1171
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:18,920
We want to cry too.

1172
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,040
Can it go even higher?

1173
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,760
It seems like it can't go up anymore.

1174
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,440
Hurry, wish for more wind!

1175
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,720
There's wind now.

1176
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:49,920
This is so romantic,

1177
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,880
it's almost too much.

1178
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:56,960
I'm so moved.

1179
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,880
I didn't wish for wind.

1180
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:08,800
Then what did you wish for?

1181
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,360
So, what did you wish for?

1182
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,320
Not telling you.

1183
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:10,720
Come on, tell me.

1184
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:11,640
No.

1185
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:13,240
You're really going to be like this?

1186
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,080
I wished for us to always be together.

1187
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,080
Stand on my right side.

1188
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:18,200
Okay.

1189
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,160
Block the sun for her.

1190
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,680
I stepped in horse manure.

1191
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,320
Good things are coming.

1192
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,080
Time to eat.

1193
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:33,880
Let's eat.

1194
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,360
What's this pot called?

1195
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,320
Earth hotpot.

1196
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:41,760
That's right.

1197
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,200
Just looking at it makes me hungry.

1198
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,440
There are green veggies.

1199
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,080
I want to eat the green veggies.

1200
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,160
It's my first time eating on the grassland.

1201
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,760
It's my first time too.

1202
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,960
Look, that cloud is still there.

1203
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,320
It's just floating there, not moving.

1204
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:15,720
Alright, that's fine.

1205
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:16,640
Thank you.

1206
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,200
You just add it straight in.

1207
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,760
It looks so homey.

1208
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:25,800
Tastes great.

1209
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:27,600
Thanks for your hard work.

1210
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,240
It wasn't hard.

1211
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:30,800
You cried so much, it must've been tough.

1212
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,200
He's like an elementary school boy.

1213
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,360
That's how boys act with girls they like.

1214
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:37,960
Just kidding.

1215
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,960
Sometimes he gets a bit "cheeky."

1216
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,640
He says something a bit "sly."

1217
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:41,720
He says something a bit "sly."

1218
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:43,280
Yeah.

1219
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:45,760
I'm really touched.

1220
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,960
Why did you suddenly want to give me a gift?

1221
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,520
Because we talked about it before.

1222
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,600
You're graduating soon, right?

1223
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,400
So I thought it was the perfect time.

1224
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,440
I wanted to use this chance

1225
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:08,440
to surprise you.

1226
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,280
I'm really moved.

1227
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,280
It feels like youth passes so quickly.

1228
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,400
I think a lot of what you do

1229
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,640
is really meaningful.

1230
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,600
Is there something you really want to do

1231
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:27,320
but

1232
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,040
you regret never getting to do?

1233
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,400
Right now, I think

1234
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,840
there's nothing I really regret.

1235
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,120
Because

1236
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,360
I try to do things

1237
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,800
before they become regrets,

1238
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,080
and make up for them as much as I can.

1239
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:43,800
Stop them from becoming regrets.

1240
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:50,920
After you joined the house,

1241
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,360
did you regret anything?

1242
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,560
After joining the house,

1243
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:05,840
I regretted a lot of things.

1244
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,080
Not being proactive.

1245
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:08,960
For example,

1246
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:10,560
For example,

1247
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:11,320
A lot.

1248
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:11,840
Mini train.

1249
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:12,480
Park.

1250
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:14,280
Mini train.

1251
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:14,920
Park.

1252
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,480
No need to regret those anymore.

1253
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,200
Look where you two are now.

1254
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,400
You've already changed course.

1255
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,320
No more trains for you.

1256
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,320
Not anymore.

1257
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:25,720
I think what he said makes sense.

1258
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,360
You can make more memories.

1259
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:29,000
Memories in the house.

1260
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,640
I think I've always been a passive person.

1261
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:34,280
Yeah.

1262
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,040
But your initiative

1263
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:39,880
isn't in words.

1264
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,080
You just act directly.

1265
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,720
I never expected that.

1266
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,120
He opened up a lot.

1267
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,520
This is the most satisfying meal I've had.

1268
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:01,400
It's so relaxing.

1269
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,080
In a place like this,

1270
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,640
how could you ever want to leave?

1271
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:10,800
Alright, these two horses have "fallen in love" too.

1272
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,440
Suddenly, I think planning surprises

1273
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,920
is actually quite fun.

1274
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,440
I cried my eyes out.

1275
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,240
What were you thinking at that moment?

1276
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,160
What were you thinking?

1277
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:30,840
What are you doing?

1278
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:32,640
Doing all this?

1279
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,720
What do you mean, "doing all this"?

1280
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,840
No one has ever

1281
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,880
remembered my regrets like this.

1282
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:42,080
Or the things I wanted to do.

1283
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,200
Because before, I was always the type

1284
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,040
to get something,

1285
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,440
I had to work really hard for it,

1286
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,200
put in a lot of effort.

1287
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,080
Only then could I get it.

1288
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,160
Yes.

1289
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,200
So,

1290
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,560
just be yourself, that's enough.

1291
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,280
Alright.

1292
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,120
I really feel

1293
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,360
after coming to the house,

1294
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:12,440
you've changed a lot.

1295
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,800
From the very start, on the island with you,

1296
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:18,960
when we talked on the second day,

1297
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,000
you said you were someone

1298
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:20,800
who doesn't care much for rituals.

1299
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:24,160
You really dislike

1300
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,560
surprises prepared by others.

1301
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,360
You'd get scared and run away.

1302
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:28,440
And you also said

1303
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:32,160
you rarely prepare these things for others.

1304
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,960
But since we've been together,

1305
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,680
you've truly done so much

1306
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:38,840
that made me feel

1307
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,720
your gentle and thoughtful gestures.

1308
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,920
Stop, I'm about to cry.

1309
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,600
Maybe it's really because of

1310
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,800
the influence of that Peking University badge.

1311
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:56,880
He never stopped thinking about it.

1312
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:57,480
Yeah.

1313
00:56:58,600 --> 00:56:59,440
What's wrong?

1314
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:01,880
It actually affected me a lot.

1315
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,200
When you got it, besides surprise,

1316
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:06,960
what else did you feel?

1317
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,120
Well...

1318
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,720
How did you hear that sentence?

1319
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,440
I really just said it casually back then.

1320
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:16,760
I know you said it offhand.

1321
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:17,760
I was joking.

1322
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:19,920
But since you mentioned it,

1323
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,760
and I happened to be going to Beijing,

1324
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:22,560
so I did it while I was there.

1325
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,000
Then I started making wishes.

1326
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:24,400
Just happened to do it.

1327
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,480
Then I started making wishes.

1328
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,200
So you...

1329
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:27,760
I want...

1330
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,000
I want...

1331
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,280
What do you want?

1332
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,320
I want world peace.

1333
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,240
You want world peace?

1334
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,920
Feels like I'm being interviewed.

1335
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,400
I like being interviewed.

1336
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:49,040
You know, I prepared

1337
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,040
another surprise for you today.

1338
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,680
Really?

1339
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,040
Your whole day is full of surprises.

1340
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:53,960
Of course.

1341
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:56,200
Because look, the weather in Xinjiang now

1342
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:57,360
is great,

1343
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,240
but the UV rays are really strong.

1344
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:00,920
So I got you

1345
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:03,960
a beautiful box.

1346
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,040
What's inside?

1347
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,120
It's the Pantene Rose Miracle Bubbles Hair Care Gift Set.

1348
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:09,160
They say it improves hair from the roots.

1349
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,040
Makes your hair strong, shiny, and bouncy.

1350
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,240
And it's also

1351
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,960
got a wonderful ebony rose scent.

1352
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:15,400
Hope you like it.

1353
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,320
I love it.

1354
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,080
Thank you.

1355
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,720
I'll definitely use it well.

1356
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:22,480
Let's go.

1357
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:24,040
Let's go.

1358
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:26,720
I think this moment

1359
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:27,960
is already etched in my mind.

1360
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,840
That light is truly beautiful.

1361
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:33,400
Beautiful.

1362
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:35,200
Tyndall effect.

1363
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:36,680
Goodbye, grasslands.

1364
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:37,080
Bye-bye.

1365
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:37,680
Bye-bye.

1366
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,560
Let's come again next time.

1367
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,880
So beautiful.

1368
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:49,280
Look, in this

1369
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:49,800
whole process,

1370
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:50,960
the way two people interact

1371
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,080
makes you feel that this

1372
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:54,720
is such a wonderful state.

1373
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:56,520
Taking the other person's regret

1374
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,040
as your own regret.

1375
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:58,400
Yeah.

1376
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,400
A school badge might

1377
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,520
not be as noticeable as

1378
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,920
saying you want to eat something,

1379
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,240
in terms of catching attention.

1380
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,400
But only someone who truly likes you

1381
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,320
will notice you.

1382
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:08,560
An emotional need

1383
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:09,120
will be fulfilled.

1384
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:11,280
Le Chen can see

1385
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,320
the little girl

1386
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,160
inside Lu Yuan's heart,

1387
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,840
and wants to protect her.

1388
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,120
While caring for her,

1389
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,480
he also heals himself.

1390
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,240
So far, their interactions

1391
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:22,840
have succeeded because

1392
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,440
there's a positive cycle.

1393
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:25,360
Their way of relating

1394
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:26,560
just fits perfectly.

1395
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:27,800
It sets an example

1396
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:29,360
for this relationship.

1397
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:31,320
Then the other person is inspired.

1398
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:32,160
It creates a

1399
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,520
positive mutual influence.

1400
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:34,160
Right.

1401
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,600
I think their emotional

1402
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,680
sensitivity is the same.

1403
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:38,760
Let me mention a detail.

1404
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,160
After she finished crying,

1405
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,040
they sat down to eat.

1406
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,120
Then Le Chen said to Lu Yuan,

1407
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:43,880
"You worked hard today."

1408
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:44,880
"You cried a lot."

1409
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,400
"What were you thinking then?"

1410
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,760
After Le Chen did something,

1411
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,120
he would ask about the details.

1412
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:50,920
And Lu Yuan also asked her,

1413
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,720
"When you received the badge,

1414
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:53,600
what were you thinking?"

1415
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,520
So they're a perfect match.

1416
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:56,680
And the two of them

1417
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:57,480
already have their own

1418
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:58,600
way of communicating.

1419
00:59:58,600 --> 00:59:59,680
You're so annoying.

1420
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,320
Isn't that just saying the opposite?

1421
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:02,680
You're such a cutie.

1422
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,160
That's nice. So, what's next?

1423
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:06,840
Let's take a look

1424
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,520
at the other side of Qiandao Lake

1425
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:09,440
to see what kind of

1426
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,960
heart-fluttering things will happen.

1427
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,320
Come on, let's go stargazing there.

1428
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:52,960
Okay.

1429
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:53,800
I want to ask you,

1430
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:54,960
when did you first text me?

1431
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:55,680
When was it?

1432
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:57,000
When you asked me to walk the dog.

1433
01:00:58,360 --> 01:00:59,280
On the island,

1434
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,560
you didn't send me a single message.

1435
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:02,720
Getting heated.

1436
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:04,960
You're so "annoying."

1437
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:06,520
So beautiful.

1438
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:09,240
You're looking at me.

1439
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:12,160
Looking at the view, and

1440
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,000
accidentally glanced at you.

1441
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:18,800
Why look at me?

1442
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:20,920
I love looking.

1443
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:22,480
Bold.

1444
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:26,120
Let's go.

1445
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:26,760
Chase the sunset.

1446
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:28,080
The boat's leaving.

1447
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:29,640
Should we take a group photo?

1448
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:30,920
Then I'll do this.

1449
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,840
Do you like this vibe?

1450
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:33,360
Yes.

1451
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:34,840
Happy.

1452
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:37,160
Sometimes it's a bit regretful.

1453
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:38,440
Missing Chichi.

1454
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,400
Yeah, even the prettiest view isn't pretty.

1455
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:41,600
They're back.

1456
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,880
What did you two do?

1457
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:45,320
Rode a hot air balloon.

1458
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:46,920
Went to romantic Turkey.

1459
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,200
What is Zihan thinking now?

1460
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:50,960
What do you think of him (Yu Xing)?

1461
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,160
Great question.

1462
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,280
At every moment,

1463
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,840
there's a beautiful view.

1464
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,120
Enjoying the process

1465
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:02,800
is still more important.

1466
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,760
This kind of talk is so relaxing.

1467
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,680
That feeling of being held and supported.

1468
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:10,280
This journey has completely surpassed

1469
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:11,880
my definition of heart-fluttering.

1470
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:14,360
The wind's back.

1471
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:15,880
The wind blew the worries away again.

1472
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:17,440
When one thing ends,

1473
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,280
another begins.

1474
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:20,600
Everyone has their own pace.

1475
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:21,480
Hang in there.
