1
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,840
Are you the first one up?

2
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,760
I’ll be doing that the day after tomorrow too.

3
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,040
Leaving early.

4
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,800
I’ll drive.

5
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,640
I’ll give you a ride.

6
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,280
Sure.

7
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,480
What do you think?

8
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,560
I think we’re early enough.

9
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,960
Let’s just go.

10
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,520
Let’s go.

11
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,200
We’re leaving.

12
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,400
What time do you start work?

13
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:30,880
Nine o’clock.

14
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,280
Let me think.

15
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,960
If it’s nine, then seven.

16
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,520
About two hours to get there.

17
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,160
My meeting starts at nine.

18
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,560
What made you decide to come to Shanghai?

19
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,080
For me, I’d say

20
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,760
There are better opportunities for startups here.

21
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,400
The older you get,

22
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,600
you lose that youthful vigor.

23
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,320
You don’t have the same courage or drive.

24
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,000
You become more cautious.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,080
Do it while you still can.

26
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,160
Do you need me to help you out?

27
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,880
Does Sister Lan look like someone who needs help?

28
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,120
Just going with the flow.

29
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,520
What about you?

30
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,280
Do you need my help with anything?

31
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,760
I’m like you, I don’t need it.

32
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,160
Already got it for now.

33
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,360
Brother Liu doesn’t need it either.

34
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,160
Hard to say.

35
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,080
Okay.

36
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,520
Can’t say.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,680
I think girls should trust their own feelings.

38
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,240
And their personalities are great.

39
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,000
They’re all easy to get along with.

40
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,600
Yeah.

41
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,040
Didn’t you say you’d help me out?

42
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,000
Which day?

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,680
When do you want to cook?

44
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,040
Let’s wait until everyone’s a bit more relaxed.

45
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,560
Then I’ll wait until you’re ready.

46
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,000
Yeah, let me tell you.

47
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,800
And you can say who you want to help you.

48
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,840
You can just let me know.

49
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,600
Bye.

50
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,560
Bye.

51
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,440
Bye, see you.

52
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,320
Hope your meeting goes well today.

53
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,240
Hello.

54
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,360
Hi, glad you're here.

55
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,280
You're here.

56
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,520
Why?

57
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,880
Because I forgot my card.

58
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,320
Yesterday morning.

59
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,760
Yesterday morning.

60
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,920
You only had one egg.

61
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,440
The day you left with a banana.

62
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,480
I had sausage.

63
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,800
Sausage.

64
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,800
You.

65
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,360
Do you want some?

66
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,480
If you want, I can make it for you.

67
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,760
Really?

68
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,480
Go ahead.

69
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,960
Darn it, the egg's ruined.

70
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,680
What happened?

71
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,560
It got burnt.

72
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,640
Let me do it.

73
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,600
What if it turns into scrambled eggs?

74
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,000
Let me do it.

75
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,600
I feel like on my way to Shanghai

76
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,400
I'll probably be half asleep.

77
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,040
More like unconscious.

78
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,760
Yesterday, when did you sleep?

79
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,480
What time did you go to bed?

80
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,680
Two thirty.

81
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,000
Dr. Fang and I slept around three.

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,240
Dr. Fang.

83
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:35,920
Why?

84
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,360
We were chatting.

85
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,840
Did he leave?

86
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,640
Yeah, he left.

87
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,440
I said I'd make breakfast for you.

88
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,800
Are you sure you don't want a fried egg?

89
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,960
One more.

90
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,000
Do you like it well-done

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,920
or the other way?

92
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,200
Well-done.

93
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,800
Well-done, coming up.

94
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,880
Thanks.

95
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,560
This way it won't be greasy.

96
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,440
Which piece do you want?

97
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,000
More burnt or less burnt?

98
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,080
Burnt.

99
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,320
Thanks.

100
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,680
It burst open.

101
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,520
This one seems pretty good too.

102
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,360
Should we make another?

103
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,360
I'm heading out.

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,640
Okay.

105
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,360
I packed up these two sausages.

106
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,680
You pack them.

107
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,560
Alright, I'm leaving.

108
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,400
Bye.

109
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,400
Bye, see you tonight.

110
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,080
Take care on the road.

111
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,240
Just use this directly.

112
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:38,600
Done.

113
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,520
I'll come get you guys later.

114
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,600
Are you waiting for me?

115
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,680
Come.

116
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,160
Nicole.

117
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,640
Hurry.

118
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,640
Come on, hurry.

119
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,320
Come.

120
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,080
Sorry.

121
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,200
Do you want a drink?

122
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:34,960
Sure.

123
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,640
Let me take another look.

124
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,880
Actually, you don't need to wear glasses.

125
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,200
So do I look better with them

126
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,320
or without them?

127
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,120
Want the honest answer?

128
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,240
Yes, tell me the truth.

129
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:04,880
Both look good.

130
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,920
Pick one.

131
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,960
Honestly, both are good.

132
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,680
Did you notice my nails changed?

133
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,320
I heard.

134
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,240
What color were they before?

135
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,000
They were

136
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,760
Pink.

137
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,320
Yeah.

138
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:19,960
Really?

139
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,400
Yes.

140
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,360
So, is my cooking

141
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,920
better than you expected?

142
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,120
It's honestly better than I expected.

143
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,200
I thought that water spinach

144
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,040
would turn out badly.

145
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,480
One thing is you just left it there.

146
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,000
You didn’t pay attention and walked away.

147
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,880
No idea where you went.

148
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,560
And another thing,

149
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,560
the stems and leaves

150
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,600
were put in together.

151
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,160
Yeah.

152
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,120
You should add the stems first, then the leaves.

153
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,480
Because the stems take longer to cook.

154
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,560
For veggies like that,

155
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,120
they taste best when slightly undercooked.

156
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,960
I know.

157
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,560
It gives a fresh aroma.

158
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,360
Right.

159
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,160
Makes sense.

160
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,120
Okay, next time I stir-fry veggies

161
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,760
I’ll make them a bit raw for you.

162
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,440
So, should we go cycling?

163
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,440
Are we riding?

164
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,080
Let’s ride.

165
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,320
Are you coming?

166
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,320
I can work out too.

167
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,200
There’s a mountain bike inside.

168
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,920
It’s fine, you guys go ahead and ride.

169
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,320
I’ll just do some stretching and exercise.

170
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,920
You should try it.

171
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,800
I’ll get it down for you.

172
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:26,920
We don’t need that many, right?

173
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,240
Aren’t there just five of us?

174
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,200
This one looks cooler.

175
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,160
I’ll get you the cool one.

176
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,560
This one’s more suitable

177
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,040
for people with long legs.

178
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,960
That works.

179
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,240
How does this...

180
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,600
Wait a sec.

181
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,560
Lift it out.

182
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,280
How do I get it out?

183
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,360
Yeah, just lift it out.

184
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,960
Okay.

185
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,760
Thanks.

186
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,240
I want to ride too.

187
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:51,720
I’m riding.

188
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,560
There’s another one here.

189
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,720
You take this one.

190
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,480
This one’s already out.

191
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,680
Alright, thank you.

192
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,280
Today I need Dr. Fang

193
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,200
to be my life coach.

194
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:03,960
What’s up?

195
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,640
Seriously.

196
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,080
I kind of need it.

197
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,280
Let’s go.

198
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,000
Go.

199
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,720
Go.

200
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,800
This feels great!

201
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,240
I’ll head up first.

202
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:19,560
Bye.

203
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,320
Don’t leave me behind.

204
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,960
Which way?

205
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,400
Go, we can take the right side.

206
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,440
It’s brighter on the right.

207
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,320
Wait.

208
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,400
I can’t brake very well.

209
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,880
Careful.

210
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,240
I’ll go slower.

211
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,600
Honestly, I think riding slowly is harder.

212
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,400
Don’t you think so?

213
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,320
Going slow

214
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,480
makes it harder to control the direction.

215
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,280
Yeah.

216
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,960
The temperature is actually pretty nice.

217
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,560
A light breeze and a bike ride,

218
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,320
the weather feels so good now.

219
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:00,920
Yeah.

220
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,800
This is my first time

221
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,160
riding when it’s so dark out.

222
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,440
It’s nice, a different kind of experience.

223
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,640
Yuxing really came out to exercise.

224
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,720
I honestly planned to go to the gym.

225
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:24,760
I honestly planned to go to the gym.

226
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,560
The lake looks so beautiful.

227
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:28,920
So pretty.

228
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,640
So gorgeous.

229
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
The moon is so big and round tonight.

230
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,280
It's really bright.

231
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,400
And there are so many stars tonight.

232
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,280
Feels like you can even see the craters.

233
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,160
See what?

234
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,280
Is your eyesight that good?

235
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,760
The craters.

236
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,800
Your eyesight is amazing.

237
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,160
The craters.

238
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,080
Where?

239
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,160
Here.

240
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,480
I need to look closely.

241
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,480
Tilt your head up at a 45-degree angle.

242
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,520
I see it.

243
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,680
Look carefully.

244
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,160
We need to turn left.

245
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,240
Turn left? Left.

246
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,720
This breeze feels so nice.

247
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,000
We probably haven't even biked halfway yet.

248
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,400
Really?

249
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,200
Yeah.

250
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,800
Come on.

251
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,400
Let's go.

252
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,360
Speed up.

253
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,760
Have you lately...

254
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,160
You seem a bit off.

255
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,520
Yeah.

256
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,360
Problems at work?

257
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,160
Or is it something in the cabin?

258
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,200
Probably in the cabin.

259
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,760
In the cabin, huh.

260
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,360
There must be someone you most want to connect with.

261
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,280
Is he moving away?

262
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,040
Or have you not

263
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,480
taken the first step?

264
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,000
Mainly, I don't know what he thinks.

265
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,320
Or what he'll say.

266
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,360
Because I haven't seen

267
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,600
him do anything.

268
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,680
If I meet someone I like,

269
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,040
I'll be very proactive.

270
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,720
I'll definitely let her know.

271
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,720
I think the first step is to let him know.

272
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,320
First, he needs to know how you feel.

273
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:15,560
Right?

274
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,120
So do you worry

275
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:20,600
Me?

276
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,480
When it comes to relationships,

277
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,280
I go straight for it.

278
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,000
But even then, I can't

279
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,960
be that proactive.

280
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,480
Maybe.

281
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,920
But honestly, I think

282
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,080
it's hard for girls to take the initiative.

283
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,560
It just feels awkward, I don't know what to do.

284
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,840
If that's the case,

285
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,360
you two might not even

286
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,000
get a chance to know each other.

287
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,240
Actually, there was one chance to get to know each other.

288
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,560
Did you think it was a good fit?

289
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,600
My first

290
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,600
priority is

291
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,760
letting her know about it.

292
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,200
As for what she chooses,

293
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,120
that's up to her.

294
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,800
We just do what we can.

295
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,040
Do it first, that's enough.

296
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,320
But I still worry

297
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,120
if he keeps

298
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,160
being

299
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:10,760
unclear.

300
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,440
If that's his attitude,

301
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,640
I can totally give up.

302
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,040
Got it.

303
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,000
Thank you.

304
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,920
That was eye-opening.

305
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,000
Exactly.

306
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,600
Hello.

307
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,920
Please have a seat first.

308
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,960
Let's get in the car first.

309
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,360
The type of person I like,

310
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,280
Name at least three traits.

311
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,720
Gentle.

312
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,520
Gentle.

313
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,120
Easy to get along with.

314
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,920
Someone who's easy to be around.

315
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,720
No drama or complications.

316
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,520
Double eyelids and big eyes.

317
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:23,680
Fair skin.

318
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,920
Really?

319
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,160
Okay.

320
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,000
So that's your ideal type.

321
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,680
That would probably attract me.

322
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,280
It would instantly catch my attention.

323
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,800
Do you think

324
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,680
I'm a gentle person?

325
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,800
Pretty gentle.

326
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,040
Your voice is gentle too.

327
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:58,840
You give off the vibe of

328
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,640
a gentle person.

329
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,600
So are you someone

330
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,120
who thinks in your life plan

331
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,080
you must get married and have kids?

332
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,600
I think when a relationship reaches

333
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,040
that point,

334
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,280
marriage just happens naturally.

335
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,080
It's just

336
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,640
a natural outcome.

337
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,720
I hope it leads somewhere.

338
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,600
That's simple.

339
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,600
I don't have many hobbies.

340
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,400
Badminton counts as one.

341
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,040
Billiards.

342
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,000
You mean recently?

343
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,480
Alright.

344
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,600
And also,

345
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,160
all kinds of outdoor and nature activities.

346
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,000
Actually, I also like walking.

347
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,120
Walking after meals.

348
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,080
Walking after meals.

349
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,400
Shopping.

350
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,920
Strolling around the city.

351
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,600
Yeah.

352
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,640
I like going out and people-watching.

353
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,200
It feels lively when I'm out.

354
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,520
But my biggest hobby is still badminton.

355
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,320
So how good are you at badminton?

356
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,440
What's your level?

357
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,560
Amateur.

358
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,320
Are you strong among amateurs?

359
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,680
Just average for an amateur.

360
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,480
Are you being modest or really just average?

361
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,680
Really just average.

362
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,640
Maybe slightly above average.

363
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,400
Next?

364
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:37,920
Okay.

365
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,720
My life goals and expectations,

366
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,600
I actually want a

367
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,080
free and easy life.

368
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,280
How do you define "free and easy"?

369
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,280
It's when you can

370
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,840
go wherever you want,

371
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,480
do whatever you want.

372
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,400
If no one

373
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,000
shows up in my world,

374
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,280
my plan would be

375
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,080
maybe to get a PhD.

376
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,120
Probably in Shanghai or Hangzhou.

377
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,240
I think these two places

378
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:09,920
are worth considering.

379
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,280
And then,

380
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,000
get promoted to

381
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,880
intermediate physician.

382
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,880
Then move up to senior physician.

383
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,480
Would you change your plans

384
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,240
because of someone?

385
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,760
If I change my plans for her,

386
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,200
the prerequisite is

387
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,640
I must really, really like her.

388
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,240
What if later

389
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,200
you two don't end up together?

390
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,240
Would you regret it?

391
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,000
No, I wouldn't.

392
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,440
Once I've made that decision,

393
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,800
I definitely can't and won't regret it.

394
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,760
Workout.

395
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,240
Let's do push-ups, three people.

396
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,960
Sure.

397
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,880
Why do I feel like I got bitten again?

398
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,520
No excuses, hurry up.

399
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,440
Three, two, one, go.

400
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,960
Six.

401
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,640
Eight.

402
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,400
Nine.

403
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,440
Ten.

404
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,680
I'm going over there to deal with some mosquitoes.

405
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,880
Get some revenge.

406
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,440
Here.

407
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,240
Why are you so into killing mosquitoes?

408
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,480
So excited.

409
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,160
Feels like New Year's fireworks.

410
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,960
Let's go up.

411
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,680
Let's go.

412
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,880
Hello.

413
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,640
Hi.

414
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,600
Are you alone?

415
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,240
Yeah, just me.

416
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,960
They've all finished training.

417
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:49,800
Yeah.

418
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,280
You're still training?

419
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,400
So persistent.

420
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,680
Impressive.

421
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,320
Duoduo, can you teach me boxing?

422
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,200
Sure.

423
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,480
You wear the pink gloves.

424
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:00,880
Okay.

425
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,160
Don't use too much force with your hands.

426
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,360
Be careful not to get hurt.

427
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,560
You can start slow at first.

428
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,480
Like, one, two.

429
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,440
Make your moves more precise.

430
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,200
Or you might get injured.

431
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,760
One, two, twist.

432
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,760
One, two.

433
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,280
Take it slow.

434
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,400
Right, and punch straight in.

435
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:24,880
Yeah.

436
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,320
Right.

437
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,000
And when you punch, you should...

438
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,720
Hold back a little.

439
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,480
Then your left hand...

440
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:32,720
Keep it by your left cheek for protection.

441
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,720
Protect your left cheek with your left hand.

442
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,120
Right hand protects your right cheek.

443
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,400
After punching, bring your hand back.

444
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,040
Because in a real match,

445
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,440
you can't leave your hand out after punching.

446
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:41,680
That's not allowed.

447
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,920
You have to protect yourself at all times.

448
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,120
Have you sparred with others?

449
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,160
I've done real sparring.

450
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,360
How long have you been training?

451
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:48,840
How long have you trained?

452
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,080
Since 2019.

453
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,720
But not every day.

454
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,520
We train...

455
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,280
I've trained for seven years.

456
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:54,800
Practiced combination punches.

457
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,280
But not always.

458
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,200
Not every year.

459
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:56,240
Every year.

460
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,480
Not every month either.

461
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,640
It's not like regular fitness.

462
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,240
Then your hand can...

463
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,680
Punch a bit more vertically.

464
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,360
Right.

465
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,960
Rotate your hips, make sure your foot turns.

466
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,200
Use force.

467
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,920
Yeah.

468
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,000
Just make sure your wrist doesn't get hurt.

469
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,440
Okay.

470
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,960
Because it's easy to twist your wrist.

471
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,040
Normally, you need to wrap it inside.

472
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:20,760
With a bandage.

473
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,080
Yeah.

474
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,040
You kind of feel like...

475
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,520
You're smashing yourself in.

476
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,000
Exactly.

477
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,920
So cool.

478
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,080
Cool, right?

479
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,320
Really cool.

480
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,600
That's my goal.

481
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,400
No.

482
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,200
It's just a simple...

483
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,360
Show-off's goal.

484
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,800
So cool.

485
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,840
I can do a plank contest with you now.

486
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,800
Plank? Sure.

487
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,280
Are you in?

488
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,240
Let's do it.

489
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,880
Really?

490
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,320
What if I join you guys?

491
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,600
Sure, let's do it together.

492
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,200
Go over there.

493
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,440
I'm ready.

494
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,280
Does Chichi know how to box?

495
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,120
Yes.

496
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,240
Yeah, she does.

497
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,360
You all know how, impressive.

498
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,320
Chichi can do it.

499
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,240
She punches really hard.

500
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,200
It's starting.

501
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,400
Okay.

502
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,560
I'm getting sore.

503
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,440
I can't go on.

504
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,720
Jue'er, how long has it been?

505
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,120
A little over a minute.

506
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:54,960
About a minute and a half.

507
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,000
It's been a long time.

508
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,480
Yifan, you're amazing.

509
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,400
Yifan is awesome.

510
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:16,960
Super impressive.

511
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,760
I think I train my core more.

512
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,280
And your form is really standard.

513
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,520
Your form is actually very standard.

514
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,160
Is this considered standard?

515
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,360
I've never done the fly exercise.

516
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,640
It's usually done like this.

517
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,000
It's for training the back, right?

518
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,280
It works this area, the triceps.

519
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,800
Fly exercise.

520
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,600
Yes.

521
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,120
But my trapezius gets activated easily.

522
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:43,920
That's right.

523
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,840
But Chichi looks like she trains.

524
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,040
Yeah.

525
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,000
Because Chichi

526
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,880
Chichi has a natural physique.

527
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,600
Her shoulders

528
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,080
are big.

529
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,520
Yeah.

530
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,320
I noticed this part.

531
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,680
I saw this area.

532
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,760
Her shoulder caps are great.

533
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,920
She definitely trains.

534
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:04,960
She really does.

535
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,480
She does.

536
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,200
Shows she works hard regularly.

537
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,560
Yeah.

538
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,720
But my shoulders

539
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,640
if I don't get as lean as

540
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,920
Chichi's level,

541
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,320
like me,

542
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,080
Same here.

543
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,200
I bulk up easily.

544
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:20,680
Yeah.

545
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,080
I want to lose some fat.

546
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,440
You want to lose fat?

547
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,120
Right now it's fat-wrapped muscle.

548
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,160
Yours is fat-wrapped muscle.

549
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,200
Then what is mine?

550
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,040
I prefer lean muscle.

551
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,520
I want to be a "muscle frog".

552
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,000
I like "muscle frogs" too.

553
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,800
So I train my thighs to get bigger.

554
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,920
Yeah, they say girls love training legs.

555
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,680
Yeah.

556
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,400
I like training my back.

557
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,560
Me too, I like training my back.

558
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,360
I really enjoy training my back.

559
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,920
Training your back is good for posture.

560
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,280
Yeah.

561
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,120
It also helps your jawline.

562
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:49,440
Yeah.

563
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:49,720
Yeah.

564
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,280
Actually, for a slimmer face

565
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,880
Then Ruilong said

566
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,200
I didn't know girls could do so much.

567
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,000
Is there one with my weight?

568
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,440
This one is five kilos.

569
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,440
I'll use eight kilos.

570
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,840
There's an eight-kilo one.

571
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,640
Do a fly with eight kilos.

572
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,680
How do you check

573
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,400
if your trapezius is working?

574
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,840
You'll feel soreness here.

575
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,600
A pulling sensation.

576
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,120
Yeah, if you feel pulling and soreness here,

577
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,920
But shoulder exercises always involve it a bit.

578
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,640
the trapezius.

579
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,280
Can't help it.

580
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,760
If you feel it a bit,

581
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,080
just rotate like this.

582
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,880
Rotate back and then keep training.

583
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,240
Reset.

584
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,720
Yeah, just reset and it's fine.

585
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,920
Just rotate and you'll be fine.

586
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,400
I'm heading out.

587
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,920
My outfit really isn't suitable.

588
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,240
I'm leaving.

589
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,000
Honestly, I'm not really suitable either.

590
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,600
Wait for me, Jue'er.

591
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,040
I used to work out, and after exercising

592
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,840
I’d always have a late-night snack when I got home.

593
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,840
There are new peanuts today.

594
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,520
I ate some.

595
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:57,560
I got some.

596
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,400
They still have the skin on.

597
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,160
I ate them as soon as I came in.

598
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,800
I spotted them right away.

599
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,240
No peanut can escape my eyes.

600
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,760
Not a single peanut is innocent here.

601
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,440
With me,

602
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,400
I feel like I’ve worked out enough today.

603
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,800
I must’ve burned at least a hundred calories.

604
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,560
Yeah, for sure.

605
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,880
Boxing felt amazing.

606
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,040
Right?

607
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,960
I really let off some steam.

608
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,840
I think we should box together more often.

609
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,520
It’s so satisfying.

610
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,080
Definitely.

611
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,000
How about you, Ruilong?

612
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,840
How’s your progress bar?

613
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,880
I’m good.

614
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,280
Let’s go then.

615
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:31,920
Let’s move.

616
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,280
When we work out,

617
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,600
what’s our main goal?

618
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,400
It’s just

619
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,360
to break a sweat.

620
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,600
Then we stop.

621
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,400
I actually just started sweating.

622
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,000
A little sweat.

623
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,160
From a traditional Chinese medicine perspective,

624
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,240
that’s really healthy.

625
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,240
That’s great.

626
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,000
Sweating just a bit.

627
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,760
So much food.

628
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,080
Come on.

629
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,800
It’s my sweet moment of the day again.

630
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,320
Time for my daily sweet treat.

631
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,040
Do you want one?

632
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,400
Yes.

633
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,240
Back in high school,

634
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,400
chocolate was my favorite.

635
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,160
But what I brought today

636
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,720
is 100% dark chocolate.

637
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,200
The chocolate from the living area—

638
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:04,880
Did you bring it?

639
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,920
Is it still over there?

640
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,840
Yeah, it’s still there.

641
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:16,200
Delicious.

642
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:16,520
Right?

643
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,400
So good.

644
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,520
Delicious, okay.

645
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,240
This is different from the spicy peanuts.

646
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,440
It has a different flavor.

647
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,320
Between the spicy peanuts and these,

648
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,400
if you had to choose one,

649
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,040
I’d probably pick this.

650
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:30,600
This one.

651
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,240
Spicy.

652
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,640
I didn’t get to eat anything.

653
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,920
Me neither.

654
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,720
Are you calling me out?

655
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,240
What’s Dr. Fang thinking while looking at the sky?

656
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,400
Gazing up at a forty-five degree angle.

657
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,040
No, I just look cooler at a forty-five degree angle.

658
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,120
My jawline is sharp as a knife.

659
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:58,920
There’s a

660
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,640
jawline sharpness test.

661
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,960
Did you actually take that test?

662
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,120
Just to see how sharp your jawline is?

663
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,600
I tested my jawline.

664
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,400
Is this the charm of a possessive lover?

665
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,000
Is that it?

666
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,000
Talking about possessive lovers again.

667
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,200
Possessive lover, yeah.

668
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,160
Possessive lover, that’s right.

669
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,800
I’m that “comrade.”

670
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,800
Comrade, partner.

671
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,080
Yeah.

672
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,320
Do you study grammar?

673
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,160
What?

674
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:33,880
Do you study grammar?

675
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,640
For English, or...

676
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,640
I do.

677
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,080
There will be...

678
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,040
My grammar is totally based on

679
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,360
the American TV shows I watch.

680
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,040
Watching American shows directly

681
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:43,840
helps me learn super fast.

682
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,840
It just sticks in my head, yeah.

683
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,080
Dr. Fang

684
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,080
How are your eyes today?

685
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:47,720
Pretty good.

686
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,360
Pretty good, huh?

687
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,160
I think so too.

688
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:49,960
What?

689
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,720
What eyes?

690
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,440
What eyes?

691
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,120
Dr. Fang can't tolerate any sand in his eyes today.

692
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,640
Can't stand any sand in the eyes.

693
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:55,960
Got sand in them.

694
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,760
Can you blow it out for me?

695
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,840
No, you don't need to blow for him.

696
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,040
Just give him two lenses.

697
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,640
To block the sand.

698
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,360
Yeah.

699
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,360
Put on the lenses.

700
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,880
Dr. Fang's look today

701
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,680
is called "earth sign’s dream type" online.

702
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,120
I'm the only earth sign here.

703
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:14,960
Do you like it?

704
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:17,960
I do.

705
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,480
Totally my dream type.

706
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,600
I wore glasses yesterday too.

707
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,160
You totally got me as well.

708
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:24,480
Nice.

709
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,760
Did you have

710
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,720
frames or lenses yesterday?

711
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,720
No frames or lenses either.

712
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,840
She had them yesterday.

713
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,960
I had lenses yesterday.

714
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,920
You had lenses.

715
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,920
Legally Blonde.

716
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,520
Yeah.

717
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:36,720
Dr. Fang

718
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,640
How do you get rid of red veins in your eyes?

719
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,280
Sleep more.

720
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,360
Don't open them.

721
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,000
Don't open your eyes.

722
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,000
You don't have red veins.

723
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,360
I have red veins too.

724
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,320
Look, mine is really long.

725
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,800
I have a lot too.

726
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,600
No.

727
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,560
It's from wearing contacts.

728
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,320
Dr. Fang, come take a look.

729
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,680
Just look at mine and you'll see.

730
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,600
Your eyes are super clear.

731
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,600
What about mine?

732
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,760
Yours are clear too.

733
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,720
Look at this side of mine.

734
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,640
Yeah, a little.

735
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,960
Yeah, mine's way worse than yours.

736
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,120
I've had it since I was a kid.

737
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,440
Then it's fine.

738
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:10,800
Wanna play?

739
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,240
Truth or Dare (from "The Answer of Heartbeat")

740
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,440
Come on, let's play.

741
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:14,760
Here you go.

742
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,560
Actually, we can help ask questions for others.

743
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,080
Sure.

744
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,040
Yeah.

745
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,160
Dr. Fang, ask one for him.

746
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,160
Are you happy?
