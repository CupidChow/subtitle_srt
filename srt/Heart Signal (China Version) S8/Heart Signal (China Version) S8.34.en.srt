1
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,880
So last week at the Heartbeat Apartment

2
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,120
we started our

3
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,200
mutual invitation round.

4
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:42,480
Alright.

5
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,600
Let's first take a look at

6
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,280
the first day's dates.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,920
Do you ever feel like I

8
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,960
talk too much sometimes?

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,120
It's average.

10
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,040
What do you think?

11
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,680
Actually, sometimes

12
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,680
if I talk for too long,

13
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,000
I don't really

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,560
I just want some quiet.

15
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,720
I want to go silent for a while.

16
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,080
It's like

17
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,560
my i-personality (Introverted) is

18
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,640
completely drained.

19
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,120
So, are you

20
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,960
an i-person (Introverted)?

21
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,760
Or are you an e-person (Extraverted)?

22
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,120
Maybe I'm about

23
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,280
fifty-five percent e-person.

24
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,040
Fifty-five percent?

25
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,680
I'm fifty-six percent.

26
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,760
I'm one point higher than you.

27
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,600
So we're pretty close.

28
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,040
So you also

29
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,840
want a break after talking too much?

30
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,480
My friends say I'm the type

31
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,080
who

32
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,680
is quiet when the vibe is quiet,

33
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,200
but super lively when it's energetic.

34
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,760
So you really go with the environment.

35
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,440
Yeah.

36
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,840
Depends on the weather.

37
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,600
Depends on the weather.

38
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,480
Depends on the weather.

39
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,840
I feel like this really

40
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,240
comes from how we grew up.

41
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,280
Maybe

42
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,240
when I was a kid, at certain events,

43
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:49,800
my family would say,

44
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,880
"Don't talk too much yet."

45
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,400
"Watch what others do first."

46
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,320
"Then you act."

47
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,000
So I adjusted how I spoke and acted.

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,680
Right? I think I'm the same way.

49
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,400
And later on,

50
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,760
I got used to observing everyone first

51
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,280
before deciding

52
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,240
how to present myself.

53
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,760
So you're really observant.

54
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,600
Yeah, I think I'm pretty observant.

55
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,960
Yeah.

56
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,160
Observe me, then.

57
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,560
Observe you?

58
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,800
I'm a bit shy to do that.

59
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,840
So, what's your observation about me?

60
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,080
After these two days,

61
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,520
I think we're actually quite

62
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,960
similar.

63
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,640
My friends might think

64
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,760
that sometimes

65
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,920
I'm not good at expressing feelings.

66
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,840
I often show it through actions

67
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,520
instead of words.

68
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,040
And they say you probably

69
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,720
combine words and actions.

70
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,600
What I want to say is

71
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm not very sensitive.

72
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,880
At first, I focus on

73
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,040
solving problems.

74
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,160
So I tend to overlook

75
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,000
everyone's feelings.

76
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,240
But you said before

77
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,280
you're someone who cries easily.

78
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,560
Isn't that

79
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,280
because of emotional triggers?

80
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,440
Isn't that what brings it out?

81
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,600
Most of these emotions

82
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,280
come from within myself.

83
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,840
So do you express your emotions?

84
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,400
I'm very expressive.

85
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,440
So you're not someone who bottles things up.

86
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,240
Because you let your feelings out right away.

87
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,040
Yeah.

88
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,320
Or I just cry.

89
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,760
I cry a lot.

90
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,440
But when I cry, I do it alone.

91
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,560
I hide under the covers and cry by myself.

92
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,160
Yeah, and I feel better after crying.

93
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,080
Strong woman.

94
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,160
So how do you let out your emotions?

95
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,640
I used to try to do it by

96
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,040
like working out,

97
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,000
or, you know,

98
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,840
going to the park to release my emotions.

99
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,640
But later I realized

100
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,760
it actually didn't really

101
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,080
help much with relieving them.

102
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,840
It might only solve

103
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,720
your emotions in that moment,

104
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,920
but it doesn't fix

105
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,640
the root cause of those feelings.

106
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,400
So do you have

107
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:51,960
like, do you have

108
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,800
I mean, do you have

109
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,440
friends you can talk to about your emotions?

110
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,240
Back in college, I really did.

111
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,040
A lot of people came to me to vent back then.

112
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,880
I felt like I was

113
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,680
kind of an emotional sponge.

114
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,280
But later I realized

115
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,640
being a venting buddy

116
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,800
means you take in too much negativity.

117
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,520
After a while,

118
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:13,960
your own emotions

119
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,040
can't be let out.

120
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,160
Are you an F (Feeling) type?

121
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm starting to think you're

122
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,960
more of a T (Thinking) type now.

123
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,200
People do change.

124
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,520
It feels like it's a gradual shift.

125
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,480
Because I think my

126
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,480
T (Thinking) score is too high.

127
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,160
So I want to become

128
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,000
a bit more F (Feeling).

129
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,760
I hope my

130
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,040
empathy can get stronger.

131
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,280
You need someone to soften you up.

132
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,400
Yeah, I need someone with

133
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,080
strong emotions around me.

134
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,320
All my feelings show on my face.

135
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,120
So you don't even need to guess.

136
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,120
Yeah, no need to guess.

137
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,280
It's basically an open-book test.

138
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,080
Yeah.

139
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,960
Right.

140
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,160
Let's go, time to head home.

141
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,480
What kind of music do you usually listen to when driving?

142
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,280
Songs with a fast beat.

143
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,920
I have two situations.

144
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,200
If I'm with friends,

145
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,920
I might listen to something more upbeat.

146
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,440
If I'm driving alone, it depends on my mood.

147
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,200
Do you prefer places with lots of people or

148
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,600
quiet places?

149
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,320
It really depends on the situation.

150
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,920
Sometimes I'm a bit of a social butterfly.

151
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,320
When there are lots of friends around,

152
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,680
you enjoy it, right?

153
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,520
But only if they're close friends.

154
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,040
Not the kind

155
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,160
you've only met once.

156
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,000
That still feels a bit awkward.

157
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,560
So now that you're in Shanghai,

158
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,000
your circle of friends has changed too.

159
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,920
You have new friends now, right?

160
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,760
Yeah.

161
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,600
Yes.

162
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,200
That's right.

163
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,840
Before I came,

164
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,800
I guess you all had lots of fun things going on.

165
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,000
Probably quite a lot.

166
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,640
Actually,

167
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,160
not really.

168
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,800
I think

169
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,880
there must be lots of interesting things on the island.

170
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,400
I always feel like I missed out on a lot.

171
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,200
Those two came later.

172
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,760
Yeah.

173
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,520
Do you feel regret?

174
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,560
I feel regret, but also not really.

175
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,280
Just let things happen naturally.

176
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,440
I believe the path I take

177
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,880
is always the best one for me.

178
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,360
That's great.

179
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,080
We're all so confident.

180
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,000
That's how it should be.

181
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,160
Such positive energy.

182
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,600
Yeah.

183
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,960
I've always had a question.

184
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,040
Do you think liking or loving someone

185
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,360
is unconditional?

186
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,320
I don't think so.

187
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,720
When you give,

188
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
you might say you don't expect anything in return,

189
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,360
but actually, in the process,

190
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,840
you gain emotional value yourself.

191
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,840
That's the reward.

192
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:42,920
It's like

193
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,960
when I do something for someone else,

194
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,480
but I feel happy myself.

195
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,880
That happiness is the reward.

196
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,880
So actually,

197
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,600
I think your understanding is

198
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,320
love is about mutual giving.

199
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,520
Right?

200
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,320
Yes.

201
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,800
If it's mutual,

202
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,360
the state between two people

203
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,600
should also be reciprocal.

204
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,200
For example,

205
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,840
when you hope someone

206
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,280
chooses you firmly,

207
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,120
shouldn't you also

208
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,160
choose them firmly?

209
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,120
That's fair.

210
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,320
Right?

211
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,280
He hopes we both give equally.

212
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,040
But this

213
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,040
how can you judge it by fairness?

214
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,400
How do you put it?

215
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,400
Fairness

216
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,840
is about both sides having equal conditions.

217
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,760
Having a fair foundation.

218
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,800
But love isn't like that.

219
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,360
Feelings and affection

220
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,920
are all about emotions.

221
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,720
It doesn't have

222
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,720
the conditions to be weighed on a scale.

223
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,600
I would hope for

224
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,280
mutual choice.

225
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,480
That's definitely the best.

226
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,160
But if it's not mutual,

227
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,280
I won't regret my decision.

228
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,480
Let's switch roles then.

229
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,400
Say there's someone you don't love

230
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,560
who keeps

231
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,840
expressing or giving things to you.

232
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,480
Would you feel uncomfortable?

233
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,120
They want positive feedback.

234
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,680
If I already know clearly

235
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,960
that I don't love them,

236
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,920
then

237
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,800
love is huge.

238
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,680
If I know I don't like them,

239
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,320
I might feel a bit pressured.

240
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,160
So, human emotions are pretty complicated.

241
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,920
Why?

242
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,320
People are all tangled up inside.

243
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,160
That's Good Luck (Haoyun from season six).

244
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,640
She said the cabin is just the beginning.

245
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,240
So I think coming to the cabin is also

246
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,160
a process of finding and seeing yourself.

247
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,280
That's true.

248
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,920
It's hard to be a person, that's all I can say.

249
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,840
It's not too bad.

250
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,440
Allow it.

251
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,000
Allow others to be themselves.

252
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,200
And be yourself.

253
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,320
I feel a bit tense.

254
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,840
I think this guy

255
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,040
is too set on the answer he wants.

256
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,600
He insists on hearing that specific phrase.

257
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,640
He's too impatient.

258
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,920
What the girl means is,

259
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,240
when I love you,

260
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,360
the process of loving you

261
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,600
is rewarding for me.

262
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,720
It's not about you having to

263
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,640
do something for me.

264
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,960
But the guy understands it as

265
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,440
mutual effort.

266
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,040
I think it has to be mutual effort.

267
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,040
But don't say this out loud.

268
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,560
It's about seeing you coming toward me.

269
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,640
And seeing you go your own way.

270
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,160
That's the most romantic part.

271
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,720
But that's not wrong either.

272
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,920
Because if you're the only one

273
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,880
giving for a long time,

274
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,680
and the other person never gives back,

275
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,120
that's not okay.

276
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,440
Then it's time to leave.

277
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,520
There's no love left.

278
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,400
Right.

279
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,920
It needs to go both ways.

280
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,320
Because you also want to feel it.

281
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,600
But you can't say

282
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,920
if I give one, you must give one.

283
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,400
If I give two, you must give two back.

284
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,120
It's not like that.

285
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,040
I think sometimes

286
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,200
the one giving is also enjoying it.

287
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,240
I totally agree with that.

288
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,640
He actually wants Chichi

289
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,000
to come closer to him.

290
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,000
To make more effort.

291
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,720
But it's still too soon.

292
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,320
Too soon.

293
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,360
But not necessarily, I think.

294
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,920
It's just that he's more

295
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,440
He came later than the others.

296
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,840
He needs to seize the opportunity.

297
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,960
Right, because earlier he already

298
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,680
compared to the others,

299
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,040
was late.

300
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,320
He arrived late.

301
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,880
That feeling is naturally

302
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,680
going to have a bit of

303
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,520
insecurity.

304
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,280
Yes.

305
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,160
This kind of insecurity

306
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,520
makes you especially hope

307
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,520
for more feedback.

308
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:06,960
Feedback.

309
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,440
So I know

310
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,880
if we're really matching each other.

311
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,920
I totally agree with what you just said

312
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,560
about insecurity.

313
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,720
Because there's a detail he mentioned

314
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,960
that shows how anxious he is inside.

315
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,960
After the girl didn't respond to him,

316
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,040
he said, "What if there's someone

317
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,880
you don't love

318
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,120
who keeps giving to you?"

319
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,080
He basically called himself

320
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,720
the person Chichi doesn't love.

321
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,040
Actually, this relationship

322
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,320
hasn't even been defined yet.

323
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,320
Everyone's still getting to know each other.

324
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,560
But when people panic,

325
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,480
they say extreme things.

326
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,680
Yeah.

327
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,960
He's really just expressing his feelings.

328
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,880
He wasn't even asking the other person.

329
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,600
Just saying, "What about you?"

330
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,760
Maybe young people

331
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,040
all go through something similar.

332
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,680
The more you like someone,

333
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,440
the more you want something back.

334
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,560
It's normal to want to be loved.

335
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,920
But you can't

336
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,560
demand that the person you love

337
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,440
just happens to love you back.

338
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,280
I think if it weren't for this show,

339
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,720
he (Liu Zihan) might not act this way.

340
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,680
It's because in the house,

341
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,880
he feels some peer pressure.

342
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,520
Maybe Zihan saw other guys

343
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,760
who already have people firmly choosing them.

344
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,600
He feels a sense of competition.

345
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,280
That probably made

346
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,720
him even more anxious.

347
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,080
I just hope he can

348
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,200
be more patient.

349
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,640
Let Chichi

350
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,880
really get to know him.

351
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,120
I think the mentor is amazing.

352
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,720
They convinced me again.

353
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,360
I think his way makes sense.

354
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,040
That's right.

355
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,040
I want to ask a question.

356
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,000
So,

357
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,960
if you enter into

358
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,640
marriage with someone,

359
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,880
or a long-term stable

360
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,760
intimate relationship,

361
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,960
can you accept

362
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,960
caring more about them than they care about you?

363
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,640
If this is the situation for a long time?

364
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,840
How is that possible?

365
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,120
I think

366
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,400
no matter who cares more or less,

367
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,720
maybe both

368
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,360
are acceptable.

369
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,240
It's not acceptable.

370
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,280
No, it's not. Okay.

371
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,160
Right, because one person feels less valued.

372
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,880
Or one person feels more valued.

373
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,720
Can this kind of love last?

374
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,960
No, it can't.

375
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,360
Right, if you're not on the same wavelength,

376
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,560
I don't think it can last very long.

377
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,840
What I meant earlier

378
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,800
is that the reason it's not acceptable

379
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,480
is that you can't not love.

380
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,720
I think you have to love.

381
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,960
You must love the other person.

382
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,760
And then,

383
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,360
just love them wholeheartedly.

384
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,120
Don't worry about who loves more or less.

385
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,040
If you care more,

386
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,520
you can love even better.

387
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,120
If you care less,

388
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,080
when you've given all your love

389
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,840
to the other person,

390
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,080
and there's no response,

391
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,560
then it's over.

392
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,240
That's great.

393
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:16,720
Yeah.

394
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,240
It turns into a butterfly and flies away.

395
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,760
Just let it fly away.

396
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,840
Like Chichi said,

397
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,440
let others be themselves,

398
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,560
and you be yourself.

399
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,440
I really like that saying.

400
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,200
I believe this is Zihan's

401
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,600
important lesson.

402
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,360
Yes, that's right.

403
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,280
Actually, what Zihan is doing

404
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:32,840
with this

405
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,680
is being genuine.

406
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,160
In our lives,

407
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,120
we express

408
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,120
a kind of emotion.

409
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,000
Yes.

410
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,960
I think everyone

411
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,000
in their own life,

412
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,720
in relationships,

413
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,840
or other areas,

414
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,920
will have this kind of

415
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,880
way of expressing themselves.

416
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,920
Everyone gets anxious like this.

417
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,880
Let's not rush.

418
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,520
Take it slow, don't be anxious.

419
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,080
I understand.

420
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,960
But don't rush.

421
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,600
So next,

422
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,320
let's continue

423
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,720
and experience

424
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,760
the next story.

425
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,200
Here they go, starting their date.

426
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,200
This should be tie-dye.

427
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,840
Really?

428
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,680
Tie-dye.

429
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,560
Yes, tie-dye.

430
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,120
That one should be batik.

431
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,880
Batik.

432
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,920
I know tie-dye.

433
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,240
You know tie-dye?

434
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,080
So, with tie-dye,

435
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,960
like this,

436
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,200
the pattern spreads out.

437
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,120
You tie it up like this.

438
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,120
And then like this.

439
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,600
And for this one,

440
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,200
it's like batik.

441
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,560
Batik still has patterns.

442
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,320
Batik is

443
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,280
it keeps the pattern

444
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,600
from getting dyed.

445
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,120
You put a layer of wax on it.

446
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,920
Then it goes into the dye bath.

447
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,120
After dyeing, you remove the wax.

448
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,200
Just peel it off.

449
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,840
Peel it off again.

450
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,040
Right.

451
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,760
So the pattern stays clear.

452
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,360
It's not that blurry look.

453
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,760
Oh, that's what it means.

454
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,040
Yes.

455
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,160
Mask.

456
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,640
I just saw that mask over there.

457
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,120
It's for Nuo Opera.

458
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,920
Nuo Opera.

459
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,360
Yes, it's pronounced "Nuo".

460
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,040
Nuo mask.

461
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,440
Nuo mask art.

462
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,120
You really know a lot.

463
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,240
I'm here to work.

464
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,440
Let's put this (wind chime) together first.

465
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,320
Let's assemble it.

466
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,120
Okay.

467
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,480
Actually, I just thought of something.

468
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,920
If we tie something heavier at one end of the string,

469
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,600
like a small weight,

470
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,880
then drop it through

471
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,160
the hole like this,

472
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,600
it'll go down quickly.

473
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,640
Let's try it later.

474
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,280
We'll figure it out in a bit.

475
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,440
Is this scientific thinking?

476
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,440
You have to develop your own

477
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,400
logical thinking.

478
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,040
No wonder you're a game "genius".

479
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,520
Alright.

480
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,480
These two

481
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,840
are reversed.

482
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,520
I'll hold it, you tie first.

483
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,080
Small hands.

484
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,080
Small hands.

485
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,200
My hands aren't small either.

486
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,840
Just saying your hands are big.

487
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,160
I think my "webbing" is bigger.

488
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:57,800
Webbing?

489
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,520
Yeah, my webbing.

490
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,480
Why use "webbing" to describe it?

491
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,080
First time I've heard that.

492
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,840
Someone saying their webbing is big.

493
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,440
Then tap it again.

494
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:09,960
Okay.

495
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,240
Looks like a spider.

496
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,160
Spider silk.

497
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:13,680
Yeah, it's all threads.

498
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,240
Yes, all threads.

499
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,440
"Caramelized sweet potato."

500
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,640
"Caramelized sweet potato."

501
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,400
So you...

502
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,880
Your laid-back personality,

503
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,400
who does it resemble more?

504
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,200
My laid-back side is more like my dad.

505
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,520
So, more like your dad.

506
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,400
Is your mom the quicker one?

507
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,200
Yeah, my mom is faster.

508
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,000
My mom has a quick temper.

509
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,200
Very quick-tempered.

510
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,080
Because my grandpa is also quick-tempered.

511
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,840
And you're the slow-paced one.

512
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,920
Yeah, I'm slow-paced.

513
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,480
I feel like I'm the type

514
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,720
who's slow in daily life.

515
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,880
But with many things, at work,

516
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,720
I'm actually fast.

517
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,600
What do you mean by "slow in life"?

518
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,120
Because with work,

519
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,280
it often requires high efficiency.

520
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,000
I have to finish things at certain points.

521
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,920
So I work at a fast pace.

522
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,920
And I make sure to finish efficiently.

523
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,080
But in daily life, I don't.

524
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,200
I'm actually pretty easygoing in life.

525
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:00,920
Just take it slow.

526
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm never in a rush to go anywhere.

527
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,480
Or to do anything.

528
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,160
Is your personality more like your mom

529
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,920
or your dad?

530
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,880
My personality...

531
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,200
Feels like neither, actually.

532
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,760
A mix.

533
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,720
Kind of balanced.

534
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,040
I feel like my personality

535
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,200
is shaped by both of their personalities.

536
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,280
Because both of them are quick-tempered.

537
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,440
Yeah, so I became a slow-paced person.

538
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,040
But deep down,

539
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,960
my old temper

540
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,720
was actually quick too.

541
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,040
But maybe because of many things,

542
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,760
or maybe it's just me,

543
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,760
since I lived alone in Shanghai

544
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,120
for five years.

545
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,640
So actually,

546
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,960
I probably smoothed out

547
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,920
some of my rough edges.

548
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,000
It made me more steady.

549
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,640
Plus, I don't like

550
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,440
getting into conflicts

551
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,320
just because of a quick temper.

552
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,360
It leads to clashes with others.

553
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,440
Or arguments.

554
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,440
Because things like that

555
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,760
just make both sides unhappy.

556
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:54,800
So sometimes,

557
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,720
I choose to handle things gently.

558
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,800
Being softer with my temper.

559
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,880
Honestly,

560
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,360
that's not a bad thing.

561
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,800
I think so too.

562
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,040
I also don't like

563
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,520
getting into conflicts with others.

564
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,800
Especially over personality differences.

565
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:13,640
Because sometimes,

566
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,720
I feel like in my life,

567
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,640
I prefer

568
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,440
a relationship that's like water.

569
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,000
"Like water."

570
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,760
Let's go.

571
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,840
Let's pick this one first.

572
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,560
You can

573
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,760
cut a little more if you want.

574
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,560
I'm going to pick a sunflower.

575
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,840
I want a sunflower too.

576
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,040
Have you picked one before?

577
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,000
No.

578
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,560
Do you prefer being active

579
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,320
or staying still?

580
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,840
Either is fine.

581
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,680
Both are good.

582
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,280
This one looks nice.

583
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,280
I like this one.

584
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,360
This one is pretty.

585
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,040
You're copying me.

586
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,480
And you're even copying me picking sunflowers.

587
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,840
This is really a whole lot.

588
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:28,760
That's enough.

589
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,440
Enough for the two of us.

590
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,040
Totally enough.

591
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,720
Let's go this way.

592
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,560
Have you always been like this?

593
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,440
Whether you're alone,

594
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,720
or with others,

595
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,720
No.

596
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,320
When I was in elementary school,

597
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,360
I was super outgoing.

598
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,800
If no one talked to me,

599
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,400
I'd feel really uncomfortable.

600
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,280
Seriously.

601
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,800
I was super E (Extraverted).

602
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,640
A real social butterfly.

603
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,600
The more people, the happier I was.

604
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,080
I couldn't stand being alone.

605
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:03,840
I had to go out.

606
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,080
But as I grew up,

607
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,680
I started to enjoy being alone.

608
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,480
Why's that?

609
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,760
What do you think

610
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,040
was the turning point?

611
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,320
I'm not sure.

612
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,440
Maybe because I do a lot of things,

613
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,320
and want to focus.

614
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,560
So I prefer being alone.

615
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,120
I'm more efficient by myself.

616
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,360
You can just do what you want.

617
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,920
No need to think about others.

618
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,760
Or worry about what might happen.

619
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,040
Were you always that way at school,

620
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,720
like a top student?

621
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,520
Not really.

622
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,320
So humble.

623
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,400
Seriously, not really.

624
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,320
Everyone at school is so competitive.

625
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,120
If I don't keep up, I'll fall behind.

626
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,400
I feel like

627
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,880
your way of thinking is actually

628
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,280
just like yours, right?

629
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,360
Are you complimenting yourself?

630
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,400
No.

631
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,800
Were you like this before too?

632
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,720
Yeah.

633
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,040
Really?

634
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,960
That's just who I am.

635
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,040
I thought you were

636
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,240
just competing with me after coming here.

637
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:55,880
Like you wanted to challenge me.

638
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,840
No.

639
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,240
Honestly, in daily life,

640
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,760
I'm pretty much like this.

641
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,280
A bit cheeky.

642
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,520
That's good.

643
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:04,880
Really good.

644
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,640
I'm teasing you.

645
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,120
It's great.

646
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,960
This is our

647
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,960
way of protecting ourselves.

648
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,880
Alright, we've been pressing for ages.

649
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,080
That's enough pressing, I think.

650
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,040
You still pressed better than me.

651
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,240
Hands-on skills.

652
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,240
Yours is already falling apart.

653
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,520
You're cracking me up.

654
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,640
Why do we have to roast each other like this?

655
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,520
We're not roasting each other.

656
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,360
I'm complimenting you.

657
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,000
Saying you cut really well.

658
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,240
You hit the spot with just one cut.

659
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,000
Just split it right away.

660
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,320
The last time I remember making a specimen

661
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,120
was back in

662
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,920
the last time.

663
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,040
Elementary school.

664
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,760
During science class.

665
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,360
Either science class or on the weekend.

666
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,400
I think it was for homework too.

667
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,560
And I remember

668
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,200
I had a

669
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,960
favorite encyclopedia back then.

670
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,160
So I put

671
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,000
the maple leaf I found

672
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,200
and some other leaves

673
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,320
I put a bunch of them

674
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,720
inside that encyclopedia.

675
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,720
After a really long time,

676
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,400
I took out that book.

677
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,360
When I saw the leaves were still there,

678
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:16,800
Yeah.

679
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,960
I was so happy.

680
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:19,920
When I was little, I used to

681
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,640
hide money in books.

682
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,200
And one day I forgot about it.

683
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,840
Then I opened a book and found a bunch of money.

684
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,720
I think we need to speed up.

685
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,160
Okay.

686
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,520
We still have to pick tomatoes.

687
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,560
Alright.

688
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,520
The tomatoes are about to clock out.

689
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,320
I just love this messy kind of beauty.

690
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,120
Casual.

691
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,400
Stop making excuses for yourself.

692
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,520
Nice, perfect.

693
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,200
Nice, perfect.

694
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:47,800
A work of art.

695
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,640
Now that's a real work of art.

696
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,920
Right?

697
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,360
Beautiful, really suits you.

698
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,000
Style.

699
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,880
Style.

700
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,760
Exactly.

701
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,360
You have to live your own style.

702
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,120
Let's go to the next activity.

703
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:03,920
Okay.

704
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,040
How do you dig this?

705
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,080
You can start by loosening it.

706
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,240
Then you plant the small one.

707
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,280
Alright.

708
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,640
You're planting yours in the corner, right?

709
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,560
Yeah, I want to plant it in the corner.

710
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,640
Loosen it up first.

711
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,880
Make the soil loose.

712
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,240
It's been ages since I smelled fresh earth.

713
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,840
You get that after it rains.

714
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,000
Nice.

715
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,360
Are you planting it this wide?

716
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,640
Pretty much.

717
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:33,800
Ten, twenty.

718
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,720
You studied humanities.

719
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,680
Me?

720
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,720
You're teasing me about numbers.

721
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,440
I'm not good with numbers.

722
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,040
What vegetables have you grown before?

723
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,720
Loofah.

724
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,320
Just in the yard.

725
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,880
We’d set up

726
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,440
something like a trellis.

727
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,920
And then,

728
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,760
yardlong beans.

729
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,360
What else?

730
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,040
Tomatoes.

731
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,320
Peppers.

732
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,240
Green onions.

733
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:03,840
That’s it.

734
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,040
Did I already

735
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,040
ask you this before?

736
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,080
Where have you traveled before?

737
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,000
When I was little,

738
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,480
I visited quite a few places in China.

739
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,560
Went with friends.

740
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,440
The first place was Wudang Mountain.

741
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,240
That’s in Hubei.

742
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,640
There’s a Taoist temple on the mountain.

743
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,120
We stayed up there.

744
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,640
No internet for three days.

745
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,160
Three days.

746
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:22,520
Yeah.

747
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,480
Because the signal is bad up there.

748
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,680
So we followed the masters there,

749
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,320
practiced Tai Chi and archery,

750
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,280
and helped repair houses.

751
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,240
Sometimes we’d chat with the masters.

752
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,000
They’d talk about

753
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,680
really deep topics.

754
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,520
Yeah.

755
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,600
They’re all

756
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,040
people with a lot of insight.

757
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,160
Write one.

758
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,000
What are you writing?

759
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,720
Dandan.

760
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,240
Why Dandan?

761
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,480
That’s the name of my two cats.

762
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:52,960
Xiaoman.

763
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,720
I really like the name Xiaoman.

764
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:55,920
Xiaoman.

765
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,240
Moderation surpasses perfection.

766
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,040
I’ll give you Xiaoman.

767
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,080
Done.

768
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:03,880
Perfect.

769
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,160
This one.

770
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,280
That’s twelve exactly.

771
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,720
Pick one more.

772
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,200
I think you can plant one more.

773
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,520
Write your own, maybe?

774
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,000
Write.

775
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,320
What’s today’s date?

776
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:18,880
June.

777
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,840
No rush, take your time.

778
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,440
Anything meaningful lately?

779
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,600
Something especially meaningful?

780
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,480
Or maybe

781
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,920
something you want to do?

782
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,800
You can write it all down.

783
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,200
Write a blessing.

784
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,840
That’s a good blessing.

785
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,520
Stick them together.

786
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,000
Okay.

787
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,800
Wishing all our friends in the cabin the best.

788
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,240
Done.

789
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,200
So many.

790
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,520
When we pick them,

791
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,200
let’s show everyone how.

792
00:25:59,200 --> 00:25:59,440
Come on.

793
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,800
Our red tomatoes.

794
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,080
We can pick the big ones.

795
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,200
When picking,

796
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,040
try to keep

797
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,480
the stem attached.

798
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,280
Just gently

799
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,040
like this.

800
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,520
Got it.

801
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,560
You can pick both yellow and red ones.

802
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,120
Done.

803
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,400
You can pick them yourself now.

804
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,480
Let’s go.

805
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,480
You go in first.

806
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,520
Go in.

807
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,000
Smells so good.

808
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,240
It’s really fragrant.

809
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,680
Feels like this one should be sweet.

810
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,000
Let’s just pick the big ones.

811
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,560
Should I go pick them?

812
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,600
This one is huge.

813
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,360
But tomatoes can be used for cooking too.

814
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,440
They're delicious when pan-fried.

815
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,880
Just fry this up.

816
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,960
Then sprinkle some salt and pepper.

817
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,880
It tastes great.

818
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,840
You really know how to enjoy life.

819
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,320
Of course.

820
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,680
I noticed you can turn anything

821
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,680
into something to eat.

822
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,520
Seriously, what else can you cook?

823
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,560
I really want to order something.

824
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:01,680
I don't know.

825
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,560
You go first.

826
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,240
Fish.

827
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,240
What kind of fish?

828
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:05,880
Perch.

829
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,120
Perch.

830
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,080
Why perch?

831
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,560
Because it's tasty.

832
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,480
Is it because your last name is Lu?

833
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,400
That's not necessary.

834
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,080
Shouldn't tonight's dinner match the theme?

835
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,000
Eat farmhouse-style food.

836
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:21,600
Yeah.

837
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,480
How did you know?

838
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,440
Really?

839
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,080
Really.

840
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,800
I'm really good at guessing.

841
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,720
What can you pick here?

842
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,600
What are we eating later?

843
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,440
I really like farmhouse-style food.

844
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,400
The dishes they make

845
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,680
have a great wok aroma and smell amazing.

846
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,320
When it comes to farmhouse food,

847
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,920
my impression is from before,

848
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,120
my impression is from before,

849
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,280
when I was in elementary or middle school.

850
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,560
During summer vacation.

851
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,680
My dad would take me swimming.

852
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,120
My dad did that too.

853
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:45,680
Right?

854
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,320
Yeah.

855
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,400
After swimming,

856
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,080
we'd eat farmhouse food.

857
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:49,680
Yeah.

858
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,160
And the food tasted amazing.

859
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,040
Yeah.

860
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,440
Alright.

861
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,080
Pretty much.

862
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:10,120
Do you know any good restaurants in Shanghai?

863
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,360
Shanghai has some.

864
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,000
There are lots in Shanghai.

865
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,240
Lots of good food.

866
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,360
I'll take you next time.

867
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,200
When you come to Shanghai.

868
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:20,920
Sounds good.

869
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,760
I love eating.

870
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,640
Great, I love eating too.

871
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,040
I think eating

872
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,320
is the happiest thing.

873
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,800
What kind of cuisine do you like?

874
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,680
I quite like Shanghai cuisine.

875
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,200
But my favorite is

876
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,320
the fresher-tasting ones.

877
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,560
For example,

878
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,560
freshwater fish.

879
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,880
Seafood and river fish.

880
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:55,800
River fish.

881
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,440
Yeah, like fish.

882
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,120
So I love the fresh taste of seafood.

883
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:01,880
Yeah.

884
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,520
And also shellfish.

885
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,200
Yeah.

886
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,080
Fish.

887
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:08,800
Yes.

888
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,600
Who cooks more in your family?

889
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,480
At home, my mom cooked when I was little.

890
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,040
She could make all kinds of

891
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,280
dishes.

892
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,280
They were delicious.

893
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:23,880
Really?

894
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,240
She also taught me

895
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,560
how to cook.

896
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,600
Then your mom's cooking must be amazing.

897
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,400
It must be delicious.

898
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,840
Because your cooking is really good.

899
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,680
Thank you.

900
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,040
In our family, it's always my dad who cooks.

901
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:46,960
Dad.

902
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,920
My dad's cooking is really delicious.

903
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,080
But he uses a lot of soy sauce.

904
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,560
You know,

905
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,360
what "heavy soy sauce" means?

906
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,640
It means adding extra soy sauce.

907
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,840
He loves to add soy sauce.

908
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,360
I just like

909
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,240
food with strong flavors.

910
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,680
All kinds of salty dishes.

911
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,720
And sweet ones too.

912
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,000
My dad's cooking is always flavorful.

913
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,720
I usually eat two or three bowls of rice.

914
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,200
So I always gain weight when I go home.

915
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,200
Do you learn to cook from your dad?

916
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,640
My dad doesn't teach me.

917
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,760
He won't.

918
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,280
Yeah, he doesn't want me to learn.

919
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,200
Why is that?

920
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,400
There's a romantic story behind it.

921
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,440
So,

922
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,880
when my dad was courting my mom,

923
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,800
my mom said she didn't like the smell of cooking oil.

924
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:46,640
My dad said,

925
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,440
"I'll never let you

926
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,000
deal with cooking fumes in your life."

927
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,040
Then my dad even went

928
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,160
and learned how to cook back then.

929
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,600
Now my mom only knows how to make one dish.

930
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,560
Which dish is it?

931
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,440
Pork ribs and corn soup.

932
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,600
Corn soup.

933
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,080
Then let's go.

934
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:09,800
Okay.

935
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,960
I think mine and yours

936
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,080
will look great when finished.

937
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,440
I'm really looking forward to it too.

938
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,800
Do you think waiting fourteen days

939
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,800
is a bit too long?

940
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,640
Or do you think it's actually fine?

941
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,320
I think it's fine.

942
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,240
I hope we can

943
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,640
before we leave the house,

944
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,560
bring them back and show everyone.

945
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,760
I feel like when we did

946
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,320
ceramic clay molding,

947
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,880
it really matched our personalities.

948
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,920
Like, when we were shaping it, right?

949
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,920
We were both so focused.

950
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,560
Really focused.

951
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,840
And what we made looked so nice.

952
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,600
So cute.

953
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:53,880
The "baby" version.

954
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,320
I just love this style.

955
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,080
What's your favorite animal?

956
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,440
My favorite animal...

957
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,640
I really like it too.

958
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,440
Capybara.

959
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,120
Capybara.

960
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:10,920
Capybara.

961
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,160
Yeah.

962
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,560
I've always liked them.

963
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,760
What else?

964
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,200
Leopard.

965
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,240
Leopard.

966
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,000
Cheetah.

967
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:20,520
Right.

968
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,120
You like cheetahs.

969
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,760
Because they're so fast.

970
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,760
Now that you mention it, I think you're like a cheetah too.

971
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,200
In what way?

972
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,400
Very cool.

973
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,600
Because cheetahs are cool too.

974
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,360
And cheetahs give off

975
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,760
a really energetic vibe.

976
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,600
What about you? Your favorite animal?

977
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,520
My favorite...

978
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,880
Besides your cat.

979
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,400
Actually, I don't have a favorite.

980
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,720
I'm kind of weird that way.

981
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,520
It's hard for me to have a "favorite" anything.

982
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,800
But there are things I'm afraid of.

983
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,440
I'm a bit scared of animals with pointy snouts.

984
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,440
Pointy-snouted animals freak me out.

985
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,000
I really love mountains and the sea.

986
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,200
When I'm feeling down, I go hiking.

987
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,160
Or I'll go

988
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:07,640
diving.

989
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,120
What about you, when you're feeling down?

990
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,120
When I'm not in a good mood,

991
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,400
I stay in my room.

992
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,040
But sometimes I'll go out for a walk.

993
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,080
My home in Switzerland

994
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,600
is right next to

995
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,840
a small hillside,

996
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,680
beside a vineyard.

997
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,280
So I can

998
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,680
walk to the vineyard in a few minutes.

999
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,960
Take my dog for a walk there.

1000
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,480
That sounds really relaxing.

1001
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,560
So cozy.

1002
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,320
Sometimes I feel like

1003
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,200
lately my

1004
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,520
feelings

1005
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,920
don't really show.

1006
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,200
I used to be really lively.

1007
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,080
Very enthusiastic.

1008
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,720
I feel like

1009
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,400
nowadays I tend to

1010
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,520
hide all my emotions and feelings.

1011
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,560
Keep them inside.

1012
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,560
But I can't really hide them.

1013
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,760
They still show.

1014
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,960
Because in your eyes,

1015
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,240
it's obvious.

1016
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,400
You can feel it.

1017
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:19,920
Are you hungry now?

1018
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:20,920
Yeah.

1019
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,280
Sure.

1020
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,240
Let's go have a big meal.

1021
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,800
We should be there soon.

1022
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,520
Almost there.

1023
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,000
Not far.

1024
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,880
Your outfit is really beautiful.

1025
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,280
Really?

1026
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,480
And it sparkles too.

1027
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,600
I just noticed.

1028
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,800
I really like this outfit.

1029
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,600
When are my clothes not pretty?

1030
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,720
They're pretty every day.

1031
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,080
Every day it's a different kind of pretty.

1032
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,280
"Little Blue, always changing"

1033
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,920
"Little Blue, always changing"

1034
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,200
This is

1035
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,880
the most fulfilling weekend I've had this year.

1036
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,480
I really like everyone here.

1037
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,320
When everyone gets together for team activities.

1038
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:05,840
Actually,

1039
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,000
me too.

1040
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,800
I think

1041
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,760
it's really fun.

1042
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,200
I really enjoy it.

1043
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,160
If I have friends around

1044
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,760
who can join in

1045
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,080
and be wild together,

1046
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:17,720
I feel

1047
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,120
they even make you wilder.

1048
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:20,880
Yeah.

1049
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,440
Different styles of wild.

1050
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,360
Going wild together.

1051
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,960
The environment here is so nice.

1052
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,400
It is.

1053
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,080
Thank you.

1054
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:40,840
No need to thank me.

1055
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,800
Eat something.

1056
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,400
You must be hungry too.

1057
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,360
Yesterday, Duoduo and I

1058
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,800
I saw you two holding hands.

1059
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,560
During the sports event.

1060
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,440
Just chatting there.

1061
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,280
At first, we didn't really

1062
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,280
talk much.

1063
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,160
But during the sports event yesterday,

1064
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,360
the two of us suddenly

1065
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,080
became much closer.

1066
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,640
I feel like she really understands me, you know?

1067
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,720
And she gets me too.

1068
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,680
It's unexpected.

1069
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,880
Yeah, she really encouraged me yesterday.

1070
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,560
My relationship with her

1071
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,760
took a big step forward.

1072
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,760
I think that's my biggest gain from yesterday.

1073
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:21,840
Yeah.

1074
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,960
And I think both of you

1075
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,960
are probably the type

1076
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,360
who don't usually show certain sides of yourselves

1077
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,520
very openly.

1078
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,400
Yeah.

1079
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,640
Especially you.

1080
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,520
I think everything

1081
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,560
happens for the best.

1082
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,960
I'm starting to believe that more and more.

1083
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,720
Me too.

1084
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,360
Eat more so you won't be hungry later.

1085
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,160
I've eaten a lot.

1086
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:46,800
I keep eating.

1087
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,200
I feel like

1088
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,480
I ate most of these dishes.

1089
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,120
I feel

1090
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,200
my dress was loose before,

1091
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,080
now it's really tight.

1092
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,400
I've always wondered

1093
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,200
how someone as pure

1094
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,600
and kind as you exists.

1095
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,080
But after you told me

1096
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,560
about your parents' relationship

1097
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,800
and your family,

1098
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,360
I realized

1099
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,240
that's the answer.

1100
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,320
Really.

1101
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,080
Just like my parents told me today,

1102
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,360
they hope we can all

1103
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,440
stay happy

1104
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,440
and keep our purity.
