1
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,200
You should come over here.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,400
I’ll come over here.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:07,600
Yeah.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:07,840
Okay.

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:08,480
Because I remember you,

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,000
on your very first day,

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,960
you made a wish.

8
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,320
And a few days ago, on Monday night,

9
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,400
you told me about making a wish.

10
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,840
So, my surprise for you is—

11
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,960
I prepared a Wishing Tree.

12
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,240
A Wishing Tree.

13
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,920
I think this tree is actually pretty big.

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,000
It can hold a really big wish.

15
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,040
You can make a wish now.

16
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,560
Okay.

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,840
Alright, three, two, one—close your eyes.

18
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,600
This is so romantic.

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,280
This is really amazing.

20
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,120
Open your eyes.

21
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,240
I opened them early.

22
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:33,960
Okay.

23
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,320
This is so touching.

24
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,000
"Like a drama."

25
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,200
I think this part,

26
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,920
the light signals,

27
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,160
flow from the ground up to the tree,

28
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,360
then shoot up into the sky.

29
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,680
So you made this wish today,

30
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,600
the whole universe will hear it.

31
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,160
The whole universe will hear it.

32
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,800
I'm a little teary.

33
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,800
It really hit me.

34
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,480
I'm really happy.

35
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,160
I want to ask, it's so high—

36
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,960
how did you climb up there?

37
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,480
A ladder.

38
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,840
That ladder.

39
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,600
I set up the ladder on the side.

40
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,040
Then I swung the rope.

41
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,360
So you actually have to

42
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,280
move the ladder all the way around.

43
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:31,920
Yeah.

44
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,160
Thank you.

45
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,840
Thanks.

46
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,040
So all day,

47
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,640
he didn't show up because he was doing this.

48
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,800
He didn't show up because he was doing this.

49
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,200
Everyone was looking for Xiao Jiao.

50
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,640
He was working on the Wishing Tree.

51
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,640
With so much to do, how could anyone find him?

52
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,760
Then wait a bit more.

53
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,680
Stay right there, don't move.

54
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,800
Okay.

55
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,840
And also,

56
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,120
He went all out.

57
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,400
Turn around.

58
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,480
Work with me, thanks.

59
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,040
Okay.

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,240
It's so windy.

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Was this not in your

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,440
expected outcome?

63
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,560
It's fine, because I

64
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,120
I still have two more.

65
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,480
Because I

66
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,720
I still have two more.

67
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,000
You can still play.

68
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:44,840
I can give you one.

69
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,560
This is pretty fun.

70
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,280
Okay.

71
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,480
I'll go first.

72
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,280
You can play one yourself.

73
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,040
How do I play? Like this?

74
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,760
Do you need a photo?

75
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,280
I can, I brought my phone.

76
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,120
I can take a picture for you.

77
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,080
I can record a video for you.

78
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,560
Okay.

79
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,080
What should I do?

80
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,840
I noticed everything you picked for me

81
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,720
is pink.

82
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,360
Yeah.

83
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,800
Let me show you.

84
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,440
When you take the photo,

85
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,120
you can hold it a bit higher.

86
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,600
That way it'll look even better.

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,600
Okay.

88
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,680
Is this height okay?

89
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,400
Yes.

90
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,040
Alright.

91
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Three, two, one, go.

92
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,880
It's so pretty.

93
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,120
Looks great.

94
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,480
Looks great.

95
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,600
He was talking about Lan Lan.

96
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,800
Looks great.

97
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,280
So beautiful.

98
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,080
Absolutely gorgeous.

99
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,240
You're praising me so much, I'm embarrassed.

100
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,880
Really.

101
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,920
So beautiful.

102
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,880
I just think it's wonderful.

103
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,720
What's wrong?

104
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,320
He finally got up.

105
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,480
Doesn't everyone think so?

106
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,120
I'm about to burst.

107
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,000
He finally got his own

108
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,600
moment to shine.

109
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
I can't take it anymore.

110
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,160
I feel like she can already see

111
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,160
his wedding.

112
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,320
Thank you for preparing this.

113
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,320
You're welcome.

114
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,360
The Wishing Tree and these fireworks

115
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,360
are both so cute.

116
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,360
Everything you prepared today

117
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,480
really

118
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,760
I think it completely exceeded

119
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,440
my expectations.

120
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,240
It went beyond what you guessed.

121
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,440
Yes, it did.

122
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,040
I originally thought

123
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,240
it would just be the two of us

124
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,680
maybe walking and talking in the park.

125
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,760
Just a weekday park time.

126
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,920
Literally.

127
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,160
Yeah.

128
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,840
At most,

129
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,840
maybe at a restaurant

130
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,600
one of those we passed by,

131
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,440
having a meal and chatting.

132
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,040
But everything today

133
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,720
was far more

134
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,920
thoughtfully prepared than I imagined.

135
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,440
Much more than I imagined,

136
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,840
it really amazed me.

137
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,880
It made me feel

138
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,840
so happy

139
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,760
and lucky.

140
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,720
This is the happiest thing

141
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,920
I've heard all week.

142
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,000
Actually, at the very beginning of planning,

143
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,640
it was all a bit shapeless.

144
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
Didn't you bring a gift on the first day?

145
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,640
Was it building blocks?

146
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,560
It felt like building with blocks

147
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,960
in the early stage.

148
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,680
At first,

149
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,320
I thought this park

150
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,400
was so dark.

151
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,240
Like,

152
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,280
there's nothing here at night.

153
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,120
This is the Broken Bridge.

154
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,600
Yo Sheep Ranch.

155
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,000
This is Yo Sheep Ranch.

156
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,400
The Deer Garden is here too.

157
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,320
Will there be deer at night?

158
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,640
They might get scared.

159
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,840
See, when he heard the dog barking,

160
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,920
he thought about the girl,

161
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,000
that she might get scared too.

162
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,200
Okay.

163
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,800
Yo Sheep Ranch is out.

164
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,920
Jungle Go-Karts.

165
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,840
Is this the Windmill Corridor?

166
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,080
We came here yesterday.

167
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,600
How do you do this?

168
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,360
He did this over several nights.

169
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,960
Next place.

170
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,880
He kept searching.

171
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,520
After walking around the first night,

172
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,880
I was totally confused.

173
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,520
I couldn't really find

174
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,520
any place that felt

175
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,240
interesting.

176
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,280
That night when we went for a walk,

177
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,120
you happened to mention

178
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,840
that you made a wish last night.

179
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,400
So the wishing idea came in.

180
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,760
Maybe that gave me a little direction.

181
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,480
I needed to find a clean lawn.

182
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,400
Hello.

183
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,080
May I borrow

184
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,720
the tables and chairs here?

185
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,480
I'll just be setting up over there,

186
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,400
decorating the campsite a bit.

187
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,240
Sure.

188
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,880
Thank you.

189
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,080
Look at that initiative.

190
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,400
He can actually prepare

191
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:57,960
a little surprise for you.

192
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,120
I think

193
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,760
this whole process is also very happy.

194
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,240
Okay.

195
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,800
I'm sweating buckets.

196
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,280
This is my

197
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,600
weekly

198
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,640
building block plan.

199
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,160
Report complete.

200
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,480
Like a young general after a victorious battle.

201
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,320
Actually, on the first day,

202
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,360
I really wanted to get to know you.

203
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,480
After entering the house, there were a lot of people.

204
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,800
So for many days after that,

205
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,840
I was actually a bit

206
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,960
unsure what I was doing.

207
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,560
I think maybe it's because

208
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,960
I didn't know how

209
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,360
to get along with you.

210
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,160
It makes you feel comfortable.

211
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,360
That's why I wanted to get

212
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,960
the weekday date card.

213
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,400
But what I want to say is,

214
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,760
I actually didn't want to mention this.

215
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,600
Because I was afraid it would pressure you.

216
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,560
I still hope

217
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,960
even after today,

218
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,840
you can still be yourself and feel free.

219
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,080
I think your happiness

220
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,160
is the most important thing.

221
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,360
I think your happiness

222
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,440
is what matters most.

223
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,040
Let's eat.

224
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,440
Sorry, I shouldn't have said so much.

225
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,640
I just want to say,

226
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,520
thank you for caring about my happiness.

227
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,520
And I think

228
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,120
besides me,

229
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,920
I hope you also

230
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,320
take care of your own feelings.

231
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,040
I also hope you

232
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,280
are happy.

233
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,080
Thank you.

234
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,080
Ruolan is great too.

235
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,160
So beautiful.

236
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,600
Let me see.

237
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,920
Just swipe it over to me.

238
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,440
But I think

239
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,840
it looks good from my angle too.

240
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,040
Give me a piece of paper.

241
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,120
I think this scene

242
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,440
shows Ruolan's genuine happiness.

243
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,000
Xiao Jiao is happy too.

244
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,880
Because he's truly sincere and thoughtful.

245
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,360
I was really touched just now.

246
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,040
Xiao Jiao's actions made me feel

247
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,560
that love is actually simple.

248
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,080
It's just wanting to give her the best in the world.

249
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,200
He seems like

250
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,480
"I love you, and it's not about you."

251
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,600
I'm simply expressing it to you.

252
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,880
And especially

253
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,280
when he wants to bring the power of the universe

254
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,200
into it,

255
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,200
it moves me in a way I can't resist.

256
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,680
He hung up

257
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,080
stars and moons on the tree.

258
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,920
He said at that moment,

259
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,160
the universe would hear it.

260
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,560
He wants to pour

261
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,760
the power of the world

262
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,920
to help you fulfill

263
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,600
even your smallest wish.

264
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,080
What touched me most was the flashback

265
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,640
of him searching for that park all the way.

266
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,720
I just felt

267
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,160
he spent several nights

268
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,080
doing all this.

269
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,160
But I think a date like this

270
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,840
takes so much effort to create.

271
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,240
It's really not easy at all.

272
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,840
Ask the girls,

273
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,720
what kind of

274
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,280
park date do you want?

275
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,600
Let me share one.

276
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,720
The one I want to design.

277
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,200
I hope drones can

278
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,760
fly out and create a sky full of stars.

279
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,320
One of the drones

280
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,120
I want it to land in my hand at the end.

281
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,840
Then I'll give it to him.

282
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,640
Because there's a lyric I really love.

283
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,120
It goes,

284
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,160
"I want to fly to the endless night sky"

285
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,080
"and pick a star to be your toy."

286
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,640
That star has to twinkle with the others.

287
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,360
After it twinkles, you can control it remotely.

288
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,360
Because it can land as a single star.

289
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,920
And it's also a toy.

290
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,960
I just want to be with him

291
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,280
and ride a roller coaster together.

292
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,120
Or do something exciting like bumper cars.

293
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,480
Something thrilling.

294
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,280
Then the two of us would start

295
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,480
feeling our hearts race.

296
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,440
There might even be

297
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,720
a little physical contact.

298
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,000
And I think

299
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,960
I'd already be falling for him.

300
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,600
After that,

301
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,920
we'd go

302
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,680
sit on those little benches

303
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,960
and feel the breeze.

304
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,920
Take a break,

305
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,000
maybe have a drink,

306
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,320
and just relax.

307
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,120
Calm down a bit.

308
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,560
We could have a nice chat.

309
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,680
With the moonlight shining down,

310
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,160
just the two of us,

311
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,400
in a quiet corner,

312
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,480
it would be so romantic.

313
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,280
But it has to be at night for us.

314
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,000
Because we won't get sunburned at night.

315
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,480
And it won't be too hot.

316
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,800
Also,

317
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,560
you won't sweat or mess up your makeup.

318
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,320
And the vibe is just better.

319
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,240
He looks handsome too.

320
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,600
I get it.

321
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,960
Both of us would want that.

322
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,360
And if

323
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,400
we both get shy,

324
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,440
there's somewhere to hide.

325
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,720
So I hope everyone

326
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,400
can join in

327
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:33,880
our

328
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,040
Weibo topic.

329
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,240
If you have any

330
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:36,560
romantic surprise ideas,

331
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,720
romantic surprise ideas,

332
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,040
feel free to share them with us.

333
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,920
Next,

334
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,520
let's take a look

335
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,720
at the signals in the house

336
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,960
and see what changes

337
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,760
have happened.

338
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,360
Let's keep watching.

339
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,240
Let's keep watching.

340
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,160
You make eating look so good.

341
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,600
I'm really hungry now.

342
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,320
Try this.

343
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:09,640
You made this?

344
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:11,560
Seriously?

345
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,160
You can make steamed eggs?

346
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,640
What, you don't believe in me?

347
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:15,680
No way.

348
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,720
It's so tender.

349
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,000
Of course.

350
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,280
I love steamed eggs.

351
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,320
Give it a review.

352
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:32,840
Not bad, right?

353
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:34,640
It's good.

354
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,280
Is this really egg?

355
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:38,800
You're good at compliments.

356
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,640
How long did you steam this egg?

357
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,680
About thirty minutes.

358
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,880
Thirty minutes?

359
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,920
Impressive, it's still

360
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,400
so soft after thirty minutes.

361
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,600
Of course.

362
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,600
I'm a natural at cooking.

363
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,040
What's your water-to-egg ratio?

364
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:56,880
I just eyeball it.

365
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,840
Seriously, I just go by feel.

366
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,680
Then you should cook from now on.

367
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,120
Then you'll be eating steamed eggs every day.

368
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,600
When are you making spicy hot pot?

369
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,320
It's been days.

370
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,200
You buy the ingredients, I'll cook.

371
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,320
What ingredients do you need?

372
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,880
Just get whatever you want to eat.

373
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,000
Do you need any seasonings?

374
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,520
Just the spicy hot pot base.

375
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:22,880
No extra seasonings needed.

376
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:24,880
Alright.

377
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,240
I'll stir-fry it for you.

378
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,080
Okay.

379
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,280
You said it.

380
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,520
Dr. Fang

381
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,640
Why is no one here?

382
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:44,760
Hello.

383
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,000
Hi.

384
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,720
Is Herry around?

385
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,120
Herry is over there.

386
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,680
Why are you—

387
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,600
Why are you suddenly looking for him today?

388
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,200
I get it now.

389
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,200
What?

390
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,200
What do you know?

391
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,600
Herry and Lan Lan are—

392
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,640
Good friends.

393
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,680
So if you want to know about Lan Lan,

394
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,040
of course you can ask him.

395
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,760
A brain teaser.

396
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:15,560
Hello.

397
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,160
Hi.

398
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,520
Hello.

399
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:16,840
Hi.

400
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,520
Just got back.

401
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:18,880
How's your eye?

402
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,560
Yeah, I wanted to see you for a follow-up these days.

403
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,040
A stye.

404
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,880
Is it better?

405
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,040
Feels better than yesterday.

406
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,120
I brought you two medicines.

407
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,920
I had a stye before.

408
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,080
Why didn't you check it for me?

409
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,720
You had one before?

410
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,960
No one even remembered you.

411
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:47,840
Dr. Fang.

412
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,400
I have a question for you.

413
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,480
I always rack my brain picking gifts.

414
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,720
I'm afraid I won't get it right.

415
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,000
Do you have any good suggestions?

416
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,240
I think you could give an Estée Lauder gift set.

417
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,040
Estée Lauder.

418
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,600
I don't think any girl would say no to that.

419
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,240
Plus, this one is a collaboration with

420
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,920
a regular designer from Paris Fashion Week.

421
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,680
It's a limited edition holiday gift set.

422
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,160
It has their signature brown bottle serum.

423
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,320
That's their best-selling product.

424
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,720
Their top anti-aging serum.

425
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,920
Looks great and is practical.

426
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,560
It's a solid gift.

427
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,360
That's actually a good idea.

428
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,760
I'll look into it.

429
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,240
Let's go, want to work out?

430
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,880
Let's check if the photo machine is fixed.

431
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,360
Let's go.

432
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:23,720
Let's go.

433
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,520
Let's head down too.

434
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,160
Why is this little windmill still spinning?

435
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,720
I get it now.

436
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,200
What's up?

437
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:31,680
What?

438
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,880
Is it Xiao Jiao—

439
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,440
You just realized?

440
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,040
Using this?

441
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,000
You just found out?

442
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,600
They're at the park.

443
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,240
He still doesn't know.

444
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
What should we do?

445
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,160
I just realized.

446
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,120
How did you just find out?

447
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,520
What do we do?

448
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,480
He really cares.

449
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,120
This is tough.

450
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,840
Can we use it now?

451
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,880
It's ready.

452
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,760
I think it's good too.

453
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,000
It's fine for today.

454
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,360
Rui Long.

455
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,720
What's wrong?

456
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,240
Feeling down?

457
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:14,960
Not really.

458
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,520
Dr. Fang is upset.

459
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,120
Because Xiao Jiao took Lan Lan out.

460
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,560
Took her to the park.

461
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,800
It's just a walk in the park.

462
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,320
It's not just a walk in the park.

463
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,200
Dr. Fang is upset.

464
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,280
This—

465
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:33,960
What now?

466
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,880
This is a tough one.

467
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,320
I'm heading out.

468
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,400
It's too hard.

469
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,360
Are you here alone?

470
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,920
Where's Lan Lan?

471
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,160
No idea.

472
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,440
Has Lan Lan come back?

473
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,160
I don't know.

474
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,600
No idea.

475
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,440
Haven't seen her today.

476
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,480
Back so late today.

477
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,320
I forgot to bring my book down.

478
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,320
What should I do now?

479
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,680
Dr. Fang cares a lot.

480
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,600
Especially since he's the possessive type.

481
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,400
He's the only one who's possessive.

482
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,720
So his concern is even more obvious.

483
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,400
Darn it.

484
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,480
I think I need a couple of days to recover.

485
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,800
When I was driving back to pick you up,

486
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,400
I wished the car could go a hundred miles an hour.

487
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,440
But now, driving back to the cabin,

488
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,560
I wish the car could go just one mile an hour.

489
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,200
So we could spend more time together.

490
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,800
I really love what he said.

491
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:39,680
Let's go.

492
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,040
Time to sleep, let's head inside.

493
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,960
I don't know why,

494
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,760
but right now,

495
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,600
I truly feel

496
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,080
like I'm coming home.

497
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,640
We were out having fun for so long,

498
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,560
and now there's this

499
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,920
feeling of rest.

500
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,800
A sense of relaxation.

501
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,520
I think you're absolutely right.

502
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,440
When you're getting close to home,

503
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,320
that sleepy, restful feeling

504
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:58,760
just

505
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,840
comes over you.

506
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:00,920
Yeah.

507
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,000
Tonight was really relaxing.

508
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,480
I felt relaxed and happy.

509
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:05,960
That's good.

510
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,760
You should be happy too.

511
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,200
Okay, I promise.

512
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,400
Come in.

513
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,400
Actually, I really like

514
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,400
the way Lan Lan expresses herself.

515
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,040
She keeps saying,

516
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:16,760
"You should be happy too."

517
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,720
"You should be yourself."

518
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,400
"You should feel comfortable too."

519
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,040
Right.

520
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,960
I'll head upstairs first.

521
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,960
You go ahead, bye.

522
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,160
Bye.

523
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:30,760
Bye.

524
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,160
Just got back.

525
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,280
Yeah.

526
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,080
Where is everyone?

527
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,000
Where is everyone?

528
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,400
Just went back to their rooms.

529
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:56,920
What's going on?

530
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:58,600
Withdraw.

531
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,440
What's wrong?

532
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,280
What's wrong?

533
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,440
"Help!"

534
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,520
Did you bump into something?

535
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,480
No, I didn't.

536
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,160
I'm not going.

537
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,000
I'm not going out.

538
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,560
It's a mess.

539
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,680
That's so unlike Dr. Fang.

540
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,400
Here I am.

541
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,160
So cute.

542
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,560
Can you help me put this outside?

543
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,240
And grab my water cup while you're at it.

544
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,760
Can you get me some water?

545
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,120
Is that okay?

546
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,880
Where should I put it?

547
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,920
On that sofa.

548
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,240
He's so funny.

549
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,680
Back again.

550
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,800
Back again.

551
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,480
We came out at the wrong time.

552
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,400
No, I just wanted to get some water too.

553
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,640
He probably doesn't know how to handle it.

554
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,120
No?

555
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,080
This one?

556
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,160
No.

557
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,560
That water cup.

558
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,240
Water cup.

559
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,880
If you can't find it, it's fine.

560
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,720
As soon as he saw Ruolan,

561
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,040
he turned back.

562
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,240
No.

563
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,520
Just put it on your book.

564
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,040
Just put it on your book.

565
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:20,960
What are you doing?

566
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,160
What are you doing?

567
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,080
What are you doing?

568
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,000
Sometimes, honestly,

569
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,320
the more you want to see someone, the less you do.

570
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:37,880
Hello.

571
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,440
Hello.

572
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,920
I really can't find my water cup.

573
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,440
Let's go inside.

574
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,400
He (Dr. Fang) looks

575
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,320
really busy.

576
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,960
I don't know what to say. What should I do?

577
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,080
It's okay.

578
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,600
You don't have to say anything.

579
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,920
Let's just not say anything.

580
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,800
What are we doing here?

581
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,320
Just looking around.

582
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,200
I don't know.

583
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,480
I came out to boil some water.

584
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,040
I came out to get some water.

585
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,680
I came to keep you company.

586
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,760
You can't find your water bottle.

587
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,360
There's another one over there.

588
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:41,760
It's that one.

589
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,480
Another one got withdrawn.

590
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,280
Everyone feels a bit unsure.

591
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,120
Not sure how to deal with it.

592
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,680
It's like a magnet.

593
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,080
Right?

594
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,560
Actually, if it's just two people,

595
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,240
things seem a bit simpler.

596
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,480
When everyone's together,

597
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,240
it feels harder.

598
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,120
This situation

599
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,240
What's wrong?

600
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,000
Everyone's just watching the drama.

601
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,120
Why leave?

602
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,400
Why did he leave?

603
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,920
There's still a gift.

604
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,560
This part feels like watching a silent film.

605
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,560
It's so entertaining.

606
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,760
He's really dramatic.

607
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,480
Even pouring water, he has to act like that.

608
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,520
No, five hundred milliliters.

609
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:51,840
Going to sleep.

610
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,280
Good night.

611
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,400
"Sneaky"

612
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,040
"Acting all stealthy"

613
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,480
I'm leaving, bye.

614
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,240
Bye.

615
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,240
Even Xiao Jiao is using a cutesy voice now.

616
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,320
I'm leaving, bye.

617
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,120
He's already in love.

618
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,680
Yeah.

619
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:00,960
What's this?

620
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,040
What's this round about?

621
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,120
They're all little notes from Xiao Jiao.

622
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,560
Okay.

623
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,600
Good luck.

624
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,480
What are you planning for tomorrow?

625
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,360
I just want to stay home.

626
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,120
I don't want to come anymore.

627
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,240
Don't give up on yourself.

628
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,800
I can't take it anymore.

629
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,480
It's too complicated.

630
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,080
This is really beyond me.

631
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,920
Here's something fun for you.

632
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,720
Three people, three moods.

633
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,440
What should we do?

634
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:26,920
This part

635
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,400
For Dr. Fang,

636
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,320
he's having a hard time too.

637
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,000
He might feel like

638
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,160
he's half a step behind.

639
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,720
But it's more than just half a step.

640
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,200
Park Time

641
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,880
This is a standing long jump.

642
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,440
He might think

643
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,920
Am I not proactive enough?

644
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,800
Am I not trying hard enough?

645
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,960
Am I not good enough?

646
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,880
Then he starts to

647
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,800
shrink his own energy again.

648
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,200
Xiao Jiao doing all this

649
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,680
is really touching.

650
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,600
But maybe

651
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,200
the outcome isn't as perfect as it seems.

652
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,440
Honestly, seeing him makes me feel a bit...

653
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,200
Like seeing myself

654
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,960
back when I was a student.

655
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,600
I just think

656
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,360
some paths

657
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,720
you have to walk, no matter what.

658
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,960
Only after you fall once

659
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,760
do you realize it hurts.

660
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,120
Then you’ll know what to do next time.

661
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,720
For Xiao Jiao,

662
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,000
the process matters most.

663
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,680
I think along the way,

664
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,680
his courage

665
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,080
If I had been as

666
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,320
brave as him when I was young,

667
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,440
I think even now,

668
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,720
I’d be married with kids.

669
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,680
Just now,

670
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,000
he secretly left a gift at her door.

671
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,920
I think that gesture

672
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,520
is really touching.

673
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,120
I mean,

674
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,480
he’s so considerate,

675
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,240
he doesn’t want Dr. Fang to feel uncomfortable.

676
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,280
If you were the girl,

677
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,360
wouldn’t you feel

678
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,040
his sincerity too?

679
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,640
But I think

680
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,600
right now, Lan Lan

681
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,280
must feel really upset.

682
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,480
And guilty.

683
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,560
There’s one thing—

684
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,680
after she went over there,

685
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,520
she kept paying attention to Dr. Fang.

686
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,720
I think maybe she cares about Dr. Fang

687
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,240
a bit more.

688
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,400
So far,

689
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,600
maybe everyone feels

690
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,680
Ruolan and

691
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,640
Dr. Fang’s

692
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,880
spark is stronger.

693
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,720
But I don’t think

694
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,320
that’s

695
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,200
the final outcome.

696
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,120
I agree.

697
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,520
But this journey

698
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,160
I think

699
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,480
Xiao Jiao’s sincerity

700
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,640
really turned things around.

701
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:58,680
Yeah.

702
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,800
A while ago,

703
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,800
we all felt

704
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,720
bad for him.

705
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,920
We felt sorry for him.

706
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,280
He finally

707
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,000
got to express himself.

708
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,040
We felt relieved too.

709
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,080
Loving someone sincerely is something to be proud of.

710
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,320
It’s truly admirable.

711
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,360
What?

712
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,360
Someone opened Duo Duo’s secret message moment.

713
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,560
Someone’s looking for her.

714
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,080
Who?

715
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,000
Duo Duo’s inbox has been opened.

716
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,280
She’s fixing her hair and makeup.

717
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,200
Who is it?

718
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:33,920
Is it Le Chen?

719
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:39,680
Who?

720
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,720
Who opened my secret inbox?

721
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,640
Rui Long.

722
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,360
Rui Long.

723
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:46,800
Rui Long.

724
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,120
Wasn’t it Le Chen?

725
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,560
My first instinct

726
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,880
was Rui Long.

727
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:51,720
I guessed Rui Long.

728
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,160
I think Rui Long is about to make a move.

729
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,600
He can’t just keep watching others.

730
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,680
Le Chen is more likely though.

731
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,640
I think it should be Le Chen.

732
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,080
Hello.

733
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,240
Le Chen.

734
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,600
I hope it’s Rui Long.

735
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:14,840
Please!

736
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,320
Rui Long is awesome.

737
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,640
I totally shipped those two.

738
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,840
Seriously,

739
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,680
is there something between us?

740
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,040
Like “blood relatives”?

741
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,000
He’s not my

742
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,880
little brother, right?

743
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,400
I think

744
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,400
Hello.

745
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,120
Not bad at all.

746
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,280
So good, he’s brave now.

747
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,960
I’m Rui Long.

748
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,000
Hello, Rui Long.

749
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,360
Want some chocolate?

750
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,200
Chocolate is my favorite.

751
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,600
He notices everything.

752
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,760
So he's always paying attention to Duo Duo.

753
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,720
Sure.

754
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,240
Quietly making big moves.

755
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,400
I feel like a proud mom.

756
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,760
Finally, Rui Long.

757
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,480
That's great.

758
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,720
Hello.

759
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,520
Hello.

760
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,000
Good evening.

761
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,080
Good evening.

762
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:12,680
Come on.

763
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,000
Spray a little.

764
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,360
Thank you.

765
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,480
You're welcome.

766
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,240
I even brought an electric mosquito swatter.

767
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,000
He's very thoughtful too.

768
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:22,920
Not bad.

769
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,120
Didn't expect that, Rui Long.

770
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,560
We're about to ride the little train.

771
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,120
So beautiful.

772
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,120
Where should we sit?

773
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:41,600
Here.

774
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,160
Anywhere is fine.

775
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,080
Okay.

776
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,280
Looks great.

777
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,480
Let's go.

778
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,720
The little train is moving.

779
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,320
I heard you say yesterday you wanted to ride the little train.

780
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,560
Thank you.

781
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,240
She's always wanted to.

782
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,080
Ride that little train.

783
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,000
Who knows?

784
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,240
And then he took her on it.

785
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,600
He probably heard it while walking.

786
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,280
He heard she wanted to ride the little train.

787
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:26,640
Yeah.

788
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,080
Then he said, "I'll make it happen for you."

789
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:28,440
Right.

790
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,840
Little train.

791
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,920
Awesome.

792
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,360
Did you see that?

793
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,280
I'm so jealous of you, Chen.

794
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,600
I'm really jealous of you, Chen.

795
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,520
He heard it.

796
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,360
She said.

797
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,520
She (Ke Ailin) envies you (Wang Le Chen).

798
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,720
She envied him riding the train, so he took her.

799
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,640
I heard you say yesterday

800
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,920
you wanted to ride the little train.

801
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,720
Thank you.

802
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,240
And I want to ride the little train too.

803
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:56,960
Okay.

804
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,560
Maybe Rui Long really wanted to ride the little train.

805
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,200
And just happened to hear you wanted to as well.

806
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:02,960
No.

807
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:03,960
This is just

808
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,480
so she won't feel

809
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,920
any pressure.

810
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,080
It's just an excuse.

811
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:07,440
Yeah.

812
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,000
That's really nice.

813
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,640
So the two of us

814
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,200
get to see each other two days in a row.

815
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,000
At the park.

816
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,400
It's pretty romantic.

817
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,800
Riding the little train late at night.

818
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,800
And I just wanted to chat too.

819
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,880
I think you

820
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,760
I always feel talking with you is

821
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,480
the happiest for me.

822
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,040
The easiest to talk to.

823
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,640
Like this.

824
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,440
Actually,

825
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,640
maybe my personality is more

826
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:50,920
outgoing.

827
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:51,600
Yeah.

828
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,000
So

829
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,760
I really admire that about you.

830
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:56,760
Thank you.

831
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:03,920
So we should

832
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,280
talk about this?

833
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:05,840
Sure.

834
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,440
Do you

835
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,800
know clearly

836
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,440
clearly

837
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:10,640
Yes.

838
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,240
know what your ideal relationship looks like

839
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,320
or what kind of relationship model you want?

840
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,360
Let me explain.

841
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,960
What this means is,

842
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,280
what does your ideal love look like?

843
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,760
Love comes first.

844
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,080
Love comes first.

845
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,960
I put love first.

846
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,680
If I’m in a relationship,

847
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,960
I think about a lot of things.

848
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,840
I want it to lead somewhere.

849
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,520
So if

850
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,400
if it’s

851
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,400
I think

852
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,720
it won’t work out,

853
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,640
then I won’t

854
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,680
even start it.

855
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,280
Actually, I’ve only been in one

856
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,400
girlfriend relationship.

857
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,080
He started by sharing his own experience.

858
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,360
He’s so sincere.

859
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:00,680
Yeah, that’s

860
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,760
I think this guy

861
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,680
has really honest eyes.

862
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,360
Actually, I’ve only had one

863
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,480
girlfriend.

864
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,560
But I’ve pursued others.

865
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,840
Every time I failed,

866
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,600
I became more and more cautious.

867
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,000
Sometimes

868
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,920
I didn’t even dare to date.

869
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,120
Is it better to stay single forever?

870
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,800
Is it better to be single for life?

871
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:25,680
No.

872
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,160
No, of course not.

873
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,760
I don’t think it’s your fault.

874
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,800
You don’t need to

875
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,520
be afraid.

876
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,800
I used to feel the same way.

877
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,120
My past relationships

878
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,400
honestly

879
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,960
weren’t that great.

880
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,240
And sometimes

881
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,560
I doubted myself too.

882
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,040
Am I

883
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,400
a good person?

884
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,520
Or am I

885
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,280
capable of loving someone?

886
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,200
I questioned all these things.

887
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,840
But later I realized

888
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,000
I am a good person.

889
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,400
I just haven’t met

890
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,240
the right person.

891
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,440
the one who’s truly suitable.

892
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,080
That’s great.

893
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,640
There’s definitely someone out there.

894
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,800
I think you just need to be patient.

895
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,040
Someone who truly appreciates her.

896
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,280
Do you still feel lost sometimes?

897
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,480
I mean,

898
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,960
just hanging out and making friends with everyone.

899
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,520
I’m just

900
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,680
a really shy person.

901
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,960
You can probably tell.

902
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,560
I think anyone can see that.

903
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,600
So I get a bit

904
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:28,640
anxious.

905
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,320
I wonder what I’m even doing here.

906
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,480
I think we can relax a bit.

907
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,160
Let’s just be good friends first.

908
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:39,760
Because, look,

909
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,480
right now,

910
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,120
we’ve only just

911
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,240
Yeah.

912
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,360
I was anxious when I first came too.

913
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,000
Because my personality

914
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,720
is

915
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,160
I can’t hide my feelings.

916
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,200
Yeah, I’m not good at

917
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:53,880
like,

918
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,600
pretending

919
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,200
to be someone I’m not.

920
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:57,560
Yeah.

921
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,120
Right.

922
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,000
That’s just not me.

923
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,720
I’m a very straightforward person.

924
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,920
Sometimes I worry too,

925
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,800
like, coming here,

926
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,360
will others

927
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,880
think

928
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,880
this girl

929
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,800
why is her personality so passionate,

930
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,760
so direct?

931
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,920
I do have those concerns sometimes.

932
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:14,840
But after coming here,

933
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,560
I feel really good.

934
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,440
Really?

935
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,120
I really appreciate that.

936
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,400
I think it’s great.

937
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,280
That’s why I wanted to talk to you.

938
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:25,440
Thank you.

939
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:25,720
Thanks.

940
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,600
You’re great too.

941
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,720
You have this

942
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,560
calm

943
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,440
but powerful energy about you.

944
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:40,840
Yeah.

945
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,600
We have a word for that here,

946
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,400
“gentle as jade.”

947
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,360
It suits you perfectly.

948
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,960
Gentle as jade.

949
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,440
Yeah.

950
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,760
You should remember that.

951
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,480
That word really fits.

952
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,520
Duo Duo is really wonderful.

953
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,320
She’s great at giving people strength.

954
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,640
I think this experience in the house

955
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,240
will definitely

956
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,960
be a very

957
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,440
happy

958
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,360
and unforgettable memory for you.

959
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,960
It’s been a happy and unforgettable experience for me too.

960
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:14,880
So,

961
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,480
absolutely.

962
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,160
Yeah.

963
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,680
As long as you stay true to yourself,

964
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,680
just relax a bit.

965
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,160
Everything will be fine.

966
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,360
Rui Long, you’re a great person.

967
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,320
I really think so.

968
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,320
That day, when you opened

969
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,360
the “Answer of the Heart,” do you remember

970
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,480
what it said?

971
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,280
“I am irreplaceable.”

972
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,520
You are irreplaceable.

973
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,480
Irreplaceable.

974
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,000
Yeah, so relax.

975
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,360
Alright, cheers!

976
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,360
Thank you for inviting me on the little train today.

977
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,200
Thank you for coming.

978
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,520
Of course I’d come.

979
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,040
Actually, before I went to bed last night,

980
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:56,800
I was making a wish.

981
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,440
I wished I could ride the little train too.

982
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:00,640
I heard it.

983
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,760
I was right next door and got your wish.

984
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,160
I was going to say,

985
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,640
the walls are that thin?

986
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,960
Her smile is so sweet.

987
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,120
That’s hilarious.

988
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,080
Both of them just shine.

989
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,560
What should we do about this?

990
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,360
He responds in such a subtle and comfortable way.

991
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:30,840
She said,

992
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,360
"I'm making a wish."

993
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,480
He said, "I heard you."

994
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,080
Duo Duo's words

995
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:34,600
are like acupuncture.

996
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,320
She always manages to

997
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,280
hit the exact spot for others.

998
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,560
And then gives people

999
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,520
a sense of relief.

1000
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,480
She has a really healthy

1001
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,680
mindset and outlook.

1002
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,840
I think Rui Long is lucky.

1003
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,000
He just mentioned

1004
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,240
he had a relationship before

1005
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:48,840
and it went really badly.

1006
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,560
So he felt afraid to fall in love again.

1007
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,560
But this time,

1008
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,160
in this situation,

1009
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,160
when Rui Long expressed

1010
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,360
his feelings and admiration to a girl,

1011
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,160
what he received was

1012
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,600
a response from such a healthy-minded girl.

1013
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,760
That's the reply he got.

1014
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,920
You know, for him,

1015
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,640
this will open up

1016
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,960
his heart to love again.

1017
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:05,920
It's so important.

1018
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:06,960
Just imagine,

1019
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,200
if he had met someone

1020
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,760
who wasn't like Duo Duo,

1021
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,080
I think his open heart

1022
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,560
would have closed right away.

1023
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,200
But she

1024
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,800
gave him just the right "acupuncture."

1025
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,480
Personally, I think

1026
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,880
the two of them are a great match.

1027
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,160
Because Duo Duo is so passionate,

1028
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,520
and Rui Long is

1029
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:24,960
more reserved.

1030
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,640
I think they really complement each other.

1031
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,600
They're both people I really like.

1032
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,160
Rui Long truly appreciates her goodness.

1033
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:31,800
Right?

1034
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,240
That's just your personality.

1035
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,480
You might worry

1036
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,360
that sometimes

1037
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,960
you're too carefree,

1038
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:38,640
and can't control

1039
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,600
your emotions.

1040
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,520
But actually, that's

1041
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,720
what attracts me to you.

1042
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,160
What you worry about is what I admire.

1043
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,560
I believe anything is possible.

1044
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,480
As long as it works out,

1045
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,640
it's a good thing.

1046
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:52,240
I suddenly realized

1047
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,320
you've suddenly reached

1048
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,600
a new level in how you see things.

1049
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,280
With your hair tied up like that,

1050
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,400
with your hair tied up like that,

1051
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,880
you look so clear-headed.

1052
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:58,960
Why are you using that phone case?

1053
00:44:58,960 --> 00:44:59,640
The signal's better.

1054
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,000
I've broadened my perspective.

1055
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:02,760
Now it's already

1056
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,520
opened up, completely open.

1057
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:04,920
Later,

1058
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,320
can I borrow it and tie my hair too?

1059
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,160
Can I

1060
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:07,560
take a look too?

1061
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,840
Next, our Heartbeat Apartment

1062
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,520
will welcome

1063
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,040
its first

1064
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,440
Open House Day.

1065
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,480
The guys

1066
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,280
will invite

1067
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,760
their group of close friends

1068
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,080
to our little house.

1069
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,120
Their personal friends.

1070
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:22,600
Yes.

1071
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,560
That's so interesting.

1072
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,360
I'm really looking forward to it.

1073
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:25,840
Come on,

1074
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:26,720
let's keep watching.

1075
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,560
The Heartbeat Apartment is about to have

1076
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,240
an Open House Day.

1077
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,160
Are the guys here?

1078
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:11,920
So many people.

1079
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,480
Today is so exciting.

1080
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,600
The winning team

1081
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,400
will receive

1082
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:18,360
Go for it!

1083
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,320
Is it really this popular?

1084
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,720
How can you not fight for first place?

1085
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:22,720
Lan Lan.

1086
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,400
So straightforward.

1087
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,600
If you don't want to dance,

1088
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,480
we won't dance.

1089
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,280
He impressed us again.

1090
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:29,880
Darn it, Dr. Fang.

1091
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,480
Whoever you choose will be stunned.

1092
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,760
Who do you think you work best with?

1093
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,160
That's tough.

1094
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,200
Both of them want to dance with Chen Chen.

1095
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:36,720
Yeah.

1096
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:37,880
Our Heartbeat Apartment

1097
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,120
is about to have a Mutual Choice Date.

1098
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,440
You have to choose me, and I choose you.

1099
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,560
Only then can they move forward.

1100
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,880
That makes it obvious.

1101
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,200
Are you free tomorrow?

1102
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,640
He gave it to her first.

1103
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,640
Want to go on a date?

1104
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:48,720
This time, it's my turn to give it to you.

1105
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,160
Wait, you still have one more.

1106
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,200
They're all going for it.

1107
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,480
I was dreaming too much.

1108
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,040
Just relax.

1109
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,040
Nothing is a big deal.

1110
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,520
I'll come in and sit for a bit.

1111
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,680
I don't even know what I'm thinking.

1112
00:46:58,680 --> 00:46:59,520
What does that mean?

1113
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,560
I'm so nervous.

1114
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:02,600
I hope he can

1115
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,880
follow his own heart.

1116
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,720
I think every choice should

1117
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,080
be thought through carefully.

1118
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,440
Being boyfriend and girlfriend

1119
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,440
isn't the only goal.

1120
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:12,160
Who?

1121
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,800
Will anyone write my name?

1122
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,040
I bumped into something.

1123
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:17,960
What should I do now?
