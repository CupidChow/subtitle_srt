1
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,640
Here they come.

2
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,800
Is it a newcomer?

3
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,800
Passionate lover type.

4
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,160
The passionate kind.

5
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,600
Hello.

6
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,880
Hi.

7
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,080
He's really tall.

8
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,040
Hello.

9
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,520
Hi.

10
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,280
Hello.

11
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,480
So all the girls

12
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,720
are having dinner with him alone?

13
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,400
Five girls welcoming one guy.

14
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,480
We never got that treatment.

15
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,360
If it were me, I'd be thrilled.

16
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,080
Seriously, I am...

17
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,000
Newcomers arrive later.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,080
They get a special dating privilege.

19
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,000
Is there time for a date?

20
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,000
She's really happy.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,480
Yeah.

22
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,960
Their outfits match so well.

23
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,480
They really look like a couple.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,880
They're about to hit the tree!

25
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,160
We're totally into this couple!

26
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,960
Let’s row together.

27
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,240
Xiao Jiao.

28
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,160
What's up?

29
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,760
I came to give you something.

30
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,320
Thanks for the snacks you gave me.

31
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,640
This is for you.

32
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,480
It's different.

33
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,720
Thanks.

34
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,520
Why don't you two chat for a bit?

35
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:50,880
Okay.

36
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,440
I'm heading out.

37
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,480
Did you wrap your hand?

38
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,320
I'm about to wrap it.

39
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,000
Alright.

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,640
Okay.

41
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,440
Thank you.

42
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,000
No need, thank you.

43
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,000
Time for the Little Train.

44
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,680
Hi, Chen Ge.

45
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,760
I heard it.

46
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,800
Then I happened to go back to Beijing.

47
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,840
So I brought one for you.

48
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,880
It might feel like a burden.

49
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,680
You don't want it?

50
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,760
Then give it back to me.

51
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,360
No, let me give you something else instead.

52
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,040
No, let me give you something else instead.

53
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,160
They can talk.

54
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,720
That's nice.

55
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,960
Healing each other.

56
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,960
Here we go!

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,880

Welcome, Cupids!

97
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,400
Welcome to all our friends!

98
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,960
Last week was so lively.

99
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,320
Yes.

100
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:12,760
Feels like right now,

101
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,680
everything in my mind

102
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,000
just won't fade away.

103
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,880
Yeah, it's like it just happened.

104
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,640
But I think we can

105
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,880
share a few

106
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,000
key details.

107
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,760
For example, our

108
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,880
Little Train session started.

109
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,280
Right.

110
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:23,680
Yeah.

111
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,480
So important.

112
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,480
First time ever.

113
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:25,880
Yes.

114
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,240
After the deep talk in the Little Train,

115
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,320
our Le Chen

116
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,600
and Yuan Yuan

117
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,920
are so similar,

118
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,680
but also feel complementary.

119
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,800
During that session,

120
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,440
the Little Train

121
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:35,800
really

122
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,320
helped the two

123
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,080
keep

124
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,480
digging deeper into their hearts.

125
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,120
That's the feeling.

126
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,280
Also,

127
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,160
we welcomed

128
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,560
a new guy.

129
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,840
What's his name?

130
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,240
Zi Han from your team.

131
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,600
That's right.

132
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,600
Zi Han has a strong presence.

133
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,400
He put pressure on the other guys.

134
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,920
There were lots of moments,

135
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,040
like Jiao Ge receiving butterfly pastries.

136
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,280
He was so happy.

137
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,200
Our Jue Er and Long Long

138
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,200
had so many details too.

139
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,280
So next,

140
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,960
a new week of stories is about to begin.

141
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,840
Let's see what signals

142
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,280
will appear in Heart Signal Apartment this week.

143
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,320
Let's watch together.

144
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,840
Lan Lan

145
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,280
My Lan Lan

146
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,680
How is she always so pretty?

147
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,120
Seriously.

148
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,640
Hello.

149
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,160
Hi.

150
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,480
Hello.

151
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,920
If you didn’t come back soon, I wouldn’t be able to eat.

152
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,600
I’m here.

153
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,480
Hi, I’m here.

154
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,680
I’m about to start.

155
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,920
Start what?

156
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,680
I’m making braised pork ribs.

157
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,640
But there’s already

158
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,280
a braised pork ribs dish in there.

159
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,000
Where?

160
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:02,960
In there.

161
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,720
You’re already making it.

162
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,920
Let’s have a cook-off then.

163
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,000
Sure.

164
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,400
But...

165
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,000
Why is this so long?

166
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,040
You staring at me is making me nervous.

167
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,680
Because he’s an eye doctor.

168
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,080
If I do something clumsy,

169
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,000
you’re not allowed to laugh.

170
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,760
Clumsy moves.

171
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,720
I won’t laugh.

172
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,520
This feels like a couple talking.

173
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,120
The last time I cooked was probably

174
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,440
two years ago.

175
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,720
I thought you were good at cooking.

176
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,720
You seemed really skilled at first.

177
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,240
If you watch, it’ll definitely taste good.

178
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,680
Why do I feel like it’s working again?

179
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,040
It’s going to work again.

180
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,360
It’s working.

181
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,160
I think I didn’t add enough water.

182
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,800
Can you add a bit more for me?

183
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,880
It’s too heavy.

184
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,920
You add first.

185
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,360
Is it going to dry out?

186
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,080
You really made so little.

187
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,480
You made so much.

188
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,240
Then you should eat more.

189
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,640
Okay.

190
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,520
You’re not afraid of gaining weight.

191
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,240
I’ll try to eat more.

192
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,160
What are you making?

193
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,280
Lily and mung bean porridge.

194
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,760
To help everyone avoid getting overheated from staying up late.

195
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,480
Shredded beef.

196
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,360
I really like shredded beef.

197
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:14,680
Thank you.

198
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,760
I can already smell it.

199
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,160
Smells good.

200
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,080
I’ll bring some to them.

201
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,840
He’s probably bringing it mainly for Lanlan.

202
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,320
Hello, everyone.

203
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,560
Hi, everyone.

204
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,040
Hello.

205
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,280
It smells so good over there.

206
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,200
Food delivery is here.

207
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,680
Lanlan, you cooked?

208
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,800
Made lots of small pork ribs.

209
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,360
Thanks.

210
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,160
You’re welcome.

211
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:43,800
What’s this called?

212
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,880
Just to give one person some food,

213
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,240
you gave it to everyone.

214
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,800
Gotta set the stage.

215
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,560
Give two packs.

216
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,680
It’s almost gone.

217
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,840
None left for tomorrow.

218
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,160
One pack isn’t enough.

219
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,960
Give me two packs.

220
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,520
Thank you.

221
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,160
Dr. Fang can have some tomorrow.

222
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,200
Duoduo is the wingman.

223
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,120
A lot of people haven’t gotten any yet.

224
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,360
Take one more for Lanlan.

225
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,560
Everyone hasn’t gotten any.

226
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,280
The shredded beef is super tasty.

227
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,280
The trash is so full.

228
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,920
I’ll empty it out.

229
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,280
It might explode.

230
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,600
It exploded.

231
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,440
The pan exploded.

232
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,640
Wait a second, Dr. Fang.

233
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,200
Why is it exploding?

234
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,440
Because there's water.

235
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,120
Thank you.

236
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,800
Thanks.

237
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,360
One handles the pan, one handles the people.

238
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,760
Go ahead, say it.

239
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,400
Nothing gets missed.

240
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,360
Those two look like they're watching a show.

241
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,520
It exploded all over my face and clothes.

242
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,320
It popped right onto our mouths.

243
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,760
It accidentally splattered on us.

244
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,840
It hit both our mouths.

245
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,920
It made us both burst out laughing.

246
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,120
Let it explode.

247
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,160
Is the stove next door out?

248
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,600
I'll go next door.

249
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,080
No fire next door, right?

250
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,560
Okay.

251
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,920
Let it explode.

252
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,680
The whole world is exploding.

253
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,360
Need any help?

254
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:21,760
Brother Herry (Zi Han)

255
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,960
You both came over.

256
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,400
Just checking if you need help.

257
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,560
The color looks nice.

258
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,160
Not that nice.

259
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,760
Looks good.

260
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,880
Xiao Jiao

261
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,440
Maybe just leave it for now.

262
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,480
Fix it at the end.

263
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,560
I'll toss these first.

264
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,560
Feels a bit stuck.

265
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,760
The atmosphere is a bit awkward.

266
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,520
Where's its lid?

267
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,160
Where's the lid?

268
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,840
The lid.

269
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,240
At the same time.

270
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,880
Is it this one?

271
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,680
This one's a bit small.

272
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,240
A bit small.

273
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,200
Nope.

274
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,440
This one.

275
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,800
Really?

276
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,480
Try matching it.

277
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,360
Okay.

278
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,640
Alright, you're done with this one, right?

279
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,040
It's just about this one pan.

280
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,840
Three people could squeeze in.

281
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,400
This pan says, "Don't blame me."

282
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,200
It's about to get super spicy.

283
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:58,760
Alright.

284
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,400
Be careful.

285
00:11:59,400 --> 00:11:59,920
It's really spicy.

286
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,720
I'll step back then.

287
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,200
It actually looks tasty.

288
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,200
Smells great.

289
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,280
But it's a bit pungent.

290
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,200
Okay, I get that it's spicy.

291
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,600
I'm just doing

292
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,600
a waiting pose now.

293
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,200
Then I'll go wash my hands.

294
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,280
There's no hand soap here.

295
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,480
No hand soap left.

296
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,080
Yeah, I'll go wash over there and come back.

297
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,520
I'll go get some from over there.

298
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,800
Very proactive.

299
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,160
What are you making today?

300
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,800
I'm making water spinach and braised pork ribs.

301
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,080
Water spinach and braised pork ribs.

302
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,080
We're here to borrow hand soap again.

303
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,560
You're welcome.

304
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,480
There's no hand soap left over there.

305
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,000
You're welcome.

306
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,680
Come on.

307
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,320
It won't come out.

308
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,320
It won't come out, right?

309
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:57,840
Yeah.

310
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,080
Someone will help you squeeze it.

311
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,360
Someone will help you pour it back.

312
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,920
Problems are never really problems.

313
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,280
You're a real language genius.

314
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,360
Okay.

315
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:05,840
Someone will fix it.

316
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,840
Assist!

317
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,440
Really.

318
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,920
I'm so hungry.

319
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,640
Soon.

320
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,640
I'm waiting for you to call me from the kitchen.

321
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,480
No problem.

322
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,400
Bro, you're our first floor representative.

323
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,280
Go talk more with the second floor.

324
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:21,680
Okay.

325
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,320
Now I'm the second floor representative.

326
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,440
Getting along on the first floor.

327
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,520
Coming to the first floor to connect.

328
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,040
Right.

329
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,640
Got it.

330
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,440
Friendship and harmony.

331
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,000
For friendship.

332
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,480
Friendship and harmony.

333
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,840
That's so cute.

334
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,920
I'm back.

335
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,160
Try it.

336
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,880
Is it a bit bitter?

337
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,000
It's pretty good.

338
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,640
Not bitter.

339
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,400
I took some of their hand soap.

340
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,280
Poured out half.

341
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,880
"Stole" half.

342
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,160
He didn't see.

343
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,560
I want to make it, but since it's everyone's first time,

344
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,920
I think it should be something everyone can eat.

345
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:51,960
Actually, we

346
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,520
came back really early today.

347
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,960
It's still early.

348
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,360
Much earlier than yesterday.

349
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,440
Not bad.

350
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,800
What are you making?

351
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,040
Herry is cooking.

352
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,000
Herry is cooking.

353
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,360
Tomato beef brisket.

354
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,800
Give it a review.

355
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,160
Try it.

356
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,920
Are you cooking?

357
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:11,800
I'm not.

358
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,760
I'll just watch you cook today.

359
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,640
Next door doesn't need you.

360
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,200
Next door doesn't need you.

361
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,560
Stay here.

362
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,040
Don't move.

363
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,640
Those two.

364
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,760
We need you here.

365
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,440
What else are you making?

366
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,160
Just this dish.

367
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,080
Then we'll go eat.

368
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,880
Let's grab all the dishes from next door.

369
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,800
Why are they making so much food today?

370
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,640
What's up with today?

371
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,960
It's like New Year's.

372
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,960
Hello, everyone.

373
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,560
Hello.

374
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:31,960
Hello.

375
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,040
You're back.

376
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,320
Hello.

377
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,280
Ruilong.

378
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,640
Hello.

379
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,520
You just got back, right?

380
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:39,880
Just got back.

381
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:40,960
Just got back.

382
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,760
Salmon.

383
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,120
Grilling again.

384
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,680
Salmon.

385
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,440
More food again.

386
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,800
More food again.

387
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,200
I'm still craving tamagoyaki.

388
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,080
That tamagoyaki was so delicious.

389
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,400
Yeah, yesterday's tamagoyaki was great.

390
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,120
Yeah, yesterday's tamagoyaki was great.

391
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,160
Should I make another tamagoyaki?

392
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,280
Sure.

393
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,280
Okay.

394
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,680
I really didn't get enough.

395
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,080
Alright.

396
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,680
Looking forward to seeing your skills.

397
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,520
Jue'er is pretty obvious.

398
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,040
Jue'er is really

399
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,440
It's super clear in her mind.

400
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,720
Does this count?

401
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,080
It also gives Ruilong confidence.

402
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,200
It counts.

403
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:22,800
Definitely counts.

404
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,320
Are you heading out?

405
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:44,880
Have you eaten?

406
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,280
Who?

407
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:46,720
You.

408
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,600
I had a little.

409
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,120
So you still have some room left, right?

410
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,000
Yeah.

411
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,120
I thought at this time,

412
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,160
you’d all be done eating.

413
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,920
So do you want to

414
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,120
walk the dog and then eat when you get back?

415
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,080
Now?

416
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,040
Sure.

417
00:16:59,360 --> 00:16:59,840
Let’s go.

418
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,000
Let’s walk the dog.

419
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,760
Come on, Weini, I’ll take you out.

420
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,200
Does it need to wear this?

421
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,520
Yeah, it does.

422
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:09,920
Nico, just wait here.

423
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,720
Jiao and Yu Xing will go with you.

424
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,840
The dog is speechless.

425
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,200
Hi, Yu Xing.

426
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:16,560
Hey, everyone.

427
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,560
We were just talking about you and you came back.

428
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,600
Come on, let’s walk Nico.

429
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,560
You brought food back again.

430
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,240
Yeah, I brought some food.

431
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,560
They’re cooking a lot of dishes.

432
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,640
They’re still cooking.

433
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,560
I was worried I brought it too late.

434
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,080
No, it’s fine.

435
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,080
Let’s go.

436
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:29,800
Baby.

437
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,320
So cute.

438
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,800
Why so excited?

439
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,800
So adorable.

440
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,880
I was planning to work out today.

441
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,920
I need to work on my abs.

442
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,600
My abs are gone.

443
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,640
Then you can do sit-ups.

444
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,800
We can do sit-ups together.

445
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,640
Okay.

446
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:48,600
Alright.

447
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,440
Actually, I was thinking,

448
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,840
if we could go out,

449
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,680
I’d want to

450
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,800
go rock climbing.

451
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,880
You know, I saw in Zhejiang the other day,

452
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,240
there’s a place for rock climbing.

453
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,360
It’s outdoors.

454
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,120
Kind of like

455
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,440
an outdoor spot.

456
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,200
I know.

457
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,280
It’s near a cliff.

458
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,400
It’s kind of like Fei—

459
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:04,800
Via Ferrata.

460
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,560
Yeah, kind of.

461
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,680
It seems really fun.

462
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,040
I’ve never tried it.

463
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,640
Never tried.

464
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:09,760
So when I saw it that day,

465
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,680
It sounds like you’ve done so much,

466
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,800
but you haven’t tried any of it?

467
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,200
Yeah.

468
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,080
Not like you.

469
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,720
You’re so brave on your own.

470
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,400
If it’s just me alone,

471
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,320
I can do whatever I want.

472
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,120
Like, totally wild.

473
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,800
But if there are two people,

474
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,560
there’s someone to take responsibility for.

475
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,160
Right?

476
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,520
But maybe the other person

477
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,640
doesn’t feel like they’re taking responsibility.

478
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,240
Maybe they think

479
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,520
but that’s not always the case.

480
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,360
How do you know?

481
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,600
For example, I think it’s about sharing.

482
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,400
For example, I think sharing is important.

483
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,240
If you go out next time,

484
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:39,680
you can invite me.

485
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:41,760
Outdoors.

486
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,520
I'll pick a good spot.

487
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,040
Okay.

488
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,600
They make a great pair.

489
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,560
Do you think Jiao Ge's personality is like mine?

490
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,360
Yes and no.

491
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,400
Kind of, but not really.

492
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,200
What do you think is different?

493
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,320
Jiao Ge is someone

494
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,040
like me,

495
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,880
who dares to act.

496
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,040
He acts first and thinks later.

497
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,000
Because last night I was at the gym.

498
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,480
Really?

499
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,360
What did he do?

500
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,960
You two are so close.

501
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,680
He doesn't tell you?

502
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,720
No time to chat with him.

503
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,160
He

504
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,200
He talks about you every day when you're not around.

505
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,360
No, it's Jiao Ge's way of caring.

506
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,320
It's not intense enough.

507
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:13,800
No.

508
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,840
So you can't feel it, right?

509
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,440
It's too intense.

510
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,320
Can you feel it?

511
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,680
I feel it a lot.

512
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,640
This scene is beautiful.

513
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,200
Yeah.

514
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,600
Actually, Duoduo is

515
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,720
very clear about her goals.

516
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,120
Super focused.

517
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,800
Did you just get back?

518
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,840
Yeah, I just got back.

519
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,000
So the progress here

520
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,280
is much faster than over there.

521
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,400
Right.

522
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,760
Because we returned earlier here.

523
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,080
Try it.

524
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,680
It's delicious.

525
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,400
Is it good?

526
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:52,960
Super tasty.

527
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,560
Isn't it?

528
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,120
Really.

529
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,960
Is it just right, not too salty or bland?

530
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,160
It's perfect.

531
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,720
Use a plate to serve this dish.

532
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:16,920
(Yifan) has been paying attention

533
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,720
to his needs.

534
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,520
Okay.

535
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,560
I'll probably be back late today.

536
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,680
Did you open a new gym?

537
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,200
I went for an assessment today.

538
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,160
So I was busy yesterday.

539
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,560
You were studying last night, right?

540
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,000
Yes.

541
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,760
Did Yu Xing feel

542
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,120
Yifan's feelings for him?

543
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,520
I think definitely yes.

544
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,960
Compared to before.

545
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,840
Didn't they go walk the dog?

546
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,600
Yeah, they went for a walk.

547
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,040
But they didn't take Nicole.

548
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,160
Then I'll go walk with you.

549
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,000
Okay.

550
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,640
Is Chichi here?

551
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,320
Who came back?

552
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,240
They arrived one after another.

553
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:19,960
Who came back?

554
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,840
Is Chichi here?

555
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,480
Chichi is back.

556
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:30,960
Chichi.

557
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,440
Hello.

558
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,560
Hi.

559
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:34,920
Hello, everyone.

560
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,080
They're cooking.

561
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,520
It'll be ready soon.

562
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,240
Our kitchen made a lot of dishes.

563
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:42,760
Yeah.

564
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,200
Okay.

565
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,120
What should we do?

566
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,800
How do we handle this?

567
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,480
Hello.

568
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,520
Hi.

569
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,400
Have you eaten?

570
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,320
Not yet.

571
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,800
Soon.

572
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,080
Almost.

573
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,760
Chichi.

574
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,920
Has everyone else eaten?

575
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,040
I don't think so.

576
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,520
Aren't they eating?

577
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,720
They'll come over soon.

578
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,840
Zi Han is still next door making soup for us.

579
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,320
She seems a bit distracted.

580
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,200
She really cares about Yu Xing walking the dog.

581
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,040
We should be able to eat now.

582
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,520
How about we go back and eat first?

583
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,720
I don't feel like walking the dog anymore.

584
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,560
I was thinking about them having dinner.

585
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,720
I'm going to work out for a bit.

586
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,920
You're going to work out?

587
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,760
She's going to find

588
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,800
who?

589
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:31,880
Zi Han.

590
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,360
Zi Han.

591
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,400
Zi Han.

592
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,000
I have something for you.

593
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,200
Thanks for taking me out yesterday.

594
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,640
And you said you had insomnia.

595
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,360
You can use that spray.

596
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,280
Indoors.

597
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:43,840
Thank you.

598
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,200
I'll head over there first.

599
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,480
Just so happens,

600
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,880
Don't you eat durian?

601
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,400
Do you want some? I bought it.

602
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,840
But I think it's too much.

603
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,760
So I didn't take it out.

604
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,000
We'll eat it later. I'll get it downstairs.

605
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,720
I put it somewhere else.

606
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,800
Because it smells strong.

607
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,320
Okay.

608
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,040
I made some soup.

609
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,640
It's already done.

610
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,600
We'll wait for them to eat together.

611
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,360
I'll go over there first then.

612
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:00,680
You go ahead.

613
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,200
I'll come over in a bit.

614
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:01,840
Okay.

615
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,200
So happy.

616
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,480
Dinner's ready.

617
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,680
Okay.

618
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,240
We couldn't find Duoduo and

619
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:18,840
Le Chen.

620
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,280
Le Chen.

621
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,240
It's fine, not important.

622
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,720
Maybe they're on the Little Train.

623
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,680
Having dinner.

624
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,320
You're good with words, Yu Xing.

625
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,680
Here comes Yi Fan.

626
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,160
Yi Fan.

627
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,840
Come try the ribs I made.

628
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,240
Okay.

629
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,360
There are two kinds of ribs.

630
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,000
Try both and see which one tastes better.

631
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,600
Who made this one?

632
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,160
Don't ask yet.

633
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,640
Let's not ask for now.

634
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,080
Right.

635
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,000
You guys try first.

636
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,120
I'll try.

637
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,000
I'll get you some chopsticks.

638
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,640
I'll do it myself.

639
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,600
You do it, there's another pair here.

640
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,160
Thanks.

641
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,120
Give it a taste.

642
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,720
Okay.

643
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,880
I'll wash my hands first.

644
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,080
He put the chopsticks next to Chi Chi.

645
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,640
Yi Fan saw it too.

646
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,560
Is it too spicy?

647
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,320
It's okay.

648
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:12,840
It's fine.

649
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,040
Tastes good.

650
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,480
The smell brought me here.

651
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,240
The smell brought me here.

652
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:24,960
I'll just sit here.

653
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,760
Seat.

654
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,600
Got taken.

655
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,200
Saving chopsticks doesn't work.

656
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,120
What do I do? This is too hard.

657
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:44,880
Try Boss Lan's dish.

658
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,680
Which one did you make?

659
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,000
We have to guess.

660
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,200
Today's meal is so rich.

661
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:50,840
Try this one.

662
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,640
Looks delicious.

663
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,800
Why do their clothes look kind of similar?

664
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,160
You know what, you're right.

665
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,680
Lonely Gourmet.

666
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,680
Lonely Gourmet.

667
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:08,920
Is it okay?

668
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,880
It's really tasty.

669
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,440
Right?

670
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,880
As long as you guys like it.

671
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,200
I'm leaving.

672
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,560
Keeps sighing.

673
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,000
Delicious.

674
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,800
Really delicious.

675
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,680
You all gave me a lot of motivation.

676
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,520
I'll cook again tomorrow.

677
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,920
What do you want to eat tomorrow?

678
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,640
Can we order dishes?

679
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,760
You can start ordering now.

680
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,720
I'll help you out.

681
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,440
He was stumbling as he walked.

682
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,800
I think he felt a bit helpless.

683
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,680
Jue saw right through it all.

684
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,600
Go get a bowl.

685
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,840
Bring a bowl and serve that.

686
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,320
Here's your chance.

687
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,040
Put it here.

688
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,240
They look like they're playing

689
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,920
that game where you grab chairs.

690
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,200
Just spin the chair around.

691
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,440
Then see who sits down fastest.

692
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,680
Whoever sits first wins.

693
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,920
He didn't get the seat.

694
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,760
See?

695
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,160
He went around and came back.

696
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,680
Let's go.

697
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,200
Smells so good.

698
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,920
They should all be over there.

699
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,600
Later, the two of us

700
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,120
will walk Weini again.

701
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,320
Hello.

702
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:20,920
Walk her again.

703
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,520
Yeah.

704
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,120
Hi.

705
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,280
Is there any food?

706
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,040
I'm starving.

707
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,920
I'm "dying" of hunger.

708
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,520
Yes, they just finished cooking.

709
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,440
Where's the food?

710
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,040
Here.

711
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,040
Over here, the Western restaurant.

712
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,240
Smells amazing.

713
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:38,960
Hello.

714
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,680
Hi.

715
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,120
Is there a bowl?

716
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,400
There's an empty one here.

717
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,160
Yeah.

718
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:44,880
Thanks.

719
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,680
Eat up.

720
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,720
I'm super hungry.

721
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,560
Am I the last one back?

722
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,600
Probably.

723
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:53,920
I'm "starving" to death.

724
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,280
I'll just take a small plate.

725
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Their relationship is pretty complicated too.

726
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,280
Same with Yu Xing and the others.

727
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,080
Competing for seats.

728
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,800
But I'm surprised by Chichi's reaction.

729
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,520
When she saw Yu Xing walking the dog,

730
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,240
She just said, "Good."

731
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,440
Seems like she still cares.

732
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,920
Is it because of that?

733
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:27,920
Probably.

734
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,240
I think so.

735
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,720
No way, isn't she

736
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,960
already together with Zi Han?

737
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,560
From my perspective.

738
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,240
That's kind of subjective.

739
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,240
It's just a personal view.

740
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,560
How much for Zi Han?

741
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,400
What percentage?

742
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,120
Eighty percent.

743
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,400
About eighty percent.

744
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,200
Yeah, otherwise Chichi wouldn't be so proactive.

745
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,520
She even bought a gift.

746
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,840
And it's

747
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,440
a caring kind of gift.

748
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,640
It's for sleep aid.

749
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,160
I think Yu Xing

750
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,440
can really stir up

751
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,000
Chichi's

752
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,960
emotions.

753
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,920
mood swings.

754
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,080
I think his influence is stronger.

755
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,320
I think his influence is stronger.

756
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,400
Yeah.

757
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:00,840
Let's

758
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,520
look forward to it together.

759
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,760
In such a lively

760
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,680
Heart Signal apartment,

761
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,480
what new stories will unfold?

762
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,920
Let's keep watching.

763
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,240
We went looking for you but couldn't find you.

764
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,080
I wondered if you were on the Little Train.

765
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:13,640
You were so fast.

766
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,800
Why are you on the Little Train again?

767
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,520
The Little Train.

768
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,160
I rode it all by myself.

769
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,800
Who rode the Little Train?

770
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,240
Duoduo doesn't know.

771
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,360
You two.

772
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,520
Us two.

773
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,200
Not me, only

774
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:27,880
Chen.

775
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,680
I didn't ride it.

776
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,440
Do you have to queue for the Little Train?

777
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,360
The Little Train has already

778
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,200
It's starting to smoke.

779
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,320
It was smoking and I still didn't get a seat.

780
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,640
Duoduo really can't hide anything.

781
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,920
I really didn't get a seat.

782
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,280
I didn't even see the edge.

783
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,320
I just want to have it once.

784
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,280
A chance to say "aww".

785
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,600
No holding back, let's not bottle it up.

786
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,720
Then Duoduo won't get a chance.

787
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,760
Yeah, can't bring up his issue now.

788
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,400
Unless Le Chen picks Duoduo, then they can still sit.

789
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,920
So full.

790
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,080
Honestly, we should've done that today.

791
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,160
Hello.

792
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,240
Hello.

793
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,480
Why is everyone sitting here?

794
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,040
Sitting so quietly.

795
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,080
So quiet.

796
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,480
This seat.

797
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,760
It witnessed it again.

798
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,800
Witnessed it once more.

799
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,840
Yeah.

800
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,960
Ruolong is always in these scenes.

801
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,640
Yeah.

802
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,800
Jiao Ge, where did you go?

803
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,080
Miss Jiao Ge.

804
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,800
What, you miss Jiao Ge?

805
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,960
I only said one thing to him when I got back.

806
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,160
And then he disappeared until now.

807
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,760
Did he go to start that?

808
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,480
The Little Train.

809
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,800
Maybe.

810
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,280
Yes.

811
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,280
So, Jiao Ge the day before yesterday...

812
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,360
What happened again?

813
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,240
Ask him.

814
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,360
He wants to tell you.

815
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,680
You didn't have time for him yesterday.

816
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,440
He wanted to talk to you.

817
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,400
But you didn't...

818
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,440
Didn't have time to listen.

819
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,080
No.

820
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,680
No, what are you talking about?

821
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,840
No, I need to move.

822
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,760
I'm going to find him.

823
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,880
I'm heading out.

824
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,080
What does that mean?

825
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:36,880
I don't know either.

826
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,720
Jiao Ge wanted to talk to you.

827
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,760
But you didn't listen.

828
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,200
No.

829
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:40,920
And you feel guilty.

830
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,640
He didn't come to me.

831
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,840
But he probably wanted to talk to me.

832
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,400
How do you know?

833
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,680
It's a guy's sixth sense.

834
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:54,960
Let's go.

835
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,240
Let's go.

836
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,640
She's brave.

837
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,760
Called to go, but she turned back.

838
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,760
Where are you going?

839
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,120
When Duoduo said to go,

840
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,840
I almost wanted to.

841
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,360
Stand up.

842
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,880
Forget about him.

843
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,920
Go find Jiao Ge.

844
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,080
Let's go look for him.

845
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,840
Okay.

846
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,080
My Jiao.

847
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,720
Where are you?

848
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,000
Feeling a bit down.

849
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,000
Just the two of us left.

850
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,440
And I'm about to leave too.

851
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,760
You're leaving too?

852
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,080
Then I'll head out too.

853
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,480
It's a bit boring being alone.

854
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,360
You two wait for me.

855
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,480
She went.

856
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,080
Found out you left.

857
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,200
Only me left.

858
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,320
So boring.

859
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,400
Take it.

860
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:16,760
What for?

861
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,440
This is your "magic tool" for today.

862
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,560
What can it do?

863
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,040
Can it summon Jiao Ge?

864
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:21,600
Yes.

865
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,120
Darn it.

866
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,880
It's the slide's problem.

867
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,080
Let's go to the park.

868
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,560
Let's go, we'll sleep in the park tonight.

869
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,280
Let's go.

870
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,760
Secret message session.

871
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,840
Each resident gets one chance.

872
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,880
To send to their crush.

873
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,720
To initiate a secret message session.

874
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,560
To the same person.

875
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,360
Only Duoduo knows.

876
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,080
Park shuttle bus

877
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,120
Which stop are we at now?

878
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:08,640
Here.

879
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,120
Central Station.

880
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:21,920
Go this way.

881
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,240
If we walk around, can we get back today?

882
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,440
It’ll take a long time.

883
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,240
I think Duoduo isn’t very happy right now.

884
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,680
Hello.

885
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,520
Hi.

886
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,200
Ruilong.

887
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,400
Hi, Ruilong.

888
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,640
Ruilong, do you want to join us?

889
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,080
Sure.

890
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,960
Come over.

891
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,480
Ruilong passed through my whole world.

892
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,480
Ruilong is so happy.

893
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,320
It has to be Duoduo calling Longlong.

894
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,160
He’s probably heading toward Duoduo.

895
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,320
Running.

896
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,400
Ruilong is kind of like

897
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,440
a “happy puppy.”

898
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,560
He makes everyone happy.

899
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:17,840
Yeah.

900
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,840
Running.

901
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,400
You can run too.

902
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,440
Actually, running works too.

903
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:48,920
Get some exercise.

904
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,840
Can you work out like this?

905
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,840
So cute.

906
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,840
Did you guys really work all day?

907
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,320
How are you still so energetic?

908
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,200
You see, both of them like working out.

909
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,120
They’re actually a good match.

910
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:11,960
Yeah.

911
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,280
Is this for glutes?

912
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:15,520
Really?

913
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,120
It works.

914
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,520
If you use the right muscles.

915
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,320
True.

916
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:23,880
It’s a bit tiring.

917
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:26,560
the Little Train

918
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,640
Nice, awesome!

919
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,440
Did you see that?

920
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,480
I’m so jealous of you.

921
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,400
Chen ge.

922
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,440
How about...

923
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,040
If you sincerely invite me,

924
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,640
I’d feel bad refusing.

925
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,120
After all, you’re the only one who’s driven the train.

926
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,720
Everyone will definitely follow your lead.

927
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,160
Looks great.

928
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,000
Can you show off your food in this train?

929
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,520
You...

930
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,680
What’s wrong?

931
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,560
What should we do?

932
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,760
Is your secret message once a day or...

933
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,720
Once a day.

934
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,800
If you come back early tomorrow, you can get one.

935
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,240
Now, all of you

936
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,440
already have someone.

937
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,840
Is there someone you want to talk to?

938
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,800
Good question.

939
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,320
Then let me ask you back.

940
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,080
He’s looking at Duoduo.

941
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:32,920
Yeah.

942
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,440
Do you have someone now?

943
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,000
Do you have a target?

944
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,920
Ended up gossiping about myself.

945
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,720
Ruilong, just say it.

946
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,640
What about you guys?

947
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,480
How about you?

948
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,280
And you?

949
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,360
What about you?

950
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,240
And you?

951
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,120
You go first.

952
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,640
How about you?

953
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,080
Those two.

954
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,160
I haven’t yet.

955
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,680
I haven’t seen you make a move.

956
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,480
So comfortable.

957
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,880
Feels like West Lake.

958
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:07,640
Yeah.

959
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,320
So relaxing.

960
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,120
Is it just me?

961
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:22,920
I feel like Ruilong is always focused on

962
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,080
I feel like Ruilong is always focused on

963
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,680
I feel like Ruilong is always focused on

964
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,600
Duoduo.

965
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,440
It’s not just you.

966
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,720
He showed off to her in the gym.

967
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,640
That one-handed push-up.

968
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,800
He did it just for Duoduo.

969
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,800
I really hope

970
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,080
Duoduo and Ruilong end up together.

971
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,280
You can actually sense it.

972
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:47,400
You can actually sense it.

973
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,000
During the walk,

974
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,080
Duoduo seemed a bit

975
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,680
emotional.

976
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,920
Because I think maybe

977
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,000
about riding the Little Train,

978
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,600
this whole thing,

979
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,600
she wanted to do it too.

980
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,000
She wanted to ride with Le Chen.

981
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,320
Yeah.

982
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,160
Now the only chance left is

983
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,880
unless Chen Chen

984
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,360
chooses Duoduo

985
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,760
to ride the Little Train.

986
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:06,640
Xu Ge,

987
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,000
so for someone like Duoduo,

988
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,000
who is quite self-driven,

989
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,800
would she make Le Chen feel

990
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,200
pressured?

991
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,000
I think there were a few moments just now

992
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,400
where I imagined

993
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,560
if I were that guy,

994
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,520
would I feel a bit pressured?

995
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,280
Only you’ve ridden the Little Train.

996
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:24,560
Yeah.

997
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,840
The first time she joked about it,

998
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,200
it was "Only you’ve ridden the Little Train."

999
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,280
I feel like

1000
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,680
when Duoduo brought this up,

1001
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,840
in her expression,

1002
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,000
part of it showed

1003
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,360
her insecurity,

1004
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,360
but another part

1005
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,000
showed her confidence.

1006
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:38,600
So,

1007
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,120
it means that before this,

1008
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,400
regarding her relationship with Le Chen,

1009
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,320
she still had some confidence.

1010
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,400
Because if she had none

1011
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,640
of that confidence,

1012
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,160
she wouldn’t seek your reassurance.

1013
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,640
You let me know you still care about me.

1014
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,880
So she still had

1015
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,360
some sense of security before.

1016
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,120
There’s a foundation of trust and confidence.

1017
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,120
That’s how I see it.

1018
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,480
Yeah, I think this is also

1019
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,960
where Duoduo’s charm lies.

1020
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,960
She can truly be herself.

1021
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,560
That’s what makes her so attractive.

1022
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:05,960
Right?

1023
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,000
Because honestly, we all want

1024
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,120
to be ourselves

1025
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,040
every moment,

1026
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:09,840
always connecting with

1027
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,000
our own emotions.

1028
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,920
Yeah.

1029
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,400
It’s fine, let’s see what happens next.

1030
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:14,920
Alright?

1031
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,800
Okay, let’s keep watching.

1032
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,600
Air conditioner

1033
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:56,960
Turn it up

1034
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,080
Did Le Chen and the others come back?

1035
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,520
They’re back

1036
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,560
He’s in his room

1037
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,560
There’s a mangosteen here

1038
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,160
It wasn’t eaten yesterday

1039
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,360
Come in

1040
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,000
Can I talk to you for a moment?

1041
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,080
Chichi

1042
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:23,400
What?

1043
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:25,960
Can I talk to you for a moment?

1044
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,320
Sure

1045
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,720
That was unexpected

1046
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,800
What are they talking about?

1047
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:34,520
Just

1048
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,320
I’ll sit here

1049
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,960
Okay, I’ll sit here then

1050
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,880
What does she want to talk about?

1051
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,640
I think Yu Xing must be nervous right now

1052
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,680
Do you want some?

1053
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,120
No, I’m good

1054
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,040
He said it in a cute, clueless way

1055
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:01,960
This is pretty sweet

1056
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,040
Are you sure you don’t want any?

1057
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,800
Then I’ll eat it first, and then

1058
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,240
I get back pretty late every day

1059
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:19,800
And I feel like

1060
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,960
I don’t seem to have much time

1061
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,760
to spend with you

1062
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,480
Every time I come back

1063
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,360
it seems like you’re busy with something else

1064
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,720
And I just

1065
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,240
She’s not happy

1066
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,120
They went to walk the dog

1067
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,480
I don’t know if talking to you like this

1068
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,800
makes you feel awkward

1069
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,200
No, it’s fine

1070
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:45,680
How should I put it

1071
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,680
Actually, when you came back

1072
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,440
we had just gotten back too

1073
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,400
When they took Wei Ni for a walk

1074
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,200
Nico didn’t go out

1075
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,680
So I went along for a walk

1076
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,400
Honestly, I don’t really know what to say

1077
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,000
But I feel like

1078
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,720
It was kind of impulsive for me to come talk to you just now

1079
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,400
Because I

1080
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,800
felt like all night tonight

1081
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,600
I didn’t really talk to you at all

1082
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:20,240
Yeah, now I feel

1083
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,080
Yeah, now I feel

1084
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:21,760
At that time

1085
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,560
She went in because

1086
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:22,920
after she saw it

1087
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,200
she was a bit upset

1088
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,000
so she went inside

1089
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,520
You guys went to walk the dog

1090
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,200
Yeah

1091
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:28,960
Okay

1092
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,040
Straightforward girl

1093
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,200
Just

1094
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:41,760
Just say it

1095
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,960
Honestly, I think sometimes I’m

1096
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,760
not really the type to kill the mood

1097
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,000
And sometimes

1098
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:50,840
very

1099
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:55,320
I find it hard to say no to people

1100
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,960
Yeah, and I tend to overthink things

1101
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,200
I’ll wonder, if I do this

1102
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,040
what will happen

1103
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,000
If I do that

1104
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,120
what kind of result will it bring

1105
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,640
So do you know what you really think?

1106
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,160
Are you clear about your thoughts right now?

1107
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,520
Are you in that state?

1108
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,760
I’m probably a bit slow to realize things

1109
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:26,800
Honestly, sometimes

1110
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,840
I feel like I

1111
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:29,680
sometimes overthink things

1112
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,080
and that makes me less proactive

1113
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,280
But that means I miss a lot of opportunities

1114
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,040
Just

1115
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,880
I end up missing them, and then

1116
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:43,680
I

1117
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,440
Actually, I was planning to

1118
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,440
go work out.

1119
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,120
But suddenly,

1120
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,040
I think Zhi Heng came back.

1121
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:56,760
I think Zhi Heng came back.

1122
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,280
He said he just went cycling.

1123
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,440
Then he suggested

1124
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,520
we all go cycling together.

1125
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:02,880
So,

1126
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,400
I wanted to ask if you wanted to join.

1127
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,440
But then,

1128
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,080
I saw you seemed to

1129
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,680
head off in another direction.

1130
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,200
You went to the kitchen.

1131
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,040
So I

1132
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,640
was just about to head out then.

1133
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:18,320
And I ran into them.

1134
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,200
I felt like

1135
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,560
I didn't want to kill the vibe.

1136
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,720
So I joined them.

1137
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,280
Yeah, that's it.

1138
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,680
Where are you guys going?

1139
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,360
We're going cycling.

1140
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,320
I was going to work out.

1141
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,800
But they wanted to go cycling.

1142
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,160
So,

1143
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,240
Do you want to come?

1144
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:36,560
You guys go ahead.

1145
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:47,960
Do you want to join?

1146
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:48,920
I'm fine with working out too.

1147
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,800
There's a mountain bike inside.

1148
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,200
It's fine, you guys go cycling.

1149
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,480
I'll just do some stretching and exercise.

1150
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,520
You should try it.

1151
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:58,400
I'll get it down for you.

1152
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:01,800
This one looks cooler.

1153
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:02,760
I'll get you the cool one.

1154
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,160
This one's better suited

1155
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:05,640
for people with long legs.

1156
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:06,560
That works.

1157
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,960
He's really considerate of others too.

1158
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,080
That's probably my weakness.

1159
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,640
But he described himself pretty accurately.

1160
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,680
I think he's very self-aware.

1161
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,040
Why are you starting to reflect on yourself?

1162
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,640
No, I just

1163
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,440
Maybe I'm the type

1164
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,520
who's a bit more action-oriented.

1165
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,000
Really?

1166
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,520
I think I'm a bit better than you at that.

1167
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:32,600
What about him?

1168
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,120
Yeah, that's right.

1169
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:35,600
The second brother won't talk about the eldest.

1170
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:36,720
And the eldest won't talk about the second.

1171
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,360
At least they cleared things up here.

1172
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,240
That's really good.

1173
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:47,480
And then,

1174
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,520
I think our time in the cabin

1175
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:49,360
is pretty precious.

1176
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,120
Sometimes I want to

1177
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,160
just talk to you.

1178
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,080
I'm really glad

1179
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,160
that you take the initiative to talk to me.

1180
00:47:59,160 --> 00:47:59,680
Because I think

1181
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,600
sometimes direct communication

1182
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,280
is better than keeping things bottled up.

1183
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,160
is better than keeping things bottled up.

1184
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,520
It works out much better.

1185
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:05,760
I'm not trying to pressure you.

1186
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,080
I know.

1187
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,400
I don't feel pressured.

1188
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,800
I'm just thinking about how to phrase things.

1189
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:11,560
Sometimes I

1190
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,760
amn't that good at

1191
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:15,200
expressing myself.

1192
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,720
Like yesterday, I think we

1193
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:18,960
had a really nice chat.

1194
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:23,800
So have you been happy these past few days?

1195
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,200
You mean with you?

1196
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,600
Yeah, I've been happy.

1197
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:47,520
The two of them

1198
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:48,960
have that kind of

1199
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,120
slowly

1200
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:51,720
So the proportion

1201
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,600
shouldn't be eighty percent

1202
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:53,840
Yeah, definitely not eighty percent

1203
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,360
I think Yu Xing has more

1204
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,080
I guessed wrong again

1205
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,360
But before, I

1206
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,800
really thought Zi Han had more

1207
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:00,920
Yeah, but

1208
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,400
Compared to who can make you happy

1209
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,400
I think who can

1210
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,000
truly make you unhappy

1211
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:06,560
is more important

1212
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:08,320
Do you get it?

1213
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,320
Being happy

1214
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,920
There are many people who can make me happy

1215
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,160
We might have many different kinds of happiness

1216
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:14,520
The feeling he gives me is

1217
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,320
Who can truly affect my mood

1218
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,080
and stir up my emotions

1219
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,040
I understand

1220
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,840
Because of this special part

1221
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:22,800
I really like Chi Chi

1222
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,400
Because she has to make this choice

1223
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,680
there are many conditions

1224
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,200
First, she has to believe

1225
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,600
between her and Yu Xing

1226
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,040
there's something going on

1227
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:32,880
If there's nothing

1228
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,040
her action today

1229
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,400
would seem really abrupt

1230
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,600
So first, she's someone who

1231
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,280
trusts herself

1232
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,520
and her feelings

1233
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,520
Second,

1234
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,560
like Honey just said

1235
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,720
she's a straightforward girl

1236
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,680
After she trusts her feelings

1237
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,040
she wants to open up

1238
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,960
a space for communication

1239
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,040
But few people can actually do this

1240
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:50,840
But she really

1241
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:51,800
wants to do this

1242
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:52,680
She feels that

1243
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,400
their communication

1244
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,720
has some issues

1245
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:56,960
Yeah

1246
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,200
She's really good at solving problems

1247
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,360
I've noticed when things happen

1248
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,720
she doesn't keep it bottled up for long

1249
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,480
She does sometimes

1250
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,920
but she realizes that doesn't solve anything

1251
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,120
The other person is just too closed off

1252
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:07,680
So I'll do it

1253
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,880
Yeah, that's really charming about her

1254
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,160
She doesn't just struggle internally

1255
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,160
That's something I should really learn from

1256
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:14,520
For example

1257
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:15,680
when you're invited by

1258
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,640
your crush and your best friend

1259
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,160
at the same time

1260
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,480
how do you make

1261
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:20,480
a choice

1262
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,640
Is it friends first

1263
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,120
or your crush first

1264
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:26,200
Me

1265
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:30,000
When I was younger, I’d probably choose my friends.

1266
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,320
Because back then,

1267
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,000
I loved playing basketball.

1268
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,920
If someone invited me to play,

1269
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,000
I’d always go.

1270
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:38,920
I felt that was really important in my life.

1271
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,360
It mattered a lot to me.

1272
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:41,840
But now, I’d choose my girlfriend.

1273
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,040
Now, I’d pick my girlfriend.

1274
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:45,920
For me, it depends.

1275
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:46,800
If I’m with that guy,

1276
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:47,480
and it’s the early stage,

1277
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,520
like the heart-fluttering phase,

1278
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,320
I’d also consider

1279
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:49,880
how close I am with my bestie.

1280
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,200
Are we super tight?

1281
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,440
If we’re really close,

1282
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,240
and it’s not something

1283
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,480
especially important,

1284
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,880
like just going shopping or something,

1285
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,240
I’d say, “We have plenty of time ahead.”

1286
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,160
“Let me take this chance this time.”

1287
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,600
“I’ll make it up to you next time.”

1288
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:04,160
Because I feel that opportunity

1289
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,760
is something I need to seize.

1290
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,120
My friends,

1291
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,920
we’ve known each other for ages.

1292
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,560
When they start dating, they disappear too.

1293
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:12,600
They ditch me sometimes.

1294
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,400
So we all get it.

1295
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:14,520
Bestie, you understand.

1296
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,160
Last time, you

1297
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,040
did the same to me.

1298
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:16,480
Thanks.

1299
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:17,680
Yeah, I get it.

1300
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:18,240
I understand now.

1301
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:20,120
That’s how it is.

1302
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,120

00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,440
who would you choose?

Who made this?

1313
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:54,760
Zi Han

1314
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:56,840
Try it.

1315
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:00,480
It’s delicious.

1316
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:04,360
Nice!

1317
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,440
You really know how to make people feel good.

1318
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:07,160
Not bad.

1319
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:13,960
Who’s back?

1320
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:15,400
Who?

1321
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:18,160
Xiao Jiao

1322
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:18,880
Hello.

1323
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:20,160
Hi.

1324
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,240
Hey.

1325
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,760
I was wondering where you went.

1326
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,160
I thought you’d be back early today.

1327
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,720
Can you come out for a bit?

1328
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:36,840
Can you step out for a moment?

1329
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:41,320
Are you done eating?

1330
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,480
I need to talk to you.

1331
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:44,760
Xiao Jiao, okay.

1332
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:51,600
What’s up?

1333
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,040
What are you doing?

1334
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,040
What is it?

1335
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:57,480
You’ll see when you get here.

1336
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,840
Let’s go to the mailbox.

1337
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,040
The mailbox area.

1338
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,000
You can guess.

1339
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,280
He started her Little Train session.

1340
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:08,160
Really?

1341
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:09,080
What else could it be?

1342
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,080
Go to the mailbox, then what?

1343
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,800
Then nothing, the mailbox isn’t important.

1344
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:14,720
Let’s keep walking.

1345
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:16,680
What do you mean?

1346
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:20,680
What?

1347
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:21,480
What’s this?

1348
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,320
That card.

1349
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:30,520
Park Time.

1350
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,320
Only once a week.

1351
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,440
Midweek park date.

1352
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:39,040
Opens every Monday at midnight.

1353
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,160
Whoever gets the invitation card

1354
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,640
has to personally

1355
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,760
plan and prepare the date.

1356
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:44,960
So for a one-on-one date,

1357
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,280
you have to create it yourself, right?

1358
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,600
You have to work for it.

1359
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,240
So it won’t be long before

1360
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,000
he starts trying to get that card.

1361
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,160
I'm going to get that.

1362
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,280
The weekday one.

1363
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,080
Yeah.

1364
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:11,160
Definitely.

1365
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:12,240
Go.

1366
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,560
Anyway, it's now.

1367
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:14,800
But I think it's about time.

1368
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:17,960
I'm heading down. Want to come?

1369
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:18,760
Let's go together.

1370
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:25,480
Here we go.

1371
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:26,520
We're here.

1372
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:27,720
I've been looking forward to this.

1373
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,080
Alright, first one.

1374
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:37,880
Then...

1375
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,120
Check below.

1376
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,520
It says the time and place.

1377
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,880
So this is the weekday one.

1378
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,320
Let's go.

1379
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:52,480
Is it a date?

1380
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:53,600
No idea.

1381
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,920
You'll know when you get there.

1382
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,120
So tsundere.

1383
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:56,760
I don't know.

1384
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:57,560
No idea.

1385
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,360
You'll find out when you come.

1386
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,840
Could you wait here for me?

1387
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,640
Sure.

1388
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,440
I'm determined to get this.

1389
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,800
This car is so pretty.

1390
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:17,200
Yes.

1391
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:18,560
Do I sit here?

1392
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:19,000
Is this my seat?

1393
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:19,800
Yes.

1394
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:20,240
Okay.

1395
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:21,720
Flower cart.

1396
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,280
Let me spray this for you.

1397
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,800
There are lots of mosquitoes here.

1398
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:26,560
Thanks.

1399
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,120
He sprayed mosquito repellent for her first.

1400
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:28,880
Worried she'd get bitten.

1401
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:29,600
Such attention to detail.

1402
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,040
Pick one.

1403
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,280
This one's for mosquitoes.

1404
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,920
I'll take the pink one.

1405
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,160
Alright, I'll take this.

1406
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,200
So I just do it like this?

1407
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,040
Either way is fine.

1408
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,160
However you like.

1409
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:40,480
Okay.

1410
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,440
This little bunny is so cute.

1411
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,080
I bought this bunny because...

1412
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:46,800
Your zodiac sign is Rabbit.

1413
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:49,680
See?

1414
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,200
It's all in the details.

1415
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,760
He really likes her.

1416
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,080
First the flower cart,

1417
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,160
then the mosquito repellent,

1418
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,400
then the zodiac sign.

1419
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,680
When did you grab that card?

1420
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,160
Guess.

1421
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,120
It was you?

1422
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,320
So cool.

1423
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:22,640
We're here.

1424
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,520
I'm really curious what he planned.

1425
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,120
He must have lots of tricks.

1426
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:30,160
Yeah, someone who brings snacks every day.

1427
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,480
He must have tons of moves.

1428
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,600
Alright, let's get out.

1429
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,000
Okay.

1430
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:39,720
Come on, let's go this way.

1431
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:41,560
There's a path ahead.

1432
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:42,320
Yes.

1433
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:45,400
Where are we going?

1434
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:46,600
Go through here.

1435
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,520
To the cabin.

1436
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:49,600
Right.

1437
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,560
I actually came here last night.

1438
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:53,520
Set up half of it.

1439
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:53,960
Then...

1440
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:55,760
You decorated it yourself?

1441
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,120
Some things I asked

1442
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:00,000
the staff to buy.

1443
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,280
But I did most of the setup.

1444
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:04,240
That's so nice.

1445
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,080
We're actually here.

1446
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,560
This is beautiful.

1447
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,480
It's really gorgeous.

1448
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:12,000
Right?

1449
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:15,880
He really put a lot of thought into this.

1450
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:17,200
Sit here.

1451
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,120
Hold on a sec.

1452
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:23,040
Okay.

1453
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:31,360
Flower

1454
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,080
He's actually someone who values rituals.

1455
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,320
The flower is coming, yes.

1456
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,640
This flower is for you.

1457
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,760
Thank you.

1458
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:38,760
This is a preserved flower.

1459
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:40,280
It's so beautiful.

1460
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:42,040
So it will never wilt.

1461
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:42,840
That's right.

1462
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:43,640
I just hope you

1463
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:45,320
can always be happy and joyful.

1464
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,320
Not just in the cabin.

1465
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:47,360
Thank you.

1466
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,080
You can put it next to you.

1467
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,240
Is this barbecue?

1468
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:00,760
Grilled meat.

1469
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:01,160
Grilled meat.

1470
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:01,800
I just grilled it.

1471
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,160
Outdoor mini barbecue.

1472
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:06,560
Because on your first day,

1473
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,400
I remember you said you like grilled meat.

1474
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:10,880
So I was thinking,

1475
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:10,960
So I was thinking,

1476
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,400
we could have grilled meat today.

1477
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,640
Of these three dishes,

1478
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,120
which one do you think

1479
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:18,520
matches your taste more?

1480
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,520
I prefer grilled food.

1481
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:21,680
I like grilled more than fried.

1482
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:22,040
Grilled food.

1483
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,560
I eat grilled food more often.

1484
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:25,080
Got it.

1485
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:26,120
Noted.

1486
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:28,600
Very devoted.

1487
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,640
A casual remark to him is

1488
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:31,680
a big deal.

1489
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:34,800
Your plate.

1490
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:35,440
Thank you.

1491
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:36,560
You're welcome.

1492
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,080
I'm not sure

1493
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,320
if you can eat these.

1494
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:40,960
This one's a bit burnt.

1495
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,560
It's fine.

1496
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,680
I didn't buy pork.

1497
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,360
Because I think I heard you say once

1498
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:46,680
you don't really like

1499
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:47,000
pork.

1500
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:47,360
Pork.

1501
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,040
So I bought only beef.

1502
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,120
That really hits home for me.

1503
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:51,560
I get it.

1504
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:53,920
Okay, thank you.

1505
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,120
I really love chicken cartilage.

1506
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:00,360
Really?

1507
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:02,360
I was worried

1508
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:04,040
I'd buy something you don't like.

1509
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:07,680
It's all stuff I like.

1510
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:10,800
She affirmed him.

1511
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:11,840
It's all things I like.

1512
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:12,600
Emotional value.

1513
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:13,480
So tasty.

1514
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,840
I really like fish tofu.

1515
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:16,440
Really?

1516
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:18,880
Great choices.

1517
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:22,600
Xiao Jiao really

1518
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,760
just a little affirmation

1519
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,160
because he likes it so much.

1520
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:25,400
Yes.

1521
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:25,880
He loves it.

1522
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:26,320
I understand.

1523
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,320
This place is nice too.

1524
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:30,160
Yeah, I think this spot

1525
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,360
makes people feel relaxed.

1526
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,000
That's why I chose it.

1527
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,320
If you feel cold,

1528
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:38,560
let me know, there are blankets over there.

1529
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:38,600
Just tell me, there are blankets over there.

1530
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:39,080
I'm not cold.

1531
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:39,360
Okay.

1532
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,240
I thought of everything in advance.

1533
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,240
These are wet wipes.

1534
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:44,200
Thank you.

1535
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,440
You even brought wet wipes.

1536
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:49,080
You're so thoughtful.

1537
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:54,280
Have you always been this thoughtful?

1538
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:55,720
Or did you

1539
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:57,320
used to be different?

1540
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:00,280
I think I've been like this since middle school.

1541
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:02,240
Maybe because

1542
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,760
when I was little, there was a time

1543
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,440
I didn't live with my parents.

1544
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:10,560
Who did you live with then?

1545
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,120
With my grandparents.

1546
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:15,200
Kids who grow up with elders

1547
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,720
tend to be more caring.

1548
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:17,200
Yes.

1549
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:18,640
For a while,

1550
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:19,320
I was on my own.

1551
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:20,040
Spent a lot of time alone.

1552
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:20,800
So

1553
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,240
I guess I learned

1554
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:23,880
picked up some things.

1555
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,240
I'll get the non-burnt part

1556
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:29,960
out for you.

1557
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:34,240
See, he's removing the burnt part for her.

1558
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:36,200
That's so considerate.

1559
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:42,640
Don't you think at this moment

1560
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,200
his serious expression

1561
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:44,800
is really moving?

1562
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:46,880
Your friends since childhood

1563
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,240
must have been very lucky

1564
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,560
to be your close friends.

1565
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,680
They must have all been

1566
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:52,480
well taken care of by you.

1567
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,440
Back in middle school, some classmates

1568
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,080
would write me little notes

1569
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,560
and say

1570
01:00:58,560 --> 01:00:59,600
that I might be

1571
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:00,200
well,

1572
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,120
the most thoughtful person they've met.

1573
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,360
Imagine being like that even in middle school.

1574
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:06,680
But honestly,

1575
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:07,400
to be honest,

1576
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,320
I

1577
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:10,400
only treat some people

1578
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,160
this way.

1579
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:16,480
Does that earn me any points?

1580
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:21,920
You should eat something too.

1581
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:22,840
You must be hungry.

1582
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,440
So how was your week?

1583
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,160
Every day I just feel

1584
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:29,720
so busy,

1585
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:30,240
so tired,

1586
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:31,480
and so sleepy.

1587
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:35,800
But right now I feel

1588
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:39,040
all the exhaustion from the week

1589
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,920
has melted away.

1590
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:41,680
Really.

1591
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:44,880
It was all worth it.

1592
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,960
Especially since Xiao Jiao did so much.

1593
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:47,800
Yeah.

1594
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:49,760
Thank you

1595
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,640
for preparing everything.

1596
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:55,320
That means a lot.

1597
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,080
I'm so happy.

1598
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:03,200
Every night there's a surprise.

1599
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,760
I'm really happy.

1600
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,280
Speaking of surprises,

1601
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:14,120
don't you think the moon is beautiful tonight?

1602
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:15,400
Where's the moon?

1603
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:16,560
It's over there.

1604
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,040
Is it blocked?

1605
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:21,080
Wait two minutes, and it'll come out.

1606
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:24,080
Did you arrange this too?

1607
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:26,360
The moon?

1608
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:27,840
Last night,

1609
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:29,720
I had a little talk with it.

1610
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,080
And it really showed up.

1611
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:51,040
Tonight the moon looks rounder than yesterday.

1612
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:52,240
Yeah.

1613
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:55,640
Since we were talking about surprises,

1614
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:57,440
I actually have another surprise.

1615
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:58,440
What is it?

1616
01:02:58,440 --> 01:02:59,720
I need your help with it.

1617
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:01,040
What?

1618
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:02,120
There's more?

1619
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:04,880
Okay.

1620
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:06,480
Time for the big move.
