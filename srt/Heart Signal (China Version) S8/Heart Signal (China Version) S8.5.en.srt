1
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,000
Heartbeat

2
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,680
The brightest signature on the canvas of youth

3
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,520
A deep yearning for passionate love

4
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,440
Never fades

5
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,000
996

6
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,800
Fills every gap in daily life

7
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,160
Point A to point B

8
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,120
Lays out the

9
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,560
entire trajectory of life

10
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,680
The longing to "have a proper relationship"

11
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,520
Like looking through a shop window

12
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,800
At the warm light

13
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,320
Letting work schedules go offline

14
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,240
This is so much fun

15
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,040
Muting social masks

16
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,360
Letting go of identity concerns

17
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,600
To feel two genuine hearts

18
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,440
The charm of being honest with each other

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,200
Regaining the courage to feel moved

20
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,200
Gentle waves lap

21
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,440
The sea breeze is slightly intoxicating

22
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,800
The height of summer, 2025

23
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,760
Ten singles hoping to move forward with love

24
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,160
From Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai

25
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,000
On two remote islands far from the hustle and bustle

26
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,840
Quietly meet

27
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,760
Hello

28
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,000
Hello

29
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,760
Would you like something to drink?

30
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,840
I just had something

31
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,840
You really look like

32
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,640
a "man straight out of a comic"

33
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,800
On the island

34
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,920
They will be accompanied by the sound of waves

35
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,520
Washing away the busyness and fatigue of reality

36
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,320
Experiencing the purest form of social life

37
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,200
Even though we've just met

38
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,960
It feels like everyone

39
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,480
has known each other for a long time

40
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,280
Let's see who can swing higher.

41
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:38,920
Okay.

42
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,840
On the journey,

43
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,280
they don't know each other's age,

44
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,520
nor ask about their professions.

45
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,760
They experience the purest version of each other.

46
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,000
Here we go.

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,640
Missed it.

48
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,720
Hello.

49
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,040
Hello.

50
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,240
I saw it.

51
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,600
It feels like I've seen you,

52
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,080
but not completely.

53
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,760
After you reached out to chat with me that day,

54
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,760
did you regret it?

55
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,360
No.

56
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,120
I don't

57
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,200
regret any of my actions.

58
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,920
I want to

59
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,880
keep this feeling

60
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,880
going with you.

61
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,840
This is so romantic.

62
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,360
It's not just about liking you.

63
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,360
It's the you right now,

64
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,320
the you from the past,

65
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,280
and all of you.

66
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,440
On this journey where we shed our identities,

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,520
only two true hearts remain,

68
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,120
interacting with each other along the way.

69
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,240
Here it comes

70
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,280

Alright

118
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,000
Welcome to all our Heartbeat Cupids

119
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,320
Hello, everyone

120
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm Xu Minghao

121
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,880
Last season

122
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,280
still left me wanting more

123
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,280
so this season

124
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,040
I hope to spend it with all of you

125
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,960
enjoying even more heart-fluttering moments

126
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,360
I also hope to see them here

127
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,280
find their own love and friendship

128
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,840
So I hope this season

129
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,920
can also keep us company even more

130
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,160
How does that sound?

131
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,720
Yes, this season will

132
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,120
be by your side even more

133
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,240
I'm Ma Boqian

134
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,400
And then

135
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,000
I think mainly from

136
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
the things that happen to the Heartbeat guests

137
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,560
make us reflect on some things

138
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,560
whether it's about life

139
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,040
or about future relationships

140
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,360
they can all be inspiring

141
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,120
I'll try not to be so loud

142
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,880
but since Hanikezi is here today

143
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,960
to be honest, it's a bit hard

144
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,560
because with her

145
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,360
we're the kind of people

146
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,560
who have "battled" through all kinds of shows until now

147
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,240
I hope you can control yourself

148
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,520
So next

149
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,320
let's shift our attention to

150
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,720
Hanikezi

151
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,200
Let's welcome our new friend

152
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,840
Hello everyone

153
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,160
I'm the new Heartbeat Cupid

154
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,040
This is actually my first time

155
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,400
officially "shipping" couples

156
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,880
And I quite enjoy "shipping" couples

157
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,680
because watching others fall in love

158
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,520
is a very joyful thing

159
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,640
and also a very happy thing

160
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,240
Yes

161
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,080
Hello everyone

162
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,120
I'm very happy to be back on

163
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,560
"Signal of the Heart"

164
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,720
I hope this season

165
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,840
can also bring everyone

166
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,440
my perspective

167
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,120
and straightforward analysis

168
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,320
This time, Brother Xu

169
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,800
has returned again to

170
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,840
our "Signal of the Heart."

171
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,320
How do you feel now?

172
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,760
I'm very happy to be back at

173
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,520
"Signal of the Heart" again.

174
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,560
I'm even more looking forward to seeing the follow-up

175
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,120
to the last time we met on the island.

176
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,080
What's really cute about Brother Xu is that

177
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,640
he always follows every couple

178
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,480
and gets super excited

179
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,520
and totally invested

180
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,600
really, really invested.

181
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,240
Next,

182
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,720
let's welcome

183
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,800
our Chun Ye.

184
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,040
I have a goal for this season.

185
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,400
I want to become

186
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,600
a crane worthy of Yang Ruqing.

187
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,240
Worthy of Yang Ruqing,

188
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,480
worthy of Yang Ruqing's

189
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,800
"capable" label for a crane.

190
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,040
But did Yang Ruqing ask you for anything?

191
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,840
No, I mean ability.

192
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,480
A capable crane, that's what I mean.

193
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,880
Now it's the eighth season,

194
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,400
and "Signal of the Heart's"

195
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,040
peach blossom tree

196
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
is also continuously

197
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,760
growing strong

198
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,960
and bearing fruit.

199
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,600
So here,

200
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,840
let me share with everyone

201
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,640
that our "Jin Zhao" couple

202
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,000
in May of this year

203
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,880
have achieved a happy ending.

204
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,480
They got engaged.

205
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,880
That's great.

206
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,520
So everyone knows

207
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,920
the after-sales service of "Signal of the Heart"

208
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,600
is really impressive.

209
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,800
Alright, next

210
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,880
let's also

211
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,920
look forward to

212
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,280
our brand new season eight

213
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:54,880
and see what it will

214
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,840
bring to everyone

215
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,520
in terms of different and special experiences.

216
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,120
This time, we are

217
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,400
using a trip as the format

218
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,560
to bring everyone together.

219
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,640
It's the first time we're starting off with a trip.

220
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,840
I also think

221
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,240
it's a better way to get to know each other.

222
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,840
Actually, it's about creating an opportunity

223
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,360
for everyone to have more chances to understand each other.

224
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:10,880
Right.

225
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,080
Because you'll see more sides of them.

226
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,120
You can have more

227
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,720
insight and understanding of each other.

228
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,080
More or less,

229
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,960
you can find out

230
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,080
whether the two of you are compatible in many ways.

231
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,000
Yes.

232
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,800
Traveling is still

233
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,640
a real test for two people

234
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,680
and their relationship.

235
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,680
But traveling has an advantage when it comes to feelings of attraction.

236
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:26,960
It allows two people

237
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,480
to experience that spark during the trip

238
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,480
in a deeper way

239
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,720
and more clearly.

240
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,360
In real life,

241
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,440
when people are dating,

242
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,560
they also feel

243
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,720
that sometimes

244
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,800
the feelings we have for someone

245
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,600
are influenced by many

246
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,760
external factors.

247
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,000
Traveling can actually

248
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,960
let you quickly see a person’s

249
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,120
behavior patterns.

250
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,400
You can quickly

251
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,640
and accurately judge

252
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,480
what this person will be like

253
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,040
in a future relationship.

254
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,040
You get a general idea.

255
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,080
Right.

256
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,160
We always say

257
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,000
that saying,

258
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,080
if you want

259
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,920
to get to know someone,

260
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,840
the best way

261
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,360
is to travel with them.

262
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:56,880
Exactly.

263
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,440
You can find out

264
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,480
their lifestyle,

265
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,680
how they express themselves,

266
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,120
their eating habits,

267
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,080
and everything about them.

268
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:02,920
You can get

269
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,880
a quick understanding.

270
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,480
Yes.

271
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,000
Alright, next up

272
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,640
is the

273
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,240
first

274
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,400
dinner where everyone from both islands meets

275
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,760
I'm really looking forward to our

276
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,720
night when everyone finally gets together

277
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,520
All the Heartbeat Cupids

278
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,480
let's get ourselves ready

279
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,360
and start our

280
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,680
Kang Shifu Jasmine Tea "Signal of the Heart"

281
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,560
Season 8

282
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,040
Here we come

283
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,960
Let's go

284
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,240
Shanghai

285
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,480
Everyone's about to meet

286
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,200
Yeah

287
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,200
They're here

288
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,000
They're here

289
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,880
So excited

290
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,480
They have gifts too

291
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,560
Just like us

292
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,400
Yes

293
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,680
Everyone looks so handsome and beautiful

294
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,880
This is just too handsome

295
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,680
Wang Lechen

296
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,760
I love watching the dinner parties the most

297
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,400
They always dress up so specially

298
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,440
They changed into a new outfit

299
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,720
the really formal kind

300
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,720
What is he going to do?

301
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,880
He changed seats.

302
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,080
Now you can see who is coming.

303
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,760
Yeah.

304
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,200
Wang Lechen looks so different in a suit.

305
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,280
When guys put on formal wear, they suddenly

306
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,320
look like a different person.

307
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,920
He looks really good.

308
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,960
So handsome.

309
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,880
Is it possible the others look great too?

310
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,600
They haven't appeared yet.

311
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,200
It's possible.

312
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,920
Here they come.

313
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,360
This is...

314
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,200
This should be Lan (Xu Rulan), right?

315
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,080
Yes, it's Lanlan (Xu Rulan).

316
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,080
So beautiful.

317
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,920
Really beautiful.

318
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,400
All dressed up for the occasion.

319
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:14,800
Hello.

320
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,360
Hi.

321
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,160
Hello.

322
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,160
He was amazed.

323
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,520
Where do you want to sit?

324
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,640
I'm fine with anywhere.

325
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,440
Hello.

326
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,640
Hi, my name is

327
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,320
Wang Lechen.

328
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,720
I'm Xu Rulan.

329
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,040
Lan as in the color blue.

330
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,680
Are you from the other island?

331
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,440
I think I saw your photo.

332
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,040
They haven't met before.

333
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,120
Yeah, this is the first time.

334
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,040
Dressed up like this for the first meeting?

335
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,840
I think anyone would be moved.

336
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,840
Definitely.

337
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,600
The dinner part is really amazing.

338
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,280
Have a seat.

339
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:58,800
Okay.

340
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,080
Do you want some tea?

341
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,400
It seems like this is the only thing to drink right now.

342
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,000
Then I'll have one without sugar.

343
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,920
Okay, I'll get it for you.

344
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,560
Thank you.

345
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,520
Thanks.

346
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,080
He's nervous.

347
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,880
Say something quickly.

348
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,280
"Silent mouth," hurry up and say something.

349
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,040
"Silent mouth."

350
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,400
Aren't you usually lively?

351
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,080
Yeah.

352
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,800
Why was I the first one to arrive?

353
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,720
When you went into that

354
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,840
cabin on the island,

355
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,840
what number were you?

356
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,000
The third.

357
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,720
I was the first.

358
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,480
You were the first?

359
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,760
Yes.

360
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,560
He twitched.

361
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,560
His mouth is...

362
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,240
She keeps staring at him.

363
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,560
And she doesn't say anything.

364
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,880
"Silent mouth," what are you even doing?

365
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,400
What are you laughing at?

366
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,280
Nothing.

367
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,320
It's just that we suddenly stopped talking.

368
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,480
It seems like they say that over there, you all are

369
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,640
very "I" types (introverts), right?

370
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,800
No.

371
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,160
Actually, I'm more of an "E" type (extrovert).

372
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:43,640
Really?

373
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,320
Yeah.

374
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:44,960
What about you?

375
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,040
I'm a strong "I" type (introvert).

376
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,840
That must be tough for you.

377
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,400
Then I'll come up with a topic.

378
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,280
Find a topic.

379
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,000
She's really confident and open.

380
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,640
Alright.

381
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,320
(Xu Rulan) Lanlan is just

382
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,040
not nervous at all.

383
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,240
She's very relaxed.

384
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,240
She always feels like

385
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,720
she can control the whole situation.

386
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,560
A woman with a very strong inner self.

387
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,840
That must be tough for you.

388
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,200
Then I'll come up with a topic.

389
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,520
Sure.

390
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,280
Host a meeting for the two of us.

391
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,600
Just the two of us.

392
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,800
I really like watching this kind of thing.

393
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,840
We should have two friends with us.

394
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,080
Back then, we went to your place.

395
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,200
Yes.

396
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,640
We exchanged with each other.

397
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,280
Right.

398
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,720
Did you have fun?

399
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,120
It was pretty good, just...

400
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,240
Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong)

401
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,080
Very "I" (introverted personality)

402
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,120
Wang Yifan was just always smiling.

403
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,960
Yeah.

404
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,160
From your photos, it seems like you love to smile too.

405
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,280
When I saw that...

406
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,280
The photo from when we were choosing.

407
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,000
Yes.

408
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,920
And you're also the friendship-type lover, right?

409
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,560
Are you?

410
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,280
Yeah, I am too.

411
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,040
I want to switch.

412
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,760
I want to switch.

413
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,200
Switch to where? Next to you?

414
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,400
Sit on this side.

415
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,120
Yeah.

416
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,920
Why don't you sit over here?

417
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,640
A bit more in the middle.

418
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,240
Okay.

419
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,680
Or over here.

420
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:27,960
Okay.

421
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:32,720
Please have a seat.

422
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,480
So sweet.

423
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,600
Okay.

424
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,120
What do you think about sitting next to someone?

425
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,920
I think it's a considerate gesture.

426
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,320
Maybe she sensed

427
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,640
that the guy felt awkward being stared at by her.

428
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,520
He might have felt embarrassed.

429
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,160
So she decided to sit next to him.

430
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,040
Right, I want to ask something.

431
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,840
Teacher Qianzhuang,

432
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,160
is sitting next to someone more intimate

433
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,560
or is sitting across from them more intimate?

434
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,800
Actually, sitting next to someone

435
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,000
can also be a way to hide a little.

436
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,800
Because when you're face to face,

437
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,440
the sense of immersion with each other

438
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,360
is much stronger.

439
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,200
But the timing of her changing seats was quite clever.

440
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,240
She did it right after saying

441
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:30,800
"We are all

442
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,440
friendship-type lovers,"

443
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,480
then she changed seats.

444
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,120
So she really did

445
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,360
show a sense of friendliness,

446
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,760
at least a kind of acceptance.

447
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,200
Minghao, which type are you?

448
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,640
Are you the type who dares to move around?

449
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,200
Or do you also just find a corner?

450
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,880
I wouldn't.

451
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,880
I would.

452
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,160
I just naturally do what I want to do.

453
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,840
That's great.

454
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,120
She's really brave.

455
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,480
If it were me, I'd be glued to my seat.

456
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,080
I wouldn't be able to move.

457
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,320
How long after you came in did I arrive?

458
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,320
About

459
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,160
I didn't really check the time

460
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,400
It should be around ten minutes or so

461
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,040
Yeah

462
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,200
So you were sitting here alone

463
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,840
Didn't you have nothing to do at all?

464
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,440
Yes

465
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,840
I was just about to

466
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,920
start cleaning up for a bit

467
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,840
Give Wang Lechen some time and he gets excited

468
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,000
I think it's nice that we sit side by side like this

469
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,240
As soon as they come in, we can

470
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,760
greet the guests, right?

471
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,360
They're here

472
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,120
This is

473
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,360
Looks a bit like Wang Jue

474
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,040
Wang Jue

475
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,360
Beautiful lady

476
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,240
Hello

477
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,720
Hello

478
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,800
Hello, we meet again

479
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,280
Hello, we meet again

480
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,760
Do you want to sit here or over there?

481
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,080
I'll sit here

482
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,760
Sure

483
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,680
This seems to be everyone's first choice

484
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,520
I sat here when I came

485
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,400
She sat here when she came

486
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,200
It must be the spot the first person to come in chooses

487
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,320
would pick

488
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,000
Okay

489
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,800
Let's sit

490
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,480
Alright

491
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,600
How long have you been here?

492
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,160
I was the first to arrive

493
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,200
I told you pink really suits you.

494
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:28,880
Yes.

495
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,280
White looks good on you too.

496
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:32,720
Thank you.

497
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,640
And your hairstyle looks great today too.

498
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,840
Thank you.

499
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,160
But this is actually the first time you two have met.

500
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,240
That's right.

501
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,880
So, how does it feel to be switched over there?

502
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,680
It's amazing.

503
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,200
I think they're having a lot of fun over there.

504
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,360
Aren't they?

505
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,920
Of course.

506
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,840
I want to know what you guys

507
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,320
did on the island yesterday.

508
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,000
We went to watch the sunset.

509
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,840
We watched it at the lighthouse.

510
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,840
It was beautiful.

511
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,960
I really want to see the lighthouse photos you took.

512
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,560
To make up for the fact that I didn't get to see the lighthouse.

513
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:16,560
I have them.

514
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,600
There are lots of group photos too.

515
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,080
Can I see them now?

516
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,080
They're all here.

517
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,920
They're all right here.

518
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,200
Anyway,

519
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,320
It's fine, you go ahead and look.

520
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,240
It's fine, you go ahead and look.

521
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,160
Show me the group photos so I can be jealous of you.

522
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,280
You guys are so good at taking photos.

523
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,800
You were the one behind the camera for their photos, right?

524
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,840
They posed themselves.

525
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,080
No.

526
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,520
At first, Duoduo (Ke Ailin) arranged it.

527
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,560
After she finished taking photos,

528
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,280
I helped take some for them.

529
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,600
Duoduo (Ke Ailin).

530
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,600
Duoduo (Ke Ailin).

531
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,200
We've turned into tourists in the photos.

532
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,880
We're acting cute now.

533
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
The pose is really good.

534
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,840
These two girls' eyes

535
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,560
are especially expressive.

536
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,080
Yes.

537
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,840
That's great.

538
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,000
Next time, let Duoduo (Ke Ailin) take the lead.

539
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,120
All of us together.

540
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,520
I feel like Lanlan (Xu Rulan)

541
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,920
picked up on some information.

542
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,560
Did it happen?

543
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,040
No wonder you wanted to switch over there.

544
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,200
This side is at a disadvantage.

545
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,000
She wants to switch too.

546
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:55,960
You still have a chance to choose.

547
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,760
Actually, you can switch.

548
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,240
Yes.

549
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,920
If I don't choose, I'll just sit here.

550
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,600
Very clear.

551
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,760
Okay.

552
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:03,720
Very determined.

553
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,000
Wang Jue likes him (Wang Lechen).

554
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
For now,

555
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,440
she's determined to sit across from him.

556
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,320
Teacher, could this sometimes also

557
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,600
reflect the girl's feelings?

558
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,120
Yes.

559
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,520
Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong).

560
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,680
Meticulous Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong).

561
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,520
When he wears glasses and when he doesn't,

562
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,720
he looks like two different people.

563
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,760
He looks better without them.

564
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,400
Yes.

565
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,360
Hello.

566
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,360
Hello.

567
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,080
Hello.

568
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,840
Hello.

569
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,880
This is also our first meeting.

570
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,720
I haven't met this person before.

571
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,120
Wang Jue

572
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,000
Hello

573
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,320
He said it out loud

574
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,280
her name

575
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,560
Hello

576
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,520
You are

577
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,800
I'm Fang Yijiong

578
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,920
We've met before

579
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:18,720
Yes

580
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,880
Hello

581
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,480
Pick a seat

582
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,120
Actually, Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong)

583
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,240
has a good impression of Xu Rulan

584
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,240
He'll probably sit

585
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,760
next to her

586
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,480
I'll just sit here

587
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,960
across from her

588
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,200
I have a feeling

589
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,160
Later, when Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng) arrives,

590
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,280
sit next to her.

591
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,040
Sit next to Xu Rulan.

592
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,560
Hello, Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong).

593
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,760
Are you having fun?

594
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,200
We really missed you after you left.

595
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,440
You and Wang Yifan.

596
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,640
Happy.

597
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:58,960
Hello, roommate.

598
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,560
He said he only slept two hours yesterday.

599
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,320
Yeah.

600
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,480
Why?

601
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,720
Couldn't fall asleep.

602
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,640
Aren't you the one who...

603
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,360
Aren't you the one who never gets insomnia?

604
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,120
You tell us.

605
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,160
Because I was switched out.

606
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:13,840
That's why I had insomnia.

607
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,040
Too nervous.

608
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,600
Too nervous.

609
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,920
My mind was just...

610
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,520
pretty chaotic.

611
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,080
Silly smile.

612
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,920
Silly smile.

613
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,240
Sending out signals.

614
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,320
Today, Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong)

615
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,040
isn't wearing glasses.

616
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,160
Still not quite used to it.

617
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,600
Is it a different style?

618
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,080
It is a different style.

619
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,280
When we were choosing the profile cards,

620
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,320
we saw one with glasses

621
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,160
and another one where you weren't wearing glasses.

622
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,120
But in real life, you actually wear glasses.

623
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,520
So which one did you choose?

624
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,160
Actually, it was us

625
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,120
who discussed and chose based on the love personality type.

626
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,760
It's because

627
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,600
your type is the possessive lover.

628
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,000
That's a type we didn't have on our side.

629
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,720
Actually, you can't really say

630
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,000
it's completely the possessive lover type.

631
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,280
I might just need more companionship.

632
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,840
The "to be possessed" type.

633
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,840
The "to be possessed" type.

634
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,080
Who do you want to be possessed by?

635
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,720
Actually, when we were choosing,

636
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,960
there was another reason.

637
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,160
It was because you weren't smiling in that photo.

638
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,280
You looked so serious.

639
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,280
Is it this photo?

640
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,360
Yes.

641
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,800
It's one of the few photos where I'm not smiling.

642
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,520
Yeah, he usually smiles a lot.

643
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,000
I want to see it again.

644
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,200
Then you should smile more.

645
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,200
Okay, I'll try.

646
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,760
Alright.

647
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,960
So girls really like guys

648
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,000
who smile often?

649
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,000
That's right.

650
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,600
Of course, it depends.

651
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,800
You have to look good when you smile.

652
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,560
I don't look good when I smile.

653
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,240
You look great.

654
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,960
Give me a smile.

655
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,840
When I smile, I look like

656
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,720
a "silly son."

657
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,080
No.

658
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:51,840
You're really cool.

659
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,200
Give us a smile.

660
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,000
A shy smile.

661
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,880
See? Even your shy smile looks great.

662
00:26:59,240 --> 00:26:59,880
It's fine, keep watching.

663
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng)

664
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,000
Hello.

665
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:12,960
Hello.

666
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,560
Hello.

667
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,240
Hello.

668
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,560
Hello.

669
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,920
We're old acquaintances.

670
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,160
Can I sit anywhere?

671
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,120
Should I sit across or next to you?

672
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,080
Friends,

673
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,560
He should sit next to her.

674
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,600
Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng) must be

675
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,600
next to Lanlan (Xu Rulan).

676
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,400
Sit next to her, next to her.

677
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,480
Can I sit anywhere?

678
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,120
Yes, sit wherever you like.

679
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,400
Please, have a seat.

680
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,200
He pointed over there.

681
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:55,760
Send him away.

682
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,480
Please, have a seat.

683
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,600
He won't do that.

684
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,120
Okay.

685
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,440
Impossible.

686
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,080
That's not you.

687
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,080
It's over.

688
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:15,800
He realized.

689
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,280
He realized.

690
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,000
He has to stand.

691
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,800
He has to stand.

692
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,640
You have to stand.

693
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,720
You have to stand too.

694
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,280
He'll definitely stand.

695
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,160
Stand up, bro.

696
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,800
Once you sit down,

697
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,960
you won't want to get up.

698
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,920
By the way, how should I address you?

699
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,360
Jiao Zhiheng.

700
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,280
You can call me Xiao Jiao.

701
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,880
Alright, I'm Wang Lechen.

702
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,080
"Le" as in "happy,"

703
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,040
and "Chen" as in "morning."

704
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:48,440
Easy to remember.

705
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,040
Yeah, it's pretty easy to remember.

706
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,480
Did he just do a serious mosquito-catching act?

707
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,000
Yes.

708
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,080
What are you doing?

709
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,520
Sorry about that.

710
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,600
I didn't mean to.

711
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,800
What's going on here?

712
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,960
You can even get competitive over this?

713
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,280
That mosquito-catching bit

714
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,080
was really "dramatic."

715
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,160
He's the one

716
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,280
who's famous for being an extrovert.

717
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,360
Actually, he

718
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,160
isn't that much of an extrovert.

719
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,040
When he's alone,

720
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,720
yeah.

721
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,720
He is.

722
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,080
Are you an extrovert?

723
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,880
Wang Lechen, are you an extrovert

724
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,960
or an introvert?

725
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,600
I'm an introvert.

726
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,480
You're an introvert too.

727
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,240
So nervous

728
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,240
that the day before yesterday,

729
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,400
I kept picking at my cup.

730
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,240
He didn't even know who it was.

731
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,440
I knew it was you.

732
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,480
He's so

733
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,160
over the top.

734
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,200
He said he's

735
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,120
a native of Shengsi Island.

736
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,200
Really?

737
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,040
Yeah.

738
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,040
Yesterday, Jin Yuxing actually believed it for a moment.

739
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,320
Even I believed it.

740
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,000
Do you want to guess about him?

741
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,560
Where did he come from to Shanghai?

742
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,080
Where did he come from to Shanghai?

743
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,120
Take a wild guess.

744
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:52,920
Do you know?

745
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:54,840
You don't know either.

746
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,640
Sounds like somewhere in Zhejiang.

747
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,600
Any hints?

748
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,880
Or maybe say something in your dialect.

749
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,200
If I speak in my dialect, it'll be too obvious.

750
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,120
Way too obvious.

751
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:06,680
Yeah.

752
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,040
Just say something.

753
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,320
We've never heard you speak it.

754
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,160
Okay.

755
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,520
Our dialect is just...

756
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,480
Why are you like this?

757
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,360
See, when others talk, he doesn't want to say anything.

758
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:23,960
Yeah.

759
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,600
But as soon as Lanlan (Xu Rulan) says it, he's fine.

760
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,320
You can try guessing a direction first.

761
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,160
Sounds so familiar... wait a second.

762
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,880
Is it south of Zhejiang?

763
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,840
It's probably about the same latitude as Zhejiang.

764
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,720
Anhui

765
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,160
No

766
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,080
Wuhan

767
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,080
Changsha

768
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:01,680
No

769
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,920
I think he's a science student

770
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,640
No, I'm a liberal arts student

771
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,400
Are you really a liberal arts student?

772
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,240
Are you really a liberal arts student?

773
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,760
Got one point back

774
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,480
Turned it around

775
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,120
Sichuan

776
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,320
It must be that he didn't say it correctly

777
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,400
Mine

778
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,720
I didn't say it correctly, did I?

779
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,280
I'm shocked

780
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,440
It could be that

781
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,040
No, I'm not joking.

782
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,760
I think Xu Rulan

783
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,040
is a key figure.

784
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,280
Lanlan (Xu Rulan) and

785
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:47,960
Chenchen (Wang Lechen)

786
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,560
Both of them are probably in similar situations.

787
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,080
Yeah.

788
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,680
Each of them will be compared.

789
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,680
They'll get more attention.

790
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,600
The center of the vortex.

791
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,120
Right.

792
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,960
But I think there might be some overlap.

793
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,120
But I think there might be some overlap.

794
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,440
Maybe Lanlan (Xu Rulan) towards

795
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,360
Chenchen (Wang Lechen)

796
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,120
might also have something going on.

797
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,280
Vortex against vortex.

798
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,320
Vortex against vortex.

799
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,360
But why did Jiao Zhiheng

800
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,520
not sit next to Lanlan (Xu Rulan)?

801
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,360
I’ve always wondered about this.

802
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,640
He was led by Wang Lechen.

803
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,160
See?

804
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,240
Whatever.

805
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,440
Okay.

806
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,800
He would definitely sit over there.

807
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,000
Come on.

808
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,160
Let’s keep watching.

809
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,280
Duoduo (Ke Ailin)

810
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,240
Duoduo (Ke Ailin) is here.

811
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,800
Duoduo (Ke Ailin) has such a great personality.

812
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:48,960
Wang Lechen

813
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,800
Everyone, please stand up.

814
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,200
Hello.

815
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:51,960
Hello, baby.

816
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,760
Hello.

817
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:54,840
Feeling happy now.

818
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,320
She should sit next to Chenchen (Wang Lechen).

819
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,040
Sit down first.

820
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,560
Sit down first.

821
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,520
She's so cool.

822
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,600
Sit next to Chenchen (Wang Lechen).

823
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,760
Then I'll sit here.

824
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,160
Please sit.

825
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,000
Beautiful girl.

826
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,240
Wang Lechen and Duoduo (Ke Ailin)

827
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,680
Let me help you carry that.

828
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,360
Is it this one?

829
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,080
Hello.

830
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:33,560
Hello.

831
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,160
Hello.

832
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,960
Hello.

833
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,160
(What) part is this?

834
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,520
Three-minute self-introduction.

835
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:43,960
Okay, like this.

836
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,800
Then I'll go first.

837
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,400
Introduce.

838
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,280
Myself.

839
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,400
My full name is

840
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:50,960
Ke Ailin

841
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,400
It means "Dad loves Mom."

842
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,360
Her dad and mom.

843
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,400
I'm shipping them.

844
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,240
This way of naming

845
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,560
is a really good idea.

846
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,040
My surname doesn't work well for this.

847
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,120
If you use this kind of

848
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,120
"Dad loves Mom" name,

849
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:01,840
what would your name be?

850
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,560
No.

851
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,040
Pick a character from inside.

852
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:12,840
I like it.

853
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,520
The long one.

854
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:14,920
You like the long one.

855
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,520
Last night, we

856
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,080
practiced the "er" sound hard.

857
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,600
I thought about it after I got back.

858
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,320
If we want to make it sound more affectionate,

859
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,040
what should we call it?

860
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,040
Jue'er (Wang Jue)

861
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,120
Jue'er (Wang Jue)

862
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,320
Jue'er (Wang Jue)

863
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:29,880
She seems a bit

864
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,600
happy now.

865
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,320
She's happy.

866
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:31,840
Happy now.

867
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,520
It's a bit like that in Peking Opera,

868
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,320
the character.

869
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,200
The lead performer.

870
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,280
Yesterday,

871
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,160
we started saying

872
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,560
as soon as we woke up, we'd go find you.

873
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,960
We were even saying, when you got up,

874
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,840
why didn't you come find us?

875
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,560
We kept worrying

876
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,520
that maybe you

877
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,120
might be a little bored alone.

878
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,200
But she lost the "Ganmaoling" joke.

879
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,320
Look, when Duoduo (Ke Ailin) came, he

880
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,240
he felt better.

881
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,640
Now Wang Lechen is comfortable.

882
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:05,920
They don't know.

883
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,520
So did you tell her?

884
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,280
That joke from yesterday.

885
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,040
It's hard to explain.

886
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,640
A little.

887
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,040
A little secret only they know.

888
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,400
I can explain it to you in detail later.

889
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,200
Okay.

890
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:23,880
Here they come.

891
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,560
Who is here?

892
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,320
Jin Yuxing.

893
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,560
Hello.

894
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,120
Hello.

895
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,040
Hello.

896
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,840
Hello.

897
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,760
I stood up for you.

898
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,640
Just in time.

899
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,440
It's fate.

900
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,760
Long time no see.

901
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,080
Long time no see.

902
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,560
Long time no see.

903
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,040
Come on.

904
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,520
Pick your favorite seat and sit down.

905
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,640
In that case,

906
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,240
I'll sit over there then.

907
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,960
It really has been a long time.

908
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,160
Even though it's only been a day,

909
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,840
it feels like I haven't seen you all for a week.

910
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,600
I feel like we've grown distant.

911
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,240
How come you seem

912
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,120
so much taller all of a sudden?

913
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,360
Me?

914
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,120
Him.

915
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,800
Yeah, it feels like you and Wang Lechen both got a lot taller.

916
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:32,840
That's really interesting.

917
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,520
Opening remarks.

918
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,240
Still catching mosquitoes.

919
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:35,760
Still catching them.

920
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,560
Still catching mosquitoes.

921
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,240
Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng) is really funny.

922
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,280
You left too early this morning.

923
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,080
We originally wanted to visit.

924
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,720
You guys.

925
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,600
But you had already

926
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,840
left.

927
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,360
We were really disappointed.

928
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,560
Because we brought gifts.

929
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,040
Yeah.

930
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,000
I really didn't expect that

931
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,280
the boys would also

932
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,040
be switched out.

933
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,320
It's just that

934
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,480
it's a bit of a pity.

935
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,240
We didn't get to

936
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:11,880
say goodbye to you.

937
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:12,800
And then

938
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,400
we left first.

939
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,680
So did you later

940
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,560
catch a cold?

941
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,280
No.

942
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,520
Why do you think I would catch a cold?

943
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:22,720
It's nothing.

944
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,720
That's so funny.

945
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,480
He didn't get it at all.

946
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,720
What they're laughing at

947
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,240
is Ganmaoling.

948
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,400
He still doesn't know that was Yuanyuan (Lu Yuan).

949
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,720
who gave him Ganmaoling.

950
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:34,760
But they came yesterday.

951
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,880
Before they arrived

952
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,160
that place must have been peaceful.

953
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,280
There were only the sounds of seagulls

954
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,240
and the sound of the waves.

955
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,000
After they arrived,

956
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,080
yeah.

957
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,600
The first person I saw was

958
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,080
Xu Rulan.

959
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,680
She left a strong impression.

960
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,160
She was wearing that

961
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,200
yellow

962
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,080
pale yellow dress.

963
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,080
She was looking at the sea.

964
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,080
Right?

965
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,760
Yeah.

966
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,680
You still remember the color of my dress?

967
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:11,800
Because I thought

968
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,960
it looked really nice.

969
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,920
He made it really obvious.

970
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,200
That look in his eyes means something.

971
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:28,920
Just now, Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng)'s

972
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,720
look in his eyes

973
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,240
Are you trying to express that you miss someone?

974
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,960
I'm not the one who should be expressing that.

975
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,760
You know, after you left,

976
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,440
someone was really sad.

977
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,520
Finally, it's been said.

978
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,960
Please, hurry up and say it.

979
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,640
I'm getting so anxious here.

980
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,280
Yeah, I was wondering why

981
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,440
he didn't just say it sooner.

982
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,080
You know, after you left,

983
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,760
someone was really sad.

984
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,640
Is it okay to say this now?

985
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,560
Hurry.

986
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,280
"Cold Medicine Girl"

987
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,840
Show up quickly.

988
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,360
It's time to show up.

989
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,840
Lu Yuan

990
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,240
She brought cold medicine.

991
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:20,920
Yes.

992
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,200
She brought cold medicine.

993
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,400
Hello, everyone.

994
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,200
Speak of the devil.

995
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,400
"Cold Medicine Girl"

996
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,160
is online.

997
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:35,560
She's here.

998
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,440
Hello, Yuan'er (Lu Yuan).

999
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,440
Hello.

1000
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,960
Hello.

1001
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,080
Hello.

1002
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,000
Hi, where should I sit?

1003
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,960
Please choose.

1004
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,560
She should sit directly across from Jin Yuxing.

1005
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,680
I'll sit here.

1006
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,480
Is that okay?

1007
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,840
She picked the right seat.

1008
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,480
When we first saw Jin Yuxing,

1009
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,520
the first thing both of us

1010
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,640
said was

1011
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,920
Long time no see.

1012
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,680
Long time no see.

1013
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,800
Long time no see.

1014
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,840
Long time no see.

1015
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,680
This phrase of his

1016
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,000
has many meanings.

1017
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,800
Can I pour myself a glass of water?

1018
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:20,960
Thank you.

1019
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,680
It's okay, you can put it down.

1020
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,200
I'll do it.

1021
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:34,880
Pour some first.

1022
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,360
Okay.

1023
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,840
May I ask your name?

1024
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,080
My name is Jiao Zhiheng.

1025
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,400
Zhiheng is a bit hard to remember.

1026
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,680
You can just call me Xiao Jiao for now.

1027
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,600
Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng), okay.

1028
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,200
My name is Lu Yuan.

1029
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,200
You can call me Xiao Yuan.

1030
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,320
Lu Yuan.

1031
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:49,840
Yes.

1032
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,520
What did you do on the island yesterday?

1033
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,560
That's a rather

1034
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,040
important question.

1035
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,840
On the island, we

1036
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,840
rode electric scooters,

1037
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,200
chased the wind,

1038
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,560
and chased the sunset.

1039
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,760
You watched the sunset too?

1040
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,880
Yes, that sunset

1041
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,400
was beautiful.

1042
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,200
Yes, we went to see it yesterday too.

1043
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,280
Because yesterday

1044
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:11,960
the weather was great.

1045
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,560
Yes, the weather was great.

1046
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:12,880
Yeah.

1047
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,080
The one we saw from the guy,

1048
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,040
is the (test result) label.

1049
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,400
It's on all of them.

1050
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,480
Market philosopher.

1051
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,240
Market philosopher.

1052
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:29,680
Yeah.

1053
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,520
So when you cook,

1054
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,960
it must be really delicious too.

1055
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,720
He has his specialties.

1056
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,240
He can cook beef.

1057
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,240
Cooking is also a plus.

1058
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,000
What's the dish you're best at?

1059
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,160
The one I make most often,

1060
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,040
for example,

1061
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:44,480
braised pork.

1062
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,200
Or

1063
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,360
wasabi giant river prawn.

1064
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,400
Giant river prawn.

1065
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,680
I really love eating giant river prawn.

1066
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,120
And things like cilantro beef.

1067
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,600
Just simple home-cooked dishes.

1068
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:54,880
Impressive.

1069
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,360
So impressive.

1070
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,720
He can cook beef.

1071
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,160
His beef is really delicious.

1072
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,720
Yeah, he can also cook shrimp.

1073
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,200
Braised pork.

1074
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:01,600
Yeah.

1075
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,480
He's really good at it.

1076
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,400
Yeah.

1077
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,040
Really good at it.

1078
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,800
Very impressive.

1079
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,720
Don't.

1080
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,720
Please, I'm begging you.

1081
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,080
Sorry.

1082
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,120
Sorry.

1083
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,080
That reaction is really cute.

1084
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,280
Xu Rulan should be able to do it too.

1085
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:20,960
Really?

1086
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,080
Why did you suddenly mention me?

1087
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,880
I can do it.

1088
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,800
So silly.

1089
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:34,760
When the time comes, please help me out.

1090
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,560
What if I mess up?

1091
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:36,080
No problem.

1092
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:36,480
Help me out.

1093
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,440
I'll assist you.

1094
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,160
Help me out.

1095
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,520
I'll do my best.

1096
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,520
I'll make it for everyone.

1097
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:56,920
Ours.

1098
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,200
Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong)

1099
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,160
Um...

1100
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:00,880
Spicy food tolerance

1101
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,880
improvement plan

1102
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:02,720
Right?

1103
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,520
Right.

1104
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,280
Teacher Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong)

1105
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,080
I'll add more numbing and spicy flavors for you.

1106
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,880
Spicy food training class

1107
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,080
Yes, spicy food training class.

1108
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,240
I'll add more spice for you too.

1109
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:18,840
It's okay.

1110
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,200
Rice mixed with chili peppers

1111
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,480
Such a "vicious" dish.

1112
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,040
Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong)

1113
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,080
Really so "I" (introverted personality)

1114
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,440
You really shouldn't let

1115
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:29,800
"E" people (extroverted personality)

1116
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,920
treat you like a "toy."

1117
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,040
Actually, it's not that bad.

1118
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,040
If they can treat me like a "toy,"

1119
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:34,960
I would still be

1120
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,680
pretty happy about it.

1121
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,280
Pretty happy.

1122
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,120
Here

1123
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,080
Who here is most likely to treat him like a "toy"?

1124
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:48,640
What do you think?

1125
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,280
Who?

1126
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,040
Then I think it might be Xu Rulan.

1127
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,280
Oh no.

1128
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,320
This comment from Xing-ge (Jin Yuxing)

1129
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:01,960
really made Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng)

1130
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,360
probably feel a bit "blown up."

1131
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,920
He dug this hole himself.

1132
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,720
And then jumped right in.

1133
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,080
It's her.

1134
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,520
She's the most extroverted.

1135
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,200
I think both of them are very

1136
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,120
evenly matched.

1137
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,280
That sentence has multiple meanings.

1138
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:41,720
I hear something.

1139
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:42,440
Who's here?

1140
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:49,680
Wang Yifan.

1141
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,480
Wang Yifan.

1142
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:57,920
Hello.

1143
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,040
Hello.

1144
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,800
Hello.

1145
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,280
Hello.

1146
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,840
We meet again.

1147
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,000
Yes.

1148
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:07,800
Look.

1149
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:08,360
Where should I sit?

1150
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:09,400
I'll just

1151
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,000
sit nearby.

1152
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:10,560
Okay.

1153
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,120
Wang Yifan sat down

1154
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,600
next to Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong)

1155
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,240
She seemed casual about it

1156
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,240
but actually it was

1157
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,400
a deliberate choice

1158
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,560
I think what you said makes sense

1159
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:25,680
Your sudden approval

1160
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,120
made me doubt myself again

1161
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,720
I feel like I've already been

1162
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:31,680
treated as a "toy" by Xiao Ma

1163
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,440
Hello

1164
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:42,960
My name is Wang Jue

1165
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,520
We met that one time on the boat

1166
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,320
That's right

1167
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,200
You two

1168
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:48,720
And then we

1169
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,400
Yes

1170
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,520
waved to each other from different boats

1171
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:51,120
Yes

1172
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,560
How are you so beautiful

1173
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,120
So the last one is

1174
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,320
the guy I haven't met

1175
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,560
Wait a second

1176
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,400
Are you sure

1177
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,240
This is the

1178
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,280
guy you said you haven't met

1179
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,000
You all

1180
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,080
have met before?

1181
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,440
We greeted each other on the boat.

1182
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,360
We said hello on the boat.

1183
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:41,720
Hello.

1184
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,120
Yes.

1185
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,440
Hello.

1186
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,720
Hello.

1187
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,720
My name is Jin Yuhang.

1188
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:50,640
"Jin" as in "gold".

1189
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:51,680
"Yu" as in "Yu the Great".

1190
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,560
"Hang" as in "industry".

1191
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,000
Wang Yifan.

1192
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:54,880
And "Yi" is

1193
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,760
"Yi" as in "art".

1194
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:56,960
"Fan" is

1195
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,400
like in "smooth sailing".

1196
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,120
"Fan" as in "sailboat".

1197
00:47:59,120 --> 00:47:59,600
Right.

1198
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,000
So isn't that

1199
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:07,960
just missing

1200
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:08,600
Ruilong.

1201
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:11,920
You saw Ruilong, right?

1202
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,320
I saw him.

1203
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:14,720
What did you think?

1204
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,480
My impression is

1205
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:21,960
I'm just waiting for Ruilong

1206
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,000
to make a grand entrance.

1207
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:28,680
Ruilong.

1208
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,040
I want to see him.

1209
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,440
You seem really interested in Ruilong.

1210
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,240
Because

1211
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,120
he described

1212
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:37,560
He said

1213
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:38,480
when he (Fang Yijiong) saw Ruilong,

1214
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,160
he was really impressed.

1215
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,120
Superior jawline

1216
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,560
He really is so handsome

1217
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:56,960
Okay

1218
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,520
Looking forward to it

1219
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,640
He really looks good

1220
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,640
He really is handsome

1221
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:06,640
Here he comes

1222
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,480
Hello, everyone

1223
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:11,760
Hello

1224
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,640
Hello

1225
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,760
Come, pick a seat

1226
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,880
Have a seat

1227
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,200
Everyone is so beautiful

1228
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,240
He is really cute

1229
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:04,880
Long time no see

1230
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,920
Shengsi, I really miss you

1231
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,000
A pun

1232
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,000
Their code words

1233
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,120
Miss Shengsi

1234
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:18,480
That's the island, right?

1235
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:18,960
Shengsi Island, right

1236
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:19,560
Right

1237
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:20,360
Long time no see

1238
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,200
Miss Shengsi

1239
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:21,600
Right

1240
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,120
Ruìlóng, do you want to go first?

1241
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:24,840
Introduce yourself

1242
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,400
Sure, my name is

1243
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,040
Ruìlóng

1244
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:41,320
Hello, Ruilong.

1245
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:43,600
So cute.

1246
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,880
We've been waiting for you for so long.

1247
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:49,760
Sorry.

1248
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,440
I'm late.

1249
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,120
A bit late.

1250
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,400
The journey was exhausting.

1251
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,280
Just got off the plane.

1252
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,080
Just got off the plane.

1253
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,480
From

1254
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,800
Pudong Airport.

1255
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:00,600
That distance.

1256
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,560
So Ruilong is

1257
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:06,600
What kind of mixed heritage?

1258
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,080
Swiss.

1259
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,080
So you can speak

1260
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:13,480
German,

1261
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:14,360
English,

1262
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:17,920
German, English,

1263
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:18,880
French,

1264
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:19,760
Chinese,

1265
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,400
and then

1266
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,680
Swiss dialects.

1267
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,040
He's so talented.

1268
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,720
The Swiss dialect is

1269
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,080
Swiss German.

1270
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:29,520
Swiss German.

1271
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,160
So impressive.

1272
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:33,360
He's really amazing.

1273
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,760
He can even understand

1274
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,160
some Cantonese.

1275
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:41,200
A bit of Cantonese.

1276
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:42,920
A bit of Spanish.

1277
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,040
A language genius.

1278
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,440
He found the secret to languages.

1279
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:49,920
You know?

1280
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:50,600
People like him

1281
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:51,680
are so impressive.

1282
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,200
I'm from Shanghai.

1283
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,720
I studied German in college.

1284
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:06,920
That's impressive.

1285
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:08,880
I'm glad.

1286
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,040
Nice to meet you.

1287
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:11,800
Yes.

1288
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,080
Why don't you start a class?

1289
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:14,600
Just one month.

1290
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,560
Let's see how much you can learn.

1291
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:16,280
It's up to you.

1292
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:19,960
It's up to Ruilong.

1293
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,040
Half an hour every night.

1294
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,000
Take notes in a small notebook.

1295
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:38,000
Did you notice there are two more seats?

1296
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,400
Who are they for?

1297
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,800
Are there really going to be more people?

1298
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,200
I think they might be newcomers.

1299
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,520
I'm sure there will be.

1300
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:54,920
I think I heard a phone.

1301
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:57,680
I don't think so.

1302
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,640
Who got a message?

1303
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,120
Only one person got it.

1304
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,360
He has a message.

1305
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,400
Jin Yuxing got it.

1306
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,280
The exciting part is about to start.

1307
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,360
I'm so nervous.

1308
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,120
Show up already.

1309
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,240
So soon?

1310
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,000
Looking forward to it.

1311
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,000
This outfit isn't easy to pull off.

1312
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,400
She gives off a bit of a big sister vibe.

1313
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,720
This should be that mature, dominant style.

1314
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,600
Her legs are pretty long.

1315
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,560
The new arrival checked in advance

1316
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:50,160
the results of the travel edition love personality test.

1317
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,160
She will choose one

1318
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,360
member of the opposite sex she wants to get close to.

1319
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,080
member of the opposite sex she wants to get close to.

1320
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:57,360
and sit next to him.

1321
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,120
Devoted lover

1322
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:00,400
Friendly lover

1323
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,320
Possessive lover

1324
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,880
I would choose this one.

1325
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:12,960
She picked Jin Yuxing.

1326
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,360
I think I got a message

1327
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:20,600
saying a mysterious guest is coming.

1328
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,720
Jin Yuxing is quite popular.

1329
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,200
Really?

1330
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,680
Yeah.

1331
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,840
Jin Yuxing needs to make sure

1332
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:30,880
there's an empty seat next to him.

1333
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,440
That means a girl is coming.

1334
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:35,560
A girl?

1335
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,080
Yeah.

1336
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:41,920
He's really in demand.

1337
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:44,360
Yuan Yuan (Lu Yuan) really is something.

1338
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,720
One wave hasn't settled before another starts.

1339
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,000
Just moved to that island,

1340
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,360
and now a newcomer is arriving.

1341
00:54:58,560 --> 00:54:59,320
They're here.

1342
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:03,600
I hear something.

1343
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:08,600
I'm so nervous.

1344
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,600
Purple is really popular this year.

1345
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:11,000
Yeah.

1346
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:12,640
It'll definitely work.

1347
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Hello, everyone.

1348
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:16,920
Hello.

1349
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,960
Hi.

1350
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,040
Hello.

1351
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,520
Hi, everyone.

1352
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:38,880
Hello.

1353
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,200
Let me introduce myself first.

1354
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:42,640
Why don't we sit down first?

1355
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,320
Okay.

1356
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,000
Seats.

1357
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:46,480
What should I do?

1358
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:49,640
Jin Yuxing.

1359
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,800
There's an empty seat here.

1360
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,320
I'll sit over here.

1361
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,360
She wants to sit next to Jin Yuxing.

1362
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,200
Yeah.

1363
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:02,480
Go ahead and sit.

1364
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,120
She seems very generous.

1365
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,800
My name is Sun Hanqing.

1366
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:13,440
The "Han" from "cultivation."

1367
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,160
The "Qing" from "clear water."

1368
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,800
You can all call me Chichi.

1369
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:16,440
Chichi (Sun Hanqing)

1370
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:16,920
Yes.

1371
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,360
Because I really love to eat.

1372
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,480
Chichi (Sun Hanqing)

1373
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:21,640
Yes, it's easy to remember.

1374
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:22,720
You can call me Chichi.

1375
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:23,720
Chichi (Sun Hanqing)

1376
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:24,520
Chichi (Sun Hanqing)

1377
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:27,800
It's because of work.

1378
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,480
That's why I can meet everyone today.

1379
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,320
I'm very happy to see you all.

1380
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,400
She loves to laugh.

1381
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,200
Thank you.

1382
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,720
My name is Jin Yuxing.

1383
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:40,520
"Jin" as in "gold."

1384
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:41,880
"Yu" as in "Yu the Great who controlled the floods."

1385
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:42,880
"Xing" as in "industry."

1386
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:46,880
You can use the pronunciation from "astronaut" (yuhangyuan)

1387
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:47,960
Use the "yuhang" pronunciation

1388
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:48,800
to remember my name.

1389
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:49,520
Yuhang.

1390
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,560
You can also call me Yuxing, yes.

1391
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,560
Sure, that's easy to remember.

1392
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:56,600
That's easy to remember.

1393
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,240
He seems very cheerful.

1394
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:10,520
Is that guy mixed-race?

1395
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,120
Is that guy mixed-race?

1396
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:16,120
Yes.

1397
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:16,760
Yes.

1398
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:18,320
That's right.

1399
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,560
You can guess where he's from.

1400
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,680
His name is Ruilong.

1401
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:33,800
Sweden.

1402
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:35,640
Close.

1403
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:36,360
Switzerland.

1404
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,000
Right.

1405
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,280
What?

1406
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,000
Guessing where you're from.

1407
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:41,920
That's too far off.

1408
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,040
I already guessed it right.

1409
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,760
Guessed Switzerland correctly.

1410
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,000
Got it right on the first try.

1411
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:48,200
Yes.

1412
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:49,640
No.

1413
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:50,640
Second try.

1414
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:51,920
Impressive.

1415
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:53,880
Don't say it.

1416
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,120
We've gotten closer.

1417
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,200
There’s a bit of a spark between the two of them.

1418
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,880
I guess you’re an extrovert.

1419
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:09,440
Me?

1420
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:10,320
I am indeed an extrovert.

1421
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,440
But my extrovert score

1422
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,680
isn’t very high.

1423
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,080
Now everyone is

1424
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:17,760
Everyone’s an extrovert.

1425
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,480
All the girls are extroverts.

1426
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,160
Then I might be

1427
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:22,400
the least extroverted one.

1428
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,080
Are you from Hangzhou or Shanghai?

1429
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,160
You can guess.

1430
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,040
Shanghai.

1431
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,360
Yes, that’s right.

1432
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:35,440
Besides Shanghai and Hangzhou, are there any others?

1433
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,080
Yes, I’m from Yiwu.

1434
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:38,720
Yiwu.

1435
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:40,160
Yiwu, Zhejiang.

1436
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,320
So are you

1437
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,160
a Shanghai native or just working in Shanghai?

1438
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:49,920
I’m from Jiangxi.

1439
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,480
I can really handle spicy food.

1440
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:53,600
Yes.

1441
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,600
I also love spicy food.

1442
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,240
I can eat spicy food too.

1443
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,480
Yeah, I can handle spicy food as well.

1444
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,080
His expression.

1445
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,040
Lu Yuan doesn't look very well.

1446
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:16,080
What have you all been up to these past few days?

1447
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:19,920
We went to a small island to have fun.

1448
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,160
We split up and went to two different islands.

1449
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:23,640
You went on a trip?

1450
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:26,440
Yes.

1451
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:27,600
Chichi (Sun Hanqing): That's right.

1452
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:28,680
Only I was working.

1453
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:29,920
You all went traveling.

1454
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:32,160
We have to go back to work tomorrow too.

1455
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:33,760
Yeah, same here.

1456
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:34,960
We just went to two islands.

1457
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,280
One was Shengsi Main Island.

1458
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:37,320
The other was Huaniao Island.

1459
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,120
Was it fun?

1460
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:42,280
It was fun.

1461
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:43,880
I'm jealous.

1462
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,640
At that time, we went to two islands.

1463
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:50,960
Five people were on Huaniao Island.

1464
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,640
And five people were on Shengsi (main) Island.

1465
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,280
Then, on the second day,

1466
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:55,640
Jin Yuxing felt a sense of responsibility.

1467
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,720
He thought the girl chose him.

1468
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:58,920
So he felt it was necessary to

1469
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,520
introduce many things to her.

1470
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:03,760
At that moment, I saw Jin Yuxing's thoughtfulness.

1471
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:04,480
Because I think

1472
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,720
usually, if you just

1473
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,640
arrive last and there are many people,

1474
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:09,360
actually, at that time,

1475
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:12,520
whoever shows you care and warmth

1476
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:13,520
will make you feel the most

1477
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,000
Yes.

1478
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,240
impressed.

1479
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:16,600
I think first impressions are very important.

1480
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:17,640
With so many people,

1481
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,640
how can you make the person you like

1482
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,120
or the person you're interested in notice you?

1483
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,320
So, in this case,

1484
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,720
he clearly made good use of this advantage.

1485
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,920
He managed to leave an impression on others.

1486
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,120
At that time, we went to two islands.

1487
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,440
Five people were on Huaniao Island.

1488
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,120
And five people were on Shengsi (main) Island.

1489
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,960
What did you do?

1490
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,440
It was me and

1491
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:40,720
Xiaoyuan (Lu Yuan) who went to the lighthouse to watch the sunset.

1492
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:41,520
Like that.

1493
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,240
It must have been beautiful.

1494
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:47,960
Let me show you the photos.

1495
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:50,240
Hurry, show her.

1496
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,640
Yes, this is the lighthouse.

1497
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,080
It's from Chinese National Geography.

1498
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,360
This one looks great.

1499
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,320
And we also saw

1500
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:59,440
the sunset.

1501
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:00,800
This is really beautiful.

1502
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,040
The photo is really well taken.

1503
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:04,360
Yes, it's very nice.

1504
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,720
Actually, it was like

1505
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:13,480
we took a short trip.

1506
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:14,080
And then

1507
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:14,840
during this process,

1508
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:15,960
we could get to know each other better.

1509
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:16,760
Like that.

1510
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,680
But we still don't know each other very deeply.

1511
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,280
So next,

1512
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:22,560
I think there is still more

1513
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:23,880
we can share.

1514
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:27,080
I think it's fine.

1515
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:28,760
Actually, I wasn't that late either.

1516
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:30,240
Yeah.

1517
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:31,600
But I think

1518
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:32,840
it was worth it.

1519
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:34,960
Yesterday, we waited for you.

1520
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,200
They waited for them.

1521
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:36,840
And today, we

1522
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:38,880
waited for Chichi (Sun Hanqing).

1523
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:41,320
Welcome.

1524
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:46,960
I think Chichi (Sun Hanqing)'s

1525
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,240
whole approach

1526
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:49,720
shows she's a very smart girl.

1527
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,160
Because there's a detail about her,

1528
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,080
when it came to Ruilong,

1529
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:54,600
she told Ruilong,

1530
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,240
"I guessed it right on my first try."

1531
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:57,960
Then, next to Jin Yuxing, she said,

1532
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:58,880
"Don't say anything."

1533
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,080
With the very first question she asked,

1534
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,400
she quickly

1535
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:03,600
created something between her and Jin Yuxing,

1536
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:04,200
she created

1537
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,640
a little secret only they knew.

1538
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:07,400
By doing this,

1539
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,240
I think she wasn't being offensive,

1540
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:11,720
and at the same time, she gave off

1541
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:13,040
a sense of interest

1542
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,720
and a signal that she wanted to get to know him better.

1543
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:17,920
And actually, just now

1544
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:18,920
during this process,

1545
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:20,000
we've heard countless times

1546
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:20,360
about

1547
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:20,840
E-types (extroverted personalities)

1548
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:21,480
and I-types (introverted personalities).

1549
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,360
This topic

1550
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:24,000
was already discussed

1551
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:24,760
with Hani in the pilot episode,

1552
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:25,480
and also with you.

1553
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:27,520
You both

1554
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:28,320
prefer

1555
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:29,320
I-types (introverted personalities).

1556
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,560
I like it when he's colder outside,

1557
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:32,560
just quiet.

1558
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,200
And then at home, the two of us can

1559
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:35,920
I like that special preference,

1560
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:38,160
a kind of treatment that's different from others,

1561
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,120
just for you.

1562
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:40,120
It's a kind of pattern,

1563
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:41,320
wanting that special feeling,

1564
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:43,240
wanting to be the special one for him,

1565
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:44,360
to be treated differently.

1566
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:44,880
Introverted on the outside,

1567
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:45,760
extroverted on the inside.

1568
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:46,640
Right.

1569
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:47,360
But my E (extroverted personality)

1570
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:48,640
means he doesn't have to be that way at home.

1571
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:49,640
He doesn't need to show his extroverted side.

1572
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:51,920
He can just be himself.

1573
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,440
But I want a strong response.

1574
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,120
I don't want a lukewarm response.

1575
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,480
I think I tend to like people who are the opposite of me.

1576
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,000
Because I'm already very introverted.

1577
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,560
And if the other person is also introverted,

1578
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:04,920
Yeah, that's what I mean too.

1579
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,600
Yeah, that's what I mean too.

1580
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:08,280
I'm someone

1581
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:09,360
who tends to get lost in my own

1582
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:10,480
emotions.

1583
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,880
So I hope the person by my side

1584
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:13,840
can help me

1585
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:15,160
feel stronger

1586
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,040
or more motivated.

1587
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:17,240
So

1588
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:18,360
if they're a bit more extroverted than me,

1589
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,240
it might feel more comfortable being together.

1590
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,240
Sometimes I just feel like

1591
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:24,600
their kind of energy

1592
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:25,920
makes me feel recharged.

1593
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,080
Because I usually feel like I don't have enough energy.

1594
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,080
So I really need that

1595
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:30,040
energy to lift me up.

1596
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,120
Actually, I think I can also become

1597
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:32,960
quite outgoing

1598
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:33,640
like that.

1599
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:34,360
And the energy of extroverted people

1600
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:34,920
that kind of energy

1601
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:37,240
is like sunbathing during the day,

1602
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:39,320
it can make your whole energy

1603
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:41,840
feel comfortable from the inside out.

1604
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:43,280
But it can't be

1605
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:44,280
too extroverted.

1606
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:45,960
If they're too extroverted,

1607
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:47,200
I will

1608
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,920
end up completely exhausted.

1609
01:03:58,640 --> 01:03:58,920
Okay.

1610
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:01,200
Everyone has prepared gifts in advance.

1611
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,840
Please decide the order of drawing lots yourselves.

1612
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:04,520
And

1613
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:06,440
announce who prepared the gift you draw.

1614
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:07,760
Announce who prepared the gift you draw.

1615
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:09,520
Looking forward to it.

1616
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,680
For more exciting content, please check the extended version.

1617
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:13,760
Let the newcomer pick first.

1618
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,880
Then I won't be polite.

1619
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:17,080
I'll go first.

1620
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,000
I'll go first.

1621
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:25,880
I picked the biggest one.

1622
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:27,160
I'll choose this one.

1623
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:29,640
Okay, take a guess.

1624
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:36,000
Guess.

1625
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:40,960
Guess.

1626
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:43,240
How did you know?

1627
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:44,720
I gave it.

1628
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,800
This jasmine green tea is really tasty.

1629
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,440
My jasmine honey tea is also delicious.

1630
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,480
This Master Kong jasmine honey tea

1631
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,720
has the perfect blend of jasmine and tea aroma.

1632
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:01,040
They're blended just right.

1633
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:02,960
Mine also has a rich jasmine fragrance.

1634
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,080
If you savor it, there's a sweet aftertaste.

1635
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:07,920
Time to eat!

1636
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:20,760
Delicious.

1637
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,800
This table is really too long.

1638
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:27,200
Let me share these with everyone.

1639
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,560
I'll use this as a serving spoon.

1640
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:30,480
Here you go, Duoduo (Ke Ailin).

1641
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:31,120
Thank you.

1642
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:32,200
Is it okay if I put this here for you?

1643
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,800
Do you eat beef, Xiaoyuan (Lu Yuan)?

1644
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:38,800
Do you eat this?

1645
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:40,200
Yes, thank you.

1646
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:41,000
You're welcome.

1647
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:42,960
Do you want to try this?

1648
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:44,040
Thank you.

1649
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:46,080
We've all taken some.

1650
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:55,280
Thank you.

1651
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:56,720
So busy.

1652
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,200
Butler.

1653
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:01,280
Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng) is actually very thoughtful.

1654
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:03,920
I'll serve you first.

1655
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:04,720
Plate.

1656
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:05,520
Thank you.

1657
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:10,360
Thank you.

1658
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:12,960
Then this piece.

1659
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,120
Should I just put it here?

1660
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,320
Let's see who can eat faster.

1661
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,000
You lost.

1662
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,240
A man's competitive spirit.

1663
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:30,280
You two, see who finishes chewing first.

1664
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,120
Whoever swallows first wins.

1665
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:36,760
I've already swallowed.

1666
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:38,840
What?

1667
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:40,200
Is it that hard, bro?

1668
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:42,520
Bro.

1669
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:52,520
Look.

1670
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,840
Put the little flower in that collar.

1671
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:57,520
A little thoughtfulness.

1672
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:58,480
Very romantic.

1673
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:13,640
The lid isn't open.

1674
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:15,000
This is a new suit.

1675
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:15,880
The pink is so delicate.

1676
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,080
It looks like a group of groomsmen and a bride.

1677
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:30,160
Excuse me.

1678
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,080
Let me serve everyone.

1679
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,680
Special blend of Master Kong Jasmine Tea.

1680
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,040
This looks so pretty.

1681
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:42,880
Yeah, this special blend looks delicious.

1682
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,120
Can I have the orange one?

1683
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:49,320
Do you want to swap with me?

1684
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:50,280
Sure.

1685
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:51,560
Thank you.

1686
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:53,600
Thanks.

1687
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:58,320
What's the one in the middle?

1688
01:07:58,320 --> 01:07:58,880
Is it loquat?

1689
01:07:58,880 --> 01:07:59,720
Loquat.

1690
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:00,600
Lemon.

1691
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:01,120
Jasmine.

1692
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:02,600
Come on, everyone.

1693
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:03,360
Happy New Year.

1694
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,480
Happy New Year.

1695
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,200
Wishing us happiness every day.

1696
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:07,840
Happy.

1697
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:08,520
Cheers.

1698
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:11,200
Alright.

1699
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:14,800
The cucumber one is so refreshing.

1700
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:15,640
It's really good.

1701
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:17,560
It's not that cloying kind of sweetness.

1702
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:18,520
It's light.

1703
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,000
This one is also very refreshing.

1704
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,040
Slightly sweet.

1705
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:23,000
We want some too.

1706
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,360
Master Kong Jasmine Tea special blend.

1707
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:28,000
Really, there really are.

1708
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:29,400
Two identical versions.

1709
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:31,320
Can I have both of them?

1710
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,320
I'm being a bit greedy.

1711
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:33,040
Okay.

1712
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,320
For all of us Cupids,

1713
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:35,640
we've prepared the same special drinks.

1714
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:38,000
Our Master Kong Jasmine Tea

1715
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,920
lets us experience

1716
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,120
the party atmosphere from afar.

1717
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:43,640
You really are greedy.

1718
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:47,640
My drink is called "Mo Mo's Heartfelt."

1719
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:50,960
You can taste the Master Kong Jasmine Honey Tea's

1720
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,800
rich jasmine fragrance.

1721
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:54,960
Mine is "Mo Ming's Heartbeat."

1722
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,960
In the fragrant, low-sugar jasmine tea,

1723
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:58,480
there's refreshing loquat added.

1724
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:00,160
It really tastes great.

1725
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:01,080
Delicious.

1726
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:01,840
Let's keep watching.

1727
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:03,120
Cheers!

1728
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:07,960
This is mine.

1729
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:11,760
There's a card.

1730
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,680
Can I look at this?

1731
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:16,360
Can I look at this?

1732
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:19,160
There's writing underneath.

1733
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:25,360
Whoever gets someone's gift

1734
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:28,040
has to answer the question in their hand.

1735
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:31,760
I think this is the most exciting part every time.

1736
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:34,320
Then I'll ask you.

1737
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:40,360
How do you feel about

1738
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:42,480
your journey of finding love so far?

1739
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:43,480
Are you satisfied with it?

1740
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:44,200
Why?

1741
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,520
I'm definitely satisfied.

1742
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:50,440
Because I think

1743
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:51,880
no matter what,

1744
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:53,520
regardless of who I end up having feelings for,

1745
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:53,960
I feel

1746
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:55,080
at the very least, I've met

1747
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:56,160
a wonderful group of friends.

1748
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:10,080
And for me,

1749
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:16,280
if you had to prepare another gift,

1750
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:17,880
which member of the opposite sex would you give it to?

1751
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:18,640
Why?

1752
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:25,200
This

1753
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:26,520
is very obvious

1754
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:27,960
and straightforward.

1755
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,000
He looks like he changed color.

1756
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:33,760
He really is

1757
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:36,040
a "chameleon."

1758
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:37,600
You all thought he used a filter, right?

1759
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,840
He didn't use a filter.

1760
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:43,960
What should we do?

1761
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:45,720
He's so shy.

1762
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:50,760
His neck is all red.

1763
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:53,320
He turned red so quickly.

1764
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:53,960
"Little Red Dragon."

1765
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:56,680
Of course, it's for the same person.

1766
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:58,040
This is fate.

1767
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,560
Can you even answer like that?

1768
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
That's clever too.

1769
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,360
Very clever.

1770
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:07,680
The person who got my gift

1771
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:08,600
Xiaoyuan (Lu Yuan)

1772
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:12,480
May I ask, tonight

1773
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,800
will the person you have feelings for change?

1774
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:18,880
So exciting.

1775
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,200
So exciting.

1776
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:23,680
You're really going all out.

1777
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:28,680
Did you hear that clearly?

1778
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,000
Yes, I heard it clearly.

1779
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,360
She needs to answer carefully.

1780
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:40,120
No.

1781
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:42,720
No change, she hasn't changed.

1782
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:44,240
That's really brave.

1783
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:47,840
Still choosing that one.

1784
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:48,560
Jin Yuxing.

1785
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:48,960
Yes.

1786
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,240
Next.

1787
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:55,120
I'll do it.

1788
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:00,880
Please have the person who received your gift choose someone.

1789
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,640
Exchange seats with someone of the same gender.

1790
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:06,080
Right.

1791
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:09,800
I've been waiting for him all along.

1792
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:10,640
Are we switching seats?

1793
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:11,400
I just didn't feel that

1794
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:12,200
this thing would

1795
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:12,920
be this simple.

1796
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:14,200
Come on.

1797
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:15,520
Switch.

1798
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:22,120
Very straightforward.

1799
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:23,320
Very obvious.

1800
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:25,320
Exchange seats with someone of the same gender.

1801
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:26,480
Go ahead and switch.

1802
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:29,360
Will he switch with Fang Yijiong?

1803
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:30,480
It's possible.

1804
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,640
He'll probably still go to

1805
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:34,680
Lele (Wang Lechen)'s side.

1806
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:38,920
He might switch with Wang Lechen or Ruilong.

1807
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:44,960
You...

1808
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:46,560
You...

1809
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:47,800
Why is it the two of us...

1810
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:48,600
laughed?

1811
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:49,440
Then let's switch.

1812
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:52,480
Then let's switch.

1813
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:54,440
It's obvious he wants to

1814
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:56,960
sit next to Xu Rulan.

1815
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,080
Yes.

1816
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:06,280
Come.

1817
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:08,400
Butler, switch seats.

1818
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:10,800
Come on.

1819
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:31,160
Should I bring it over?

1820
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:41,880
This shot

1821
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:42,560
is a battlefield.

1822
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:59,240
In a moment, all of Wang Jue's

1823
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:00,040
You will see all of her

1824
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:01,680
body positions are like this.

1825
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,360
Feels like we're playing a murder mystery game.

1826
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:09,040
He's happy now.

1827
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:21,480
Afraid I'll see it, right?

1828
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:22,600
Did you see it?

1829
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:23,840
No.

1830
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,280
Look, it's already started.

1831
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:27,120
Is it happening?

1832
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:28,280
It's already started.

1833
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:33,760
Is it me?

1834
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,440
My question is,

1835
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:41,920
please describe, during the island trip,

1836
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:43,520
in those two days,

1837
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,360
the moment that moved you the most.

1838
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:46,520
Why?

1839
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:49,360
Answer properly.

1840
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:52,280
Why is my question so long?

1841
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,480
The most touching moment.

1842
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:57,080
That's a good question.

1843
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:00,960
Duoduo (Ke Ailin)

1844
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:05,800
Feels like three pairs of eyes are watching.

1845
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,360
It should be when we watched the sunset.

1846
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:19,000
Because I had been looking forward to the sunset for two days.

1847
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:19,880
I think unexpected encounters

1848
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:21,080
are truly the best arrangement.

1849
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:24,240
It's a bit vague, but

1850
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:26,040
I can answer like this now.

1851
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:27,960
Yes, he really was looking forward to the sunset.

1852
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:36,360
Then let me ask.

1853
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:38,440
I'm asking you.

1854
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:39,160
Yes, Lanlan (Xu Rulan).

1855
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:43,560
In the upcoming romantic journey,

1856
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:46,240
do you have any wishes you want to fulfill?

1857
01:15:57,160 --> 01:16:00,200
I think whether it's during this time

1858
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:02,760
or after the show ends,

1859
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:04,200
all of us can

1860
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,520
go on another trip together.

1861
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:06,440
Okay.

1862
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:08,480
That's very similar to our wish.

1863
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:09,560
I agree.

1864
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:21,880
During this romantic island trip,

1865
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:22,800
if you had to

1866
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,280
name one thing you regret,

1867
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:25,200
what would it be?

1868
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:28,520
Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong),

1869
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:29,400
the thing I regret is

1870
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:30,840
I was switched out.

1871
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:31,920
If he says that,

1872
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:32,760
then it must be Lanlan (Xu Rulan).

1873
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:34,520
Then I really

1874
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:35,800
That's impressive.

1875
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:42,160
Come on, say what's on your mind.

1876
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:44,600
I sent the (sunset time) message too slowly.

1877
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:48,320
That's pretty obvious.

1878
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:49,280
It's Lanlan (Xu Rulan).

1879
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:51,560
This one—

1880
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:52,960
His is especially obvious.

1881
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:55,920
He sent the (sunset time) message too slowly.

1882
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,800
So you didn't get a chance to see the sunset, right?

1883
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:02,640
Right.

1884
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:05,040
That's exciting.

1885
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:12,040
He drinks a toast by himself.

1886
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:22,880
What?

1887
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:25,000
I think

1888
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:25,720
the first person to send

1889
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:27,040
the (sunset time) message to someone of the opposite sex

1890
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:29,480
can invite the other person to join the activity.

1891
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:31,800
So did you already join the activity?

1892
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:33,760
Yes.

1893
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:36,360
Alright.

1894
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:37,880
Got it.

1895
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:44,280
I'm going to ask now.

1896
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:52,840
Please choose a member of the opposite sex.

1897
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:54,920
Ask her so far

1898
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,440
what her impression of you is.

1899
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:02,280
He’s going to blush soon too.

1900
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:09,480
Choose a member of the opposite sex.

1901
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,760
How should I choose?

1902
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:21,240
Then I’ll choose the person who asked the question.

1903
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:24,320
I’m going to blush (feel warm).

1904
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:26,760
They’re all so good at answering.

1905
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:27,960
But this is the safest choice.

1906
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:35,080
Because you don’t know much about me.

1907
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:37,280
It’s just a first impression.

1908
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:40,160
The first time we met was on the boat.

1909
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:42,160
It did feel a bit distant.

1910
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:45,280
At the time, I told Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong),

1911
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:46,600
I said I felt this guy

1912
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:48,600
was really strong.

1913
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:49,960
Strong.

1914
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:52,040
Back then, under the sunlight,

1915
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:53,280
because you guys were probably on the shady side,

1916
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:54,640
while we were on the sunny side.

1917
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:55,520
So I said at the time,

1918
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:56,160
I said,

1919
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:58,080
he seems a bit tanned.

1920
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:03,120
But now I think you look quite fair.

1921
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:10,160
But today, you seem very reserved.

1922
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:11,920
Because that day, you were actually

1923
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:13,120
the first one to wave.

1924
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:14,080
I thought you would be the type

1925
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:14,760
who’s very

1926
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:16,880
outgoing.

1927
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:20,080
Really?

1928
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:21,680
Really?

1929
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:23,400
Maybe.

1930
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:30,720
But this question

1931
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:32,160
there's only one person feeling lost here.

1932
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:32,840
That's Yuan Yuan (Lu Yuan).

1933
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:33,560
Right.

1934
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:34,680
When asking Jin Yuxing now,

1935
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:37,760
Jin Yuxing actually didn't really

1936
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:40,640
direct the question to someone he spent a whole day with.

1937
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:41,600
Someone he spent a long time with.

1938
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,680
He asked from a very neutral standpoint.

1939
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:45,480
But at this moment, being neutral

1940
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:47,840
is also his way of expressing himself.

1941
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:49,640
So Yuan Yuan (Lu Yuan) then

1942
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:50,920
feels an even bigger gap.

1943
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:52,880
But the two of them have always

1944
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,160
not really had the right connection.

1945
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:57,120
Yeah.

1946
01:19:58,040 --> 01:19:59,720
Is it my turn now?

1947
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:00,320
Yes.

1948
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:07,920
Please invite one person of the opposite sex and one of the same sex

1949
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:10,200
to describe their first impression of you.

1950
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:12,360
Okay.

1951
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:22,520
Then I'll invite

1952
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:24,080
you two.

1953
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:31,800
I think

1954
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:33,000
well,

1955
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:35,240
she's very easy to get along with

1956
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:38,000
and a very observant girl.

1957
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:41,480
I really have been observing everyone here.

1958
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:41,880
Yeah.

1959
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:48,000
Is it my turn?

1960
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:52,640
Because when you came in,

1961
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:54,480
the first thing you did was introduce yourself.

1962
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:55,960
I think

1963
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:57,360
you seemed pretty confident and natural.

1964
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:12,680
Can I answer

1965
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:13,760
my first question again?

1966
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:15,440
I just thought about it.

1967
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:18,600
Because when she answered,

1968
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:20,560
we hadn't heard Jin Yuxing's answer yet.

1969
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,920
May I ask if the person you're interested in tonight

1970
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:29,760
will change?

1971
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:36,400
Yes.

1972
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,160
She changed.

1973
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:40,320
That means it's not.

1974
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:41,600
Right, it's not Jin Yuxing.

1975
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:42,720
So that means

1976
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:44,120
it's Wang Lechen.

1977
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:44,680
Yes.

1978
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:47,440
She definitely did this because

1979
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:48,480
she heard Jin Yuxing's answer.

1980
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,320
She changed her mind on the spot.

1981
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:51,360
She said, "I regret it."

1982
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,760
"I don't want to make this decision anymore."

1983
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:53,680
This behavior

1984
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:55,920
is actually pretty bold.

1985
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:10,960
You go ahead.

1986
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:11,440
I'll do it.

1987
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:12,040
Okay.

1988
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:13,240
Mine is...

1989
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:16,560
You should answer this question.

1990
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:22,680
Up to now,

1991
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:24,920
has anyone of the opposite sex made your heart flutter?

1992
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:25,800
If so,

1993
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,600
please take a sip of

1994
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:28,960
"Mo Mo Qing Xin"

1995
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:30,720
or "Mo Ming Xin Dong" special drink in your hand.

1996
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:34,680
This is a really good question.

1997
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:35,720
You really know how to ask.

1998
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:37,560
Every one of these questions is great.

1999
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:53,960
She keeps staring at him (Wang Lechen).

2000
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:58,560
This is also very direct.

2001
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:23,320
Ask.
