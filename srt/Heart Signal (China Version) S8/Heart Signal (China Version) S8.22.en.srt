1
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,480
Let's go.

2
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,360
Here we come.

3
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,760
Back again.

4
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,600
Finally, this day has come.

5
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,000
So excited.

6
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,560
Someone was here before.

7
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,800
Who are all these people?

8
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,680
I thought that was Brother Jiao.

9
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,520
From a distance, it really looks like him.

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,920
Their face shapes are so similar.

11
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,960
And the hairstyle too.

12
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,400
No idea who it is today.

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,520
Joining us.

14
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,000
Yeah, who else is coming today?

15
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,600
Maybe there are more.

16
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,200
Not sure, let's wait and see.

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,600
Which good brother is coming?

18
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,600
I took this two days ago.

19
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,840
Secretly brought it back to my room.

20
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,960
Studied it all night.

21
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,760
Read every page.

22
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,600
Flipping through it.

23
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,640
Let's have a drink first.

24
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,000
Cheers.

25
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,080
Hello.

26
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,200
Hello.

27
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,520
Hello.

28
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,280
New friend.

29
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,120
Hello, new friend.

30
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,200
You're tall too.

31
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:33,920
Hello.

32
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,800
Hello.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,600
Hello, Brother Xue.

34
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,920
Hello, Brother Chen.

35
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,720
Take a seat.

36
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,400
Hello, Brother Sun.

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,920
Hello.

38
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,400
Please sit, I've poured you tea.

39
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,480
So thoughtful.

40
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,720
Too kind.

41
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,840
We're family.

42
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,200
Do you know why

43
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,880
the three of us came together today?

44
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,400
No idea.

45
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,000
Is it because we're handsome?

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That's one reason.

47
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,960
But mainly,

48
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,080
because this year isn't

49
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,240
our Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai season.

50
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,840
Is it back again?

51
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,080
Actually, the three of us are

52
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,280
from three years ago,

53
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:21,840
the "veterans".

54
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,800
The "veterans".

55
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,720
Representatives of the "Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai boy group".

56
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,240
Of course, we have to

57
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,040
give you a warm welcome.

58
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,160
Thank you.

59
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,680
This moment deserves applause.

60
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,360
Let's introduce ourselves.

61
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,320
Hello, everyone.

62
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,320
I'm from "Signal of the Heart".

63
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,560
Shanghai.

64
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,800
Shanghai.

65
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,720
Hello, I'm from

66
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,400
the eighth season of "Signal of the Heart", Liu Zihan.

67
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,840
I'm currently working in Shanghai.

68
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,480
Working.

69
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:47,840
Yes.

70
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,200
Alright.

71
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,480
I'm from the eighth season of "Signal of the Heart".

72
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,200
Wang Lechen from Hangzhou.

73
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,560
Hello, everyone.

74
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,440
I'm from "Signal of the Heart".

75
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,600
Season five, Sun Xing.

76
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,880
You can also call me Xiaopai.

77
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,720
Hello, everyone.

78
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,360
I'm from "Signal of the Heart".

79
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,600
Season five, Chen Zonglun.

80
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,840
I'm also from Shanghai.

81
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,480
Hello, everyone.

82
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,480
I'm from "Signal of the Heart".

83
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,200
Season five, Xue Zheyang.

84
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,360
Also from Shanghai.

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,280
Welcome to these two joining

86
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,520
our "Signal of the Heart family".

87
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,560
No, I'm still too nervous.

88
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,720
It's okay, just relax.

89
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,520
It's fine.

90
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,920
Looks like you're still a bit nervous.

91
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,600
Is it because we're about to

92
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
watch your heartwarming stories?

93
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:18,760
We're about to watch your heartwarming stories.

94
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,240
Back then, when we

95
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,240
watched for the first time,

96
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,920
we had a lot of expectations.

97
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,840
We were nervous too.

98
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,800
After all, that dating house was

99
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,280
something we personally experienced.

100
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,600
So you're just seeing it from a different perspective,

101
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,120
watching your life back then.

102
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,760
You can also see your friends,

103
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,600
the others,

104
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,600
what they're going through every day.

105
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,920
You'll find it really interesting.

106
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,200
I think it's quite fun.

107
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,720
Actually, I have a small question today

108
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,120
that I've always wanted to ask you two.

109
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,960
Okay.

110
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,000
What do you think

111
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,440
about your experience in the dating house?

112
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,800
It felt surreal.

113
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,920
Even now, it feels like the dream isn't over.

114
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,880
I probably feel the same as him.

115
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,920
Definitely felt anxious at first.

116
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,440
But gradually,

117
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,800
everyone was really nice to each other.

118
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,200
We all got familiar.

119
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,440
Got used to it.

120
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,840
Looks like the dating house left you

121
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,080
with many wonderful memories.

122
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,800
Yes.

123
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,560
Is your accent from the northeast?

124
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,040
No, I'm from Hebei.

125
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,320
Close enough, both have "bei" in the name.

126
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,080
It has that vibe.

127
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,120
So close, so beautiful.

128
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,760
So close, so beautiful.

129
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,880
Spend your weekend in Hebei.

130
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,280
Just hang up a banner.

131
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,960
This time, it's our

132
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,040
"Heart Signal Boys" team

133
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,720
first time joining "Watching Heart Signal with You"

134
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,440
so we can get to know each other quickly

135
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,720
let's start today's

136
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,320
mini game

137
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,320
Whoever loses the game

138
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,520
will get a punishment

139
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,520
The winner

140
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,120
will receive a mysterious surprise

141
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,440
So everyone, give it your all

142
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,120
and fully join the game

143
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,440
Okay

144
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,120
The name of this mini game

145
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,720
is "Forbidden Card Challenge"

146
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,800
In front of each guest

147
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,520
there is

148
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,880
a personal "Forbidden Card"

149
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,600
Attention

150
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,120
Don't let others see your card

151
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,200
During the first five minutes of the game

152
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,760
guests can chat freely

153
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,720
and share snacks

154
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,480
Stay alert during interactions

155
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,080
about what's written on your Forbidden Card

156
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,120
If someone triggers

157
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,640
the forbidden action on your card

158
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,240
they must immediately do the punishment

159
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,520
If no one triggers it

160
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,280
or the player with the fewest triggers

161
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,040
will get a "mysterious title"

162
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,280
and a surprise

163
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,760
Let's take a look first

164
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,680
This card

165
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,080
Can't let others see it, right?

166
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,960
Then I want to see yours

167
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,680
No

168
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,320
What?

169
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,400
Has it started already?

170
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,120
It's started

171
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,680
It's started

172
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,040
It's started

173
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,440
Has it started?

174
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:00,920
Is it tasty?

175
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,640
It's started

176
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:11,920
What flavor is it?

177
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,240
Can you close your mouth?

178
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,280
About your heart today

179
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,000
What just triggered it?

180
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,920
His giggling

181
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,480
What's your punishment?

182
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,120
Is it giggling?

183
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,880
What did you just do?

184
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,720
Stop talking

185
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:41,880
You

186
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,880
Sun Xing, sit down

187
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:50,920
Why are you standing up?

188
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,040
Why did you stand up?

189
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,760
Xiaopai, sit down

190
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,400
It's started

191
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,760
He means

192
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,520
What?

193
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,760
What?

194
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,760
Got it, understood?

195
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,120
Understood

196
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,840
You get it?

197
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,360
The weather is great

198
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,280
Let's get some exercise

199
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,960
Exercise

200
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,560
Are you done?

201
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,480
Sun Xing, sit down

202
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,520
Can you think of something else?

203
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,280
How about "visiting three parks"?

204
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,280
Today let's visit three parks

205
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,480
Today we only visit three parks

206
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,720
Which three parks are we visiting today?

207
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:49,960
About you guys today

208
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,000
Almost slapped me

209
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,400
Almost slapped me

210
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,360
Speak

211
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:09,880
Speak

212
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,280
Should I talk to you?

213
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,400
I can't eat anymore

214
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,000
You give it to him

215
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,200
Looks like he can't eat anymore

216
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,040
Why am I included?

217
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,080
Why am I included?

218
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,080
Why again?

219
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,200
What triggered it?

220
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,960
I think it's easy to guess

221
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,960
Guess what it is

222
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,040
Guess what it is

223
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,560
What exactly is it?

224
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,280
I want to laugh out loud

225
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,240
Probably laughed quite a few times

226
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,280
I've been voting just now

227
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:54,760
Was I voting just now?

228
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,960
Mine should be pretty easy to guess.

229
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,920
Silent and quiet.

230
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,920
He just stood up.

231
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,240
Yes.

232
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,360
Yes.

233
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:06,800
Right.

234
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:06,960
Right.

235
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,480
You are "you" and "me".

236
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,280
"You, me, him."

237
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:09,440
"You, me, him."

238
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,240
"You, me, him."

239
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,960
What are you?

240
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:14,880
Is it a question?

241
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,840
Is it a question?

242
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,720
So I don't eat.

243
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,480
Then he gets punished.

244
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,160
I think so.

245
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,640
You eat.

246
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,560
I don't eat.

247
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,520
Does he not get punished?

248
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,120
What's your punishment?

249
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,920
Why are you still eating?

250
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,720
I can't eat anymore.

251
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,040
I'm not talking to him anymore.

252
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,400
So what are you?

253
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,360
Feed the person closest to you.

254
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:42,520
For me, whenever someone speaks,

255
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,320
Whenever someone speaks,

256
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,040
If it's more than five words, I have to...

257
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,680
Does "hahahahaha" count?

258
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:46,960
It counts.

259
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,280
So if he giggles, I have to do it too.

260
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,520
What's your punishment?

261
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,320
Punishment is jumping and spinning around.

262
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,880
You spun too little just now.

263
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,800
You should've kept standing.

264
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,680
You should be.

265
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,280
My throat is hoarse from shouting.

266
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,600
Let's review this.

267
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,480
The person with the fewest punishments.

268
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,040
Who is it?

269
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,880
Who is it?

270
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,000
Who could it be?

271
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:06,920
Congratulations.

272
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,400
Let me congratulate myself.

273
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,880
Received the fewest punishments.

274
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,760
"Clear-headed among people."

275
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,120
That hand reached over.

276
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,760
Thank you.

277
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,160
Is there anything else?

278
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,040
What's inside?

279
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,440
Congratulations, in this round,

280
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,160
you came out on top.

281
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,480
You earned the title "Clear-headed Pit Avoider".

282
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,480
The winner gets the "Hero's Privilege".

283
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,480
You are awarded a "Love's Dispatch Order".

284
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,080
With this order in hand,

285
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,240
during this episode's recording,

286
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,880
you can command one person present

287
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,640
to accept a punishment.

288
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,560
The chosen guest

289
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,680
must help unconditionally.

290
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,520
No refusing or bargaining.

291
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,120
Once it's done,

292
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,000
the "Love's Dispatch Order" expires.

293
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,920
The guest holding this order

294
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,920
cannot use it again.

295
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,200
So I can

296
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,920
make one request.

297
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,800
But it doesn't say how many times.

298
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,080
But it doesn't say how many times.

299
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,080
You dug this pit for yourself.

300
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,120
You dug this pit for yourself.

301
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,360
I didn't hear anything.

302
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,440
I think Wang Lechen

303
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,680
has been sitting for a while, right?

304
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,280
Maybe needs to move a bit.

305
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,240
Do five push-ups to wake up.

306
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,560
One

307
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,440
Very standard.

308
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,080
Three, four, five.

309
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,800
Okay.

310
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,840
Let's make it harder.

311
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,360
Five is still too few.

312
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,440
You do fifty.

313
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,440
We can almost start.

314
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,520
Watching today's show.

315
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,320
It's about to start.

316
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,480
Who is it?

317
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:44,960
So handsome.

318
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,280
Such a stylish guy.

319
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:48,960
So stylish.

320
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,200
Super stylish, bro.

321
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,720
Authority.

322
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,560
Authority.

323
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,080
Dinner.

324
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,240
His solo dinner.

325
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,000
Just him.

326
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,480
His privilege dinner.

327
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,040
About this segment,

328
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,680
It's you.

329
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,840
It's me.

330
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,200
You were also a pair (or more).

331
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,120
I was alone at first too.

332
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,040
Facing five girls.

333
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,440
Do you want to?

334
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,000
Just sit in the middle.

335
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,040
It's easier to chat with everyone.

336
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:18,880
It's fine.

337
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,280
No problem.

338
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,480
Were you drenched in sweat?

339
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,280
Totally drenched.

340
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,480
Because I was told on the way here

341
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,160
Tonight there is

342
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,160
This kind of segment.

343
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,840
You thought that day was the first day.

344
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,280
Yeah.

345
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,640
And they said there was one at night.

346
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,520
A segment like this.

347
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,360
So I just

348
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,520
I thought it was pretty...

349
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,200
Yeah, I only found out that day too.

350
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,320
I thought when I entered

351
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,280
I'd greet everyone.

352
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:39,680
Same here.

353
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,760
But it was only girls.

354
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,120
Yeah.

355
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,400
Yeah.

356
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,080
He was really silent.

357
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,720
Yeah, I just didn't know what to do.

358
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,960
I was really anxious, you know?

359
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,960
Because I'm not good at

360
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,400
starting conversations.

361
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,960
My mind kept thinking

362
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,000
What should I say?

363
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,200
Let's start with this topic.

364
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,560
Where are you from?

365
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,360
Then say

366
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:54,880
The weather's nice.

367
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,960
It rained again today.

368
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,680
It's hot, really hot.

369
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:58,960
My brain started to freeze.

370
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,920
Think fast, dead brain.

371
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,280
Speak fast, dead mouth.

372
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,080
That white dress.

373
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,520
That eye contact.

374
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,360
Your hands were still in your pockets.

375
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,800
How did it feel?

376
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,680
Nervous.

377
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,280
So by then

378
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,280
I was already panicking.

379
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,160
My brain was starting to freeze.

380
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,640
What about later?

381
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,840
It got even worse later.

382
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,600
See?

383
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,840
No accent.

384
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,120
Look at your mouth.

385
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,480
You can't hold back your smile.

386
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,600
Handsome.

387
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,520
Handsome.

388
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,120
Sports company.

389
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:57,920
Sports student.

390
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,000
Sports student.

391
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,440
Nice, nice.

392
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,280
Used to work at a car company.

393
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,000
Yeah.

394
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,320
Getting to the point.

395
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,800
Feels like watching a mini date.

396
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,400
Pretty much.

397
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,520
You could call it a mini date.

398
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,360
Why even go to the dating house?

399
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,800
Why go to the dating house?

400
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,840
Back to Shanghai.

401
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,440
Thank you.

402
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,360
So gentlemanly.

403
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,680
This kind of quietly

404
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,160
having a little interaction with you is pretty

405
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,080
touching.

406
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,760
Take a look.

407
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,960
That's not really appropriate.

408
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,840
Check the tongue.

409
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,520
That's true.

410
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,480
Register for an appointment.

411
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,200
Why didn't you mention me?

412
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,000
You're also the giving type.

413
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,800
Looking down on me.

414
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,680
Can you cook?

415
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,960
I'm great at cooking.

416
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,840
He's really good at cooking.

417
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,240
I can't cook.

418
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,480
We're all good at cooking.

419
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,280
His mapo tofu is amazing.

420
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,960
So who loved cooking the most back then?

421
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:03,720
Him.

422
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,080
You love cooking the most.

423
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,480
"Master Chef."

424
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,760
Sometimes it's just that

425
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,200
some places need me.

426
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,640
I'll go wherever I'm needed.

427
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,320
If a girl needs him, he'll go there.

428
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,880
The kitchen is my "girl."

429
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,920
So you cooked for them.

430
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,920
And then they dated.

431
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,160
Yes, exactly.

432
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,440
Wang Jue'er.

433
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:35,600
Jue'er.

434
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,720
Sister Jue'er is here.

435
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,440
Sister Jue'er.

436
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,680
Speak of the devil.

437
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,120
So happy.

438
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,080
At this moment,

439
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,920
you don't know where to look.

440
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,800
Really.

441
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,400
I don't even know.

442
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,320
Right now, I'm already

443
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,880
starting to feel awkward.

444
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,200
When things get awkward,

445
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,240
I always pretend to be busy.

446
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,080
Yeah, acting busy.

447
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,640
Tactical water drinking.

448
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,000
I drink water when I'm nervous.

449
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,080
Drinking and pouring water.

450
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,120
Yeah, drinking and pouring water.

451
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,120
Find something to do.

452
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,280
It's all the same issue.

453
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,960
Asking the same question three times.

454
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,080
Who... who just arrived?

455
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,200
The grand finale.

456
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,240
What does that mean?

457
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,880
Do you know each other?

458
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,160
Is there a story between you two?

459
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,600
What kind of "know"?

460
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:53,840
Yeah.

461
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,440
We all used to work in Beijing.

462
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,320
Never thought we'd meet here.

463
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,040
What a coincidence.

464
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,760
Yeah, such a coincidence.

465
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,520
So I just

466
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,280
kind of froze up.

467
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:03,800
That's what happened.

468
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,240
No.

469
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,960
Who could've seen this coming?

470
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,560
Yeah, really.

471
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,880
Honestly, I didn't expect it either.

472
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,600
But I think this vibe is pretty nice.

473
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,000
Much more relaxed than at first.

474
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,200
It was tense at the beginning, right?

475
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,960
Yeah.

476
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,920
The waiter brought the food.

477
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,760
That awkward moment back then.

478
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,640
Didn't dare to leave.

479
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,280
Didn't dare to leave.

480
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,280
Didn't dare to leave. Darn it.

481
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,800
I'm really curious what she said.

482
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,440
Liu Zihan is curious about this part too.

483
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,080
What did she say?

484
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,320
Of course.

485
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,240
She didn't say anything.

486
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,400
She just came back.

487
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,120
Liu Zihan was at the door.

488
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,000
Eavesdropping, huh?

489
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:09,720
Yeah.

490
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,560
What were you talking about?

491
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,880
She seems like your strategist.

492
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,600
Helping you read the other person's expression.

493
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,040
Like your brother.

494
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,000
Helping you check things out.

495
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,840
Does she have a lot of thoughts about you?

496
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,920
She thinks about you a lot.

497
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,600
The first one goes to

498
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,200
This is the first one.

499
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:38,760
Eat up (Sun Hanqing).

500
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,480
Got it.

501
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,440
No need to pick up more.

502
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:49,800
This is our dating house.

503
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,040
Do you need a ticket to enter?

504
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,360
We are the dating house.

505
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,560
That's an apartment.

506
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,360
We have a "shed."

507
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:56,800
We

508
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,360
"Shed"

509
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,080
Unfinished

510
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,120
Unfinished apartment

511
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,720
Unfinished apartment

512
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,320
So jealous.

513
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,600
I'm tired of being jealous.

514
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,960
Each of you has such a big room.

515
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,720
My room is a bit bigger.

516
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,760
Three of us share half a room.

517
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,240
They have bunk beds.

518
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,640
You really have bunk beds?

519
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,040
Bunk beds.

520
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,800
You know, that day a few of us guys

521
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,600
returned to the dating house and found

522
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,200
all the girls

523
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,120
were gone, right?

524
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,400
Still hadn't come back.

525
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,240
That familiar feeling came back.

526
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:46,840
Familiar feeling.

527
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,200
Was it the same as your time?

528
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,360
Then the three of us were in the room

529
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,280
cooking.

530
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,200
When cooking, there was a pot of food.

531
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,160
The range hood back then

532
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,200
even dropped some dust.

533
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,800
I almost lost my dinner.

534
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,280
Three of us stayed in the dating house.

535
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,120
Still no food.

536
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,040
We could only sing.

537
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:04,960
Sing sad love songs.

538
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,640
Even though we didn't fall in love,

539
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,080
but

540
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,360
it was pretty pitiful.

541
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,880
So you gave me that undercooked egg.

542
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,120
Right?

543
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,520
I didn't fry that.

544
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,800
That wasn't me.

545
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,200
Did you see it?

546
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:30,680
Brother Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng) fried it.

547
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,480
It's this one, right?

548
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,800
I knew it was this one.

549
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,680
He wanted to flip it over

550
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,120
so you wouldn't notice it was raw.

551
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,600
See?

552
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,080
Brother Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng) fried it, right?

553
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,640
Do you think he did it on purpose

554
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,480
or was it an accident?

555
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,000
No idea.

556
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,000
On purpose.

557
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:45,960
Okay.

558
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,480
Alright, fine.

559
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,200
Fine, I get you.

560
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,600
Jiao Zhiheng.

561
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,440
Okay.

562
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,240
Liu Zihan makes a dazzling entrance.

563
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,640
Opens the door at the same time.

564
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,160
He's nervous.

565
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,440
Bro's muscles are already pumped.

566
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,040
His eyes are starting to "kill."

567
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,600
Standing on tiptoe.

568
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,920
Comparing who's taller, right?

569
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,400
How tall is he?

570
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,400
I don't know.

571
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,720
You two really aren't close.

572
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,520
No.

573
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,680
Who asks about height for no reason?

574
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,480
When we came in,

575
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,280
we all reported our heights.

576
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,280
You even reported your heights?

577
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,480
We almost put a height chart on the door.

578
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,920
A height scale on the door.

579
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,240
If a guy is over 1.8 meters tall,

580
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,720
he has to make sure everyone knows, right?

581
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:41,920
Yeah.

582
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,520
A cool turn.

583
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,680
Let me go back and get ready.

584
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,200
Very gentlemanly.

585
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,720
Their dating house is really

586
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,680
amazing.

587
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:03,800
Goldfish.

588
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,640
There's also a fish tank.

589
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,760
And an arowana in the pond.

590
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,160
An arowana in the pond.

591
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,680
Singing inside the villa.

592
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,160
There's really a slide.

593
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,040
There really is.

594
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,320
I can only say, that was really fast.

595
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,160
Super fast.

596
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,920
Didn't they just slide to the floor?

597
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,400
Why aren't there any shots inside the tunnel?

598
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:32,920
Why aren't there any shots inside the tunnel?

599
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,400
This is kind of funny.

600
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,000
This entrance

601
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,200
is a bit too funny.

602
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,600
So funny.

603
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,040
Is there also a Corgi?

604
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,440
Yeah.

605
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,640
There's an Alaskan Malamute.

606
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,360
And a Corgi.

607
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,080
So happy.

608
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,000
A dazzling entrance.

609
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,680
Doesn't look very welcoming.

610
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,760
Full now.

611
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,240
Raw eggs are about to be served.

612
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,080
Just thinking about what's next

613
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,720
makes me want to laugh.

614
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,520
I thought they were happy to see me.

615
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,400
A really happy smile.

616
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,480
Turns out it was a mischievous grin.

617
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:24,880
Dr. Fang (Fang Yijiong)

618
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,200
And this move.

619
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:27,960
All food included.

620
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,040
All food included.

621
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,440
You even took another bite.

622
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,280
It smells so good.

623
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,440
It's actually already set.

624
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,160
It's edible.

625
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,560
Darn it, it's starting.

626
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,240
You're like a parent.

627
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:41,600
Yeah.

628
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,440
Who cooked tonight?

629
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,520
The egg isn't cooked.

630
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,360
The boss is here to inspect.

631
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,160
Don't know what to talk about.

632
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,360
Just talk about this stuff.

633
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,480
Yeah, your room.

634
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,640
All our rooms combined

635
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,200
probably aren't as big as this one.

636
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,080
No way.

637
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,720
When you watched yourself before,

638
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,000
how did you feel?

639
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,120
At first,

640
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,920
I was really nervous.

641
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,160
Especially when I saw

642
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:24,840
myself on camera.

643
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,360
I was worried I'd miss something.

644
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,120
But after watching more, you realize

645
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,080
it doesn't matter anymore.

646
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:29,600
Doesn't matter.

647
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,760
You get used to it.

648
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,200
Yeah.

649
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,160
Just like when we first entered the dating house.

650
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:33,880
Feels like entering again.

651
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,800
That dating house feeling.

652
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,600
Yeah.

653
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,080
Actually, seeing what I wore each day

654
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,760
helps me remember

655
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,880
what happened that day.

656
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,160
Yeah.

657
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,600
Boss Lan (Xu Rulan)

658
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,960
That "killer" look is back.

659
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,600
The guys still don't know, right?

660
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,720
They probably don't.

661
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,960
Definitely not.

662
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:08,880
"Lan" friend.

663
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,600
"Lan" friend.

664
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,640
So much pressure.

665
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,560
Yeah.

666
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,280
What's this?

667
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:22,560
The Book of Answers.

668
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,400
The Book of Answers.

669
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,160
That's the one.

670
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,280
Go with the flow.

671
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,760
That's about right.

672
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,080
I didn't really get it then.

673
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,680
Because my brain had already crashed.

674
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,920
Challenging the authority of this book.

675
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,960
Well said.

676
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,160
Challenge complete.

677
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,320
I think what was said makes sense.

678
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,160
Yes.

679
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,760
We just looked at the Book of Answers.

680
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,560
It can actually

681
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,840
reflect your own

682
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,680
inner confusion.

683
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,120
So how about we

684
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,920
play the Book of Answers too?

685
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,360
Is that okay?

686
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,400
Sure.

687
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,760
You guys go first then.

688
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,080
Ask your question and flip it.

689
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:53,720
The question.

690
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,200
Ask the question first.

691
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:54,960
You ask first.

692
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,440
Our Liu Zihan,

693
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,600
did she, in this season,

694
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,080
find a heartwarming story?

695
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,200
A story, okay.

696
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,640
We will, through

697
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,200
the eyes of those who love us,

698
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,920
see more of our own lovable sides.

699
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,800
See more of our own lovable sides.

700
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,640
Through the eyes of loved ones.

701
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,800
Look inward more.

702
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,080
Seek within.

703
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,040
You found yourself in the process.

704
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,000
The process matters.

705
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,360
Then I'll ask Wang Lechen,

706
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,760
did you find happiness?

707
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:26,800
Did you find happiness?

708
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,200
Yes.

709
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,040
So mischievous.

710
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,880
If a crush could sprout,

711
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,640
it would grow

712
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,960
care, respect, understanding, and responsibility.

713
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,480
Has it sprouted?

714
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,400
I'm already drenched in sweat.

715
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,920
Let's play with it for a while.

716
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,400
Let's play this for a bit.

717
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,480
Help, I'm sweating!

718
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,360
Give me a kiss.

719
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,600
Applause.

720
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,600
Can I or not?
