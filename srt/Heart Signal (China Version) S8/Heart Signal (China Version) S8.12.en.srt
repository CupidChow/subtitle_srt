1
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,040
Boxing

2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,520
Ruilong

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,760
Ruilong

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,280
I'm actually looking forward to him showing some sparks.

5
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,720
We'll have to see Ruilong make his move.

6
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:29,600
Jiali

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,320
Hello

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,200
Did you guess it was me?

9
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,480
So you think it's Chichi.

10
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,680
Did we get it wrong?

11
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:42,960
Yes

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,040
But Chichi

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,240
is better, I think.

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:48,760
No.

15
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:49,880
No.

16
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,000
I thought about it, it's possible.

17
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,080
Who did you guess?

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,760
I guessed.

19
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,520
Actually,

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,680
Actually, it's either Duoduo

21
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,920
or you.

22
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,080
So you did guess it.

23
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,360
Why did you choose this?

24
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:03,720
Look.

25
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,040
Boxing.

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,040
You like boxing.

27
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,840
And eating hotpot.

28
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,640
See, I told you.

29
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,760
Does he like boxing and hotpot?

30
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,040
But

31
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,760
This is my first time

32
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,200
boxing.

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:15,560
I've never done it before.

34
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,120
First time boxing.

35
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,680
Yes.

36
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,520
I'm just curious about boxing.

37
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,760
So I chose this activity.

38
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,120
See, she doesn't know how to box.

39
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,360
Actually, boxing for me

40
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,360
is also the first time like this.

41
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,680
But I've done Sanda before.

42
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:29,960
Sanda.

43
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,200
I also want to learn Sanda.

44
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,840
Ruilong's spring has come.

45
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,280
I want to learn.

46
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,000
I want to learn everything.

47
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,320
And I'm still quite curious

48
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,800
about boxing as a sport.

49
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,520
This protects your hands.

50
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,880
Let's get a new one.

51
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,200
I'll show you how to put it on.

52
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,640
Do you know how to put it on?

53
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,600
Isn't this fate?

54
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,040
You can give it a try.

55
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,920
Sit down.

56
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,520
You can stretch out your hand.

57
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,080
One.

58
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,640
Two.

59
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:10,800
Three.

60
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,040
Three.

61
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,560
Four.

62
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,840
Five.

63
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,520
It's not Ruilong.

64
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,480
This bandage of yours—

65
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,560
You wrapped it wrong.

66
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,760
Is it like this?

67
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,240
I don't think so, right?

68
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,400
See, she noticed it too.

69
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,000
This isn't wrapped correctly.

70
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,120
I really want to go in and teach him.

71
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,400
Just leave it.

72
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,520
This way you can wrap it a bit longer.

73
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,560
Can I hold your hand a little longer?

74
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,200
At this very moment,

75
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm really eager to help him out.

76
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:39,920
I don't think so.

77
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,720
This—

78
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,880
That was careless.

79
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,040
Think about it.

80
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,280
He doesn't know either.

81
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:54,760
Coach.

82
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,360
Can I get some help?

83
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,640
Do I turn it this way or that way?

84
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,640
Let this loop

85
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,160
be on top.

86
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,960
Hold it up with your hand on top.

87
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,000
Wrap it around five times.

88
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,640
You remember now, right?

89
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,000
Keep going.

90
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,840
I've already forgotten the earlier steps.

91
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,400
Do you still remember?

92
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,440
You forgot too.

93
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,280
It should be fine.

94
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,000
Switch to the other hand.

95
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,680
I think it needs to be reversed.

96
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,680
Like this.

97
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,080
Is it comfortable to hold?

98
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:36,680
Yes.

99
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,400
Let me help you put on the other side.

100
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:38,960
Okay.

101
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,720
Like this.

102
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,640
See if it's comfortable when you turn it over.

103
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,280
Yes.

104
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,760
Alright.

105
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,360
Let me try it for you.

106
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,240
I think I've got it.

107
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,360
Okay.

108
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,280
Four loops.

109
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,720
Five loops.

110
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,080
He looks like a "little baby dragon" now.

111
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,840
Is that okay?

112
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,560
Very good.

113
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,080
Really?

114
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,160
I feel like we could

115
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,920
do Pilates.

116
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,320
I've never tried it before.

117
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:34,840
I'll teach you.

118
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,160
Okay.

119
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,400
But usually, I might just

120
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,640
warm up, right?

121
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,200
One band.

122
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,600
But you can try two bands.

123
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,160
Give it a try.

124
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,200
Engage your core.

125
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:45,720
Go ahead.

126
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,560
Exhale.

127
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,400
You can do one more.

128
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:53,960
This move

129
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,360
You might need to step with your foot.

130
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:56,960
Step on one.

131
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,400
You need to step.

132
00:04:59,160 --> 00:04:59,720
Then,

133
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,120
pull.

134
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,480
Is this one okay?

135
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,600
This one's very simple.

136
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,120
I think she

137
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,120
is quite suited for this kind of

138
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,440
take-charge girl.

139
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:09,880
Yeah.

140
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,240
How about later

141
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,480
we compete in

142
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,600
plank.

143
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,720
See who can hold a plank longer.

144
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,680
Plank.

145
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,520
Do you know how?

146
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:16,920
Can you do it?

147
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,440
Yes.

148
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,560
The loser

149
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,080
eats

150
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,960
a chili pepper.

151
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,200
He's so cute.

152
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,920
But I think

153
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,480
your core should be relatively

154
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,320
good.

155
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,800
After all,

156
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,440
Actually,

157
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,280
I've been to a military camp.

158
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,200
In Switzerland.

159
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,640
Everyone has to go to the military camp.

160
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,200
And then I went to their

161
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,280
special forces.

162
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:44,920
That's it.

163
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:45,960
He's so cool.

164
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,960
My boy, Ruilong.

165
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,960
What do they do?

166
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,200
They said it's just shooting.

167
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,920
They use real bullets.

168
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,000
Grenades.

169
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Flashbangs.

170
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,400
Riding helicopters.

171
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,560
No more comparing.

172
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,000
Wait a minute.

173
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,560
Let me speak first.

174
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,080
No more comparing.

175
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,520
No more comparing.

176
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,080
Suddenly, no more comparing.

177
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,440
No more comparing.

178
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,920
Ruilong.

179
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,680
So cool.

180
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,440
I think he really looks like

181
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,360
that golden retriever.

182
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,120
Big golden retriever.

183
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,000
Yeah.

184
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,280
Let's go shoot that.

185
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,720
I forgot for a moment.

186
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,600
It seems like this is right.

187
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,160
Not bad.

188
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,040
Okay.

189
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,520
This is correct.

190
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,760
The more we talk, the more excited we get.

191
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,640
The more we praise, the more enthusiastic we become.

192
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,840
It seems like this is right.

193
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,120
This is right.

194
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,360
I want to join too.

195
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,280
Sure.

196
00:06:59,320 --> 00:06:59,960
Okay.

197
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,080
Why do you keep hitting my fist?

198
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,320
I'm lightly punching your chest.

199
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,840
I can't lose.

200
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,560
You can't lose.

201
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,240
He hit her.

202
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:24,720
What should we do?

203
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,120
This won't work.

204
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,800
Are you okay?

205
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,000
Are you alright?

206
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,480
You actually hit my face.

207
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,080
Wait, I'll knock out your front teeth.

208
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,040
So cute.

209
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,440
So adorable.

210
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,000
Here they come.

211
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,160
They're here.

212
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,960
I need to protect myself.

213
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,280
This teamwork is great.

214
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,240
We won.

215
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,440
Too easy.

216
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,560
What do you mean, too easy?

217
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,760
What?

218
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,400
It's too easy.

219
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,200
What?

220
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,240
Let's go, let's have hotpot.

221
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,040
Let's go for hotpot.

222
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,200
This...

223
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,680
That's it?

224
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,400
He admitted defeat.

225
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,360
He lay down on the ground.

226
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,560
He was knocked down.

227
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,520
And then went to eat hotpot.

228
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,640
Yes, sometimes boys are willing to

229
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,360
admit defeat and show weakness, which is

230
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,280
a very touching thing.

231
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:13,600
Yes.

232
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,520
Why do you love him so much?

233
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,120
I really, really like him.

234
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,720
My favorite is Ruìlóng.

235
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,640
I love him too.

236
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,960
He said he served in the military.

237
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,840
And did that job.

238
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,480
And did this job too.

239
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,120
But he never shows it off.

240
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,600
He never sits there and openly talks about it.

241
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,800
What I used to be.

242
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,240
Not that proactive.

243
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,200
He’s quiet about it.

244
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,200
He’s outstanding.

245
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,320
But he’s not eager to show it.

246
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,080
You need to take your time to appreciate him.

247
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,640
Gradually, you will

248
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,800
become more and more attracted.

249
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,400
You’re absolutely right.

250
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,280
Isn’t Ruìlóng exactly like this?

251
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,360
He’s really handsome, you know?

252
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,800
And before, when they were

253
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:43,840
well,

254
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,800
in public settings,

255
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,560
they were actually kind of low-energy.

256
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,200
Yeah.

257
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,080
But when the two of them are together,

258
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,560
it’s like positive and negative poles connecting.

259
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,560
Being with someone like that,

260
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,520
is actually comfortable.

261
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,080
Yes.

262
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,920
Very relaxing.

263
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,160
It feels really easygoing.

264
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,400
Usually

265
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,280
Do you have a favorite hot pot restaurant?

266
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:05,800
Yes, I do.

267
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,920
I tend to prefer Sichuan-style hot pot.

268
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,360
Is Sichuan-style spicy?

269
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,640
Sichuan-style is spicy.

270
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,480
That's right.

271
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,560
So how much spiciness can you handle?

272
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,920
Let me check first.

273
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,600
I am

274
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,960
When I was a kid, I didn't eat spicy food at all.

275
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,480
But I really love eating

276
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,040
shredded cabbage,

277
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,160
dry pot cauliflower,

278
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,560
and spicy peanuts.

279
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,880
Or

280
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,040
I eat them like this.

281
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,840
What do these dishes have to do with chili peppers?

282
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,840
I want to know.

283
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,520
They're all spicy.

284
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,480
You don't think they're spicy?

285
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,120
Is dry pot cauliflower not spicy?

286
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,280
Dry pot cauliflower

287
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:40,960
If you go

288
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,120
and ask a random person on the street,

289
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,360
I think it's really spicy.

290
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:45,640
Really?

291
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,800
It was so spicy that I cried.

292
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,080
Oh no.

293
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,040
I don't know.

294
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,720
Do you feel a bit

295
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,520
less relaxed in the cabin?

296
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,960
Definitely.

297
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,040
I get nervous.

298
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,920
What about you?

299
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,240
Me too.

300
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:06,840
It's just that

301
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,960
maybe I've only just started

302
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,200
to find my own rhythm.

303
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,600
In a new environment,

304
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,200
I feel

305
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,120
a bit lost among people.

306
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,200
So I hope

307
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
this activity

308
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,560
today, with sports and good food,

309
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,480
are my two best ways to relieve stress.

310
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,160
Yes, I really like it.

311
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,200
I really like her lifestyle.

312
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,360
Good food and exercise.

313
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,920
It feels very positive.

314
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,080
We encourage each other.

315
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,560
I'm so happy to see you.

316
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,000
Thank you, me too.

317
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,240
When they smile,

318
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,040
it's very comforting.

319
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,560
Yes.

320
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,840
We're here.

321
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm worried the food might be too spicy for you, so I'll pour you some water first.

322
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,720
Thank you.

323
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,000
What's wrong?

324
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,120
That look means

325
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,680
you're planning to mess with him.

326
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,040
Yes, I am.

327
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,720
I'm leaving.

328
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,680
Where did he go?

329
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,880
What?

330
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,960
I bought a little gift for you before coming over.

331
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,480
You brought a gift.

332
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,800
I bought a little gift for you before coming over.

333
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,680
Thank you for inviting me.

334
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,320
Here's your gift.

335
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,080
Thank you.

336
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,800
What is it?

337
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,640
What could it be?

338
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,840
Is it hand cream?

339
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,080
I use this scent too.

340
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:51,920
You have it?

341
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,360
Yes.

342
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,560
It's exactly the one you like.

343
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,240
That's right.

344
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,800
Thank you.

345
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,440
So he guessed it was her.

346
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,240
I think it's possible.

347
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:58,600
It's possible.

348
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,240
Because he knows.

349
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,320
Only these two box.

350
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:00,680
Yes.

351
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,800
It's possible.

352
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,720
He's very smart.

353
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:02,760
He's extremely smart.

354
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,880
He's just a big golden retriever.

355
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,880
He's really intelligent.

356
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,040
And also very gentle.

357
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,640
He's smart but looks

358
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,120
very non-aggressive.

359
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,880
Yes, that's right.

360
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,840
He's the giving type.

361
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,120
He's the giving type.

362
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,680
Let's have a toast.

363
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,240
To celebrate our first date.

364
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,360
Thank you for inviting me to hotpot.

365
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,360
I'm so happy.

366
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,640
It's nothing, thank you for your gift.

367
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,560
I'll put the spicy pot in for you first.

368
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,280
Okay.

369
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,720
You can try how the mild spiciness tastes.

370
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,800
I want to eat too.

371
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,640
Do you want to choose the most—

372
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,600
—the spiciness that suits you best?

373
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,240
No.

374
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,840
Numbing spicy.

375
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,480
Mine is—

376
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,160
Extra spicy.

377
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,000
Isn't this because I'm worried you can't handle it?

378
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:46,960
Thank you.

379
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,280
You can try that beef.

380
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,160
Right now, Ruilong probably—

381
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,000
—doesn't dare to eat it.

382
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,200
Let's see if Ruilong now—

383
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,080
—forces himself to eat it.

384
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,040
He'll definitely eat it.

385
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,040
You can try that beef.

386
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,280
Let's start with a spicy one.

387
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,680
I'll try it first.

388
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,520
If it's too much, you can pick out the chili.

389
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,320
It's fine.

390
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,480
I eat spicy food.

391
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,000
He pronounced those three words so clearly.

392
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,320
I eat spicy food.

393
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:18,880
You can't handle it.

394
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,000
You can't, but I can.

395
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,120
It's fine.

396
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,280
I eat spicy food.

397
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,560
Your hands are shaking.

398
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,160
How is it?

399
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,680
Still smiling and looking at her.

400
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,680
How is it?

401
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,400
He can't take it anymore.

402
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,240
It's spicy.

403
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,120
This is mildly spicy.

404
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,640
That's a rhetorical question.

405
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,480
This is mildly spicy.

406
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,280
This is mildly spicy.

407
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,040
To what extent?

408
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,240
What do you think, for you personally?

409
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,360
Is it spicier than dry pot cauliflower?

410
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,800
I think it's about the same level of spiciness.

411
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,640
Really?

412
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,320
I think he's about to cry.

413
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,640
His eyes are already wandering.

414
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,560
Relieve it (spicy).

415
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,960
Actually, it's not that bad.

416
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,640
This fake-smiling boy.

417
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,880
So cute.

418
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,520
Stubborn.

419
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,720
But your body is honest.

420
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:33,920
Tears are already...

421
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,520
Tears are coming out.

422
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,600
Bursting out of your eyes.

423
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,800
Your face turned red instantly.

424
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,680
It's flushed.

425
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,080
It's already red.

426
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,720
Yeah.

427
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,400
I can tell.

428
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,120
So usually, if you...

429
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,160
...feel stressed,

430
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,240
what do you do to relax?

431
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,400
I don't put too much pressure on myself.

432
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,280
That answer...

433
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,480
Ruilong, my boy.

434
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,480
What about you?

435
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,600
How do you relieve stress?

436
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,040
I just eat.

437
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,680
That's why I'm called Chichi.

438
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,480
Because maybe usually,

439
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,120
I want to say,

440
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,680
eating too much makes you gain weight easily.

441
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,720
So I don't dare to eat.

442
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,200
So I gave myself this name.

443
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,160
As a kind of compensation.

444
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,760
So when you're with me,

445
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,760
can you relax a bit?

446
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:30,880
Yes.

447
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,840
I wonder if I might

448
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,200
add some pressure to you.

449
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,320
I'm a little worried.

450
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,600
No.

451
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,280
I think just doing

452
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,880
the things I usually do.

453
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,360
He always thinks about others.

454
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:47,840
Yes.

455
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,520
I know that now he

456
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,760
his selfless nature

457
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,040
that

458
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:50,720
I feel that his

459
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,080
trait is becoming more and more obvious.

460
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,320
Have you ever been to Shanghai before?

461
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,440
The first time I came to Shanghai was probably

462
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,160
for the World Expo.

463
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,560
In 2010.

464
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,480
Haibao.

465
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,920
I still have a little Haibao at home.

466
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,440
That was in 2010, right?

467
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,480
I think so.

468
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,720
I still remember

469
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,200
when I was still in elementary school

470
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,000
back then

471
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,680
I went with my classmates

472
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,400
to the World Expo

473
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,320
the World Expo

474
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,640
and there was the Turkey Pavilion

475
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,000
I went there too

476
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,600
the Turkey Pavilion

477
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,280
ice cream

478
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:29,840
yeah

479
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,520
the line was really long

480
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,160
right

481
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,720
just to get an ice cream you couldn't catch

482
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,320
it was so funny

483
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,400
What did you study?

484
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,000
I studied advertising in graduate school

485
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,920
and now my job is

486
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:49,920
in that field

487
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,000
more or less

488
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,320
I'm a management trainee now

489
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,440
What about your job?

490
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,720
I'm in

491
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,680
the audit department as a management trainee

492
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,920
And I

493
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,840
majored in

494
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,240
electrical engineering and

495
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,200
electronics

496
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,800
and information technology

497
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,800
So I will bring some

498
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,520
of what I learned in college

499
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,200
about information technology

500
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,760
like programming

501
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,040
and related skills to the audit department

502
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,840
I will also

503
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,240
make some small programs

504
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,360
and create some websites

505
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,120
for them

506
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,960
to optimize some work processes

507
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,240
like this

508
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,000
He's really impressive

509
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,440
The audit department even does information technology

510
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,320
It's mainly me

511
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,320
I know how to do information technology

512
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,200
So I can

513
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,920
do some

514
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,840
things that can simplify some processes

515
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,200
for them

516
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,480
There are some things

517
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,440
Sometimes it might be

518
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,080
There's a task where

519
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,280
you have to check spreadsheets

520
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,120
and you might spend a whole day checking them

521
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,240
Then I think it's too much trouble

522
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,360
If you check them manually

523
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,480
a "crawler" is much faster

524
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,440
but it still makes mistakes

525
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:56,840
Right

526
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,640
So I automated it

527
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,040
Now you just press a button and it's done in seconds

528
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,200
Then you must know

529
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:02,560
Python

530
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,840
using Python for those things

531
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,000
Yes, I use Python

532
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,600
I wanted to learn it before

533
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,640
But

534
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,920
I gave up after the very first class

535
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,920
I usually do summer jobs too

536
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,600
And

537
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,120
I try out different industries

538
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,600
What kind of part-time jobs do you do?

539
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,880
Selling Turkish ice cream

540
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,840
I still need to learn how to do that

541
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,440
I think that's doable

542
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,280
Although I'm not sure if I can actually do it

543
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,200
Especially with kids there

544
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,400
waving it in front of their mouths

545
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,280
I don't know if I could do that

546
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,240
I'm too soft-hearted

547
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,240
After spinning it twice, I'd just let them take it

548
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,840
I'm not like you

549
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,640
I'd make them cry

550
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,000
That's really

551
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,200
That's such a cute thing to say

552
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,920
We're so happy today

553
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,200
We exercised and ate hotpot

554
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,440
Only decompressing.

555
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,880
You need someone around you who can handle spicy food.

556
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,000
To help share the load.

557
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,440
That's why I have you.

558
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,560
Ruilong, my boy.

559
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,440
My boy, Ruilong.

560
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,840
That's why I have you.

561
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,080
From now on, when eating hotpot,

562
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,400
you can call me.

563
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,880
Ruilong really

564
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,360
his sense of contrast

565
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:36,960
is so strong.

566
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,280
At first, when we saw him,

567
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,880
we thought he was a bit insensitive.

568
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,320
But later, he actually seemed very attentive.

569
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,920
And he's a very considerate person.

570
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,440
There's a little detail about him that I really like.

571
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,840
He said he would learn how to make Turkish ice cream.

572
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,200
Then Ruilong made a joke.

573
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:56,680
He said,

574
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,000
If you let me learn,

575
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,880
I might just give in.

576
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,120
After two spins, I'd give it to him.

577
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,920
I just feel

578
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,560
it's not exactly kindness.

579
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,160
The word "kind" is too ordinary.

580
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,240
But I think he's

581
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,000
like a golden retriever.

582
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,680
Very cute.

583
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,120
A golden retriever.

584
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,440
Yeah, I feel like he'd be soft-hearted.

585
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,280
There's a bit of

586
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,120
that feeling of wanting to cherish him.

587
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,400
He's a very pure person.

588
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,560
Yeah, just pure.

589
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,080
Actually, we've always been

590
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,720
waiting for Rui Long to have

591
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,360
a chance to express himself

592
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,400
genuinely.

593
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:23,840
Yes.

594
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:24,760
From the very beginning,

595
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,440
right from the start,

596
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,640
we could all sense that he

597
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,840
really wanted to communicate.

598
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,400
It's the same for Chi Chi.

599
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,240
Because of work,

600
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:31,960
Chi Chi

601
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,600
arrived a little late.

602
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,920
That little bit of time

603
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,480
made her feel a bit

604
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,760
slightly

605
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,480
alienated in a new environment.

606
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:39,800
Yes.

607
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,440
I think their inner states

608
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,960
are actually quite similar.

609
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,000
So I think

610
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,680
in this

611
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,200
process,

612
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,280
they can open up more.

613
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,600
It really feels comfortable.

614
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,200
Yes.

615
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,240
During this date,

616
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,280
I noticed

617
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:51,880
Chichi's

618
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,280
emotional intelligence is also very strong.

619
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,480
First of all,

620
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,960
she is very clear about

621
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,240
her emotional state in the cabin.

622
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,280
She knows it very well.

623
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,880
She can express it clearly.

624
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,240
She also knows how to handle

625
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,240
her own emotions.

626
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,240
She said she wants to regain

627
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,840
her own way of living.

628
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,360
Yes.

629
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,920
She is a very poised

630
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,680
and self-accepting

631
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,840
girl with strong emotional intelligence.

632
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,760
She also showed more of her

633
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,560
which is what we wanted to see.

634
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,760
So their date this time

635
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,000
was indeed very sweet.

636
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,200
As for the Heartbeat Gem,

637
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,160
there isn't one.

638
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,080
We can't get it.

639
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,480
That's it.

640
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,320
Also,

641
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:23,880
if we get one question wrong,

642
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,000
it's actually two wrong.

643
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:25,800
Yes.

644
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,080
But where did we get the other one wrong?

645
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,040
We still don't know.

646
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,240
Next, let's

647
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,080
watch the next group's date

648
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,720
and see if our group guessed right

649
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,200
or wrong.

650
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,520
Who is this?

651
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,680
Le Chen.

652
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm really looking forward to Le Chen's.

653
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,280
Who, Xiaoyuan?

654
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,800
Jue.

655
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,320
I'm still really happy for Jue.

656
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,160
Finally got a chance.

657
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,240
At last.

658
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,000
Hello.

659
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,880
Hello.

660
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,640
Hello.

661
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,040
It's sunset (card).

662
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,040
Or hiking (card).

663
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,840
What a surprise.

664
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,000
Surprise.

665
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,880
You're surprised too.

666
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,600
Sunset.

667
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,480
Wait a moment.

668
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,920
So the current follow card isn't Wang Jue.

669
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,080
Then who could it be?

670
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,280
And Duoduo doesn't eat hotpot either.

671
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,520
So what does Duoduo do?

672
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,280
Chichi doesn't watch the sunrise either.

673
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,560
So who watches the sunrise?

674
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,600
Let's keep watching.

675
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,360
Have you been here before?

676
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,680
It's very close to my home.

677
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,680
Here?

678
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,080
Yes.

679
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,760
Alright, this is the place.

680
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,480
Pet dessert shop.

681
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,840
First,

682
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,720
make a little cake (for pets).

683
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,520
Then,

684
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,200
we'll stay here

685
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,200
and have dinner.

686
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,840
Can dogs eat this?

687
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:24,840
Yes.

688
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,200
Is this for people to eat?

689
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:25,600
Yes.

690
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,360
It's for dogs.

691
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,080
This is for dogs.

692
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:27,920
I thought it was for people.

693
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,080
It's made for dogs.

694
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,720
For people who have pets,

695
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,080
it's pretty nice to have a date here.

696
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:33,480
It's pretty nice to have a date here.

697
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,040
Yeah.

698
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,760
It's great.

699
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,600
I like it.

700
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:36,960
Sit.

701
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,760
Is there something easier?

702
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,760
Although I really want to draw this,

703
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,200
but

704
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,960
it's so hard.

705
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,400
Something simple.

706
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,680
This one.

707
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,480
This one.

708
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,960
I'll go first and take one.

709
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,000
This one.

710
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,600
Do you want to take one?

711
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,040
I'll take one.

712
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,640
How about you do this one and I do this one?

713
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,120
I've decided.

714
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,720
Can you do this one?

715
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,880
I'll try, I can do it.

716
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,520
You try.

717
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,080
I'll try.

718
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,960
Do you usually

719
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,240
have this much patience

720
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,920
to do other kinds of crafts like this?

721
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,800
Probably not, right?

722
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,320
You know me well.

723
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,360
I'm really curious.

724
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,200
Why is it that you

725
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,080
in so many things

726
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,840
What's wrong?

727
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,960
It feels like

728
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,160
you really understand me.

729
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,920
Really?

730
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,040
Maybe I just observe things carefully.

731
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,000
What happened to your hand?

732
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,000
Yesterday.

733
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,720
Yesterday I scraped it.

734
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,440
Yesterday I cut it.

735
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:47,960
While cooking.

736
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,840
Okay.

737
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,160
Next time, I'll do it.

738
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,440
Next time, I'll do it.

739
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,000
Then it won't just be a cut hand.

740
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,400
Such a simple thing,

741
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,520
the kitchen might explode.

742
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,720
That's a bit much.

743
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,240
It's fine.

744
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,520
It has a long spout.

745
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,520
And you make it stick out, right?

746
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,240
I'll adjust the shape.

747
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,280
Watch closely.

748
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:27,680
Let me adjust it.

749
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,000
I think Wang Jue is really happy right now.

750
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,080
She finally gets to spend time alone.

751
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,160
So cute.

752
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,240
You're so hungry.

753
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,200
So we're making it like this, right?

754
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:00,720
Yes.

755
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,120
On top of this is

756
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:02,520
that...

757
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,720
Your hand is shaking.

758
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,520
Don't be nervous.

759
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,520
It's like an "earthquake."

760
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,480
Let me do it.

761
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:15,920
I'll turn it.

762
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,880
Okay, you turn it.

763
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,400
Here.

764
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,120
This.

765
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:18,600
Add a bit more here.

766
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,080
A little more.

767
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,760
It's too broken up.

768
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,200
It's fine.

769
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,760
You can collect it.

770
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,000
You picked it up really fast.

771
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,480
Your learning ability is pretty strong.

772
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,640
That look in your eyes.

773
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,480
This is really the first time.

774
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:53,920
In my dreams,

775
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,280
I’ve imagined this scene.

776
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,640
Why didn’t I do it?

777
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,320
Is it because of me?

778
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:00,960
What was the reason?

779
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,480
It’s because I didn’t have someone supportive like you.

780
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,040
I...

781
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,760
It’s because I didn’t have someone supportive like you.

782
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,000
I...

783
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,080
I guess I also

784
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,400
bravely expressed myself.

785
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:11,960
Yeah.

786
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,760
This was probably their closest moment.

787
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,080
They also said everything they wanted to say.

788
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,160
That’s good.

789
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,200
I’ve become a supportive person.

790
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:23,720
Let me do it.

791
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,240
You come here.

792
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,200
I won’t touch it anymore.

793
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,480
Hurry.

794
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,880
Turn it.

795
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,680
It feels like this

796
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,600
isn’t supposed to be used this way.

797
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,040
Okay.

798
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,240
The artistic element here

799
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,120
is quite high.

800
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,120
That works.

801
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,320
Alright, let’s leave it like this for now.

802
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,160
Now we need to do the next one.

803
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:45,800
Okay.

804
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,080
See, I’m really afraid to start.

805
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,760
You outline the shape first.

806
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,720
You outline the shape first.

807
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,840
Anxious personality type

808
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,440
Anxious type

809
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,720
I'm really afraid to start

810
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,200
I'd rather not do it

811
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,000
I'd prefer not to do it

812
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,920
Prefer not to do it

813
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,880
Because I'm worried about the outcome

814
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,080
I

815
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,200
I get anxious

816
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,320
If I have to do it

817
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,280
Then I

818
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,760
Really want to do it well

819
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,680
Do you think you are

820
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,880
A person who can be "crazy"?

821
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,200
Why do you say that?

822
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,960
No, I just wanted to ask

823
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,000
To get to know

824
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,240
We haven't really talked about it before

825
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,440
Tend to be persistent

826
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,200
About some things

827
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,520
Persist with some things

828
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,080
Also quite

829
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,120
Principled

830
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,960
Will, for the sake of

831
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,600
Things I love

832
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,680
Do some

833
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,200
Make some efforts

834
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,120
But at the same time, maybe

835
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:14,920
Also a

836
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,080
Relatively somewhat

837
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,360
Vulnerable

838
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,400
And hope someone will guide me

839
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,160
That's how I am

840
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,120
I'm basically telling him directly

841
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,200
This is probably, among all their interactions

842
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,400
The most expressive one

843
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,320
Do you think

844
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,840
You would want someone who really

845
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,600
Understands you

846
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,040
Yes

847
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,920
This belongs to Weini.

848
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,240
This belongs to Nicole.

849
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,920
It's very cute.

850
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,920
Well done.

851
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,200
Let's eat.

852
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:55,880
Let's go.

853
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,000
Who wants pizza?

854
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:02,720
I do.

855
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,840
Try this first.

856
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,880
Do you usually prefer Western food

857
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,880
or Chinese food?

858
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,040
I like both.

859
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,080
Which dish do you like the most?

860
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:15,520
Salad.

861
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,720
Right, you need to maintain your figure.

862
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,640
Recently, I often

863
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,200
ate like this every day.

864
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,400
I want to ask you

865
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,400
about your work.

866
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,280
What is your current

867
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,160
situation?

868
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,080
Actually,

869
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,080
there's an interesting point.

870
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:30,520
It's that

871
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,000
I used to

872
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,600
work at

873
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,240
an internet company

874
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,080
and then switched directly to

875
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,040
a traditional industry.

876
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,040
Specifically, a traditional industry—

877
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,520
environmental protection.

878
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,160
From small-scale

879
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,400
household types

880
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,560
for sewage treatment

881
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,360
equipment

882
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,320
to large sewage plants

883
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,000
we cover them all

884
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,280
We also have waste incineration

885
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,840
furnaces

886
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,120
We manufacture equipment for all these

887
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,960
It's very meaningful

888
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,560
It's very meaningful

889
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,560
Being able to do things

890
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,240
that truly benefit society

891
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,440
and help humanity

892
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,080
I feel a great sense of

893
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:02,600
achievement

894
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:04,600
But even though

895
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,200
I've just started this job

896
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,080
still

897
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,520
I'm very interested in this industry

898
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,200
and find it fascinating

899
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,560
I think

900
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,120
I'll be highly motivated to keep going

901
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,200
If

902
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,520
I have to say

903
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,560
I notice that you

904
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,600
seem to

905
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,720
often, when you speak

906
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,440
say half of what you mean

907
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,320
and hold the rest back

908
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,560
He noticed all of that

909
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,720
You really observe things keenly

910
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,240
It helps to better

911
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,720
in

912
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,680
hit the mark in business negotiations

913
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,960
Actually, I used to rely on sincerity

914
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,240
to move others

915
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,360
There were no tricks

916
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,240
just sincerity

917
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,480
I'm begging you

918
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,920
work with me

919
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,600
And if we make a mistake

920
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,240
we just say, "Sorry, I was wrong"

921
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,400
It's easy to admit mistakes at work

922
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,200
But

923
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,640
in relationships, it's just the opposite

924
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,120
the stubborn kind

925
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:04,760
Sometimes

926
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,680
I can't even see where I went wrong

927
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,760
Can you tolerate emotional coldness?

928
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,320
Are you

929
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,400
What are you

930
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,320
This question

931
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,040
If he asks this, something will definitely

932
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,960
happen.

933
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,000
Can you tolerate emotional coldness?

934
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,560
Are you

935
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,560
You can't tolerate emotional coldness.

936
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,120
I know that.

937
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:40,520
Right.

938
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,240
If you treat me coldly, I'll respond fiercely.

939
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,080
Fierce response.

940
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,720
Do you argue fiercely?

941
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:49,520
Northerners

942
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,680
It's hard for us to hold back.

943
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,880
It's hard not to scold them.

944
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,120
So you

945
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,720
In the past, did they

946
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,040
tolerate you being so loud?

947
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:00,360
Or

948
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,360
what were their personalities like?

949
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,560
Now you've already

950
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,440
started defining yourself

951
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,880
as someone who argues.

952
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,960
You definitely will

953
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,240
You definitely will

954
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,280
Which Aries doesn't argue?

955
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,840
That's been discovered.

956
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,360
I agree with that.

957
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,440
I agree, count me in.

958
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,560
Count me in.

959
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,000
Wait, aren't you?

960
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,200
Hanikezi

961
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,320
Let me tell you, this

962
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,960
You're absolutely right.

963
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,760
Got it, that feels right.

964
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,040
I'm a fighter.

965
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,640
It used to be because

966
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,120
I didn't know how to handle it

967
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,360
so that's why I

968
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,960
was really confused

969
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,920
and I would easily freeze up

970
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,960
just get stuck there

971
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,800
then I would put things off

972
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,880
until there was really no other way

973
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,640
when I couldn't delay anymore

974
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,280
then I'd finally deal with it

975
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,240
but by that time

976
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,280
things had already gotten serious

977
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,160
right?

978
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:10,920
I haven't seen

979
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,360
your stubborn side

980
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,440
when will I get to see it

981
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,880
so stubborn

982
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,600
so stubborn

983
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,800
so stubborn, even for a whole day

984
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,480
Okay

985
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,040
Maybe I'll see it in a couple of days

986
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,680
I think in the past two years

987
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,000
I've really grown a lot

988
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,760
you can't even imagine

989
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,560
Actually, for guys

990
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,280
the age when they mature

991
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,040
is later than for girls

992
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,600
um

993
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,040
later

994
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:34,520
delayed

995
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,440
So are you the type who would

996
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,440
Do you think you

997
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,000
Are you the kind of person who would

998
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,760
give one hundred and twenty percent

999
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,400
or rather

1000
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,320
two hundred percent

1001
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,360
of yourself?

1002
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,680
I wouldn't.

1003
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:54,240
The really self-sacrificing kind

1004
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:54,960
of giving.

1005
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,440
Really?

1006
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:00,960
Is that so?

1007
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:02,960
You seem to know me well.

1008
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,800
Now it's already at a point

1009
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,480
where

1010
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,440
probably

1011
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,320
Do you think I would?

1012
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,520
I don't think so.

1013
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,160
I think Aries are pretty impulsive.

1014
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:21,760
Really?

1015
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,520
Stop, that's enough.

1016
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,400
Looks like you got it right.

1017
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,680
So have you ever

1018
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,280
been hurt because of this impulsiveness?

1019
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,240
Yes, right?

1020
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:34,680
Was it often?

1021
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,760
No.

1022
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,280
What did you say?

1023
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,440
What did you say?

1024
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,360
Yes.

1025
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,360
It's selective.

1026
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,680
So are you scared now?

1027
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,320
Yes.

1028
00:35:59,120 --> 00:35:59,760
Yes.

1029
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,280
Yes.

1030
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,160
Aren't you scared too?

1031
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,960
I'm super scared.

1032
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,120
Exactly.

1033
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,120
I am.

1034
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,000
Maybe my initial feeling

1035
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,680
is at 0.5 right now.

1036
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,520
And my concerns

1037
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,720
might be at three

1038
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,360
or even five.

1039
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,040
Yeah, I am.

1040
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,760
I'm someone who overthinks a lot.

1041
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,960
Because I think

1042
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,360
starting a relationship

1043
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:23,960
can be pretty easy,

1044
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,520
but if you want

1045
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,720
to keep it going, that's hard.

1046
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,560
Does that make you feel bad right now too?

1047
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,760
Anyway, before coming here today,

1048
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,480
I felt awkward.

1049
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,520
What?

1050
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,720
Anyway, I felt awkward before coming here today.

1051
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,400
It was awkward.

1052
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,520
I feel like

1053
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,000
priority ranking

1054
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,560
is, for me,

1055
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,760
a very important thing.

1056
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,560
I absolutely

1057
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,240
can't stand this kind of grievance.

1058
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:07,800
Express it.

1059
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,960
Yeah, it's good to say it out loud.

1060
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,920
In daily life,

1061
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,320
this would never happen.

1062
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,520
Like how she was today,

1063
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,040
everyone spoke their minds.

1064
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,000
Maybe things will be more comfortable between us afterward.

1065
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,720
Of course.

1066
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,760
Maybe after this, she'll finally give up.

1067
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,040
Because Aries never stays in one place for long.

1068
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,960
I looked into her eyes to confirm.

1069
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,600
She really is someone to be friends with.

1070
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,680
But I think this is fine too.

1071
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,800
If that's the case,

1072
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,840
Wang Jue can let go as well.

1073
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,560
The way you acted before,

1074
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,480
what were you like?

1075
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,680
I don't want to talk about it.

1076
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,040
Seriously.

1077
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,240
You really are...

1078
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,520
This isn't about understanding.

1079
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,480
Because I feel like between us,

1080
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,720
we've barely talked.

1081
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,280
I refuse to answer.

1082
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,360
Honestly.

1083
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,160
It's fine.

1084
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,200
There's plenty of time ahead.

1085
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:12,880
In this mirror,

1086
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,200
do you really have to look at me in such an ugly setting?

1087
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:22,840
Look at me.

1088
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,760
Really?

1089
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,880
I can see you too.

1090
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,760
That last "there's plenty of time ahead,"

1091
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,040
I think it was kind of a signal.

1092
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,520
That's just being polite.

1093
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,360
Maybe this is also Chen Chen being considerate.

1094
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,960
He doesn't want to let

1095
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,680
Jue have too much hope.

1096
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,640
Does it have to be done this way?

1097
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,720
Can't you just admit

1098
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,440
Actually, I know

1099
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,960
you've been inviting me.

1100
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,600
But I already like someone.

1101
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,800
But that would hurt

1102
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,600
It would be a very direct hurt.

1103
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,200
Wouldn't that hurt too?

1104
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:00,480
I think

1105
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,320
maybe he wants to use a more appropriate way

1106
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,480
to tell you

1107
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,640
that I'm rejecting you.

1108
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,720
You should give up on me.

1109
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,680
That's what it really means.

1110
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,880
So he would start by asking

1111
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,120
such a blunt question.

1112
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,920
Actually, in them,

1113
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,280
I see the shadows of many people.

1114
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,000
That is to say,

1115
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,760
When Wang Jue is in front of Le Chen,

1116
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,240
she is facing

1117
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,360
someone she has feelings for.

1118
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,360
So her thoughts

1119
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,640
are swirling endlessly.

1120
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,280
She wants to say something,

1121
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,920
but doesn't know where to start.

1122
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,480
But

1123
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,680
Le Chen is just the opposite.

1124
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,520
He is facing someone

1125
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,800
he doesn't have feelings for.

1126
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,040
So he can say anything

1127
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,040
very openly.

1128
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,040
You can really feel that

1129
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,560
sense of straightforwardness.

1130
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,440
But he hasn't lost

1131
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,000
his sense of politeness.

1132
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,640
I think

1133
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,960
it's very dignified.

1134
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,080
I also want to say something.

1135
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:38,480
Because I think he (Wang Le Chen)

1136
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,800
might be misunderstood by people.

1137
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:40,880
Actually, just now

1138
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,160
in the last part of the conversation,

1139
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,560
I could see a lot of guilt in him.

1140
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,160
Not just guilt towards Wang Jue now,

1141
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,400
but also towards his past

1142
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,480
all the emotional coldness,

1143
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,840
and all those experiences.

1144
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,280
In his heart,

1145
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,160
listening to his analysis,

1146
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,280
I think he tends more towards cold handling.

1147
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,000
Between cold handling and emotional coldness,

1148
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,440
there is a very fundamental difference.

1149
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,240
That is,

1150
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,880
the starting point of this behavior

1151
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,360
is whether it comes from good intentions.

1152
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,000
Because he just mentioned a detail.

1153
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,160
He said he didn't know how to handle it at the time.

1154
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,560
I didn't have any intention.

1155
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,560
To hurt anyone.

1156
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,160
But when it comes to emotional coldness,

1157
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:15,880
its starting point,

1158
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,760
its motive is to punish you.

1159
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,080
I want to use coldness to punish you.

1160
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,600
I want this relationship to break down.

1161
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,040
If I'm bad to you, that's malicious.

1162
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,360
But handling things coldly

1163
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,600
might just be a

1164
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,360
way of dealing with things.

1165
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,520
Actually, this concept is

1166
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,400
called the limitation of honesty.

1167
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,120
That is to say,

1168
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,520
at that time, he was his truest self.

1169
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,840
He didn't know what to do.

1170
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,920
He could only show that kind of state.

1171
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,600
Everyone has such flaws.

1172
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,440
But as you said, his starting point

1173
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,120
wasn't malicious.

1174
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,440
Right, so you just need to learn.

1175
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,600
Don't use such heavy words on yourself.

1176
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:46,920
It's okay.

1177
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,800
Le Chen.

1178
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,920
There's a character in it, "gen".

1179
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,920
Do you know what it means?

1180
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,680
What is "gen"?

1181
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,760
It means straightforward.

1182
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,600
That is,

1183
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,840
Why are you so "gen"?

1184
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,880
Always so "gen" every day.

1185
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,760
So stubbornly "gen".

1186
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,200
Yeah.

1187
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,040
It means when you do things,

1188
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,160
you're not that...

1189
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,640
How should I put it?

1190
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,920
Neat and straightforward.

1191
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,360
A Northeastern saying goes,

1192
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,520
A young tree won't grow straight if it's not pruned.

1193
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,720
People won't improve if they aren't corrected.

1194
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,080
People won't improve if they aren't corrected.

1195
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,240
So cute.

1196
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,360
This word really

1197
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,520
I think it especially

1198
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,000
expresses

1199
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,280
the process of their conversation just now.

1200
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,200
And the way they chatted.

1201
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,400
Yes, getting stuck at every step.

1202
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:19,600
I believe

1203
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,080
there are already

1204
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,000
many real Northeasterners in the comments.

1205
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,480
Let's look forward to

1206
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,600
our "Signal of the Heart"

1207
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,920
Northeast season.

1208
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,520
I'm so excited.

1209
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,840
That will be so "gen" (tough/quirky).

1210
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,200
I'm so excited.

1211
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,400
This show is so "gen" (quirky/tough).

1212
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,520
Who is that?

1213
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,240
Wang Lechen.

1214
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,360
I'm curious who he's dating this time.

1215
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,080
She's so pretty.

1216
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:21,920
Hello.

1217
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,400
Hello.

1218
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,320
Hello.

1219
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,040
Hello.

1220
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,080
That smile is so bright.

1221
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:31,680
Hello.

1222
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,720
Did you see what kind of flowers I picked?

1223
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,680
Jasmine.

1224
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:35,920
Mo.

1225
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:36,680
Li.

1226
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,560
Mo Li—don't leave.

1227
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,840
She's so direct.

1228
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:44,920
Now I don't even

1229
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,360
care at all where they are.

1230
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,080
Because I think there's definitely no place

1231
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:47,720
better than ours.

1232
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,200
Yeah.

1233
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,000
We're fun.

1234
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,360
Such a super happy day.

1235
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,840
It's been so long since I went out and had this much fun.

1236
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,600
Who's going to ask me out next?

1237
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,440
My standards are really high.

1238
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,720
They're both in a great mood too.

1239
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,120
Yeah.

1240
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,160
I feel like we can't get out of this.

1241
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,280
I've spent my whole life learning

1242
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,400
how to open up.

1243
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,400
Then we're really complementary.

1244
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,400
Have you ever felt impulsive?

1245
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,120
I want to be impulsive for once.

1246
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,720
It feels like it's Chenchen.

1247
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,520
Needs her kind of energy.

1248
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,560
To be led forward by her.
