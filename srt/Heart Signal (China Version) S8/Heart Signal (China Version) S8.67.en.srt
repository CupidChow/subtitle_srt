1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,360
Here you are.

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,000
Yifan

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,600
Looks great.

4
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,360
Hello.

5
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,680
Hello.

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,960
Hello, hi.

7
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,760
Jin Yuxing

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,760
Hi.

9
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,000
Can you tell who I am?

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,360
Of course I can.

11
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:49,880
I was about to say—

12
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,040
If I said I couldn't,

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,040
I'd have to introduce myself.

14
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,160
Well, you can introduce yourself now.

15
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,240
Really?

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,360
Hello, Jin Yuxing.

17
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,040
My name is Wang Yifan.

18
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,240
So formal?

19
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,080
Darn it.

20
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,040
I feel like I have so much to say.

21
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,720
But...

22
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,520
Once I called, I suddenly forgot.

23
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,120
It's okay, take your time.

24
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,520
Let me gather myself.

25
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,560
How should I put this...

26
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,560
I just think...

27
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,280
This call feels pretty important.

28
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,680
To me.

29
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,840
I think my impression of you was—

30
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,880
When we first picked photos on the island.

31
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,600
Back then, I just thought—

32
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,920
Your smile was beautiful.

33
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,000
So I decided I'd choose—

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,880
Choose you.

35
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,760
But looking back now,

36
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,040
Maybe at that moment,

37
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,160
My first glance at your photo—

38
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,200
It was probably—

39
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,960
My heart was already racing.

40
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,360
It skipped a beat.

41
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,720
And then...

42
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,720
We actually met at the dinner.

43
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,480
At the dinner, I felt—

44
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,400
The first time I saw you—

45
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,520
It just felt—

46
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,680
Like slowly...

47
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,200
Yes.

48
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,880
That day, I kept watching you.

49
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,680
I kept watching you, listening to you talk.

50
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,120
A lot of what he said really touched me.

51
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,280
He seems like the type—

52
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,280
Very bright and sunny.

53
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,480
That's the kind of guy you said you'd never met.

54
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,640
Hi.

55
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,240
Yes.

56
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,400
Hello.

57
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,600
Hello.

58
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,480
My name is Jin Yuxing.

59
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,800
"Jin" as in gold.

60
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,880
"Yu" as in Yu the Great.

61
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,640
"Xing" as in industry.

62
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,040
Maybe we sat too far apart that day.

63
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,320
Yes.

64
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,840
I wondered if you—

65
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,160
Couldn't hear what I was saying.

66
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,840
So that day—

67
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,760
When talking to you, I made sure—

68
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,280
To speak a bit louder.

69
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,600
Until that time—

70
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,600
You know, on that rainy day—

71
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,120
When we went to wash the mop.

72
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,720
I felt like we—

73
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,560
Were on the same wavelength.

74
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,360
Thank you.

75
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,600
No problem.

76
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,920
You handle your side.

77
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,520
It's fine.

78
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,360
Let me do it.

79
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,560
It's okay, you hold the mop.

80
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,040
I'll do it.

81
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,640
Really?

82
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,640
Really, I'll do it.

83
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,920
Okay, you do it.

84
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,560
Like this, just like this.

85
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,560
Ended up washing my hair too.

86
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,160
Hello.

87
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,320
Brought you some bananas.

88
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:00,800
Thanks.

89
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,160
You can practice a bit more.

90
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,920
She just watched quietly.

91
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,720
Didn't they go walk the dog?

92
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,040
Yeah.

93
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,160
They went, but didn't take Nicole.

94
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,320
Then I'll go with you.

95
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,960
Okay.

96
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,960
Both are for you.

97
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,480
Both are for you.

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,240
Why isn't this water boiling?

99
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,280
Mine's already boiling.

100
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,440
Drink something lighter.

101
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,840
Don't drink too salty.

102
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,040
I barely added any seasoning.

103
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,200
She's really brave.

104
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,160
So actually—

105
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,240
Since that day—

106
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,880
After that—

107
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,920
I started expressing myself directly.

108
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,600
How much I like you.

109
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,400
Or being more proactive.

110
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,240
I felt it.

111
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,320
But...

112
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,320
But maybe I just—

113
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,880
Once I fell deeper—

114
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,520
I stopped noticing a lot of things.

115
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,880
Didn't realize my actions—

116
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,600
Might affect you.

117
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,440
Or put pressure on you.

118
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,840
I think it was on the little train—

119
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,320
That I realized—

120
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,240
I brought you a lot of negative feelings.

121
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,760
Or a lot of bad influence.

122
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,200
Maybe after that emotional time—

123
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,560
I started to—

124
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,160
Reflect on myself.

125
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,040
I think—

126
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,240
I think I—

127
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,480
Because I've always—

128
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,280
I've always felt—

129
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,920
No matter what kind of feelings—

130
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,640
When two people are together—

131
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,200
They shouldn't change themselves.

132
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,440
Right, so actually—

133
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,880
Since the short trip (the date)—

134
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,560
When I saw you—

135
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,800
I was still really happy.

136
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,000
Even though I knew deep down—

137
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,280
I was still happy.

138
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,200
She still likes him a lot.

139
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,320
I'm standing here—

140
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:30,760
Because—

141
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,320
I think—

142
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,160
I need to finish what I want to do.

143
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,000
Brave girl.

144
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,000
So today, actually,

145
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,280
I prepared a gift for you.

146
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,440
And I brought another present.

147
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,000
I also have a bouquet in my hand.

148
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,480
My favorite one

149
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,000
is a purple iris.

150
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,160
I chose it because

151
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,000
it actually

152
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,120
stands for freedom.

153
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,800
Just like I said before,

154
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,480
I'm very straightforward.

155
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,040
So I will always show you

156
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,040
my truest self

157
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,600
and the most

158
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,520
even if it's this passionate

159
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,880
side of my feelings.

160
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,000
But I don't want my actions

161
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,160
or what I do

162
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,360
to affect you

163
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,360
or hold you back.

164
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,160
Just like I've always told you,

165
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,680
I said, Jin Yuxing, be yourself.

166
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,640
Jin Yuxing, be yourself.

167
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,680
I hope everything goes your way.

168
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,120
Honestly, I want to say

169
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,240
first, I'm truly grateful to you

170
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,960
for sharing so much with me,

171
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,800
your heartfelt thoughts.

172
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,080
I can feel

173
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,920
that when you say these things,

174
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,480
you're truly sincere.

175
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,800
And

176
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,480
you're also the bravest girl

177
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,440
I've ever met in my life.

178
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,160
I really mean what I'm saying.

179
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,040
I think

180
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,720
I'd rather stay friends

181
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,240
and keep spending time with you.

182
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,640
Stay friends and keep spending time together.

183
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,400
I understand.

184
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,200
And I also thank you

185
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,440
for all the gifts you prepared today.

186
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,560
I think you put so much thought into it.

187
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,320
So I also

188
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,320
I truly

189
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,800
wish you can be like

190
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,960
a purple

191
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,920
bird, soaring

192
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,160
freely in the sky.

193
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,920
And

194
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,480
may you meet

195
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,680
another who truly understands you.

196
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,720
I think that's wonderful.

197
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,000
Life in the house

198
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,400
comes to an end here.

199
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,000
But I'm still very grateful

200
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,000
for this journey in the house.

201
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,840
It really let me

202
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,560
fall in love at first sight

203
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,080
and unknowingly meet you.

204
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,720
Alright, thank you.

205
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,600
Bye, Jin Yuxing.

206
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,120
Bye, Yifan.

207
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,920
Bye.

208
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,880
Let's thank Yifan.

209
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,360
Thanks to this brave girl.

210
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,320
In our

211
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,720
Master Kong Jasmine Tea "Heart Signal"

212
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,880
season eight,

213
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,920
for all the

214
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,240
wonderful

215
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,640
memories she gave us.

216
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,520
I have a feeling I'd like to share.

217
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,160
After watching these two episodes,

218
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,280
I feel Yifan

219
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,440
is someone who knows how to love herself.

220
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,840
Because many people in

221
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,840
her position

222
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,080
would doubt themselves.

223
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,160
But with her,

224
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,400
I see her accept

225
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,320
her feelings for Jin Yuxing.

226
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,560
She also affirms her own initiative.

227
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,320
That's truly rare

228
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,680
and very precious.

229
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,080
Indeed, the teacher is right.

230
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,360
Because the person you like

231
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,320
may not like you back.

232
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,880
That doesn't mean there's something wrong with you.

233
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,880
Right.

234
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,680
In real life,

235
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,280
many young people

236
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:14,960
may feel

237
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,600
when they bravely confess

238
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,880
to someone who doesn't like them,

239
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,000
their feelings,

240
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,480
they feel ashamed.

241
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:20,960
But actually,

242
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,400
I think you should

243
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,120
be proud of yourself.

244
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,520
Yes.

245
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,280
You have the ability to love someone

246
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,400
and are willing to openly

247
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,880
give and express it.

248
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,880
I don't think she needs

249
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,280
or has to change herself.

250
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,480
If she meets someone

251
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,000
who can accept her feelings

252
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,520
and truly understands her,

253
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,520
then meeting her

254
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,600
will be a truly happy thing.

255
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:42,960
I think she has handled

256
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,720
her own journey

257
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,680
really well.

258
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,960
It's a perfect answer.

259
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,280
So I think it's quite romantic

260
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,280
and very happy.

261
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,680
Her happiness lies in

262
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:50,960
her saying

263
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,040
she met someone she fell for at first sight

264
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,080
who didn't even realize it.

265
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,880
I think such people

266
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,520
are not easy to find.

267
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:56,960
True.

268
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,840
But this is just

269
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,880
where it ends for now.

270
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,800
In the future,

271
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,360
the gears of fate will turn.

272
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,680
Because you need to give yourself

273
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,520
a chance for fate's gears

274
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,360
to start turning.

275
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:06,880
Yes.

276
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,600
Well said.

277
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,640
Beautifully said.

278
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,280
Thank you.

279
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,680
Because we just talked about

280
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,000
how, throughout this whole season,

281
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,320
many of our discussions

282
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,200
many of our discussions

283
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,480
are really about

284
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,400
whether we need to change ourselves.

285
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,800
That's the main theme.

286
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,000
So do you think

287
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,600
there are things worth

288
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,600
changing?

289
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,320
And what doesn't need to change at all?

290
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,360
Do you have any thoughts?

291
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,120
I was just thinking seriously

292
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,600
that our growth

293
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,920
is always about change.

294
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,400
For me, change means growth.

295
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,760
It's my own upgrade.

296
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,200
A new version, two point zero, three point zero.

297
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,880
But deep down, I'm still myself.

298
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,520
Change isn't really that bad.

299
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,280
Because you need to

300
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,280
know you're not just good enough,

301
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,160
but more than enough.

302
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,520
I agree.

303
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,800
Because I think being forced to change

304
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,080
is different from choosing to change yourself.

305
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,640
So I think

306
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,920
we should rethink what change really means.

307
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,960
In the word "change,"

308
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,120
there's one part I really dislike,

309
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,080
and one part I really like.

310
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,320
What I dislike is "to correct."

311
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,280
Because "correct" feels like something was wrong.

312
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,080
It means you have to fix it,

313
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,440
which feels like denying

314
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,480
your past self.

315
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,200
You have to change it.

316
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,280
That's why I don't like that word.

317
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,480
But I like "transform."

318
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,680
For me,

319
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,680
transformation is a kind of creation.

320
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,680
A new version of yourself.

321
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,480
Like you said, it's a possibility.

322
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,640
I think before getting together,

323
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,400
there's no need to change.

324
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,200
Because you are you,

325
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,080
and he is himself.

326
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,280
If two souls happen to fit together,

327
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:17,880
being together

328
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,480
is a very lucky thing.

329
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,400
But after you're together, you will change.

330
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,760
But that change doesn't mean

331
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,640
becoming someone else,

332
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,760
or just pleasing your partner.

333
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,160
It's about changing your state

334
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,920
so both people can

335
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,040
fit together better.

336
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,840
I really agree

337
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,040
with what Teacher Minghao just said.

338
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,400
I think

339
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,520
relationships should be divided

340
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,680
into the "heart-fluttering" phase and the "getting along" phase.

341
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,280
In the heart-fluttering phase,

342
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,080
like Yifan said, "I don't want to change myself."

343
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,280
She means the way she attracts others.

344
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,920
The way I show my feelings.

345
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,320
First, you don't know

346
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,800
how to truly attract that person.

347
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,240
Second, you'll get stuck

348
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,480
overthinking and doubting yourself.

349
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,880
So in the heart-fluttering phase, just be yourself

350
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,280
and do things your own way.

351
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,080
That's how you'll attract someone

352
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,320
who likes the most natural,

353
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,200
real version of you.

354
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,520
But in the getting along phase,

355
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,680
you can adjust things.

356
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,000
Like Teacher Minghao just said,

357
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,680
it's about relationship skills,

358
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,800
ways to communicate,

359
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,400
ways to handle conflicts.

360
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,080
Maybe in the getting along phase,

361
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,760
these things become necessary.

362
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,720
The best part of "Heart Signal" is

363
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,840
we can see in them

364
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,640
in each person

365
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,720
a reflection of ourselves.

366
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,280
Yes.

367
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,000
And it helps us all become better.

368
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,280
Thanks to Yifan,

369
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,960
for giving us

370
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,960
these feelings through this journey.

371
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,400
I hope

372
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,200
everyone watching our show

373
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,520
can find a more authentic,

374
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,480
happier,

375
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,520
and braver version of themselves.

376
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,720
Alright, next

377
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,200
let's move forward.

378
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,520
It's Chichi.

379
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,320
This group is full of suspense.

380
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,440
On one side, there's maturity and steadiness,

381
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,280
constantly giving

382
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,160
emotional value.

383
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,320
That's Zihan, who gives it all.

384
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,000
Yes.

385
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,720
On the other side, there's abstract innocence,

386
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,120
just by speaking,

387
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,320
can bring you

388
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,560
a unique experience—Jin Yuxing.

389
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,040
Now, they will each

390
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,720
call Chichi

391
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,320
to confess their feelings.

392
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,040
Let's keep watching.

393
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,440
Here it comes, this part—

394
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,040
the familiar bridge.

395
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,240
He planned that park date.

396
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,760
This is the first scene.

397
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,560
Archery.

398
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,120
Yes.

399
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,840
So nervous.

400
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,920
Everyone looks nervous.

401
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,560
This group really has the most suspense.

402
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,200
Hello?

403
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,640
Chichi.

404
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,000
Hello?

405
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,920
Hello?

406
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,680
Chichi, it's Zihan.

407
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,160
Here I am.

408
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,480
Honestly, I have so much to say,

409
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,200
but I really don't know how to start.

410
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,360
You were the first person I met in the house.

411
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,160
Before you arrived, that day I

412
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,120
felt so tense and nervous.

413
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,480
But when you

414
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,680
walked in,

415
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,400
I felt a kind of magical

416
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,880
chemistry happening.

417
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,600
Maybe it was your smile

418
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,520
that healed me.

419
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,720
Hello.

420
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,320
Hello.

421
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,120
Liu Zihan.

422
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:45,760
Liu Zihan.

423
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,320
Yes.

424
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,560
My name is Sun Hanqing.

425
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,400
You can call me Chichi.

426
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,160
I need to remember that.

427
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:51,800
It's easy to remember.

428
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,520
"Chi" as in "eat."

429
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,040
"Chi" as in "eat."

430
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,960
We first met over a meal.

431
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,880
Eating, right.

432
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,280
I don't think I have an accent.

433
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,120
Really?

434
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,440
No accent, I think.

435
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,480
No.

436
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,440
At that moment, my heart slowly calmed down.

437
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,160
My body wasn't so tense anymore.

438
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,440
Then we talked again.

439
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,600
I realized we actually have many

440
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,280
similarities.

441
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,240
The way we see certain things

442
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,760
made me feel

443
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,640
that talking to someone on the same wavelength

444
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,280
really gives you

445
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,720
the feeling of reuniting with an old friend.

446
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,720
So I want to

447
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,480
hold on to every chance to know you better.

448
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,000
But maybe I held on too tightly then,

449
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,680
and made you

450
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,040
feel a lot of pressure.

451
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,360
Maybe even a bit

452
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,600
suffocated.

453
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,200
Moving forward, I worried you'd feel pressured.

454
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,640
Stepping back, I feared

455
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,400
missing my chance.

456
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,560
It's rare to see Zihan like this.

457
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,360
But seeing your joy playing badminton,

458
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,400
and your excitement driving go-karts,

459
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,280
when you were thrilled,

460
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,120
honestly,

461
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,480
my mood was deeply

462
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,360
affected by you.

463
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,680
What qualities do you value most in someone?

464
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,080
Sincerity.

465
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,920
Kindness.

466
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,760
I'm listening carefully.

467
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,240
I'm listening.

468
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,400
Handsome.

469
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,080
Your smile is really beautiful.

470
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,120
That impression is very strong.

471
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,720
Overtaking.

472
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,440
Not allowed.

473
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,280
Caught up!

474
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,320
Don't be nervous.

475
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,440
So I truly want to thank you

476
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,680
for making an ordinary night

477
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,160
so meaningful.

478
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,520
It became

479
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,680
you could say

480
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,000
unforgettable.

481
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,600
He's so good with words.

482
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,560
Actually, there are many

483
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,560
many

484
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,320
details.

485
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,800
Every little thing is etched in my mind.

486
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,840
For example,

487
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,320
the first time you

488
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,840
we secretly ate durian together,

489
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,280
that sense of satisfaction.

490
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,520
Your love for life,

491
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,440
when you talk freely,

492
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,800
your relaxed vibe,

493
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,800
that comfortable feeling—

494
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,960
I want to

495
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,160
capture every frame,

496
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,240
every second,

497
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,400
all

498
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,360
in my memory.

499
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,440
Etched in my mind.

500
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,040
No one dislikes durian.

501
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,640
Me too.

502
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,280
I eat durian by the whole piece.

503
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,560
Please.

504
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,360
You savor it first.

505
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,760
I have something for you.

506
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,040
Thank you for

507
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:14,800
taking me out yesterday.

508
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,440
And then,

509
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,400
you said you had insomnia,

510
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,880
so you can spray this in your room.

511
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,480
Thank you.

512
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,680
Weini.

513
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,840
We look like two parents left behind.

514
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,680
Make a wish.

515
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,240
Go ahead.

516
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,120
Okay.

517
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,960
You're good at arranging.

518
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,680
Alright.

519
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,760
I'm happy now.

520
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,120
Sweet.

521
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,720
(Travel date) Day two.

522
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,560
When we went traveling,

523
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,880
I actually felt quite down.

524
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,440
Because

525
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,600
you weren't there.

526
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,960
The sunset was truly beautiful.

527
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,360
But what I thought then was,

528
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,760
if you were there,

529
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,560
it would be

530
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,280
even more beautiful.

531
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,600
That day on the boat, right?

532
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,320
Yes.

533
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,480
So I used my phone

534
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,560
to record this thought,

535
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,000
so I could share it with you later.

536
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
So, rounding up,

537
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,880
we watched

538
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,200
the sunset together.

539
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,600
He filmed a sunset just for this.

540
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,160
That really hits home.

541
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,880
But today, I still want to

542
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,280
use my courage

543
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,440
to say

544
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:46,800
specifically,

545
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,160
some things from these eighteen days.

546
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,800
I like you.

547
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,600
I am genuine,

548
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,920
and you are worth it.

549
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:07,840
I am genuine,

550
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,160
and you are worth it.

551
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,880
That's enough—I am genuine,

552
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,880
and you are worth it.

553
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,320
Nine words are enough.

554
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,120
No extra words.

555
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,920
He expresses everything so clearly.

556
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,360
And it carries real weight.

557
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,720
That's all from me.

558
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,920
Okay, I got it.

559
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,360
Thanks, I'll hang up now.

560
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:38,840
Bye.

561
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,840
I am genuine,

562
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,880
and you are worth it.

563
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,960
That's the core of it.

564
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,040
I like you.

565
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,440
I am genuine.

566
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,040
No need to say anything more.

567
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,160
I think it's happening.

568
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,600
Victory!

569
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,440
You two are going to make it.

570
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,600
After watching,

571
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,760
I feel confident again.

572
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,840
I can do it.

573
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,040
Hani says it's possible.

574
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,800
No, trust your own heart.

575
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:08,800
You can do it.

576
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,000
Jin Yuxing, keep going on your side.

577
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,360
We still don't know the outcome yet.

578
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,480
Next,

579
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,320
if anything comes up,

580
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,720
just keep going yourself.

581
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,560
Now it's your turn.

582
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,040
Sent him a message on WeChat.

583
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,440
Come on, let's see Jin Yuxing.

584
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,560
He'll probably ride his bike there then.

585
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,960
He really put his heart into it.

586
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,560
Is it finally time to make a move?

587
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,840
Going all out at the end.

588
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:13,920
Come on.

589
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,160
Let's see what Jin Yuxing does this time.

590
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,440
What do you think?

591
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,240
Hello?

592
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,520
Hello?

593
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,600
Hello?

594
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,720
Hello?

595
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,680
Hi, Jin Yuxing.

596
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,280
Did you guess it was me?

597
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,600
I knew it was you by your voice.

598
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,800
How do you feel?

599
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,840
Feels like I'm nervous again.

600
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,840
I could tell it was you right away.

601
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,400
Really?

602
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,880
How are you feeling now?

603
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,920
I'm feeling pretty good now.

604
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,120
The evening breeze feels nice.

605
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,720
Really?

606
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,920
I honestly didn't expect it.

607
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,680
Life in the house ended so quickly.

608
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,960
When I found out our time in the house

609
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,960
was coming to an end,

610
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,280
I started to remember

611
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,080
the moment we first met.

612
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,280
You walked in from the banquet hall entrance,

613
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,480
wearing a shiny purple gown.

614
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,200
You introduced yourself and said,

615
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,120
My name is Sun Hanqing.

616
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,920
You can also call me Chichi.

617
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,200
Because you really love to eat.

618
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,920
Hello, everyone.

619
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:35,680
Hi.

620
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,920
You can all call me Chichi.

621
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,280
Because I love food.

622
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,720
I think you might be right.

623
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,400
You were actually pretty quiet that night.

624
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,080
I was thinking to myself then,

625
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,320
Are you like me,

626
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,680
both slow to warm up?

627
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,440
You are really slow to open up.

628
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,240
And then...

629
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,600
And when we picked gifts,

630
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,520
it was so magical.

631
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,280
You chose the bouquet I prepared.

632
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,240
Now I think,

633
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,600
our connection started right then.

634
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,800
It quietly began.

635
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,640
Mine was a bouquet.

636
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,520
Yes.

637
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,720
Right, it was me.

638
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,160
Flowers don't last long.

639
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,720
But it reminds me even more

640
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,480
to cherish the present.

641
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,000
It matched my dress too, thank you.

642
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,760
It was love at first sight.

643
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,640
But I didn't expect that later on,

644
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,200
since I'm always slow to react,

645
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,880
our time together

646
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,280
was like two cups of warm water.

647
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,600
When others were already gulping down drinks,

648
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,720
and toasting,

649
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,640
we were still sipping slowly.

650
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,720
Testing the temperature of our warm water.

651
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,640
At first, we always sighed

652
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,040
At first, we always sighed

653
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,040
about how little time we spent together.

654
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,480
We kept missing each other.

655
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,920
That's true.

656
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,440
And because I was passive,

657
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,240
I missed our first date.

658
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,880
And then, until

659
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,400
our first date finally happened,

660
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,200
the day we went indoor bungee jumping.

661
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,480
I saw how brave you were.

662
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,120
And a bit adorable, too.

663
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,240
You held onto my arm so tightly.

664
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,840
Our harnesses got tangled together.

665
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,560
I couldn't tell

666
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,360
whose scream was louder.

667
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,720
In those few seconds of weightlessness,

668
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,440
I really heard

669
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,160
our two hearts that always missed each other

670
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,160
were beating together.

671
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,840
And beating so loudly.

672
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,080
That's a great way to describe it.

673
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,040
Two hearts that kept missing each other,

674
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,200
beating so loudly.

675
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,520
So...

676
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,480
Say what's in your heart.

677
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,320
Yes.

678
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,440
So...

679
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,080
During this brief

680
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,560
trip to Qiandao Lake,

681
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:35,200
I sent your name without hesitation.

682
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,320
Jin Yuxing has changed.

683
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,200
Everyone can see it.

684
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,240
Because I wanted to watch the sunset with you alone.

685
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,000
He finally

686
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,760
made his move.

687
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,520
Yes.

688
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,480
You won.

689
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,480
I think this is going to work out for you.

690
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,760
Only he is the right one.

691
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,120
Hang in there a bit longer.

692
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,280
Don't let me get happy too soon.

693
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,760
When I sat on the lawn

694
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,080
waiting for you,

695
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,960
I saw you walking from the other side

696
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,640
of the lawn toward me.

697
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:11,720
You looked like a princess from a fairy tale.

698
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,720
Sparkling and radiant.

699
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,280
You're so good with words.

700
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,800
Hi, Jin Yuxing.

701
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,680
Hi.

702
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,760
And you called my name

703
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,560
so warmly.

704
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,520
I was a little surprised.

705
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:30,480
And really happy, too.

706
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,760
Just like yesterday, I really

707
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,960
only saw a few words

708
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,040
and sent it right away.

709
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,040
I bet now

710
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,120
my phone's input suggests "cc"

711
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:40,800
which means Chichi.

712
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,840
Later on...

713
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:52,880
Later on...

714
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,120
On the way back, you suddenly asked me

715
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,920
Is it late now?

716
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,960
Back then, I foolishly thought

717
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,080
you were asking if it was late to go home.

718
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,760
But later on, I understood.

719
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,120
You were talking about

720
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,320
whether our relationship is too late.

721
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,520
So my answer to you is,

722
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,600
The best time to plant a tree was ten years ago.

723
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,920
The second best time is now.

724
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,440
And now I also want to say,

725
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,720
I...

726
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,320
I'm not good at promising forever.

727
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,320
But I know

728
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:35,840
if

729
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,560
I don't try to walk with you

730
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,160
through these mountains and rivers ahead,

731
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,280
and turn them into memories for us,

732
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,160
I think that would be my biggest regret.

733
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,440
I really liked what he said here.

734
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,280
That really touched me.

735
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,280
He said it so well.

736
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,200
I prepared some gifts for you today.

737
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,480
I just don't know if I'll get the chance

738
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,520
to give them to you myself.

739
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:19,800
That's nice.

740
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,400
Okay, I got it.

741
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,640
Thank you.

742
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,840
Let's leave it at that for now.

743
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,840
Okay, thank you.

744
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,840
Bye.

745
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,720
Bye.

746
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:12,880
Now both of them

747
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,000
have finished expressing themselves.

748
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,440
But now

749
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,520
there are three choices.

750
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,240
Zihan

751
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,600
His sincerity and maturity,

752
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,240
his charm—

753
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,840
can they move Chichi?

754
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,200
On the other side,

755
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,960
Jin Yuxing's innocence,

756
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,600
his abstract and gentle nature—

757
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,520
can they touch Chichi?

758
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,680
Or maybe

759
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,480
neither of them

760
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,040
can really open

761
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,120
Chichi's heart.

762
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,880
It's so hard to decide.

763
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,480
But I just feel

764
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,680
my gut says they'll become a couple.

765
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,720
Yeah, I think she'll choose too.

766
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,840
Anyway, I still think the same as before.

767
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,680
Me too.

768
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,280
Xu Ge

769
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,840
We're on the same team.

770
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,880
Come on, give us your opinion.

771
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,440
Hurry up.

772
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,640
What do you think?

773
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,720
Are you still sticking to your choice?

774
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,120
He already sent the voice message.

775
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,160
Now it's different.

776
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,440
He can't take it back now.

777
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,200
I've got an ace up my sleeve.

778
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:16,840
I think

779
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,320
Jin Yuxing's greatest charm

780
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,280
is really about

781
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,440
how he's abstract when he wants to be,

782
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,720
innocent when he wants to be,

783
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,080
but for this confession just now,

784
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,840
he truly expressed his real feelings

785
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,920
in his own words.

786
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,480
And he genuinely conveyed them to Chichi.

787
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,880
I think this

788
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,400
on this

789
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,520
confession night is

790
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,200
really precious.

791
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,160
Let's see what's next.

792
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,480
Who will Chichi call?

793
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,000
Next is Chichi's confession moment.

794
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,800
Here it comes.

795
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,960
Quick!

796
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,600
So nervous.

797
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,280
Have you been happy these past few days?

798
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,360
With you?

799
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,680
Pretty happy.

800
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,840
What are you writing down every day?

801
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,520
I'm writing about you.

802
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,600
You like spicy pork stir-fry.

803
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,080
Spicy pork stir-fry.

804
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,360
I have fried eggs and sausage.

805
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,360
So tasty.

806
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,920
My shoes can't run away.

807
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,040
Careful, wait here.

808
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,840
I'll go chase after it.

809
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,960
This is for you.

810
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,160
A badminton racket.

811
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:47,520
Yeah.

812
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,480
I bought you a cake.

813
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,720
Why didn't you bring it out earlier?

814
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,440
I bought it just for you.

815
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,680
I want to get to know you better.

816
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,120
With the people around me,

817
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,640
even doing things that seem pointless,

818
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,760
still feels meaningful.

819
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,720
My name is Jin Yuxing.

820
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,760
Yuxing.

821
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,040
That's easy to remember.

822
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,120
Here we go.

823
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,120
I want to show my attitude.

824
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:22,320
Stay.

825
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,000
Stay.

826
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,400
If I bring Japanese food

827
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,360
to a hotpot place to eat with you,

828
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,680
let's just have sukiyaki.

829
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,200
Welcome.

830
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:29,280
Welcome.

831
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,760
I'll be the chef today.

832
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,040
I could actually tie it to my hand.

833
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,640
Then it won't get lost.

834
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,400
Don't feel pressured.

835
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,120
Accept kindness from others.

836
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,080
We match.

837
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,360
The wind's picking up.

838
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,800
If you have worries

839
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,920
or unhappy things,

840
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,280
let the wind catch them

841
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,560
and blow them away.

842
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,840
I think I need to use

843
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,480
eye drops.

844
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,720
I'll open it.

845
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,160
You open it.

846
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,240
Yeah.

847
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,880
Reading the hurt I gave you.

848
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,720
I feel like you're not in a great mood today.

849
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,600
It's mainly from driving too much.

850
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,440
Did you really drive all day today?

851
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,800
Wipe the lens.

852
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,920
You're pretty good at finding things.

853
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,600
You might think some things

854
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,080
are as fleeting as fireworks.

855
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:23,640
You can

856
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,880
let the fireworks go off a few more times.

857
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,200
What are these two going to do?

858
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,200
I'm so nervous.

859
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,720
Did she call?

860
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,360
Hello?

861
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,000
The biggest mystery of the season.

862
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,000
Hello?

863
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,000
Hello?

864
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,040
Here we go.

865
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,480
The biggest mystery this season.

866
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,520
The sunset is truly beautiful.

867
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,800
But what I was thinking then

868
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,760
was, if you were here,

869
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,560
it would probably

870
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,080
be even more beautiful.

871
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:06,920
Now I think

872
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,040
our story actually began at that moment.

873
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,920
It quietly started from there.

874
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,400
After watching, I felt confident again.

875
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,120
But Chichi, I think

876
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,080
no one would make a choice.

877
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,360
I'm so nervous.

878
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,800
Did she call out?

879
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,720
Who could it be?

880
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:22,840
Hello?

881
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:23,720
Hello?

882
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,600
Jin Yuxing.

883
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,280
Hello?

884
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,400
The two on the "trial romance trip"

885
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,680
will make their final decision.

886
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,440
If they choose to be a couple now,

887
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,240
they will exchange their balloons.

888
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,240
If not,

889
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,080
they will release their balloons.

890
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:45,200
I'm so grateful to have met you along the way.

891
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,160
Thank you for coming closer to me, step by step.
