1
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,640
Back again.

2
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,200
I'm back again.

3
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,880
Have a seat.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,640
Today feels a bit different.

5
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,280
How so?

6
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,440
How is today different?

7
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,920
It's spacious.

8
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,360
We used to have just two sofas.

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,120
Now we have two empty seats.

10
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,200
Noticed it.

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,000
So we'll have

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,360
two mystery guests.

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,760
Really?

14
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,480
Let's give a warm welcome

15
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,520
to our new friends.

16
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,920
Meng Zhang and

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,720
Han Tao Ren'er.

18
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,560
Welcome.

19
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,240
Welcome.

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,960
Hello.

21
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,160
Hello.

22
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:11,880
Hello.

23
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,000
Hello.

24
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,760
Hello.

25
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,320
Hello.

26
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,880
Hello.

27
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,440
Jin Yuxing.

28
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:25,640
Take a seat.

29
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,120
Let's sit down first.

30
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,480
Let's sit down first.

31
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,320
Go ahead and sit.

32
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,920
Let's start with

33
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,680
introductions.

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,800
Let's introduce ourselves.

35
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,080
I'll go first.

36
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,240
Hello, everyone.

37
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,440
I'm a Heart Signal observer from Xiaohongshu.

38
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,040
My name is Han Tao Ren'er.

39
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,200
You can call me Tao (Han Tao Ren'er).

40
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:40,920
Tao (Han Tao Ren'er).

41
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,480
Hello, I'm Meng Zhang.

42
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,680
I'm also from Xiaohongshu.

43
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,240
Heart Signal observer.

44
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,720
Here to join you all in shipping combos online.

45
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,400
Alright.

46
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:50,960
Welcome, Meng Zhang.

47
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,040
Welcome.

48
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,080
Okay, it's our turn.

49
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,680
Hello, everyone.

50
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,440
I'm from Heart Signal

51
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,280
Season Eight, Jin Yuxing.

52
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,520
And I'm today's

53
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,320
host.

54
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,120
Hello, everyone.

55
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,240
I'm from Heart Signal

56
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,040
Season Eight, Duoduo Ke Ailin.

57
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,600
I'm back again.

58
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,440
Hello, everyone.

59
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,680
I'm from Heart Signal

60
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,640
Season Eight, Lu Yuan, Xiao Yuan.

61
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,520
Hello, everyone.

62
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,360
I'm from Heart Signal

63
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,480
Season Eight, Xu Rulan, Lanlan.

64
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,240
Feels lively today.

65
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,040
It's lively today.

66
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,800
Definitely.

67
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,600
Let's welcome again

68
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,640
our new friends.

69
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,440
Come on.

70
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,480
Welcome.

71
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,800
Before this,

72
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,280
which episode did you watch?

73
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,040
I binged all night.

74
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,280
Caught up to episode five.

75
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,480
And the preview for episode six.

76
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,120
I'm all caught up.

77
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,280
Yes, I'm caught up.

78
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,880
I have my own favorite combo.

79
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,800
Really?

80
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,560
Which pair?

81
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,560
Are they here?

82
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,800
My first shipped combo is the Fang Lan Combo.

83
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,800
Thank you.

84
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,200
I've seen on

85
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,480
Xiaohongshu some photos.

86
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,120
Like some airport pictures.

87
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,760
And so on.

88
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,200
Because didn't we

89
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,880
all return together now?

90
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,880
So we just

91
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,920
took the same flight here.

92
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,680
Didn't expect to be spotted.

93
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,160
Just took a flight,

94
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,760
that's all.

95
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,160
Keep watching.

96
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,160
Later, while watching the clips,

97
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,920
we can chat about it.

98
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,160
Since we've only seen up to episode five,

99
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,160
there's still six, seven, eight.

100
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,560
I heard a lot

101
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,000
happened.

102
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,240
So my reaction later might be

103
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,960
I might be really shocked.

104
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,560
Might need you all to explain it to me.

105
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,440
No problem.

106
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,280
I saw on Xiaohongshu

107
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,400
you two shopping together.

108
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,240
What's the story there?

109
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,680
You can look forward to

110
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,040
Yuxing's video log.

111
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,120
Mainly,

112
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,280
I'm the cameraman for our Heart Signal family.

113
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,920
I handle the filming.

114
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,720
Earlier, I saw

115
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,080
Earlier, I saw

116
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,560
What impressed me was

117
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,960
seeing Jin Yuxing and Chichi

118
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,360
on your date.

119
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,360
And I thought

120
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,040
you two have a really

121
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,480
warm vibe together.

122
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,000
But I don't know if I shipped the right pair.

123
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,800
Did I ship the right pair?

124
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,720
We'll see soon, right?

125
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,280
He seems like he wants to say more.

126
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,560
So next,

127
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,040
let's liven things up.

128
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,160
Of course.

129
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,640
Today's theme is

130
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,800
happiness with no distance.

131
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,440
Right?

132
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,200
Yes, next we'll play

133
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,800
a very fitting, much-needed

134
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,840
game of quick reactions and insight.

135
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,480
When asked how many people came,

136
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,720
the randomly chosen person

137
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,560
must stand up and shout the slogan.

138
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,400
Lanlan, how many people came with you today?

139
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,520
I came alone.

140
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,920
Then the two next to her

141
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,160
clockwise must stand up

142
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,880
and shout

143
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,800
I came with two people.

144
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,560
And so on.

145
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,520
Duoduo, may I ask

146
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,080
how many people came with you today?

147
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,480
I came alone.

148
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,440
I came with two people.

149
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,280
I came with three people.

150
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,360
I came with four people.

151
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,480
I came with five people.

152
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,360
Lanlan, how many people came with you today?

153
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,400
I came alone.

154
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,360
I came with two people.

155
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,200
I came with three people.

156
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,000
I came with four people.

157
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,600
Then I have to ask Yuanyuan.

158
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,800
How many people did you come with today?

159
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,040
I came alone.

160
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,760
I came with two people.

161
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,200
I came with three people.

162
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,080
I came with four people.

163
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,760
I came with five people.

164
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,120
I came with six—

165
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,840
No, that's not right.

166
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,600
Only I sat down for five people.

167
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,880
Why are you the one for five people?

168
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,240
One, two, three, four, five.

169
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,120
Right, five people.

170
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,760
Then six people.

171
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,560
That's correct.

172
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:34,920
Yeah.

173
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,280
That's right.

174
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,480
You questioned the game, but the result was right.

175
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,080
So that's—

176
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,480
Right, so—

177
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:39,800
That counts as yours.

178
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,160
So this round goes to Xiaoyuan.

179
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,160
Except for you and me,

180
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,440
everyone else got "caught."

181
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,600
This is obvious.

182
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,400
So we're the smartest "kids" here.

183
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,040
Of course, the newcomer did best.

184
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,160
Right?

185
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,560
Mengzhang the "kid" just won a reward.

186
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,400
Thank you, everyone.

187
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,200
The reward is—

188
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,080
You can pick anyone here

189
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,600
to serve you tea or water.

190
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,440
Let's all call out their name together.

191
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,720
Jin Yuxing!

192
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,000
Let's distribute everyone's

193
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,640
tea and water first.

194
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,040
So proactive!

195
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,960
Thank you.

196
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,320
Thank you.

197
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,280
Come on, welcome!

198
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,240
Welcome!

199
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,320
Thank you.

200
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,320
Welcome!

201
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,280
Thank you.

202
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,040
Let's put on our headphones.

203
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,760
Let's start watching.

204
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,600
Okay.

205
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,800
That look in your eyes—

206
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,320
Can you explain your expression?

207
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,520
Yuxing.

208
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,480
It's just a focused listening face.

209
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,440
Listening carefully.

210
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,600
Okay.

211
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,680
Ruilong and Wang Jue aren't here anymore.

212
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,600
Yes.

213
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,400
So now, the two of them are—

214
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,360
I think we need to explain this.

215
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,600
Earlier, it was—

216
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,520
Before our trip,

217
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,320
Actually,

218
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,480
Ruilong and Wang Jue had already—

219
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,200
They made their own choices.

220
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,680
So he didn't join the journey.

221
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,200
Right, that's how it was.

222
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,320
You weren't in it either.

223
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:50,960
Were you in it?

224
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,920
You weren't in it either.

225
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,120
I wasn't in it either.

226
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,360
They went to Xinjiang back then.

227
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:55,680
They—

228
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,720
You guys really leave no suspense.

229
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,560
Wait, they—

230
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,840
They went to Xinjiang back then.

231
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,440
They are—

232
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,360
Was it you and Lechen, just the two of you?

233
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,160
You can keep watching.

234
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,440
So exciting!

235
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,520
In this kind of romantic setting,

236
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,680
everyone has their own thoughts.

237
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,160
Eight people.

238
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,240
The vibe between those two is pretty good now.

239
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,760
Teacher Duoduo is on fire again.

240
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,600
I'm on fire again.

241
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,720
Already hyped up!

242
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,280
So funny.

243
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,000
Nice singing.

244
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,840
You started on a really high note.

245
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,400
It's just the beginning.

246
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,000
Gotta set the mood.

247
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,720
The start and the end

248
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,920
feel like totally different vibes.

249
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,120
Yeah, suddenly it feels like—

250
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,000
the loneliness of a crowd

251
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,600
and the wild joy of a crowd.

252
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,200
I'm shipping them!

253
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,640
That really hits me.

254
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,960
When they left, it was just two people.

255
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,320
Dr. Fang smiled right away.

256
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,160
Everyone relaxed, look at him.

257
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,320
Who is this?

258
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,200
Who can handle this?

259
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,320
I shouldn't be in the car.

260
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,680
I should be under the car.

261
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:15,880
I don't want to watch.

262
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,560
I don't want to listen.

263
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,160
Nice singing.

264
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,240
I thought "I'm here" would sound so good.

265
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,120
You could just—

266
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,800
play it at five times speed.

267
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,520
What am I even waiting for?

268
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,720
I'm holding back laughter, who gets it?

269
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,200
Whose mic is it, anyway?

270
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,680
So hilarious.

271
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,080
Who are you singing to?

272
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,280
No one.

273
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,120
You should do a duet with her.

274
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,120
Do you know I like you?

275
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,520
When you say you can't sleep at night,

276
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,680
I want to tell you—

277
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,520
but I'm afraid I'll say it wrong.

278
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,840
Go find her.

279
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,880
Sit down.

280
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,000
Actually, in these kinds of

281
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,280
group activities,

282
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,280
we usually play

283
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,560
what kind of roles?

284
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,760
Teacher Duoduo,

285
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,680
I think Teacher Duoduo

286
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,040
is definitely the type

287
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,400
who organizes things, right?

288
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,720
Yes, I usually am

289
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,040
So you're the one who sets things up.

290
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,240
Yes, even for Hangzhou and Shanghai,

291
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,720
like after the show ended,

292
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,560
the first gathering

293
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,480
was actually because Ruilong

294
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,200
didn't join our trip.

295
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,360
So he organized one.

296
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,800
We all hope

297
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,960
our relationships

298
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,040
aren't just limited to

299
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,800
the house.

300
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,840
Because after leaving the house,

301
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,080
we show more sides of ourselves.

302
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,960
We want to make

303
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,800
friends for the long run.

304
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,320
What about you all?

305
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,760
During trips,

306
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,760
what roles do you play?

307
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,400
Me?

308
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,200
I usually just go along

309
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,240
with whatever.

310
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:04,800
Really.

311
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,840
You, a J type, on trips

312
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,720
can just let go?

313
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,080
I think

314
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,760
within reason,

315
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,000
everyone tries to relax

316
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,600
and take it easy.

317
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
Just have fun.

318
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,520
Except for traveling,

319
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,080
I'm very J type.

320
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,960
But for trips, I'm pure P type.

321
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,600
Others make all the plans.

322
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,600
I mainly just follow along.

323
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,400
I mostly bring my camera to capture

324
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,440
these moments.

325
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,000
So everyone can have

326
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,840
great memories.

327
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,120
I think that's also

328
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,880
what makes me really happy.

329
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:31,640
That's nice.

330
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,360
Everyone's pretty mature now.

331
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,920
Looking at this group,

332
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,040
if something's missing,

333
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,920
we fill the gap.

334
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,840
If nothing's missing,

335
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,960
we step back.

336
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,360
That's a really comfortable vibe.

337
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:41,720
Yeah.

338
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,720
The house's atmosphere is still harmonious.

339
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,600
We're also

340
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,720
getting closer and closer.

341
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,720
Yes, after leaving the house,

342
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,960
we actually keep in touch

343
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,000
quite often.

344
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,440
Let's keep watching then.

345
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,080
Okay.

346
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,000
Is this the Xinjiang trip?

347
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,600
Arrived in Xinjiang.

348
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,000
The weather changed instantly.

349
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,680
Really.

350
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,320
What are you thinking?

351
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,320
What?

352
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,800
Let's see.

353
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,760
Is it raining?

354
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,480
Probably.

355
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,760
That's why I say Xinjiang is magical.

356
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,400
How you feel

357
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:04,920
is how the weather is.

358
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,240
Before I watched episode nine,

359
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,400
I saw episode five.

360
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,280
When I watched this episode,

361
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,680
based on what I know about you,

362
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,120
whether you two mesh well

363
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,000
or not,

364
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,000
what happens in the future

365
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,320
doesn't really matter right now.

366
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,760
Back then, I thought

367
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,200
I'm totally fine

368
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,280
with working things out.

369
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,880
You definitely need to adjust.

370
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,440
Because at that time,

371
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,640
everyone in the house had only known each other

372
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,720
for just over twenty days.

373
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,520
So back then,

374
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,000
I wasn't too upset about long distance.

375
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,960
Because I knew

376
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,920
it's something we'd have to face later.

377
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,680
Yes.

378
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,840
Do you have any advice

379
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,120
for friends in long-distance relationships?

380
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,080
I'm a supporter of long-distance relationships.

381
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,480
When I'm in one,

382
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,800
I can

383
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,360
avoid being glued to them all the time.

384
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,960
I get more time

385
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,520
to focus on myself.

386
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,600
Here, on my own,

387
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,760
I grow independently.

388
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,880
But in my heart,

389
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,560
I still have emotional support.

390
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,640
And long-distance is usually

391
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,680
because of school,

392
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,200
or better opportunities.

393
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,320
That's why we're apart.

394
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,760
But it's all to pursue

395
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,640
a better self.

396
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,520
A better self now,

397
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,040
and a better us in the future.

398
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,640
Your view

399
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,080
is pretty fresh.

400
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,680
I never thought of it that way.

401
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,480
Let's keep watching then.

402
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,040
Reminds me of your

403
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,160
Passion Ride.

404
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,200
Passion Ride.

405
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,760
That's a good way to put it.

406
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,600
How did it suddenly

407
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,240
feel like

408
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,600
starting from zero frame

409
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,520
is kind of exciting.

410
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,880
You two can really hit it off.

411
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,640
What? What did you catch?

412
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,120
I'm disappointed.

413
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:02,920
You should have said it.

414
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,520
She wasn't asking about this.

415
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,600
Because maybe I was thinking

416
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,560
in a more general way.

417
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,520
I didn't realize

418
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,160
she was actually referring to that.

419
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,840
That specific thing.

420
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,760
I thought she meant the whole thing.

421
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,920
Okay, let's try again.

422
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,520
Now you realize

423
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,600
she wanted to ask about that.

424
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,960
How would you answer?

425
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,320
Are you someone

426
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:20,520
who sticks to your own beliefs?

427
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,720
Do you stick to your own beliefs?

428
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,240
Of course I do.

429
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,280
When it comes to relationships,

430
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,600
I think I'm still

431
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,520
someone who sticks to myself.

432
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,640
Because I think relationships

433
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,040
are different from other things.

434
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,480
Love is very subjective.

435
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,720
It's something with strong personal feelings.

436
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,320
Okay.

437
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,760
If I like someone, I just like them.

438
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,360
She actually

439
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,320
wants to be chosen firmly.

440
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,480
That's her state.

441
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,640
So actually, she

442
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,160
was asking you that question

443
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,320
because it was very important to her.

444
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,200
That question.

445
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,240
But I'm a bit slow.

446
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,760
So I didn't

447
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,920
get what she meant.

448
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,880
Chichi's first day on the show,

449
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,640
she wore that purple dress.

450
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,480
And hyacinths

451
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,280
are also purple.

452
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,960
I think girls really

453
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,480
like hearing guys compare them to

454
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,360
hyacinths. I think that's beautiful.

455
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,120
Yes, because Chichi gives

456
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,360
a very comfortable feeling.

457
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,040
She really has a quiet beauty.

458
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,480
But she's also a girl with her own theme.

459
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,600
But when she's with us,

460
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,200
including us girls,

461
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,080
at group gatherings,

462
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,440
she's not someone who

463
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,960
speaks up actively.

464
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,760
How are we supposed to respond to that?

465
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,200
I didn't expect

466
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,160
I'd say something like

467
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,520
chatting like that.

468
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,840
Your metaphors are so abstract.

469
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,240
I really wish

470
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,560
my brain could reboot every day.

471
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,240
As expected,

472
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,560
the next day I can't relate

473
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,800
to who I was yesterday.

474
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,800
That's Sunflower Bro.

475
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,240
Zihan is hilarious.

476
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,560
Your metaphors are so abstract.

477
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,760
Are they abstract?

478
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,640
What are you talking about now?

479
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,560
Honestly,

480
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,640
from a girl's perspective,

481
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,880
we really think that line

482
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,320
doesn't compliment us.

483
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,280
Brave Train Hero

484
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,880
is an anime.

485
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,640
Have you seen it?

486
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,080
No.

487
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:13,480
No.

488
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,040
No.

489
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,640
You know, it's kind of like

490
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,800
if I say you're like the moon,

491
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,560
and you don't get it.

492
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,320
Then I say, it's fine,

493
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,840
let's go with Sailor Moon.

494
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,920
It's like complimenting a guy

495
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,200
with a pretty weird comparison.

496
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,280
Really?

497
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,640
So you're okay

498
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,560
with being called Sailor Moon?

499
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,280
Are you fine with that?

500
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,120
I get it.

501
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,880
Sailor Moon

502
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,120
Should I say she's like a high-speed train?

503
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,920
Should I say she's like a high-speed train?

504
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,280
Should I say she's like a high-speed train?

505
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,640
Should I say she's like a high-speed train?

506
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,400
Stop teaching.

507
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,040
This can't be taught.

508
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,280
We were sitting face to face.

509
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,640
And drawing each other.

510
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,840
He drew me really ugly.

511
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,440
Then he didn't want to show me.

512
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:23,840
He said

513
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,560
he had to redo it

514
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,720
and draw a good one for me.

515
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,320
As Fang's roommate,

516
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,240
I think

517
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,160
Fang started out as

518
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,720
an "abstract" Picasso type

519
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,560
and became

520
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,560
a "realist."

521
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,600
He practiced by drawing you.

522
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,120
Yeah, he wanted to draw me too.

523
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,920
But later he gave me one

524
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,520
that was actually pretty good.

525
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,240
He really improved.

526
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,320
He was really serious

527
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,840
and put a lot of effort into it.

528
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,280
Chichi says

529
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,560
Which matters more, chemistry or
getting along?

530
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,840
What do you all think?

531
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:29,880
How do you see it?

532
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,040
Based on my personality,

533
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,200
you can probably tell

534
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,760
I personally lean toward

535
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,640
that first impression.

536
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,080
Chemistry is a mysterious thing.

537
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,160
As you grow up, you realize

538
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,080
very few things

539
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,200
can truly move you.

540
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,800
So I really treasure

541
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,560
anything that gives me that feeling.

542
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,440
If the chemistry isn't there,

543
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,080
no matter how much time you spend

544
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:48,800
or how long you interact,

545
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,720
it still might

546
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,200
never truly change.

547
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,120
Sure, a breakthrough needs time,

548
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,720
but I think chemistry is

549
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,800
the real magic spark.

550
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,560
I think

551
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,600
chemistry matters more to me.

552
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,200
Chemistry is sixty percent for me.

553
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,640
Because I'm the type

554
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,600
who meets someone

555
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,160
and instantly forms a rough idea

556
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,080
if this person is

557
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,200
friend material

558
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,000
or maybe

559
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,080
could become something more

560
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,240
and take things further.

561
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,480
From friends to maybe lovers—

562
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,600
there's a big

563
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,600
wall right there.

564
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,560
Yeah, you have to get past it.

565
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,280
You need that feeling first.

566
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,120
I just think

567
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,120
chemistry comes before connection.

568
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,200
If you don't feel

569
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,080
anything for someone,

570
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,800
how can you

571
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,720
connect with them later?

572
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,120
Exactly.

573
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:36,960
At least at first glance,

574
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,120
you're interested in them,

575
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,280
you want to know more.

576
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,280
You're curious about them.

577
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,440
Right, so I think

578
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,480
chemistry comes first, then connection.

579
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,840
Basically,

580
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,840
if you want a lasting relationship,

581
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,520
chemistry and connection

582
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,120
are both

583
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,280
equally important.

584
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,440
Yes, that's right.

585
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,520
Do you think the outcome matters?

586
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,040
I think

587
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,880
it does matter to some extent.

588
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,520
But I feel the journey

589
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,760
is a bit more important.

590
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,040
Sometimes,

591
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,480
the outcome isn't

592
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,880
fully in your control.

593
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,440
What you can control

594
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,200
is yourself.

595
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,960
You decide what to do

596
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,640
and in what state

597
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,240
you approach things.

598
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:35,800
So I think

599
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,840
the journey matters more.

600
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,760
For me,

601
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,640
outside of relationships,

602
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,760
I'm totally

603
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,880
result-oriented.

604
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,080
But in relationships,

605
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,000
if you look at the bigger picture,

606
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,200
I think connection

607
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,240
is really important.

608
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,200
We should cherish how we feel now.

609
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,400
The present experience and connection

610
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,760
Because in the journey,

611
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,120
the details never lie.

612
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,240
Whether happy or sad,

613
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,600
I think it's all beautiful.

614
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,720
It's all part of the experience.

615
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,560
Yes.

616
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,360
Alright.

617
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,080
Let's pause here for now.

618
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,680
There's more exciting content ahead

619
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,560
waiting for everyone.

620
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,280
Stay tuned!
