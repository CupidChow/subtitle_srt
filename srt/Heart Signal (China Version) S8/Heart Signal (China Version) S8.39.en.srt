1
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,560
We're about to meet.

2
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,680
You guys relax, I'll go call them.

3
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,240
This room smells amazing.

4
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,560
Everyone's saying "wow".

5
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:30,880
Hello, teacher.

6
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,440
Hello.

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,920
Hello.

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,080
Whose dish smells so good?

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,600
It smells incredible.

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,280
Thank you.

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,000
You're really good at giving compliments.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,560
You're so skilled.

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,640
Because the whole house smells great.

14
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,040
Um...

15
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:49,720
Chefs,

16
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,760
Let's take a moment

17
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,400
Some important friends are here today.

18
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,240
Let's go greet them together.

19
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:56,960
Let's say hello, okay?

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,320
Okay.

21
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:57,960
Okay.

22
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,320
I'll let them know first.

23
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,440
Then I'll come get you.

24
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,480
Alright, sounds good.

25
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,080
Chefs,

26
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,160
Zi Han,

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,360
Hello.

28
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,080
Hello, Du Ge.

29
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,600
Hello.

30
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,840
Some important friends are here today.

31
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,160
Let's go say hello first.

32
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,280
Then

33
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,840
we'll come back and finish cooking.

34
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,400
Okay.

35
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:15,880
No problem.

36
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,280
Let's go.

37
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,440
We're heading out.

38
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,480
Let's go.

39
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,880
It smells great over here too.

40
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,280
I walked over there earlier and said it was so fragrant.

41
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,640
Everyone wants to show off their skills today.

42
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,160
Today is really a showcase.

43
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,400
It's the Heartthrob Cooking Championship today.

44
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,640
Is there anything on my mouth?

45
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,480
Any oil?

46
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:32,840
Me?

47
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,280
Me?

48
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:33,720
No.

49
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,600
It's fine, looks good.

50
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,320
What about me?

51
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:35,880
How about my teeth?

52
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,520
No, looks fine.

53
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,800
Thanks.

54
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,360
They're here.

55
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,080
They're here.

56
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,960
We're here.

57
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,000
This is scary.

58
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,200
Don't move.

59
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,480
They have no idea who it is.

60
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,720
Absolutely no idea.

61
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,200
Hello.

62
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,960
Hello.

63
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,680
Here they come.

64
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,800
Hello.

65
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,680
Ruilong, "hello".

66
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,280
Wrong.

67
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,160
Go back, undo.

68
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,160
Which sisters were invited?

69
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,160
This is...

70
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,040
the family and friends support group.

71
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,320
We all have name tags.

72
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,480
You can see them at a glance.

73
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,840
We all have name tags.

74
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,040
You can see them at a glance.

75
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,840
Mom.

76
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,880
Scared to death.

77
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,320
Rubbing hands.

78
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,160
He's nervous.

79
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,280
This is a lot of pressure.

80
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,120
The male guests are all stunned.

81
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,840
Really.

82
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:57,800
Hello.

83
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,440
Hello.

84
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,720
Hello.

85
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,600
That's too much.

86
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,360
Hello.

87
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,240
Hello.

88
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,440
They're giving us that scrutinizing look.

89
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,080
Come on.

90
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,280
This...

91
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,000
Stand in a line.

92
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,160
Feels like a job interview.

93
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,120
This is really stressful.

94
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,160
Yeah, I think it's like

95
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,080
a big interview.

96
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,480
In that environment,

97
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,680
you can even hear people breathing.

98
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,120
It's so tense.

99
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,600
Yeah, I bought some snacks.

100
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,880
Yeah, I bought some snacks.

101
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,440
If anyone's hungry, feel free to have some.

102
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,120
Bro.

103
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,920
Thanks.

104
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,160
Chi Chi's mom will definitely be pleased.

105
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,880
So thoughtful.

106
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,600
Do something.

107
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,800
What are you up to, bro?

108
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,280
There’s also fruit.

109
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,440
Thanks.

110
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,320
We’ll help ourselves.

111
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,120
You really know how to handle things.

112
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,800
I think you need to be like this with the family and friends support group.

113
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,280
Yeah.

114
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,280
He’s just good at this.

115
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,240
I was just about to say that.

116
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,040
The moms will think

117
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,960
he’s very polite.

118
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,400
Yeah, confident and open.

119
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,440
That makes him really likable.

120
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,440
You’re making the five guys behind

121
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,680
feel like standing on pins and needles.

122
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,800
feel like standing on pins and needles.

123
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,960
Such an outstanding guy.

124
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,520
What’s your name again?

125
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,040
I’m Jin Yuxing.

126
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,920
What do you do for work?

127
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,000
I’m currently in Yiwu,

128
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,040
running an e-commerce company.

129
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,880
Who do you usually walk your dog with?

130
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,680
Usually,

131
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,880
That expression.

132
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,240
I usually walk Nicole and Winnie more often.

133
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:02,680
I didn't ask you that.

134
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,760
Who asked you about that?

135
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,640
Who asked about your dogs?

136
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,600
I'm asking who you walk with.

137
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,960
With whom?

138
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,120
You're making me so anxious.

139
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,600
That was a clever answer.

140
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,640
Relaxed.

141
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,800
Just greet everyone casually.

142
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,640
We'll all be family in the future.

143
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,800
Family, got it.

144
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,400
Welcome to our big family.

145
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,040
By the way,

146
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,200
My name is Liu Zihan.

147
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,080
I'm currently in Shanghai.

148
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,160
I'm starting my own business.

149
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,480
Hello, everyone.

150
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,720
My name is Ruilong.

151
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,400
I'm also in Shanghai now.

152
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,960
I work in the audit department.

153
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,440
I also do IT work.

154
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,400
What's your specialty dish?

155
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,560
Today I made beef rice.

156
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,880
Which girl likes beef rice?

157
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,640
Here we go again.

158
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,000
Uh...

159
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,760
Ruilong turned red so fast.

160
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,440
Why are you blushing?

161
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,800
You finished talking and your whole face...

162
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,400
Now you've become "beef rice."

163
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,760
He blushed in an instant.

164
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,400
Chameleon.

165
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,000
Red-hot.

166
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,000
Guys who blush are really cute.

167
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,720
It's fine.

168
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,360
Got it.

169
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:13,880
Alright.

170
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,560
Hello everyone, I'm Jiao Zhiheng.

171
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,400
You can call me Xiao Jiao.

172
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,760
Because the last two characters are hard to remember.

173
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,080
I'm currently in Shanghai.

174
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,360
I work at an internet company.

175
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,040
Welcome, everyone.

176
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,640
Okay.

177
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,920
So, whose family and friends are you most looking forward to today?

178
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,880
Who will get to try your dish first?

179
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:31,960
That's a tough question.

180
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,240
So many ways to ask.

181
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,800
I'm looking forward to everyone trying more.

182
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,320
Thank you.

183
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,440
Hello, ladies.

184
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,200
Hello, ladies.

185
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,880
Smart.

186
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,600
Calling them "ladies" was clever.

187
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,000
Nice.

188
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,200
My name is Wang Lechen.

189
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,920
"Le" as in "happy,"

190
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,560
"Chen" as in "morning."

191
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,600
I'm currently in Hangzhou.

192
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,760
I work at an environmental tech company.

193
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,320
I do branding and business.

194
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,200
So you...

195
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,360
Because I cooked the food,

196
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:05,880
I hope

197
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,120
everyone can try my dish.

198
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,880
Treat everyone equally.

199
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,400
Hello, everyone.

200
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,560
My name is Fang Yijiong.

201
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,120
You can call me Xiao Fang.

202
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,480
I work in Hangzhou.

203
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm an ophthalmologist.

204
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,520
Usually, the dishes I cook

205
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,800
are mostly Hangzhou cuisine.

206
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,240
They're usually mild in flavor.

207
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,160
But today I made something spicy.

208
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,880
Why did you make something spicy today?

209
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,480
I wanted to cook it.

210
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,600
Who did you want to cook for?

211
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,720
Who did you want to cook for?

212
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,560
Who likes spicy food?

213
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,040
So they're guessing too.

214
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,320
They're guessing as well.

215
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,920
No one dares to say.

216
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,960
You should say it.

217
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:46,960
Rubbing hands.

218
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,280
Because some dishes

219
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,080
are still cooking.

220
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,720
Yes.

221
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,720
So I said,

222
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,280
Like this.

223
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,640
Who has finished cooking?

224
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,960
Then take our family and friends

225
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,080
to have a look around.

226
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,320
Whoever's done can stay.

227
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,240
If you're not done, hurry and finish up.

228
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,640
Let's go cook first.

229
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,160
Okay.

230
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,280
Making a quick escape.

231
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,920
I think we need to hurry up.

232
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,320
You can tell who this is for just by looking.

233
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,440
That makes it even more special.

234
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,000
Yeah.

235
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,360
Sorry.

236
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,000
Don’t worry.

237
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,160
Is it burnt?

238
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,200
I think I should stir-fry first.

239
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,840
Yeah, stir-fry the chili and meat first.

240
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,720
First.

241
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,560
Put on the apron.

242
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,640
That just scared me to death.

243
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,720
Put it on the plate.

244
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,600
Rinse it first.

245
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,200
Left in front of them.

246
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,600
Those three "warriors".

247
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,760
I’ve noticed guys are really impressive these days.

248
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,080
Not nervous at all.

249
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,640
Yeah, I think so too.

250
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,840
Very positive, right?

251
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,640
Mom is sizing them up.

252
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,240
My hands are shaking.

253
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,080
You really do get nervous.

254
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,760
Scared.

255
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,440
Because I was in that situation.

256
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,840
The nervousness everyone saw.

257
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,760
On site.

258
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,960
Even more nervous than this.

259
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,480
Still nervous.

260
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,040
Why are my hands shaking?

261
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,840
I feel like right now

262
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,520
my heart rate must be 180.

263
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,000
Heart rate 180.

264
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,160
That’s terrifying.

265
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,000
Did you see that rising curve?

266
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,600
I’ll take it over first.

267
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:27,960
Okay, you take it over.

268
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,560
Take it over.

269
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,440
"Warrior".

270
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,320
Try this first.

271
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:33,880
"Warrior".

272
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,120
Zi Han hands it to the elders with both hands.

273
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,360
Let’s do it ourselves then.

274
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,520
Thanks, just leave it there.

275
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,000
Thank you.

276
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,160
Thanks.

277
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,400
Only one person is happily snacking.

278
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,640
I actually feel pretty relaxed.

279
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,480
It tastes pretty good.

280
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,240
The three of us represent all the guys.

281
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,000
Let's take everyone to tour a room together.

282
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,600
Let's turn around.

283
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,520
He's really a "warrior."

284
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,360
He even has to bring the moms.

285
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,160
For sightseeing.

286
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,320
That's impressive.

287
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,160
This one, no.

288
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,640
If there's no tour guide flag, I'll just raise my hand.

289
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,000
Alright.

290
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:16,880
Okay.

291
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,400
Sure.

292
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,760
Over here is...

293
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,600
We already have four rooms on the first floor.

294
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,080
Then everyone goes in here.

295
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,760
It's just...

296
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,440
"Sleeping."

297
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,720
"Sleeping."

298
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,440
The word "sleeping" just means...

299
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,160
It's a pretty comprehensive term.

300
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,480
Living and sleeping.

301
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,960
Yes, this is my room.

302
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,440
And it's a single room.

303
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,040
So tidy.

304
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,760
You have a single room?

305
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,520
Are you getting special treatment?

306
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,400
There's even a single room.

307
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,960
This bed is probably big.

308
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,520
Only a big one suits me.

309
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,640
Are you 1.9 meters tall?

310
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,680
I'm over 1.9 meters.

311
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,320
1.92 meters.

312
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,440
You look really tall.

313
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,680
If the sky falls, I'll hold it up first.

314
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,280
Chichi's mom is paying attention to Zi Han now.

315
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,840
She just wants to say...

316
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,040
If my child meets a guy like this,

317
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,480
he would make her happy.

318
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,040
Yes, this is...

319
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,000
Who?

320
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,360
Playing that.

321
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,240
That's Ruilong's.

322
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,440
The handsome guy from just now.

323
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,200
Impressive.

324
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,360
I've noticed that guys nowadays

325
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,200
are really talented.

326
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,360
There are more and more of them.

327
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,040
Le Chen quietly follows at the back.

328
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,240
Chen, you lead the second floor.

329
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,840
Together.

330
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,760
You're also on the second floor.

331
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,720
I'm also on the second floor.

332
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,120
Invisible person

333
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,440
Moms, sisters, and best friends

334
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,640
We were chatting so well just now

335
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,120
Now that the guys are here

336
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,280
They can't see us at all

337
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,200
The sense of novelty is important

338
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,880
Once the novelty wears off, they'll come back

339
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,880
Wang Jue's sister-in-law is so funny

340
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,960
She really knows how to talk

341
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,440
Actually, I feel like

342
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,320
Are these two stools reserved for us?

343
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,320
This is what I mean, look

344
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,040
Invisible stools

345
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,000
So over here, we're just

346
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,240
"invisible people"

347
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,600
Watch your step on the stairs

348
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,560
Is it just two floors in total?

349
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,800
Yes, we have two floors

350
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,480
There are four rooms downstairs

351
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,880
And four rooms upstairs too

352
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,240
The view outside is pretty nice

353
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,640
This is a double room

354
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,200
So tidy

355
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,440
This is the area where everyone stays

356
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,400
And over there is where we eat and cook

357
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,520
Everyone needs to go

358
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,480
Move over to our living area

359
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,280
Alright, let's go

360
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,080
So well-behaved

361
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:31,920
This feels a bit like

362
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,600
A realtor showing us a house

363
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,480
This is the living room area

364
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,320
This is a bedroom

365
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,800
Hello

366
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,160
Yuan Yuan is back

367
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,240
Mom

368
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,120
My daughter

369
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,080
You already toured over there, right?

370
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,280
Yes, we even used the bathroom in your room

371
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,360
It was obvious it was your room

372
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,960
Definitely your room

373
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,400
So skinny

374
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,320
Moms always think their kids are too thin

375
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,320
Go in

376
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,120
Why are you the only girl who came back?

377
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,120
I just arrived

378
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,760
Catching my breath

379
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,080
Feels like she's about to faint

380
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,440
Xiao Yuan has a mysterious smile

381
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:17,880
Yes

382
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,680
Her hands are freezing

383
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,240
Not cold, right?

384
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,320
Come here

385
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,400
Hello

386
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,800
Here to check out the cooking

387
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,960
This is Chi Chi's mom

388
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,200
Yes, Chi Chi's mom

389
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,400
This is our kitchen on the first floor

390
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,680
Actually, we've already prepared some of it

391
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,200
And we're waiting for everyone to come

392
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:36,760
Smells so good

393
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,480
You can already smell the aroma

394
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,000
Yes, for example, today we really made some

395
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,040
Even such complicated dishes can be made

396
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,680
Yes, our chef

397
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,640
Your cooking smells amazing

398
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,400
I told you, guys are so talented these days

399
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,120
Mom is thinking

400
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,880
My daughter won't go hungry in the future

401
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,680
And they're still cooking

402
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,480
Later, everyone should eat more

403
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,040
And it's raining outside today

404
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,960
I made some ginger tea

405
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,120
Everyone can warm up with it

406
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,000
So thoughtful, look at that

407
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:13,880
Okay

408
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,440
Thank you

409
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,720
I'll pour some for everyone

410
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,120
Spilled it

411
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,080
It's leaking out.

412
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,520
I didn't see it, sorry.

413
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,520
Look how great Chi Chi's mom is.

414
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,480
The kitchen is mom's domain.

415
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,560
Let me do it.

416
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:39,800
You go ahead with what you're doing.

417
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,360
When you pour it,

418
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,360
it tends to leak this way.

419
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,680
Maybe try pouring with the lid off.

420
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,160
Okay.

421
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,120
Pouring with the lid off, right?

422
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,440
Then it won't leak out.

423
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,760
I'm just worried about the ginger inside.

424
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,880
I mainly don't want to pour it out for you.

425
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,040
I'm afraid you'll get ginger shreds in your drink.

426
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,720
If you want ginger tea, take it here.

427
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,120
Xiao Liu made ginger tea.

428
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,640
Got it.

429
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,000
Xiao Liu is impressive.

430
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,120
He's been recognized.

431
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,000
Thank you.

432
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,520
So thoughtful.

433
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,240
Did you check over there too?

434
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,640
Both sides.

435
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,520
No.

436
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,240
There's another room over there.

437
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,160
Where? Where else?

438
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:22,640
Show us.

439
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,440
Right.

440
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,120
I shouldn't say too much.

441
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,280
Sorry.

442
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,720
We're invisible right now.

443
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,640
Yeah, you can't see me.

444
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,440
Can't see us.

445
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,480
This looks amazing.

446
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,240
Thank you.

447
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,600
All these dishes are spicy.

448
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,720
Everyone's coughing.

449
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,480
Cilantro beef.

450
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,760
Lan Lan loves this.

451
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,080
It's a bit spicy.

452
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,360
It's making me sweat.

453
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,240
Lan Lan's sister is here.

454
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,320
So today's spicy dishes

455
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,920
are all your responsibility?

456
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,360
Yes.

457
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,800
Impressive.

458
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,200
Your family must really like spicy food.

459
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,160
Yes, people from Jiangxi can handle spicy food.

460
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,480
Don't get this wrong.

461
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,800
The moms are like detectives.

462
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,560
I'm going to wash my hands.

463
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:40,600
Okay.

464
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,640
Thank you.

465
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,000
So well-behaved.

466
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,800
How long have you been cooking?

467
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,920
This meal.

468
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,800
For a while now.

469
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,960
We arrived around four.

470
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,600
Four o'clock.

471
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
Started cooking at four.

472
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,360
You did all the washing and chopping yourselves?

473
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,600
Did you do everything yourselves?

474
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,080
That's great.

475
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,360
I saw you finished everything.

476
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,240
And you cleaned up right after.

477
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,560
Yes.

478
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:15,800
Very good.

479
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,520
Do you work in information technology?

480
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,960
Wang Jue's sister-in-law remembered.

481
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,120
I'm in the audit department.

482
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,600
I can do some information technology work.

483
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,680
You guys are amazing.

484
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,520
Auntie, you and Duoduo look so alike.

485
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,280
Do we?

486
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,520
You recognized it.

487
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,120
Isn't it written here?

488
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,160
You look so young.

489
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,720
You seem like a high schooler.

490
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,360
The youngest one.

491
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,560
Feels like a high school student.

492
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,960
She must be the youngest.

493
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,680
Definitely the youngest.

494
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,200
You all know.

495
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,480
Your mom said so.

496
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,640
You're still studying.

497
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,200
You're still in school.

498
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,360
The atmosphere is so different with moms around.

499
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,920
This is also, in all these seasons of Heartthrob,

500
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,760
the first time we've had family members join us.

501
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,400
And everyone's

502
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,000
feelings

503
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,880
are really different too.

504
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:07,840
I really liked

505
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,520
how Zihan acted just now.

506
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,960
He was carrying

507
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,280
that plate.

508
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,200
He handed it to the elder with both hands.

509
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,320
He was very polite.

510
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,840
I thought Zihan's behavior

511
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,240
was both appropriate

512
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,400
and showed his own thoughtfulness.

513
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,560
He quickly seized this little opportunity.

514
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:22,800
He made an impression on Chichi's mom.

515
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,120
He made an impression on Chichi's mom.

516
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:24,600
He made an impression on Chichi's mom.

517
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,800
And later, it was great too.

518
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,600
She just called him Xiao Liu.

519
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,680
She (Sun Hanqing's mom) called him Xiao Liu.

520
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,880
He showed himself again.

521
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,400
But it was reasonable.

522
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,440
I remember you now.

523
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,640
Have you ever met

524
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,920
the family and friends of someone you like?

525
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,080
I really enjoy meeting elders.

526
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,280
I don't feel pressured.

527
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:39,960
No pressure at all.

528
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,560
Instead, I have a great time chatting.

529
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,320
And I learn a lot from them.

530
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,680
I also ask

531
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,920
about things I care about.

532
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,560
Then they share with me

533
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,240
their experiences.

534
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,680
Every time I talk with them,

535
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,440
I gain a lot.

536
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,880
Definitely.

537
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,480
That’s a big plus for you in this show.

538
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,120
And usually, when I'm with elders,

539
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,920
I choose a tea house.

540
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,120
So usually,

541
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,200
there’s no generation gap.

542
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,960
Because elders love drinking tea.

543
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,320
Starting with tea,

544
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,080
if you begin that way,

545
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,680
it naturally

546
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,000
gets you into their world.

547
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,720
Then you can chat easily.

548
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,080
That's right.

549
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,880
With elders,

550
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,520
it feels much better.

551
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,440
You can have deep conversations.

552
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,280
Yes.

553
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,400
Lanlan.

554
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,440
Hello.

555
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,160
Lanlan.

556
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,280
Hello.

557
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,520
Did you just get off work?

558
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:31,960
Yes.

559
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,040
You look beautiful today.

560
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,280
Hello.

561
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:35,800
Hello.

562
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,840
Give me the umbrella.

563
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,800
Thank you.

564
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,560
Please come in.

565
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,280
Hello, Lanlan.

566
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,120
Hello.

567
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,360
Is that your sister?

568
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,640
Sister.

569
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,640
She’s already here?

570
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,120
Yes.

571
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,520
Jiajia.

572
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,240
Hello, everyone.

573
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,840
I'm Lanlan.

574
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,080
I'm Lanlan.

575
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,880
Hello, everyone.

576
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,680
So pretty.

577
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,520
So nervous.

578
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,240
I'm just standing here.

579
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,880
Hello.

580
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,240
Hello.

581
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,200
We should be more enthusiastic.

582
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,920
Come back, have a seat.

583
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,600
Come on.

584
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,640
Where do you want to sit? Come.

585
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,000
Is this your first time

586
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
cooking on such a large scale?

587
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,960
No.

588
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,200
Actually, when everyone comes home,

589
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,040
we all head to the kitchen.

590
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,720
We always make big dishes.

591
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,800
Really?

592
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,440
And then the whole kitchen

593
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,040
gets taken over by Dr. Xiao Fang.

594
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,280
And everything is spicy.

595
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:53,880
Is that so?

596
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,200
Because Lanlan loves spicy food.

597
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,440
Duoduo is back.

598
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,200
Duoduo.

599
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,240
Your daughter is here.

600
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,400
I'm so nervous.

601
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,080
For me.

602
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,040
Anxious.

603
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,000
Seriously.

604
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,040
I'm dying of anxiety.

605
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,320
I'm so happy to see mom.

606
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,240
Are you okay?

607
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:27,720
I'm fine.

608
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,720
Okay, then sit down.

609
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,760
Sit next to me.

610
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,520
I won't sit next to you.

611
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,200
It makes me look too dark.

612
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,240
Yeah, she's really fair-skinned.

613
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,760
I'm sitting in the mom's seat.

614
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,480
Hello everyone, hello teacher.

615
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,280
Sorry.

616
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,280
You really didn't see.

617
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,560
I only saw my mom, sorry.

618
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,840
Hello, teacher.

619
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,360
You're invisible again.

620
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:49,800
Don't say that.

621
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,760
In this environment,

622
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,040
I'm still pretty ordinary.

623
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,520
There's another bowl (of fruit) here.

624
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,040
Everyone can have some.

625
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,840
Thank you.

626
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,520
No, you're not in charge of us.

627
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,920
Why are you managing me?

628
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,440
Right, we're all guests.

629
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,000
We're all guests.

630
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,120
Why are you managing me?

631
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,480
Give it to whoever you should.

632
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,280
You are...

633
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,000
No need.

634
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:19,800
Look.

635
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,320
Look.

636
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,480
Kneeling down.

637
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,640
No need for such a grand gesture.

638
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,400
Don't.

639
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,240
Really, don't.

640
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,560
No, I just peeled one for them.

641
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,640
Even kneeling for this.

642
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,120
No.

643
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,480
Teacher Zihan, what are you doing now?

644
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,840
Then what should I do?

645
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,240
If he doesn't get up, I won't get up either.

646
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:44,960
Get up.

647
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,720
Everyone's kneeling.

648
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,880
Is this a Qiong Yao drama?

649
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,440
Thank you.

650
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,080
You're welcome.

651
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,720
Xiao Jiao is really great.

652
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,680
The more I see, the better.

653
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,720
Thank you.

654
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,360
No problem.

655
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,080
Big sister sees everything.

656
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,840
Ruilong.

657
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,800
Looking over here,

658
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,160
there's so much to learn.

659
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,600
Ruilong is kneeling here too.

660
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,960
This scene feels just like New Year's.

661
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:20,920
Duoduo.

662
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:21,880
Thank you.

663
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,400
Thank you.

664
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,440
Take it.

665
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,640
Give it to Chichi's mom.

666
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,120
Zihan must be thinking,

667
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,720
Guys, hurry up and help.

668
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,560
My hands can't keep up.

669
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,040
I got a sneak peek of this whole experience.

670
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,880
The fun of meeting the parents.

671
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,880
Watching from the sidelines is definitely the most fun.

672
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,160
Hello.

673
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,320
Wang Jue.

674
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,760
Yifan.

675
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,120
Hi, everyone.

676
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,160
Over here.

677
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,200
So nervous.

678
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:11,800
Hello.

679
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,760
Everyone reacts the same way.

680
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,760
They're back.

681
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,280
They're back.

682
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,240
Come, have a seat.

683
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,880
Come, sit down.

684
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,800
Find your own family.

685
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,160
Let me find my family.

686
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,280
Come quickly.

687
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,080
My baby.

688
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,680
Hello, everyone.

689
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,640
Hello.

690
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,040
Hello.

691
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,400
Hi, everyone.

692
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,760
You're the last one.

693
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,400
Mom.

694
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,120
Mom is really adorable.

695
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,400
Are you cold, honey?

696
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,000
I'm okay.

697
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,640
I really like this mom.

698
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,720
Chichi's mom.

699
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,200
So cute.

700
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,240
You've lost weight again lately.

701
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,240
You've gotten even slimmer recently.

702
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,800
You noticed!

703
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,600
I could tell right away you lost weight.

704
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,640
So how many people are cooking in the kitchen now?

705
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,680
Everyone except those three is cooking.

706
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,440
Except for those three.

707
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,880
All the chefs are over there.

708
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,920
The three of us finished faster.

709
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,160
Mainly because

710
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,280
Everyone's dishes are easy to recognize.

711
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,080
We've all tried them before.

712
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,720
Yeah.

713
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,840
Is everyone here now?

714
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,000
Yes.

715
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,960
I'm hungry.

716
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,120
Shall we go take a look?

717
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,120
Sure.

718
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,240
Who hasn't finished cooking yet?

719
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,320
Then let's get ready.

720
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:15,920
We can start eating now.

721
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,680
Okay.

722
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,080
So many people.

723
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,120
Look at this big family.

724
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,920
Yifan.

725
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,640
Just grab it from there.

726
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,760
Honestly, Xiao Jiao is

727
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,400
the quiet, action-oriented type.

728
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,480
Seriously, he always shows up when it counts.

729
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:35,920
Yeah.

730
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,640
Exactly, he proves himself through actions.

731
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,360
The most thoughtful person here.

732
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:39,960
He's really considerate.

733
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,880
The most gentlemanly one.

734
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,440
See, everyone noticed.

735
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:43,920
Here.

736
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,200
Just take a handful.

737
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,520
Thank you.

738
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,000
Just take it.

739
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,280
Thanks.

740
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,280
This actually earns extra points.

741
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,440
If it were my daughter, I'd say Xiao Jiao is great.

742
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,320
Let's each

743
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,800
bring our delicious dishes over.

744
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,640
Alright, let's go.

745
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:07,880
Long table.

746
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,200
It looks pretty atmospheric like this.

747
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,360
Really.

748
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:19,200
This is the biggest table ever.

749
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,000
I was just thinking,

750
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,600
with such a huge table,

751
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,760
how do I manage the crowd?

752
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,200
Slow down.

753
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,920
Put the lobster in the middle.

754
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,440
Give it to me.

755
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,400
Put the lobster on both sides.

756
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,160
Because there are two lobsters.

757
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,560
Yeah, looks like there are two lobsters.

758
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,160
What's going on?

759
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:44,760
Take a deep breath.

760
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,240
What's wrong?

761
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,680
That's terrifying.

762
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,680
So scary.

763
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,920
After all, your mom is here.

764
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,120
His mom came too.

765
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,680
What do you mean my mom came?

766
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,920
Didn't your mom come too?

767
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,440
Mine didn't.

768
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:55,720
No.

769
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,400
What?

770
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:57,680
No.

771
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,400
They're coming out.

772
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:01,880
Let's go.

773
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,160
Go.

774
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,200
So many.

775
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,600
This is so romantic.

776
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,880
We still need this.

777
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,360
Where to sit is the next problem.

778
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,160
This one looks the best.

779
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,760
Even Rui Long

780
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,000
is confused.

781
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,960
We have to pick seats again.

782
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,920
What should we do about this?

783
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,320
How should we sit?

784
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,440
That's a problem too.

785
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,120
Put it over there.

786
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,120
Mr. Yu Xing, yes.

787
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:30,720
This side.

788
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,560
Yes, that side is empty.

789
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:36,920
Let's sit.

790
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,160
Sit.

791
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:38,800
Sit.

792
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,840
Sit.

793
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,560
How do we sit?

794
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,600
This side works too.

795
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,040
You two, us two.

796
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:43,760
Okay.

797
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,360
Find a seat and sit down first.

798
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,840
Mom, you sit. You go first.

799
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,360
The family and friends group and the girls are all in the middle now.

800
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,360
We need to separate them.

801
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,800
Yeah, we need to mix it up.

802
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,080
It'll be hard to talk like this.

803
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,920
Let's see what to do.

804
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,120
Seating is really a big issue.

805
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,440
Let's do it this way.

806
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,480
Here they come.

807
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,360
Let's do it like this.

808
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,520
Ours...

809
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,600
Every other family,

810
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,280
then put a guy to help everyone.

811
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:22,760
Alright.

812
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,600
Brother Herry (Liu Zi Han)

813
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,560
Emotional intelligence.

814
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,800
Very high emotional intelligence.

815
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,120
He said he'd help everyone.

816
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,520
Xiao Liu gets another point for this.

817
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,680
It's decided.

818
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,080
Every other family,

819
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,760
then put a guy to help everyone.

820
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,160
Alright.

821
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:39,960
Okay.

822
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,480
He has some leadership skills.

823
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,920
You're good at hosting.

824
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,880
You really get it.

825
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,280
You really understand.

826
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,120
Feels like mom praised Xiao Liu again.

827
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,320
Okay.

828
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,960
That's good.

829
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,560
Really smart.

830
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,680
Come on.

831
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,480
Parents should really like this.

832
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,960
You sit over there.

833
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,720
Let me switch seats with you.

834
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,640
Then we need to...

835
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,440
Let me switch seats with you.

836
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,320
Okay.

837
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,600
Alright, here comes another problem.

838
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,320
This is really

839
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,480
a game of musical chairs.

840
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,000
Hurry!

841
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,600
You can't wait for this.

842
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:20,880
Sit down quickly!

843
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,800
Hurry!

844
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,520
This is a rare chance.

845
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,120
Hurry!

846
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,240
You can sit now.

847
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,040
You can sit now, go for it!

848
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:25,920
Look, they're rushing in.

849
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,560
See?

850
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,800
Xiao Fang is here.

851
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,320
Here he comes.

852
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,480
He rushed over.

853
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,920
Not giving anyone a chance.

854
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,440
Now's not the time to be polite.

855
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:34,880
Now's not the time to be polite.

856
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,920
Xiao Fang really is

857
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,800
a sharp "scalpel."

858
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,040
But Xiao Fang is also the first one

859
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,880
to openly, in front of everyone,

860
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,600
show himself.

861
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,560
Xiao Jiao.

862
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,200
That's intense.

863
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,560
Did you get off work early today?

864
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:53,960
I took half a day off.

865
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,240
Xiao Jiao.

866
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,960
The speed you ran to get the umbrella just now—

867
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,960
Where did you go?

868
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:04,600
You startled me.

869
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,840
You gave me a fright.

870
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,600
Suddenly startled me.

871
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,560
Then I...

872
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,800
Is there still anyone coming?

873
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,640
Yes.

874
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,000
Shouldn't you sit here then?

875
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,280
Do you want to switch seats with me?

876
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,760
I mean, if the person next to you is—

877
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,720
She's helping her create an opportunity.

878
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,480
Then switch seats with me.

879
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,360
Switch seats with me, come on.

880
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,080
Good friends.

881
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:30,680
Besties.

882
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,840
Got it, everyone understands, see?

883
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,480
Is that okay?

884
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,160
It's fine.

885
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,920
The seat is waiting.

886
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,480
Everyone is standing.

887
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,200
Why isn't anyone sitting?

888
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,600
I mean, why isn't anyone sitting?

889
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,120
See, here comes Yu Xing.

890
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,760
Look, Yu Xing is making his intentions clear.

891
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:56,920
Look, Yu Xing is making his intentions clear.

892
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,240
Darn it.

893
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:00,640
Darn it.

894
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,240
Heartbroken.

895
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,000
Switched seats for nothing.

896
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,080
I made spicy stir-fried pork today.

897
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,440
I put in ten chili peppers.

898
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,040
I saw it.

899
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,760
Over there.

900
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,200
My hands are still burning.

901
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,080
Really?

902
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,520
Chi Chi is happy now.

903
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,640
What should we do?

904
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,480
What should we do?

905
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,040
Le Chen, hurry up!

906
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,800
What are you waiting for?

907
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,520
Le Chen went over.

908
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,480
See?

909
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,520
Le Chen.

910
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,360
Le Chen went over.

911
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,960
Did you make this?

912
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,480
No.

913
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,560
Really, no.

914
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,400
Really, no.

915
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,640
But next to Le Chen is Duo Duo's mom again.

916
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,720
That's pretty awkward for him.

917
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,160
Rui Long.

918
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,120
Rui Long.

919
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:45,880
Rui Long.

920
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,040
Let's go.

921
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,080
Alright, then I'll sit at the end.

922
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,240
I'll go with those two.

923
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,640
You and me, I'll go over there.

924
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,360
You sit.

925
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,360
Rui Long didn't sit next to her (Wang Jue).

926
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,800
Rui Long didn't sit next to Wang Jue.

927
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,800
Nor did he sit next to Duo Duo.

928
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,760
This seat is really obvious.

929
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:07,720
Sit.

930
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,200
Alright.

931
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,240
Chi Chi's seat got taken.

932
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,000
Can you hand that to me?

933
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,240
Do you want it?

934
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,240
Thank you.

935
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,760
Mom understands now.

936
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,240
Mom sees what's going on.

937
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,680
Everyone's seated.

938
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,200
Everyone's seated.

939
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,160
What are you doing here?

940
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,800
Why is there someone else?

941
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,360
There's still someone.

942
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,000
You missed the important seating part.

943
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,320
How did everyone choose their seats?

944
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,000
Let me take a look first.

945
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,200
How did everyone pick their seats?

946
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,640
Look at everyone here.

947
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,480
You two sat together.

948
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,040
That's a good spot.

949
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,600
Yes.

950
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,200
Can I sit here then?

951
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:04,880
No, you can't.

952
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,160
Yuan Yuan is so straightforward.

953
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,760
Interrupting people doing their thing.

954
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,840
You really have no sense.

955
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,680
Can I sit here then?

956
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,400
No, you can't.

957
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,600
Instantly frozen.

958
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,920
Yuan Yuan is adorable.

959
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,000
Why can't I sit here?

960
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,520
This spot is perfect for me to host.

961
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,240
Not suitable.

962
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:22,760
Not suitable.

963
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,560
This isn't the "head seat."

964
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,600
The "head seat" is over there.

965
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,320
Xiao Ma.

966
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,040
This side really...

967
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,080
Feels like they don't even want me standing here.

968
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,680
I'm extra here.

969
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,800
I'll move over here then.

970
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,280
That's fine.

971
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:42,560
Um...

972
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,200
Duo Duo, I won't sit here.

973
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,640
I won't sit here.

974
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,200
Honestly, there's nothing special about this seat.

975
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,560
Just take care of it.

976
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,360
Okay.

977
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,000
Take care.

978
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,840
Okay.

979
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,560
How about adding another chair?

980
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,720
No.

981
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,320
Why not?

982
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,120
Tell me, why not?

983
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,120
How is it not okay?

984
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,080
Why isn't it okay?

985
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:06,880
It just isn't.

986
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,360
You just can't.

987
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,120
Alright.

988
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,880
His possessiveness is really strong.

989
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,880
His possessiveness is really strong.

990
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,040
I can only sit here.

991
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,600
I have nowhere to sit.

992
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,800
Or...

993
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,200
Maybe I shouldn't sit here after all.

994
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,440
Yeah.

995
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,560
He wants to sit opposite Chi Chi's mom.

996
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,360
Right?

997
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:33,600
Yes.

998
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:34,960
Actually, everyone...

999
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,000
has already picked their seats.

1000
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,600
That's kind of the case already.

1001
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,800
Got it.

1002
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,240
Okay.

1003
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,080
Because I...

1004
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,840
Because I want to sit with you.

1005
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:47,840
Then...

1006
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,200
Why by yourself?

1007
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,520
What are you doing? What do you want?

1008
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,680
You sit.

1009
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,880
He's so intentional.

1010
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,200
No, he's sitting on the other side of Lan Lan.

1011
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,280
He's sitting here.

1012
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,680
Feels like he's not offending anyone this way.

1013
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,080
Not bad.

1014
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,040
Looks like I have to give up my seat.

1015
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,240
You...

1016
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,960
No, I...

1017
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,080
I'm sitting here.

1018
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,160
You sit here, it's convenient.

1019
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,560
It's convenient for me here.

1020
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,520
Yuan Yuan is so cute.

1021
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,200
She just won't let me.

1022
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,560
So adorable.

1023
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,600
This is pretty good.

1024
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,280
Quite interesting.

1025
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,760
I'm sitting here.

1026
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,760
You sit here, it's convenient.

1027
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,320
It's convenient for me here.

1028
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,680
Very determined.

1029
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,680
Isn't it inconvenient to sit here?

1030
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,920
You two are sitting across from each other.

1031
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,240
You're not saying a word, huh?

1032
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,960
You just secretly enjoy yourself every day.

1033
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,160
Then I'll sit here.

1034
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:03,640
That's fine.

1035
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,440
Don't mention sitting here.

1036
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,360
There really aren't any utensils.

1037
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,800
Alright, then us guys

1038
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,080
will introduce our dishes.

1039
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:17,600
Is that okay?

1040
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,120
Hello, everyone.

1041
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,200
I made three dishes today.

1042
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,800
One is

1043
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,800
Tamagoyaki.

1044
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,480
The dish farthest from you.

1045
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,680
There's also simple salmon.

1046
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,120
And another one is

1047
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,480
beef rice.

1048
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,400
Hello, everyone.

1049
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,720
I made three dishes today.

1050
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:40,680
This one is

1051
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,000
Thai-style curry chicken.

1052
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,400
It looks really delicious.

1053
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,960
And another dish is stir-fried pork with chili.

1054
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,800
I really like this one.

1055
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,280
And there's also pan-seared steak.

1056
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,640
Why did I choose these three dishes?

1057
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,120
Because one is Thai-style,

1058
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,200
one is Chinese,

1059
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,600
and the other is Western.

1060
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,160
So everyone's taste

1061
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,160
might be different.

1062
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,160
Multi-talented.

1063
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,120
Alright.

1064
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:17,680
Hello, everyone.

1065
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,920
I made two dishes today.

1066
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,280
One is

1067
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:20,880
dry pot cauliflower.

1068
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,440
And the other is stir-fried pork with green peppers.

1069
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,360
Two dishes with chili and pork.

1070
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,120
Both guys made them.

1071
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,840
And they're both pretty spicy.

1072
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,600
Spicy dishes.

1073
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,760
Chichi also likes spicy food.

1074
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,280
She likes spicy food.

1075
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,240
That's one way to put it.

1076
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,040
She said she really loves spicy food.

1077
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,880
Stir-fried pork with chili.

1078
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,360
So that was made for her.

1079
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:45,680
Right.

1080
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,160
But in this situation,

1081
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,360
Chichi would definitely

1082
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,680
hope that Yuxing could

1083
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,320
express this intention directly.

1084
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,640
Yuxing didn't do that.

1085
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,840
But Xiao Liu did.

1086
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,160
Zi Han said it out loud.

1087
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,360
She likes spicy food.

1088
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,000
That's one way to put it.

1089
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,080
Auntie glanced at Zi Han.

1090
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,600
Auntie was impressed by Zi Han.

1091
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,720
She remembered Xiao Liu deeply.

1092
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,160
Alright.

1093
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,280
Hello, everyone. I made braised rice.

1094
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,640
And also clam tofu soup.

1095
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,520
Since everyone's dishes are quite strong-flavored today,

1096
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,000
I made mine a bit lighter.

1097
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,320
Who would

1098
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,040
prefer lighter food?

1099
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,240
Do you even need to ask?

1100
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,360
Jiangsu and Zhejiang style.

1101
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,600
They probably prefer lighter flavors.

1102
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,240
Why are you looking at me?

1103
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,560
Lu Yuan is from Hangzhou.

1104
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,160
Why are you looking at me?

1105
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,280
It's nothing.

1106
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:46,880
Hello, everyone.

1107
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,120
I made Mao Xue Wang.

1108
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,640
Spicy dish.

1109
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:51,600
Smells amazing.

1110
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,560
I can smell it.

1111
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,560
He knows Lanlan likes spicy food.

1112
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,960
His Mao Xue Wang smells so good.

1113
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,880
That's a secret weapon.

1114
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,040
It's his killer move.

1115
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,720
Hello everyone, I'm Fang Yijiong.

1116
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,600
Let me briefly introduce

1117
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,640
the two dishes I made.

1118
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,240
The first dish

1119
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,240
is cilantro beef, which I made in the cabin.

1120
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,080
This is the third time.

1121
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,840
I improved it once before.

1122
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,760
This is the second upgrade.

1123
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,240
And then the crayfish.

1124
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,760
That's because

1125
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,160
I promised her two days ago to make this dish.

1126
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,760
I gave her my word.

1127
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,800
He’s really good at speaking.

1128
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,440
Because earlier

1129
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,240
Lanlan mentioned

1130
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,520
he’ll give you a little spark anytime, anywhere.

1131
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,560
Just a little spark.

1132
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,920
To let you know I like you.

1133
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,360
I promised her two days ago to make this dish.

1134
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,280
So I made it today.

1135
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,160
(Sister) I can feel it.

1136
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:55,640
You—

1137
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,200
You promised her to make this dish.

1138
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,520
And then you improved it.

1139
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,240
Now it’s version 3.0.

1140
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:01,720
Yes.

1141
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,240
So she had

1142
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,080
some complaints before, saying

1143
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,920
this wasn’t great.

1144
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,000
So you needed to upgrade it, right?

1145
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,840
I think it can be improved more.

1146
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,760
It can be upgraded again.

1147
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,520
Just so she’ll like it.

1148
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,360
Alright.

1149
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,760
So she’ll be satisfied.

1150
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,200
That’s adorable.

1151
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:22,960
Okay.

1152
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,240
Let’s ask her then.

1153
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,760
So, Lanlan—

1154
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,000
How do you feel about the third time he made this dish today?

1155
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,880
How does it taste?

1156
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,200
I haven’t tried it yet.

1157
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,720
Did you know at that time?

1158
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,080
Honestly,

1159
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,040
I didn’t know then.

1160
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,360
But they were so obvious.

1161
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,680
I could feel it.

1162
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,600
The two of us can switch seats.

1163
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:55,640
Look.

1164
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,680
We can swap seats.

1165
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,600
What’s wrong? You look restless.

1166
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,000
See?

1167
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,040
"Help!"

1168
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,640
Let’s hurry and eat.

1169
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,400
Don’t let it get cold.

1170
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,480
Yes, that’s right.

1171
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:20,840
Don’t let the food get cold.

1172
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,640
Alright.

1173
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,480
Let’s just

1174
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,560
start eating.

1175
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,320
Raise your glasses.

1176
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,160
Come on, friends.

1177
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,240
Come on, alright.

1178
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,360
Cheers!

1179
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,840
Let’s eat.

1180
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,160
Time to eat.

1181
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,440
Thanks to all the chefs.

1182
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,520
So happy.

1183
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,600
How wonderful, everyone together.

1184
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,800
Hurry.

1185
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,240
Then we’ll wander around.

1186
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:40,560
Sure.

1187
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,000
I want to dip some of this.

1188
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,120
So grateful for this big pot.

1189
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,200
Relax, it’s fine.

1190
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,520
See, she keeps encouraging him.

1191
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,520
He’s become an introvert.

1192
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,600
Can you serve me some?

1193
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,560
This—

1194
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,120
Do you want to eat?

1195
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,000
Is this the rice you cooked?

1196
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,920
Yes.

1197
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,320
Do you want some rice?

1198
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,600
Just a little.

1199
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,080
My mom eats less at night.

1200
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,360
Eat a little less, right?

1201
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:21,840
Yes.

1202
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:29,640
I want

1203
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,520
Give me some

1204
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,200
You go first, I'm not in a hurry

1205
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,480
Thank you

1206
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,440
More

1207
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,560
That's good, more

1208
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,840
Thank you

1209
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,280
Just a little

1210
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,360
I'll eat this after I finish that

1211
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,560
I haven't tried this rice yet

1212
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,560
Tasty

1213
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,120
Really?

1214
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,200
Go get some yourself

1215
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,960
You got rice in your bowl so fast

1216
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,200
So fast

1217
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,480
I'm jealous of you

1218
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,480
Try it, it's good

1219
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,280
I didn't know this was here

1220
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,240
I got some noodles

1221
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,480
What a pity

1222
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,360
Sorry, excuse me

1223
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,200
Let me grab some meat

1224
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,240
Sorry for bothering you

1225
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,560
Sorry for bothering you

1226
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,880
I didn't mean anything else

1227
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:26,480
Let me grab some meat

1228
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,720
You're so annoying

1229
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,320
You're so bothersome

1230
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:44,400
You're so bothersome

1231
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,280
Am I crazy?

1232
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:45,800
I'm crazy

1233
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,880
Sorry, I went crazy

1234
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,080
What are you doing?

1235
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,000
Apologize quickly

1236
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,000
Sorry

1237
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,360
Sorry

1238
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,360
What's wrong with you?

1239
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,560
Xiao Fang was stunned

1240
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,560
It's not for me

1241
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,360
Okay, I overthought it

1242
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,480
Here, I'll give you one

1243
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,240
It's fine

1244
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,360
No need

1245
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,000
Take a look and see which one you'd like

1246
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,720
How about opening your spicy hot pot?

1247
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,240
I think it smells great

1248
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:30,520
Really?

1249
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,000
Really

1250
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:31,800
Thank you

1251
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:35,720
Let me get you some

1252
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,400
Is there anything you can't eat?

1253
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:37,920
I can eat everything

1254
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,720
Everything's okay?

1255
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,800
Asking first, that's really thoughtful

1256
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,320
He's really considerate

1257
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,720
He's taking care of Lanlan's sister

1258
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,960
You want me to eat only your food?

1259
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,880
Absolutely

1260
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:51,760
That's so cute

1261
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,200
How does it taste?

1262
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,240
I want to promote Xiao Jiao's spicy hot pot

1263
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,600
I want to promote Xiao Jiao's spicy hot pot

1264
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,320
Give it a shout-out

1265
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,680
It's really delicious

1266
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,120
It's authentic, restaurant quality

1267
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,640
Sister is helping out

1268
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,520
Let us try it too

1269
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,160
Sister steps in

1270
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,040
Thank you

1271
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,600
Xiao Fang is focused on taking care of Lanlan

1272
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:21,880
Yes

1273
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,280
Xiao Jiao is trying to win over the sister

1274
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,120
See, so Lanlan said

1275
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:26,760
I want to eat too

1276
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,760
Then I want to try it too

1277
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,360
Thank you

1278
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:37,600
Try it

1279
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,040
Teacher Jiao

1280
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,040
Did you just learn this?

1281
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,720
Kind of just learned

1282
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:51,600
Yes

1283
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,280
Impressive

1284
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,800
Really impressive

1285
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,320
Indeed

1286
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:56,600
So you did it for

1287
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,160
this particular occasion

1288
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,000
and learned it just for this

1289
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,480
Yes, for someone

1290
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:07,840
So you did it for

1291
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,600
this time

1292
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,880
this particular occasion

1293
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,480
and learned it just for this

1294
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,840
Yes, for someone

1295
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,040
Got it

1296
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,640
Okay.

1297
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,120
You’d really be moved, right?

1298
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,160
It’s really about whether you like someone from the start.

1299
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,040
So if at the beginning,

1300
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,240
one side is sixty points,

1301
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,920
and the other is thirty points,

1302
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:34,520
but

1303
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:35,360
if the person with thirty points

1304
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,720
keeps acting like Xiao Jiao,

1305
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,680
then there’s a chance.

1306
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,160
Yeah.

1307
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,120
Can you eat this?

1308
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,160
It’s pretty tasty.

1309
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:51,600
Which one did you try?

1310
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,200
Cilantro beef.

1311
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,400
Let me try it.

1312
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,120
Cilantro beef.

1313
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,000
The cilantro beef is delicious.

1314
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,560
Right?

1315
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,080
It’s really spicy.

1316
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:11,760
Look how happy he is.

1317
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,120
I served you a bowl of rice.

1318
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:13,600
Thank you.

1319
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,000
Sometimes I eat from a plate.

1320
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
You’re so thoughtful.

1321
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:17,920
It’s got to be Xiao Jiao.

1322
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,160
Just make do and eat.

1323
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:20,760
Thanks.

1324
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,640
Why does it feel like your sister is here too?

1325
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,520
Yeah, my sister is here too (watching).

1326
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,480
Both sides are pretty good.

1327
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:28,960
Just peeled.

1328
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:29,520
Just peeled.

1329
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,760
Thank you.

1330
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,200
You did it so professionally.

1331
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,440
You even added beer.

1332
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:37,640
Really?

1333
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:37,880
Yeah.

1334
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:38,560
Seriously.

1335
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,720
I couldn’t taste that.

1336
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:43,960
How about you?

1337
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,000
Not bad.

1338
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,880
Good brother.

1339
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:48,480
Brother.

1340
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,240
Friend.

1341
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,040
Good brother.

1342
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,680
They really understand each other.

1343
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,440
Yeah, their relationship is really close.

1344
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:53,960
Right.

1345
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,840
Eat some, try some.

1346
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,040
First time making this.

1347
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,280
Where?

1348
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:58,760
This is mine.

1349
00:47:58,760 --> 00:47:59,040
This one.

1350
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,240
This one.

1351
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,160
Get some.

1352
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,280
Try this.

1353
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,880
Everyone praised the spicy hot pot.

1354
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:04,960
I’ve never had it before.

1355
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,240
I think the luncheon meat is delicious.

1356
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:08,800
You should try it.

1357
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,760
Thanks.

1358
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,920
No need to say anything at all.

1359
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:19,920
Yeah.

1360
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,080
Just one look and they get it.

1361
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:23,080
Their friendship

1362
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,120
is really fun to watch too.

1363
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:24,560
Yeah.

1364
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,120
Duo (Duo).

1365
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,600
Did you have fun here this time?

1366
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,920
It was pretty fun.

1367
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,000
There wasn’t much focus.

1368
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,200
Mom was watching.

1369
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,880
The key is, there was focus at the start.

1370
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,040
But gradually,

1371
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,800
It was quite focused at first.

1372
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,280
Mom probably noticed.

1373
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,120
Gradually.

1374
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:06,320
Can you still refine that focus over time?

1375
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,680
I think

1376
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,880
the focus is this.

1377
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:18,800
I think coming here

1378
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:19,960
the most important thing is

1379
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,320
to follow your heart.

1380
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,320
If you feel it’s lacking,

1381
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,640
we should add a bit more.

1382
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,160
Yeah.

1383
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,400
Mom might think

1384
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,200
Duo Duo today compared to usual

1385
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,000
is there any difference?

1386
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,280
There’s a bit of a difference.

1387
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,520
At least now she can

1388
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,960
step out of her shell.

1389
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,880
Before, she wouldn’t express herself.

1390
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:42,920
She didn’t want to say anything.

1391
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,440
Her mom has really good values.

1392
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,160
She feels like she’s encouraging her too.

1393
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,920
Her daughter should love bravely and express herself bravely.

1394
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,040
Yeah.

1395
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,920
I want some curry.

1396
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:01,920
You want curry, right?

1397
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,560
Do you want rice or noodles?

1398
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:04,240
Yes.

1399
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,760
This group is also nerve-wracking.

1400
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,760
Thank you.

1401
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,160
It’s really nerve-wracking.

1402
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,560
Do you want some?

1403
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,520
Just one spoonful is enough.

1404
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,040
Half a spoon is fine.

1405
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:49,840
Thank you.

1406
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,840
She’s eating the curry chicken by herself.

1407
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,400
If it were me, I couldn’t eat.

1408
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,480
To be honest,

1409
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:00,720
She’s right across from me.

1410
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,240
I saw

1411
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,360
the same curry chicken.

1412
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,400
I served myself.

1413
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,400
But he served it for the other person.

1414
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,800
I’ll never eat curry chicken again.

1415
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,360
It’s so sad.

1416
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,440
Did you have fun today?

1417
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,320
Yes, I did.

1418
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,040
Everything was delicious.

1419
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
So, your best friend today—

1420
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,800
Was she any different from usual?

1421
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,640
Don’t say it.

1422
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,760
Do you think she was happy today?

1423
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,200
I don’t think she was very happy.

1424
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:30,560
I think I was okay.

1425
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:33,640
Sitting across from her,

1426
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,000
just like this—

1427
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:37,800
It’s fine.

1428
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,480
Did he serve you any food?

1429
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,600
It’s fine, I can do it myself.

1430
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:42,800
No, that’s not okay.

1431
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:43,320
No, that’s not okay.

1432
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,400
No, that’s not okay.

1433
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:45,840
He looked over here.

1434
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,080
But he hasn’t served any food yet.

1435
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,200
He still hasn’t served any food.

1436
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:53,240
Stop messing around.

1437
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,120
Stop it.

1438
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,320
This is so awkward.

1439
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,720
I’m speaking loudly enough, he should hear.

1440
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,560
He should be able to hear.

1441
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,760
He can’t hear.

1442
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,280
He still can’t hear?

1443
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,000
I’m telling you, he really can’t hear.

1444
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,840
You can never fool someone who’s pretending to sleep.

1445
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,280
I can’t do it.

1446
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,080
But I think it’s pretty good.

1447
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:15,280
At this point,

1448
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,080
it needs to be like this.

1449
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:17,640
Who’s pretending to sleep?

1450
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:20,920
Me.

1451
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,200
I’m asleep.

1452
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:27,800
Okay.

1453
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,160
I’ll go over there for a bit.

1454
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,080
He took a bowl.

1455
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,080
He went.

1456
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,800
There’s also stir-fried pork with chili.

1457
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,200
I’ll split it into two plates.

1458
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,600
See, I think he just wants to split one portion.

1459
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,880
Put it on this table.

1460
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,080
So everyone can have some.

1461
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:59,200
That’s actually a good way to handle it.

1462
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,600
This makes

1463
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:04,760
the whole atmosphere

1464
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,120
a bit more appropriate.

1465
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:06,880
Yes.

1466
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,240
It’s really spicy.

1467
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,480
But I think it tastes pretty good.

1468
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,000
Not to brag,

1469
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,280
but I think it’s okay.

1470
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,080
Stir-fried pork with chili.

1471
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,120
Stir-fried pork with chili.

1472
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,240
The dishes are really well made.

1473
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,400
Mom praised me.

1474
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,240
Will Zi Han go serve some?

1475
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,920
Yeah, bring your stir-fried pork over too.

1476
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:28,920
Stir-fried pork with chili.

1477
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:33,040
Move it aside.

1478
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:35,400
Try this.

1479
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,160
Try mine.

1480
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,280
In this round, Zi Han

1481
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,320
has consistently shown

1482
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,960
his commitment to Chi Chi

1483
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,120
and his preference.

1484
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:42,920
There’s a contrast.

1485
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,480
And he seems more proactive.

1486
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:44,840
Yes.

1487
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,280
Yeah, he’s always been very proactive.

1488
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:02,640
Is it tasty?

1489
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:04,840
Really well made.

1490
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,400
Really well made.

1491
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,440
Very nice.

1492
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,040
These young guys are all so capable.

1493
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,240
How’s the food, Chi Chi?

1494
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:13,320
Are you happy?

1495
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:14,680
I’m happy.

1496
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,200
I’m happy because mom is here.

1497
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:19,120
Did you have any troubles in the house?

1498
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:20,720
No.

1499
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,160
How come not?

1500
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,120
Didn’t you tell me before?

1501
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,120
How come not?

1502
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,080
Didn’t you tell me before?

1503
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,960
Only a real mom would ask.

1504
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,480
Brother Ma is fired up again.

1505
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,480
Wait a moment.

1506
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,520
Okay.

1507
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,360
Teacher Ma.

1508
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,240
It has to be mom.

1509
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,120
I’m telling you, really.

1510
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:54,040
Let me tell you.

1511
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:54,560
Um...

1512
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,400
What did she tell you?

1513
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,960
She said the first two days after arriving,

1514
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,680
It’s fine.

1515
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,280
We’re chatting with mom.

1516
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,360
It’s fine, don’t worry.

1517
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,200
You can’t say, right?

1518
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:07,600
I can.

1519
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,280
I can say.

1520
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,160
I can definitely say.

1521
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:09,920
I can say.

1522
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,600
What happened those first two days?

1523
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,120
The first two days, well...

1524
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:14,320
Um...

1525
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:15,640
I was pretty anxious.

1526
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,080
Just wasn’t used to it at first.

1527
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,840
Gradually, everyone cared about her.

1528
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,160
She fit in quickly.

1529
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,040
Everyone is very tolerant.

1530
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:25,600
Everyone’s tolerance.

1531
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,440
Was anyone especially tolerant?

1532
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,720
Their eyes just met.

1533
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:35,880
The sudden silence is the scariest.

1534
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,640
Everyone’s pretty tolerant.

1535
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:47,600
Did he do anything tolerant today?

1536
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:55,480
I ate spicy stir-fried pork today.

1537
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,000
“The weather’s nice today.”

1538
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,240
Are you playing this game with me?

1539
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,120
Who made the spicy stir-fried pork?

1540
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,760
You’re like an interrogator.

1541
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,080
Zi Han and I both made spicy stir-fried pork.

1542
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,400
There were two spicy stir-fried pork dishes.

1543
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,240
Which spicy stir-fried pork was it?

1544
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,280
You thought it was pretty good?

1545
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,440
How do I answer that?

1546
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,000
How do I answer this?

1547
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,200
They’re all tasty.

1548
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:32,760
Don’t hurt anyone’s feelings.

1549
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:33,760
Yeah, there are too many people.

1550
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,240
They’re all tasty, but...

1551
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,960
We’re still in the tasting stage.

1552
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,080
Tasting.

1553
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,240
This is so hard for me.

1554
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,280
I might say,

1555
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:50,920
I like this one.

1556
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,080
But this one tastes better.

1557
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,400
That’s a good answer.

1558
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,560
Xiao Jiao, why don’t you sit over here?

1559
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,320
Because we can all

1560
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,200
move around and walk back and forth.

1561
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:05,880
Yeah.

1562
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:07,560
If you had a chance

1563
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,320
to switch seats with me, would you want to?

1564
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:11,720
Yes.

1565
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:12,840
Yes.

1566
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,240
Xiao Fang is about to explode.

1567
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:16,720
Okay, let’s switch.

1568
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:18,920
Sit.

1569
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:20,000
Sit.

1570
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:20,760
Sit.

1571
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:26,520
Handsome.

1572
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:27,320
There’s something here.

1573
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,560
Always very considerate.

1574
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:32,840
You’re being very manly right now.

1575
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:33,440
Yeah.

1576
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,200
Really.

1577
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,200
Everyone's almost finished eating.

1578
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,240
So today,

1579
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:44,520
what are we doing?

1580
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:45,840
Here it comes.

1581
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:47,720
Tonight's dinner

1582
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:49,200
is just officially starting.

1583
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,360
Friends,

1584
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:51,520
that card—

1585
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,040
the questions written by the family and friends support group.

1586
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:53,840
Here come the questions.

1587
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:54,520
Friends,

1588
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:55,960
the questions are coming.

1589
00:57:59,160 --> 00:57:59,680
So scary.

1590
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:00,360
So scary.

1591
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:40,840
These questions

1592
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:42,240
all come from

1593
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,040
the girls' family members

1594
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,400
Only the guys will draw them

1595
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:45,520
Only the guys will draw them

1596
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,120
I'm really looking forward to these questions

1597
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,160
A fondness that goes beyond work

1598
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,840
How do you maintain boundaries?

1599
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,320
I think my top priority is

1600
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,120
a sense of security

1601
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,120
Zi Han explained it well

1602
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:57,800
Most girls

1603
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,040
really need a sense of security

1604
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,320
Zi Han scored big today

1605
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,120
For a question like this

1606
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,120
Who do you want to answer?

1607
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:03,560
Do you think it's appropriate?

1608
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,080
I'd like to answer this question

1609
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:08,920
The one next to Yuan Yuan

1610
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:09,680
Okay

1611
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,760
Very straightforward

1612
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:11,760
How should I answer?

1613
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,880
I really want to give it a try

1614
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,240
Okay

1615
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:19,560
Wang Jue's temperament is perfect for this

1616
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:21,120
Because Wang Jue has a classical beauty

1617
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,200
She's so happy

1618
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,280
Because you said you love spicy food

1619
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,720
I added a lot of chili peppers

1620
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,400
Such a sweet dish of stir-fried pork with chili

1621
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,760
I peeled it for you, but you still peeled it yourself

1622
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:30,840
I didn't see it

1623
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,240
So cute

1624
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,080
The little train is coming again

1625
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,440
I need to know who it is first

1626
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:37,160
Want to chat

1627
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:37,720
Let's chat

1628
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:39,240
Jue has been creating opportunities herself

1629
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:40,640
I want to talk with you

1630
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:41,680
Zi Han is a warrior today

1631
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:42,280
He saw it through to the end
