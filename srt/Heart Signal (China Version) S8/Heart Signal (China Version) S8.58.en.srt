1
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,440
Now coming toward us

2
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,000
are two Sunshine Girls.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,160
They are beautiful and graceful,

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,240
genuine and charming.

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,280
Let’s give them a warm welcome.

6
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,200
Let’s take our seats first.

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,120
So awkward.

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,760
It’s fine, it gets even more awkward later.

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,360
Now coming toward us

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,000
are two Spirited Guys.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,600
They’re upbeat and confident.

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,480
Spirited Guys.

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,560
Enthusiastic and cheerful.

14
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,360
Here they come.

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,120
They’re showing

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,160
bright, friendly smiles.

17
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,720
Hello, everyone.

18
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,000
I’m from Heart Signal

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,360
Season Eight, Lu Yuan—Xiao Yuan.

20
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,480
Hello, everyone.

21
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,360
I’m from Heart Signal

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,120
Season Eight, Ke Ailin—Duoduo.

23
00:00:59,120 --> 00:00:59,920
Hello.

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,400
Hello, everyone.

25
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,480
I’m from Heart Signal

26
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,000
Season Eight, Liu Zihan.

27
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,080
Hello.

28
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:05,920
Hello, everyone.

29
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,840
I’m from Heart Signal

30
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,600
Season Eight, Xiao Jiao—Jiao Zhiheng.

31
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,440
Welcome.

32
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,360
Welcome, Jiao!

33
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:11,880
Welcome, Jiao!

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,640
Duoduo is here for Pei Ni Kan Xin Dong again.

35
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,160
How do you feel right now?

36
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:15,840
Last time I watched,

37
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,680
it was my first time watching,

38
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,520
and our emotions totally followed

39
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,280
all the ups and downs.

40
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,120
Yeah, it was like a roller coaster.

41
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,840
When Ruilong left,

42
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,640
we all felt really

43
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,280
our mood just suddenly

44
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,160
dropped all at once.

45
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,720
Yeah, I broke down, kept crying.

46
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,960
Then it got really funny again.

47
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,960
And then crying again.

48
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,560
It felt like my whole state

49
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,960
was just all over the place.

50
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,920
I’m really looking forward

51
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,000
to the clips and stories we’ll see today.

52
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,040
Yes.

53
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,440
Same here.

54
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,280
Absolutely.

55
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,760
Since everyone’s so excited,

56
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,760
let’s start today’s Pei Ni Kan Xin Dong.

57
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,000
Okay.

58
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,680
This is when you set out.

59
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,520
On the way to leave, right?

60
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,240
Heading to the airport.

61
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,360
I saw you two that night

62
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,120
wandering in front of me for ages—why?

63
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,560
Why is this my video diary?

64
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,720
Now this is real travel.

65
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,800
They filmed video diaries the whole trip.

66
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,720
I’ll give her a like first.

67
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,800
Yeah.

68
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,080
It’s really delicious.

69
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,920
This fruit today

70
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,920
suddenly makes me feel

71
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,120
we should switch to barbecue or something.

72
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,920
Yeah.

73
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,200
So talented.

74
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,720
This—

75
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,360
stiff.

76
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,880
My left and right foot are fighting.

77
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,280
Left and right brain are battling.

78
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,320
Your face is so expressive.

79
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,960
I think we’ve got new memes now.

80
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,760
This was after we left, you guys—

81
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,800
Yeah, that same night,

82
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,920
we were picking those cards.

83
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,560
Is an iconic scene coming up?

84
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,440
I’ve heard a bit about it.

85
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,680
Jiao probably picked really fast.

86
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,800
I picked super fast.

87
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,240
Just watch.

88
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,600
I really want to see this.

89
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,000
So excited.

90
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,200
Of course it was easy for you.

91
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,400
My bad.

92
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,400
I just turned around

93
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,520
and said that to Dr. Fang.

94
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,200
Yeah, you and Dr. Fang were easy picks.

95
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,040
I got nervous.

96
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,880
I’m so nervous.

97
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,920
Watching this, I’m really—

98
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,880
I got goosebumps.

99
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,280
So tense.

100
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,640
Don’t worry, it’s just starting.

101
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,760
Let me eat some melon to calm down.

102
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,640
I want some melon too.

103
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,560
Eat some melon.

104
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,920
Eat something to settle down.

105
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,840
Battlefield.

106
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,720
Tasty.

107
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,880
This melon is delicious.

108
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,640
The melon is so sweet.

109
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,720
Double meaning, bro.

110
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,440
Double meaning, bro.

111
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,920
That pun was spot on.

112
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,960
Getting a bit awkward now.

113
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,040
We suddenly got called out.

114
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,280
Cracked up—got called out so suddenly.

115
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,640
Can we just pretend we fell asleep?

116
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,800
I’m begging you.

117
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,920
Bro, you really called us out so suddenly.

118
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,760
What should I say?

119
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,800
Come on, brain, think fast.

120
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,720
So funny.

121
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,640
Honestly, I always hoped

122
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,360
everyone could handle things

123
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,080
in a calm way.

124
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,040
But when it really comes to

125
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,760
certain situations—

126
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,360
But you handled it

127
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:05,800
just fine.

128
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,280
Yeah.

129
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:06,680
It’s all normal.

130
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,440
Not really—

131
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:07,920
Nothing you can do.

132
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,200
Yeah.

133
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,600
Why did you two run off?

134
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,360
We left the frame.

135
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,480
Getting farther and farther away.

136
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:22,880
Farther and farther.

137
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,760
Maybe you two should go

138
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,240
keep Wei Ni and Nicole company.

139
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,560
We’re already talking about something else.

140
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,080
Yeah, we’ve moved on to other topics.

141
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,560
Jiao is already working hard

142
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,080
to find another topic.

143
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,280
And at that moment I thought,

144
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,080
these two want to escape—no way.

145
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,240
Bro, maybe close your eyes for a bit.

146
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,200
Close your eyes.

147
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,680
Take a nap.

148
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,000
Take a nap.

149
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,080
We can help you

150
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,640
keep an eye on things.

151
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,800
Picked us again.

152
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,120
Both of them were ready to light up.

153
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,320
We were actually lighting up at that moment.

154
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,480
He got anxious.

155
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,360
I felt Yu Xing started talking faster.

156
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,000
Already

157
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,480
speeding up, yeah.

158
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:27,960
Already faster than usual.

159
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,440
Yeah.

160
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,280
Yeah, much faster.

161
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,280
I was a bit scared then.

162
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:34,920
Jiao.

163
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,040
That's true.

164
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,400
It's a good way.

165
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,440
Because it was already tense.

166
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,120
It was really tense.

167
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,440
And then it started raining at the end.

168
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,640
You guys got caught in the rain.

169
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,320
So dramatic.

170
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,720
I grabbed a whole bag of snacks.

171
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,760
Started eating.

172
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,840
Had to use my brain.

173
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,800
Hungry.

174
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,280
It's easy to get hungry.

175
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,640
I think having some food

176
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,960
makes things a bit better.

177
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,360
It lifts your mood.

178
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,320
Got anxious.

179
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,080
I've never seen Yu Xing like this.

180
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,160
Never before.

181
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,560
Yeah.

182
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,920
That's between the two of them.

183
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,920
It's their challenge.

184
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,560
It started raining.

185
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,000
So dramatic.

186
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,520
Really fitting.

187
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,680
Really.

188
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,720
Tonight's rain

189
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,320
soaked a lot of hearts.

190
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,880
True.

191
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,480
Nothing you can do.

192
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:51,800
But I think later on,

193
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,960
he was really manly.

194
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,280
Very manly.

195
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,240
In the end, it was Yu Xing

196
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,280
who solved the problem.

197
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,720
Otherwise, we'd be stuck till morning.

198
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,560
Yeah.

199
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,880
He even helped you.

200
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,440
Yeah, I felt

201
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,280
after it ended,

202
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,080
I felt really bad, honestly.

203
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,840
Everyone was

204
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,920
trying hard to manage their emotions.

205
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,480
Everyone

206
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,880
wanted the situation

207
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,880
to be

208
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,320
as calm as possible.

209
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,000
A bit calmer.

210
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,240
Actually, early on,

211
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,760
Yu Xing had made things clear to Yi Fan.

212
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,960
They became friends.

213
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,840
He told Yi Fan,

214
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,200
there's a 99.9% chance

215
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,680
they'd just be friends.

216
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,040
But Yi Fan held onto

217
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,640
that 0.01% hope.

218
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,680
Thinking maybe

219
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,960
they could keep trying.

220
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,960
So what worries Yu Xing now

221
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,560
is if he chooses Yi Fan again,

222
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,720
makes that decision,

223
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,480
Yi Fan will think

224
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,760
he's giving her hope again.

225
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,720
So he was probably

226
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,200
really troubled then.

227
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,120
Yu Xing just mentioned

228
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,840
if the order of choosing matters.

229
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,600
Wanted to ask everyone's thoughts.

230
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,560
When you ask that question,

231
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,200
if the order matters,

232
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,640
it means there's already

233
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,960
an emotional bond.

234
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,600
So,

235
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,600
when there's that bond,

236
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,360
I agree,

237
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,800
just enjoy the moment.

238
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,160
Yeah.

239
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,280
So now,

240
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:12,880
So now,

241
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,240
let's play a little game.

242
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,440
To test everyone's reflexes.

243
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,840
So you can react faster

244
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,760
and seize opportunities better.

245
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,440
Okay.

246
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,120
Okay.

247
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,760
The rules are:

248
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,400
The first person takes three plastic bags.

249
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,920
Everyone else takes two.

250
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,920
Swap with the person next to you.

251
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,000
If anyone drops a bag first,

252
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,440
they get punished.

253
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,720
Alright, let's

254
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,160
try a round, okay?

255
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,600
Yeah.

256
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,560
I'll go first.

257
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,440
Come on, let's stand up.

258
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,400
Okay, stand up.

259
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,840
What's this music?

260
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,760
Is it for square dancing?

261
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,480
Show us how to play first.

262
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,880
No, I'll stand here.

263
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,760
Alright.

264
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,200
When I say three, two, one,

265
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,000
everyone throws to the left.

266
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Throw the plastic bag.

267
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,760
What about me?

268
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,920
Your right hand grabs Zi Han's bag.

269
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,280
Yeah, you have to grab it.

270
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,920
Yeah, grab the previous person's bag.

271
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,200
What about mine?

272
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,240
Yours just floats in the air.

273
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:17,440
Alright.

274
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,680
Then when you come back,

275
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,320
you grab three.

276
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,040
You have to grab them again.

277
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,120
Go.

278
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,080
Left, right, left, right.

279
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,480
Three, two, one, go.

280
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,080
Wait a second.

281
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,000
Xiao Yuan.

282
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,640
Keep going right.

283
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,200
Who's on the right?

284
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,040
It's starting.

285
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,720
Who dropped it?

286
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,080
Definitely not me.

287
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,480
I have two in my hand.

288
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,360
I have two.

289
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,680
You have one.

290
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,920
You have one.

291
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,120
The punishment is

292
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,240
to

293
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,080
call Wang Lechen.

294
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,760
That's really...

295
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,560
But you can't speak yourself.

296
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,280
You have to use AI.

297
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:13,880
You have to use AI.

298
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,720
Let AI talk to Wang Lechen.

299
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:17,840
Okay.

300
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,480
Go ahead.

301
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:18,880
Alright.

302
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,160
Play one first, let's hear it.

303
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:21,840
Hello.

304
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,320
Please choose

305
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,800
the voice you want me to use.

306
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,480
Sounds a lot like me.

307
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,560
Very similar.

308
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,560
Let's set up a scenario.

309
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,840
Like, say today he's

310
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,760
feeling really down.

311
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,920
And we need to comfort him.

312
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:36,800
Sure.

313
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,520
Sure.

314
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:38,720
Sure.

315
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,960
Sure, since you're the one calling.

316
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,280
Let me try a simulation first.

317
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:44,680
Hello?

318
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,520
You've already called him.

319
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,480
If you need some comfort,

320
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,320
just let me know anytime.

321
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,560
Sending this feels weird.

322
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,520
Just say, "Now it's officially starting."

323
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,480
From the next second, any sound you hear

324
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,880
is the real thing.

325
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,640
After you connect, you can guide it.

326
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,800
Let's do a test now.

327
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,640
Starting from the next second.

328
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,680
I'll tell you when the call starts.

329
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,640
When I speak to you again,

330
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,520
you need to respond.

331
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,400
With your real reaction to the call.

332
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,280
Are you ready?

333
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,560
Ready.

334
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,840
We can start anytime.

335
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,600
Hello?

336
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,000
Hello, Lechen.

337
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,200
I heard you're not feeling great today.

338
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,880
I'm really worried about you.

339
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,680
Nice.

340
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,200
If you're willing,

341
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,760
Hello, what's up?

342
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,720
You sound a bit off.

343
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,400
Is something bothering you?

344
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:43,920
What?

345
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,640
Tell me about it.

346
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,640
Maybe talking will help you feel better.

347
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,760
Stop messing with me using AI.

348
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,560
I'm not trying to mess with you.

349
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,160
I genuinely want to help you.

350
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,360
To comfort Wang Lechen.

351
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,400
When you call again,

352
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,080
how do you train the AI

353
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,280
to cheer him up?

354
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,480
I've always been obedient.

355
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,800
Can a person even say that?

356
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,720
When you call,

357
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,680
It's fine now.

358
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,120
I definitely didn't mean that.

359
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,240
Say no more.

360
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,200
It's fine now, Chen.

361
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,080
We're filming Pei Ni Kan Xin Dong: Heartbeat Companion.

362
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,920
You guys keep filming, bye.

363
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,040
Goodbye.

364
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,280
Goodbye.

365
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,280
Let's keep watching.

366
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:26,520
Okay.

367
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,080
Okay.

368
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:27,560
Okay.

369
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,840
Long-distance date day.

370
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,480
Where is this?

371
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,440
Swan Lake, I think.

372
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,320
It's near the cabin.

373
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:34,960
Right by the cabin.

374
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,920
Yeah.

375
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,880
So what am I doing here?

376
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,480
Starting to take deep breaths.

377
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,200
Taking deep breaths.

378
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,040
Why am I moving so much?

379
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,920
What are you doing back there?

380
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,000
I should've come earlier.

381
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,960
Dude.

382
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,160
The weather really fits the mood.

383
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,120
The separation anxiety you mentioned,

384
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,600
is it about the people in the cabin

385
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,160
being apart from them?

386
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,440
The first night,

387
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,840
suddenly I became

388
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,000
someone with no one to talk to.

389
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,240
It felt a bit strange.

390
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,680
I think sometimes we

391
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,240
care too much about others' feelings.

392
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,200
Always wanting others to be happy.

393
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,040
Seeing others happy

394
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,760
makes us happy too.

395
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,520
But sometimes,

396
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,440
it makes us

397
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,000
not feel like ourselves.

398
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,800
Not ourselves.

399
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,520
It drains us inside.

400
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,440
So I think

401
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,240
we need to figure ourselves out first.

402
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,520
What we're really like.

403
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,360
Set our own boundaries.

404
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,800
Then care about others.

405
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,080
Right.

406
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,400
We'll be a bit happier.

407
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:35,760
Yes.

408
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,520
If we open up more,

409
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,680
any outcome

410
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,360
is acceptable to us.

411
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,720
We can all accept it.

412
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,880
Just now, Jiao and Lanlan

413
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,880
this conversation, I think

414
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,280
if it happened earlier,

415
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,640
you'd feel much better.

416
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,880
She'd be comfortable too.

417
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,880
And so would you.

418
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,920
It's already really good.

419
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,440
And I think that day,

420
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,840
the interaction let us both

421
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,400
see each other's true selves.

422
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,760
Why am I still not here?

423
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,440
Dr. Fang, the "savior," is here.

424
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,880
That's Duoduo's charm.

425
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,760
No idea where to sit.

426
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,320
You're the one who can chat like this.

427
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,960
That was a clever double meaning.

428
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,520
Come on, brain, think faster.

429
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,160
Sorry for interrupting.

430
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,640
No worries.

431
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,840
No need to apologize between us.

432
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,720
Alright.

433
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,480
Withdraw.

434
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,280
Thanks to you.

435
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,960
The mood is much better now.

436
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,520
Our caring big sister joined in here.

437
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,960
Lanlan usually handles things herself.

438
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,200
She thinks and processes alone.

439
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,960
So, at the start of the trip,

440
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,760
you two had already

441
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,560
talked things out face to face.

442
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,000
That's why later on,

443
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,480
everyone got along so happily.

444
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,680
After that, we all blended in.

445
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,800
It felt like the whole group's vibe

446
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,120
got much better.

447
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,000
Yeah, it got more relaxed.

448
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,800
Yes, that's right.

449
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,080
So I think it's really great.

450
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,200
You are both very brave people.

451
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,680
And I think

452
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,520
mainly, you two are

453
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,840
sincere and kind-hearted.

454
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,000
So after you opened up,

455
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,800
Lanlan felt more at ease.

456
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,280
You also became more comfortable.

457
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:22,800
Right?

458
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,480
You're slowly becoming yourself again.

459
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:24,920
Yeah.

460
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,520
Let's see who it is.

461
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,240
Eat, eat.

462
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,680
Eat, eat.

463
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,400
Brother Liu's long legs!

464
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,360
Brother Liu.

465
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,360
They're really so long.

466
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,720
"Mishearing Master"

467
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,600
So cute.

468
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,600
It has to be you, bro.

469
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,360
The vibe is great.

470
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,000
The rain stopped.

471
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,520
It rained all day.

472
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,160
And then,

473
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,320
it was only sunny at this moment.

474
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,560
The weather was perfect today.

475
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,520
Are you feeding spicy strips?

476
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,440
Carrots.

477
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,720
Sorry.

478
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,640
Spicy strips.

479
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,640
This giraffe is picky.

480
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:07,640
So funny.

481
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,000
You're hilarious, bro.

482
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,280
So much fun.

483
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,400
That's hilarious.

484
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,560
What's this?

485
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,240
Parrot.

486
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,120
So cute.

487
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,720
So sweet.

488
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,960
So happy.

489
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,320
Where are you guys?

490
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,560
It's actually just

491
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,200
a place like a zoo.

492
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:44,520
Yeah.

493
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,800
My eyes feel a bit dry now.

494
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,000
Then close your eyes for a bit, bro.

495
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,400
Closing your eyes works too.

496
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,920
Make one for him.

497
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,280
I actually have a lot of this too.

498
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,080
That's awesome.

499
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:11,600
Said to me.

500
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,040
Honestly, I got goosebumps myself.

501
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,800
I'm really happy.

502
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,000
So, what do you think

503
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,720
during the trip,

504
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,960
how can you help your companions

505
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,320
feel more relaxed and happy?

506
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,400
How can you better

507
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,160
give emotional support to others?

508
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:24,920
I tend to

509
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,080
I like to crack jokes.

510
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,080
I talk a lot.

511
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:27,680
You know?

512
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,080
Yeah, so

513
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,200
you don't have to force it.

514
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,400
You're always

515
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,960
giving others emotional support.

516
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,320
You don't need to do anything special.

517
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,040
Yeah, I think

518
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,560
I'm just doing it naturally.

519
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,040
Yeah.

520
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,760
It's not like

521
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,040
I'm trying super hard

522
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,160
to create a certain vibe.

523
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,640
Honestly, you two are alike.

524
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,440
No, all three of us are.

525
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:44,880
Yeah.

526
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,160
Yeah.

527
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,160
We're back again.

528
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,680
Beautiful Xinjiang.

529
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,840
Xinjiang is truly stunning.

530
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,840
Feels so free.

531
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,800
For sure.

532
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,520
You can't see this in Jiaxing.

533
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,160
Definitely can't see it.

534
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,040
True.

535
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,600
What's that sound?

536
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,600
This.

537
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,080
So sweet.

538
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,680
It has to be (Wang Lechen).

539
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,000
A whole bunch, packed full.

540
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,320
Four-piece set.

541
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,320
Four-piece set.

542
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,480
Setting off fireworks.

543
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,680
Bubbles.

544
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,880
This shot looks amazing.

545
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,160
So beautiful.

546
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,760
This shot is gorgeous.

547
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,240
You two are really adorable.

548
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,640
So cute.

549
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,040
"Help!"

550
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,720
I'm dying laughing.

551
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,480
Where's the flower?

552
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,120
The guy in the back.

553
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,560
Can't bear to look.

554
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,320
A complete flower.

555
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,640
Complete love.

556
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,120
This is still sweet.

557
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,080
This kid really knows what to say.

558
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,760
I was just moved

559
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,800
by what Chen said.

560
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,560
When your words are heard and remembered,

561
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,880
and maybe someday

562
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,920
in the future,

563
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,720
they come true,

564
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,640
or you realize it,

565
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,560
I think that's true happiness.

566
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,160
Being cared for and missed

567
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,640
is such a happy thing.

568
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,760
Yes, really.

569
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,280
A good relationship

570
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,880
needs both people to have

571
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,400
the ability to love and be loved.

572
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:19,840
Yes.

573
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,160
Yes.

574
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:20,600
Yes.

575
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,440
Both are important.

576
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,080
Honestly, I think

577
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,160
it's the same in friendship.

578
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:23,400
Yes.

579
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,920
Because when Duoduo and I

580
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,040
were parting ways,

581
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,320
as I left the room,

582
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,080
Duoduo gave me a letter.

583
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,000
On the letter,

584
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
she drew a sunflower.

585
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,640
When I saw

586
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,520
the sunflower at first glance,

587
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,240
I felt

588
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,760
Duoduo truly cares about me.

589
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,560
I really felt Duoduo

590
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,520
noticed my little thoughts.

591
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,360
Yes.

592
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,560
So at that moment, I truly felt

593
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,800
so, so happy.

594
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,840
My first thought then was

595
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,480
when I was in Xinjiang,

596
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,720
I made so many wishes.

597
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,320
Most of them came true.

598
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,320
And I felt

599
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,640
it was so heartfelt.

600
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,200
I had many regrets in life,

601
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,320
but Xinjiang made up for them.

602
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,520
Yes.

603
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:10,760
Where is this?

604
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,440
Where is this?

605
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:11,880
Is that me?

606
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,760
That dress looks great.

607
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,080
You—

608
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:18,520
You—

609
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:18,960
look handsome too.

610
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,160
100 Ways to Style a Vest.

611
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,200
So cool, bro.

612
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,120
Honestly, few people

613
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,280
can make a vest look that good.

614
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,600
Even old guys can pull it off.

615
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,840
You really prepared three compliments.

616
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,360
Really?

617
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,720
That's so thoughtful.

618
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,760
I was lucky to see

619
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,640
every day of the last few days.

620
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,080
Someone kept me in their heart.

621
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,320
It's the same for everyone.

622
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,080
Yes.

623
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,200
You must be confident.

624
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,200
Got it.

625
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:21,800
Got it.

626
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,520
Got it.

627
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,040
Got it.

628
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,680
Got it.

629
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,160
They went to make pizza.

630
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,200
Chichi got confident from your praise.

631
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,720
You always compliment.

632
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,960
You always compliment.

633
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,720
So hungry.

634
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,840
Even sighed.

635
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,200
What's wrong?

636
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,200
Did you "poison" it?

637
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,000
True.

638
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,240
Went silent.

639
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,800
It really is a mix.

640
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,440
Try it.

641
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,680
It's edible.

642
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,600
You guys are hilarious.

643
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,080
My mind is spinning.

644
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,880
My mind is spinning.

645
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,880
It's about to explode.

646
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,720
I'm full.

647
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,400
Take a bite.

648
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,520
True.

649
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,880
Really can't eat another bite.

650
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,040
Iconic line.

651
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,240
Yes, I think object separation

652
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:20,960
is exactly this.

653
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,520
Yes.

654
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,720
I do mine, you do yours.

655
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,240
Well said.

656
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,320
Back to Yili again.

657
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,520
Back to Xinjiang again.

658
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:43,960
So comfortable.

659
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,720
Look at this view.

660
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,360
It really soothes the heart.

661
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,960
Mr. Zihan's expression

662
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,080
is already one of envy.

663
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,160
This horse is so cute.

664
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,920
I ordered it, sis, I did.

665
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,720
So funny.

666
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,600
Nodding like crazy.

667
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,200
Looks like a robot horse.

668
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,400
No idea why.

669
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,480
This card glitched.

670
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:36,920
There's a glitch.

671
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,760
Yeah, card glitched.

672
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,960
So hilarious.

673
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,080
So beautiful.

674
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,000
These clouds are really—

675
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,040
You are the wind.

676
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,920
No worries can't be solved here.

677
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,800
May I ask—

678
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,120
Amazing.

679
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,120
So satisfying.

680
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:22,480
Amazing.

681
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,720
So satisfying.

682
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,960
Your little dog too.

683
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:20,360
Yes.

684
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,760
Your massage even has an accent.

685
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,360
Massage.

686
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,200
Does it?

687
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,920
I don't think so.

688
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,520
Yes, not yet.

689
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,960
Why did it end so abruptly?

690
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,720
We were watching this too.

691
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,560
We were really getting into it.

692
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,440
Yeah.

693
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,480
Can we watch the rest of it?

694
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,600
Let's go straight to the finale.

695
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,960
Time always flies by so fast.

696
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,600
Yeah, time really does fly.

697
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:17,200
After watching so much so far,

698
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,600
let's talk about this group trip.

699
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,360
How did it feel?

700
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,560
I think it was great.

701
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,640
Because for us now,

702
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,920
these are all wonderful memories.

703
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,520
After spending so much time together,

704
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,760
you really start to notice

705
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,920
another side to everyone.

706
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,200
It helps you understand

707
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,200
them in a deeper way.

708
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,400
Yeah, because the cabin itself

709
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,880
is such a special place.

710
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:38,240
Yeah.

711
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,480
It's like a fairytale world.

712
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,200
You have a group of like-minded

713
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,840
and genuinely good friends.

714
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,240
And life outside the cabin

715
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,680
is just as vibrant.

716
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,560
In everyone's hearts,

717
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,840
there's that bond and connection.

718
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,400
I find it so romantic and happy.

719
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,480
I feel the same.

720
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,880
This time,

721
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:55,960
during the group trip,

722
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,400
it really gave me

723
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,720
a wonderful opportunity.

724
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,040
It let me have

725
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,360
a different perspective,

726
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,720
and a deeper understanding.

727
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,760
I got to know

728
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:06,960
not just Lanlan,

729
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:07,760
but also Dr. Fang,

730
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,920
and even myself.

731
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,080
Yeah, even myself.

732
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,080
I found myself again.

733
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:11,560
Yeah.

734
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:12,880
I wouldn't say I was lost,

735
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,160
but maybe before,

736
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,320
I didn't know that side of me.

737
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,080
Yeah, that's right.

738
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,280
I really think

739
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,080
it's so rare.

740
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,280
For me,

741
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,360
coming to the cabin,

742
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,480
if I feel a heartbeat,

743
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,120
that's just the cherry on top.

744
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,480
If I don't feel it,

745
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,120
I think making a group of

746
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,320
like-minded friends

747
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,880
or finding some

748
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,520
lost pieces of myself

749
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:33,720
is truly amazing.

750
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,280
I believe I'll carry this with me

751
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,960
as I move forward.

752
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:38,400
Yeah.

753
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:38,840
That's right.

754
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:39,520
Come on, cheers!

755
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,160
Cheers!

756
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:42,800
Let's do it together.

757
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,000
For us.

758
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:44,800
For ourselves.

759
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,160
For the cabin.

760
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,320
Alright.

761
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,640
Now let's move on to

762
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,120
the lucky capsule machine segment.

763
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,280
Everyone can draw one.

764
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,680
I got one.

765
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,160
I'm happy.

766
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,320
Is this from Jiao?

767
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,960
I'll go first then.

768
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,400
I'll treat you in Yiwu.

769
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,880
A Yiwu specialty restaurant.

770
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,880
Thank you, Teacher Yuxing.

771
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:13,920
I know.

772
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,480
Next one, please.

773
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,480
I got Teacher Xiao Jiao's.

774
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,120
A ticket for a spontaneous trip.

775
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,200
Thank you.

776
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,240
I'm so jealous.

777
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,360
That's a big one.

778
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,280
No, it's not.

779
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,760
Jiao will take me to school.

780
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:36,640
Alright.

781
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,120
But I'm also really happy

782
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:39,880
that you got it.

783
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,840
Yeah, you got it.

784
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,520
I got Rui Long.

785
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,960
Let's go eat together, Rui Long.

786
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,600
Alright, I got Duo Duo's.

787
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,400
Duo Duo's is also a meal treat.

788
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,680
And her treat is

789
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,360
in Hangzhou or Shanghai, your choice.

790
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,480
That's right.

791
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,040
So happy.

792
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,360
Let's write one ourselves.

793
00:46:58,720 --> 00:46:59,240
Okay.

794
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,640
Mine is

795
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,440
Help you out when you're feeling down.

796
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,240
There's no trouble

797
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,760
that a good meal

798
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,440
can't fix.

799
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,040
Mine is to give you

800
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,320
an instant camera to capture memories.

801
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,120
I carefully planned a day for him.

802
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,760
He'll be in the unknown,

803
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,000
just to enjoy it.

804
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,600
Pretty nice, right?

805
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,560
I really want to pick them all.

806
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,640
Pei Ni Kan Xin Dong: Heartbeat Companion,
the heartbeat never ends.

807
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,520
See you next time.

808
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,720
Goodbye.
