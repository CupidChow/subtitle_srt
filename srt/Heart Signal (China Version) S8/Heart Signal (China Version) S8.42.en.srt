1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,520
Right now, I actually want to go to an island.

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,800
I want the kind with a crystal-clear sea.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,720
And the sand is soft and fine.

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,720
A relaxing beach.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,400
I've only been to Haikou.

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,800
Would you want to go?

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,920
I really want to go too.

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,640
Actually, I’d love to go as well.

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,840
Let me ask you now.

10
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,920
How do we switch?

11
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,840
Because I can ask you too.

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,080
I can ask.

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,640
Okay, go ahead.

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,400
Can’t I ask you?

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,120
Are you a night owl or an early bird?

16
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,560
I’m an early bird.

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,040
I used to be a night owl.

18
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,320
But now I don’t want to stay up late, I want to get up early.

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,920
I feel like waking up early gives me more time.

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,440
And staying up late isn’t good for your health.

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,240
It’s not that healthy.

22
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,320
I wake up really early.

23
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,400
My body clock is usually set to six.

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,560
And then...

25
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,800
What time do you go to bed?

26
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,200
Around ten o’clock.

27
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,320
What time do you get off work?

28
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,360
What time do I get off work?

29
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,560
I finish work at six thirty.

30
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,680
You finish so early.

31
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,600
Just after dinner, then...

32
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,560
But I don’t really have the habit of eating dinner.

33
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,600
I can’t skip dinner.

34
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,560
You told me before.

35
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,000
Because I can’t sleep if I’m hungry.

36
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,160
But I said I can’t skip breakfast.

37
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,120
That’s how it is.

38
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,800
Okay.

39
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,760
Actually, I used to stay up late as a kid.

40
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,200
My grandpa would go play mahjong.

41
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,000
At night.

42
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,000
Then I’d wait for him to come back.

43
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,640
And I’d sleep with him.

44
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,960
I liked leaning my back against him.

45
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,560
When my grandpa was sleeping.

46
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,160
I spent a lot of time with my grandpa.

47
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,680
I’m really close to my grandparents.

48
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,600
Me too.

49
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,120
I mean, I...

50
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,200
I often miss my grandparents so much that I cry.

51
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,040
Then I...

52
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,440
Call them on video.

53
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,360
Like that.

54
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,240
Yeah, really close.

55
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,840
You’re pretty sentimental too.

56
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,480
Maybe when it comes to family.

57
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,640
I’m a bit more emotional.

58
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,600
Especially with my grandparents.

59
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,680
I think we really need to cherish

60
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,480
the time we spend with them.

61
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,560
We should talk to them more.

62
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,560
When my grandparents miss me,

63
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,360
they call me too.

64
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,760
But often,

65
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,040
I’m busy and can’t answer.

66
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,920
So I’ll

67
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,240
call them back when I’m free.

68
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,520
That’s pretty good too.

69
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,560
I spent a lot of time with my younger brother.

70
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,360
We were together quite often.

71
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,120
Because my grandparents—

72
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,400
Your brother was also at your grandparents' place?

73
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,320
Yes.

74
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,560
Then we're actually quite similar.

75
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,520
It's just that for us,

76
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,160
There were more kids at my grandma's house.

77
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,320
But you had a lot of kids around.

78
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,600
But for me, it was just my brother and me.

79
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,240
Yeah.

80
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,760
We probably had three.

81
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,960
At least three.

82
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,400
Three or four.

83
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,040
Back then, when we didn't have computers,

84
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,120
we just watched TV.

85
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,120
And my older brother loved being outside,

86
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,920
just running around wildly.

87
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,320
When I was in kindergarten,

88
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,200
I would always run after them.

89
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,240
Then my grandma would say,

90
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,960
she'd say it in dialect,

91
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,160
"Don't run after them,"

92
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,240
"You can't keep up with them."

93
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,760
Because I was so little, just in kindergarten.

94
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,920
And my brother and the others were already in elementary school.

95
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,320
But I really liked following them.

96
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,240
But my cousin (older female),

97
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,200
was a bit better.

98
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,040
She would stay at home.

99
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,840
She'd watch TV and stuff.

100
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,640
So actually, you guys—

101
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,760
Did the three of you play separately?

102
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,680
Did you only play with your brother?

103
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,720
No, we didn't play separately.

104
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,320
We'd go out and play together.

105
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,000
But my cousin is a girl,

106
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,520
so she was a bit quieter.

107
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,880
You didn't play house with your sister, did you?

108
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,320
Like playing house?

109
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,360
Sometimes.

110
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:23,920
But not often.

111
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,280
But she watched a lot of those

112
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,320
"My Fair Princess"

113
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:26,880
those kinds of shows.

114
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,360
"Romance in the Rain"

115
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,120
Those dramas.

116
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,040
You know?

117
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,920
So I watched them too.

118
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,560
She's amazing.

119
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,960
She has a skill—

120
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,480
which is,

121
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,800
she can accurately tell

122
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,320
which TV channel

123
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,280
at this time every day

124
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,120
is airing which drama.

125
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,720
And what drama is on at another time.

126
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,040
So when this drama

127
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,320
goes into a commercial break,

128
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,320
she can immediately

129
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,400
switch to another

130
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,600
TV channel.

131
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,000
That's impressive.

132
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,040
And watch another drama.

133
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,840
You know?

134
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,160
Yeah, and then she'd

135
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,760
snack on sunflower seeds while watching TV.

136
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,440
I'd also watch a bit from the side.

137
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:54,880
Like that.

138
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,840
You're pretty patient.

139
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:57,680
Yeah.

140
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,160
My brother wouldn't watch with me.

141
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,000
Now I can only recall the happy memories from before.

142
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,520
The happier times.

143
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,840
What I remember most is

144
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,800
there was a newly built

145
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,920
road called Sunshine Boulevard.

146
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,240
The kids in the village said

147
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,520
that road could lead to Hangzhou.

148
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,720
And for some reason,

149
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,320
we rode our bikes

150
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,160
along that road, just kept riding.

151
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,280
Kept riding, but didn't—

152
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,440
Did you make it to Hangzhou?

153
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,880
We talked about the idea back then.

154
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,120
But halfway there, we got so tired.

155
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,200
Actually, not even halfway.

156
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:31,800
Not even halfway.

157
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,360
Didn't even finish that road.

158
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,720
Just rode to the end.

159
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,440
And then—

160
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,640
realized we were exhausted.

161
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,040
Because the wind was so strong.

162
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,040
We couldn't keep riding.

163
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,440
Luckily, the adults drove out to find us.

164
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,880
Childhood was really happy.

165
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,120
It's enough to remember these memories.

166
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,320
Hello.

167
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,840
Hi.

168
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,600
We're just about done at the same time.

169
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,000
What dish is this?

170
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,040
This is curry chicken.

171
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,520
A main dish.

172
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,520
We're not making tom yum today.

173
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,920
Very Southeast Asian style.

174
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,920
No tom yum today.

175
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,320
But we have udon noodles and rice.

176
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,120
Let's check over there.

177
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,800
Okay.

178
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,680
Do we need to move the table?

179
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,800
Move the chairs.

180
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,520
Sneak a peek.

181
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:52,840
Your dishes.

182
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,280
Already.

183
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,640
Our dishes.

184
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,560
Lánlán all of a sudden.

185
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,560
What's wrong?

186
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,040
Just taking a look at your dishes.

187
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,000
Ruìlóng's specialty dishes.

188
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,520
Yes.

189
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,560
All here.

190
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,120
Not bad.

191
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,680
Why is the salmon on two plates?

192
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,440
I thought one plate was for here and one for there.

193
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,000
Cover it.

194
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,560
Ruìlóng's plating.

195
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,160
We've already messed it up perfectly.

196
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,360
You give this to it.

197
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,160
Add this to it.

198
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,200
It'll be gone soon.

199
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,200
Are you eating it raw again today?

200
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,200
Raw cilantro.

201
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,320
Eating cilantro raw.

202
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,600
For people who love cilantro.

203
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,040
Such a unique dish.

204
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,040
He's made this dish several times already.

205
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,120
Is this even a dish?

206
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,560
Some people love cilantro.

207
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,560
I'm not saying who.

208
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,520
But there is someone.

209
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,880
We went next door to take a look.

210
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,640
Saw their dishes.

211
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,280
Yeah.

212
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,920
Ruìlóng.

213
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,200
Are you on the other side today?

214
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,000
Taking on a lot.

215
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,600
Is there salmon again today?

216
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,560
Yes.

217
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,400
But there's also a new dish today.

218
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,360
Which one?

219
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,160
The cauliflower?

220
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,960
Beef rice.

221
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,320
You just went next door to check the dishes.

222
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,240
I did, yes.

223
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,720
Do you want to see?

224
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,360
Let's go.

225
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,160
I'll go take a look.

226
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,440
It's fine.

227
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,080
Let's go.

228
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,120
Let's check out your dishes.

229
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,280
Our dishes.

230
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,200
Already covered.

231
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,440
Already covered.

232
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,040
I can introduce them to you.

233
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,120
Ruìlóng's two specialties.

234
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,800
Salmon.

235
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,720
And

236
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,520
Beef rice.

237
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,040
Tamagoyaki.

238
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,160
Salmon.

239
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:41,760
Nice.

240
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,000
What's the main cuisine on your side?

241
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,160
Curry pot.

242
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,600
Also curry pot.

243
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,040
Compared to yesterday's.

244
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,560
How does my tom yum compare?

245
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,120
Yours is better.

246
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,480
Definitely yours is better.

247
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,160
Yours is the cottage.

248
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,000
Number one.

249
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,520
It's the same person again today.

250
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,600
Going to compete with you.

251
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,840
The same person wants to compete with you.

252
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,680
It's Yǔxíng again.

253
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,280
This man never admits defeat.

254
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,080
All your dishes are covered.

255
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,000
What, want to know?

256
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,760
Want to know.

257
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,200
If you want to know, I'll tell you.

258
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,520
For example, there's tamagoyaki.

259
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,280
I guessed it.

260
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,080
And salmon, right?

261
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,160
I know what's on your side too.

262
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,080
Yǔxíng made another one.

263
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,960
Wants to compete with my tom yum from yesterday.

264
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,720
You leave and it goes away.

265
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,600
Come on, Nicole.

266
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,440
Nicole, let's go.

267
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,480
Did the guys know the family and friends group would come today?

268
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,520
You found out last night.

269
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,760
I knew last night.

270
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,040
I found out last night.

271
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,320
Because today,

272
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,800
the guys really

273
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,800
gave it their all.

274
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,760
They even made sparks fly with the induction cooker.

275
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,520
Do you usually get to eat

276
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,960
the dishes made by any of the guys?

277
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,160
Did any leave a deep impression?

278
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,360
Then I'll call on someone.

279
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,640
Whoever I call has to answer.

280
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,600
Let's ask first

281
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,360
Yuanyuan.

282
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,360
Duoduo's tom yum soup.

283
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,240
Who told you to mention Duoduo's tom yum soup?

284
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,320
Duoduo's cooking is delicious.

285
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,800
Besides Duoduo?

286
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:16,840
They're all tasty.

287
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,560
Don't mess around.

288
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,840
Duoduo, who do you think cooks well?

289
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,440
We've been eating a lot lately

290
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,720
of dishes made by Teacher Zihan.

291
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,440
Teacher Ruilong's cooking is also great.

292
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,600
Could it be

293
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,200
far away,

294
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,560
but right in front of us?

295
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,920
What are you doing?

296
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,040
Not you.

297
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,360
Let's eat, okay?

298
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,200
Let's go downstairs.

299
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,680
We've set up a longer table.

300
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,880
It can fit all of us.

301
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,360
A place with even more warmth.

302
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,600
Come on, let's go.

303
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,320
Should I carry a dish?

304
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,680
No need, no need.

305
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,120
You just relax.

306
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,000
What help do you need?

307
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,360
I'll do it.

308
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,120
You do it.

309
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,760
I'll do it.

310
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,440
Left hand, right hand, feet, and head.

311
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,160
So professional.

312
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,800
Should I carry one?

313
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,200
No need for me to carry.

314
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,440
Should I bring the rice?

315
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,480
I'll bring the rice.

316
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,280
Let's eat.

317
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,600
This pot of spicy blood tofu stew.

318
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,920
Eat more.

319
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,320
I just said I'd eat less today.

320
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,440
Let me have a couple more bites, then we'll talk.

321
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,960
You look much slimmer than on TV.

322
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,520
I think so too.

323
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,040
I used to be even slimmer.

324
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,440
I was even a bit handsome before.

325
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,400
How does it taste this time?

326
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,720
It's really good.

327
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,840
How does it compare to the last two times?

328
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,280
I only tried it last time.

329
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,320
Because he said the first time was a "test run."

330
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,800
Tell me one sentence at a time.

331
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,560
Okay.

332
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,640
Your kitchens are separate too.

333
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,680
I saw two kitchens.

334
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,280
So that means...

335
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,560
You can only be in your assigned area.

336
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,280
To eat, right?

337
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,280
In theory, yes.

338
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,280
That's how it's supposed to be.

339
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,640
But you didn't follow the rules.

340
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,840
I did follow the rules.

341
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,280
Did anyone break the rules?

342
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,120
I don't know.

343
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,240
I just saw your big reaction.

344
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,240
So someone visited another room.

345
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,080
Someone switched floors.

346
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,840
Someone switched floors.

347
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,400
Yeah, because I know...

348
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,920
You have a room-switching system.

349
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,840
The only system.

350
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,520
Right?

351
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,040
There's a card, a rule for switching rooms.

352
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,120
So who switched?

353
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,600
Who was it?

354
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:29,960
Guess.

355
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,400
Who?

356
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:35,720
Spot on.

357
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,560
After switching, I became his roommate.

358
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,120
Yeah.

359
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,480
You're his roommate.

360
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:41,720
Yeah.

361
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,880
So you wanted to...

362
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,880
be his roommate on purpose.

363
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,160
I switched on purpose.

364
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,080
Where did you live before?

365
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,800
On the first floor, with Ruìlóng.

366
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,040
Ruìlóng, how have you been living lately?

367
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,680
Now I'm lonely.

368
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,080
Without Jiāo, there's no one to chat with at night.

369
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,280
Heart-to-heart talks.

370
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,360
Heart-to-heart talks.

371
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,600
Are you feeling lonely now?

372
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,480
You're asking such personal questions?

373
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,120
Are you okay?

374
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,880
Just no one to have heart-to-heart talks with.

375
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,280
But at least Zǐhán is still here.

376
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,280
Did you enjoy your meal today?

377
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,480
I had a pretty good time eating today.

378
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,200
Was it really fun or just okay?

379
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,480
Very happy.

380
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,920
How do you feel in the cabin right now?

381
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,480
I think because I

382
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,760
still need to get used to it.

383
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,520
Maybe I haven't spent much time

384
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,960
getting to know everyone yet.

385
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,960
Yeah, so I'll take it step by step.

386
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,720
When I see everyone,

387
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,360
is it different from

388
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,880
when you first entered the cabin?

389
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,480
Does it feel any different?

390
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,240
Everyone has been pretty accepting of me.

391
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,440
Yes, everyone is really

392
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,320
I might be the last one to arrive,

393
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,480
but everyone has helped me

394
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,120
a lot.

395
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,880
It helped me quickly

396
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,840
fit into this big family.

397
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,760
It's really nice.

398
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,440
Is there anything you're still not used to?

399
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,720
Right now,

400
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,680
to be honest, there definitely is.

401
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,480
Yeah, but I'm working on it.

402
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,760
Like what kinds of things?

403
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,560
What are you trying to overcome now?

404
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,920
For example, the big flat situation.

405
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,360
Because the people I want to see

406
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,360
are separated, and it's tough.

407
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,760
It's hard not to express what I want directly.

408
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,480
I'm someone who likes to express myself.

409
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,800
Because I feel like

410
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,920
when I eat delicious spicy blood tofu stew,

411
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,320
I want to share it with others.

412
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,720
The spicy blood tofu stew today

413
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,560
really took a lot of effort.

414
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,600
I'm not just talking about the stew.

415
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,800
Today's meal

416
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,040
was super fun and satisfying.

417
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,720
Let's start clearing the table.

418
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,320
Is that okay?

419
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,080
Let's do it.

420
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,720
Are we all going upstairs?

421
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,760
I'll take the family and friends group, okay?

422
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:17,880
Don't worry.

423
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,280
It's fine to leave your daughter with us.

424
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,040
No worries.

425
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,000
Alright, we're leaving.

426
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,720
Okay.

427
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,960
Goodbye.

428
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:29,760
Bye.

429
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,280
Come on, family and friends.

430
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,080
Here with us,

431
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,320
there's a cute little surprise.

432
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,160
Today,

433
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,560
all of us

434
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,640
have spent the whole day together.

435
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,960
So, throughout this day,

436
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,280
as we come to the end,

437
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,520
who left the deepest impression on you?

438
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,560
You can give them a little red flower here.

439
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,360
Who wants to go first?

440
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,080
Sister-in-law, you go first.

441
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,040
I'll go first.

442
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,040
I'll pick one.

443
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,160
Can I only choose one?

444
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,880
Anyway, you're taking someone else's now.

445
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,520
Then I'll give it to him.

446
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,760
Okay, to Ruìlóng.

447
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,520
To Ruìlóng.

448
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,200
Alright.

449
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,120
Why Ruìlóng?

450
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,720
When he was cooking,

451
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,920
he cleaned up the kitchen.

452
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,040
He was willing to help with chores.

453
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,160
I think that's important for family harmony.

454
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,440
It's a key trait for a lasting relationship.

455
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,680
A very important quality.

456
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,800
I choose

457
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,480
I choose Wáng Lèchén.

458
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,520
I chose him because tonight,

459
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,840
he was the only one who

460
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,600
made non-spicy dishes for my daughter.

461
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,400
All the other dishes were spicy.

462
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,880
He made two non-spicy dishes.

463
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,160
Liú Zǐhán.

464
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,640
I chose him because

465
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,160
he answered questions really well.

466
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,440
He's the tallest.

467
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,920
My daughter likes taller boys.

468
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,680
Boys who are cheerful.

469
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,640
Not sure if my feeling is right.

470
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,800
He seems to take care of me.

471
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,440
I don't know.

472
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:06,960
I'm not sure.

473
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,680
Anyway, I feel cared for.

474
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,360
I feel loved.

475
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,120
I feel a bit favored.

476
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,720
Yes, maybe it's just affection by association.

477
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,920
Yes.

478
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,800
That's possible too.

479
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,560
I choose him too.

480
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,280
First, his cooking is delicious.

481
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:21,960
Second,

482
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,240
when we toured the little house,

483
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,120
I saw a guqin in his bedroom.

484
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,520
That shows

485
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,640
he's someone with

486
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,240
a lot of taste in life.

487
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:31,760
And

488
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,160
I think

489
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,120
he can take care of daily life

490
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,320
and routines,

491
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,920
but also enrich your inner world.

492
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,600
So I think he's

493
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,840
a really good guy.

494
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,200
I'll choose him too.

495
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,880
Alright.

496
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,720
My first impression

497
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,000
was that he's very thoughtful.

498
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,720
His attention to detail moved Mom.

499
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,120
Yes.

500
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,720
Both of them are excellent.

501
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,600
And towards Lánlán,

502
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,080
it's a very straightforward kind of affection.

503
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,720
I think that's great.

504
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,360
I might give my vote to Dr. Xiǎofāng.

505
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,800
Because I think outstanding men

506
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,960
should be both bold and delicate.

507
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,760
Bold means

508
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,800
my principles are clear.

509
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,400
Expressed simply.

510
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,560
Very direct.

511
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,720
Today, I saw Xiǎojiāo

512
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,160
show a very delicate side.

513
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,680
Both of them are truly outstanding.

514
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,760
Alright, that's all for

515
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,800
today's journey of the heart.

516
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,560
Thanks again to all the ladies.

517
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,160
Thank you.

518
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,160
Thank you.

519
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,280
Don't worry, everyone.

520
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,600
The kids are all here with us.

521
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,640
They'll be just fine.
