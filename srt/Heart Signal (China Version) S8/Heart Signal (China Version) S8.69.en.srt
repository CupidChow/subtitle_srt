1
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,800
I want to ask you something.

2
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,720
Will you be my girlfriend?

3
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,360
Yes.

4
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,600
Xu Rulan

5
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,560
Would you like to be my girlfriend?

6
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,320
So let's wait until we

7
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,960
can fully see each other,

8
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,280
then we swap our balloons.

9
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,960
Hi.

10
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,400
Show yourself, Duoduo.

11
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,560
Hello.

12
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,560
Chichi

13
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,280
Hello.

14
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,840
Happy birthday.

15
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,560
Thank you, everyone.

16
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,440
Wishing you a happy birthday.

17
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:25,760
This is for you.

18
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,400
It's so pretty.

19
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,400
Who am I?

20
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,280
I'm under the car.

21
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,120
I'm the "clown."

22
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,120
No, I'm the "clown."

23
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,320
Let me take a cooler photo of you.

24
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,400
I didn't use a slim filter, I'll prove it.

25
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,560
He really is handsome.

26
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,480
Like Iron Man transforming.

27
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,840
Now I come here for dinner every day after work.

28
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,920
Getting rounder and rounder.

29
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,360
Eating meat in big bites.

30
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,800
Something's off.

31
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,680
What's off?

32
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,360
Don't you think the way

33
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,120
we hold the umbrella is weird?

34
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,240
You should use this hand, right.

35
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:56,720
Sit.

36
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,560
Hello, everyone.

37
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,160
Hello, Ruilong.

38
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,000
Hello, everyone.

39
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,560
You guys are already here.

40
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,760
Actually, Ruilong might not know either.

41
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,400
I can tell just by looking at you.

42
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,880
So, in the end,

43
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,120
how many couples are there now?

44
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,760
Take a guess.

45
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,280
I'll guess.

46
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,320
Two couples.

47
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,560
Half.

48
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,040
Half of what?

49
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,240
How do you count half?

50
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,960
No idea, I just said two and a half.

51
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,200
Cover it, I want to cover it too.

52
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,240
Forget it, I won't cover it.

53
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:55,840
Why?

54
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,040
Are you cold?

55
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,160
Not cold.

56
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm not cold.

57
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,480
When is the next person coming?

58
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,560
Back again.

59
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,520
Back again.

60
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,280
Hello, long time no see.

61
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,080
Hello.

62
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,640
So you two are...

63
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,600
I knew it.

64
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,120
Thank you.

65
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,120
Where did you confess on confession night?

66
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,720
We were in different places.

67
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,640
We just called each other.

68
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,560
Where were you?

69
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,840
I was at The Third Arch.

70
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,240
And you?

71
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,320
I was at the Bridge of Hearts.

72
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,800
Bridge of Hearts.

73
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,480
But we were actually pretty far apart.

74
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,520
So you ran over to find her?

75
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,400
It took me a long time to find her.

76
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,280
A long time.

77
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,040
A long time.

78
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,160
Maybe not that long.

79
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,640
But in his mind,

80
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,840
it felt like forever.

81
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:07,640
Yeah.

82
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,760
Couldn't wait to see her.

83
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,280
You...

84
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,200
But I really feel

85
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,200
What?

86
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,320
Doctor Fang's gaze is much softer now.

87
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,120
Compared to before.

88
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,320
Yes.

89
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,120
He's totally in love now.

90
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,040
That's how Doctor Fang is.

91
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,840
Doctor Fang is like that.

92
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,920
Whenever Doctor Fang speaks,

93
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,360
it's so sweet.

94
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,400
"Supervisor" needs to approve.

95
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:30,880
Since Doctor Fang

96
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,640
after this,

97
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,120
he's been much gentler with his words.

98
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,880
Was I not gentle before?

99
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,280
That vibe is showing again.

100
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,560
It's not that you weren't gentle.

101
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,280
Just a bit of

102
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,440
professional aura.

103
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,800
Yes.

104
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,840
Am I gentle when I talk to you?

105
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,760
Gentle.

106
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,840
Always grinning.

107
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,240
No idea what you're laughing at.

108
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,720
What's so funny?

109
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,120
All the possessive traits are showing.

110
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,320
So possessive, huh?

111
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,520
Now it's showing.

112
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,280
It's showing.

113
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,200
I think he's already

114
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,600
really controlling his possessiveness.

115
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,480
I think that's

116
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,160
something worth praising.

117
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,720
Doctor Fang got praised.

118
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,520
See, he's smiling again.

119
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,280
He smiles so easily.

120
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,880
Help me!

121
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,640
So sweet.

122
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,000
I've noticed Doctor Fang now

123
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,280
has some little gestures.

124
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,080
Like this, for example.

125
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,840
Staring into your eyes.

126
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,440
And then,

127
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,480
blinking like this.

128
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,480
It's really just like

129
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,680
exactly the same.

130
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,880
Like what?

131
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,000
Like Rulan.

132
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,560
Really?

133
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,200
Really?

134
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,600
It really is.

135
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,160
Look at the two of them—

136
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,680
Is it true?

137
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,440
Is it true?

138
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,160
So shippable.

139
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,040
Love this ship.

140
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,840
Ship them every day.

141
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,800
Shipping up close.

142
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,800
Guess who’s coming next.

143
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,880
Chichi and Herry.

144
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,480
That’s possible.

145
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,360
Then sit over here.

146
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,080
Make some space for them.

147
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,240
Let’s move over for them.

148
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,080
For Chichi and Herry,

149
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,560
make some room.

150
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,240
I’ll come sit too.

151
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,760
I’ll come sit too.

152
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,480
No way.

153
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,080
Push a little harder.

154
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,800
I’m afraid I’ll slip.

155
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:48,920
Something’s up.

156
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,760
Slippery feet.

157
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:50,840
Who’s sneaky?

158
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,360
Me.

159
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,480
I’m afraid I’ll fall.

160
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:52,880
It’s fine.

161
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,600
Wait till I get the umbrella.

162
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,640
I’ll hold you steady.

163
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,040
What’s wrong?

164
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,360
Nothing.

165
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,720
Hold tight.

166
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,600
I don’t like rainy days.

167
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,080
We can find some things

168
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,280
to enjoy on rainy days.

169
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:10,760
Okay.

170
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:12,840
You go in first.

171
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,080
I’ll get your shoes.

172
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,880
Herry, Chichi.

173
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,760
They’re back.

174
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,680
Hello!

175
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,560
Long time no see.

176
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,000
We saved you seats.

177
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,600
Yes.

178
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,800
And they’re great seats.

179
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,120
Right, we’re on both sides.

180
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,720
What do you mean by both sides?

181
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,440
We just—

182
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,000
It’s easier to ship from both sides.

183
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
We’re members.

184
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,160
Member’s sofa.

185
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,400
Cover up.

186
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,720
How have you been lately?

187
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:47,920
What are you busy with?

188
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,760
Is Shanghai fun?

189
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,400
Herry bro,

190
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,640
It’s fun.

191
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,360
It’s fun.

192
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,480
Noticed Herry bro

193
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,520
has started talking.

194
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,240
Just straight up—

195
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,400
Big smile.

196
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,480
Of course.

197
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,560
Of course, I’m in a great mood.

198
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,720
Of course.

199
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,400
Why wouldn’t I be?

200
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,600
Why wouldn’t I be?

201
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,280
Why wouldn’t I be?

202
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:05,800
Right.

203
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,320
Is there any reason not to be?

204
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,040
Right.

205
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,560
Look.

206
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,360
We’re open and confident.

207
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,280
So cute.

208
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,080
Look how cute this side is.

209
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,480
You two, be open and confident.

210
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,640
That’s nice.

211
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,760
Come on.

212
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,440
Hold hands, everyone.

213
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,040
No way.

214
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,000
I want to hold hands too.

215
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,600
Can I hold one too?

216
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,840
Not us, right?

217
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,000
Just me, then.

218
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,840
Ruilong is so “pitiful.”

219
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,000
Okay, stop.

220
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,040
That’s enough.

221
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,840
Or else soon—

222
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,960
What do you mean?

223
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,720
I didn’t mean anything.

224
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,280
I haven’t seen Chichi in a while.

225
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,320
Can’t we hold hands for a bit?

226
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,640
So possessive, Herry bro.

227
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,480
What do you mean by “mm”?

228
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,480
Giving it back to you.

229
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,880
Heard there was a big move on confession night.

230
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,800
Heard it was quite a story.

231
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,160
So, what happened?

232
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:28,960
How do I put it?

233
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,440
Just tell us about it.

234
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,200
What I want to know is

235
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,160
the story of your private date.

236
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,840
On the first day, we went to a zoo.

237
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,400
So what’s in the zoo?

238
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,400
What’s in the zoo?

239
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,800
Giraffes.

240
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,680
Giraffe zoo.

241
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,520
Is that important?

242
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,000
Actually, it’s not.

243
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,720
Not important.

244
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,520
Honestly, I don’t remember anything.

245
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,800
When we were walking,

246
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,400
all I saw was each other.

247
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,280
Couldn’t see anything else.

248
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,800
Really?

249
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,280
Yeah.

250
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:56,960
Yeah.

251
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,040
Walked in and heard—

252
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,520
Long time no see!

253
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,280
Thank you.

254
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:08,800
You’re welcome.

255
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,560
Who’s back?

256
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,080
Hello.

257
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,000
Hello.

258
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,960
Long time no see.

259
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,200
Long time no see.

260
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,880
It’s been way too long.

261
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,640
Take a seat.

262
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,480
Thank you.

263
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:25,880
Dates.

264
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,480
Camel Milk Bites are delicious.

265
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,040
So tasty.

266
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,880
Camel Milk Bites are delicious.

267
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,920
Do these milk bars cause heatiness?

268
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,680
Is it camel milk?

269
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:40,600
Yeah.

270
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,080
A little.

271
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,600
A bit.

272
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,840
But camel milk is pretty good.

273
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,440
Really?

274
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:44,640
Yes.

275
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,040
So cow's milk is cooling, right?

276
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,680
It's cool-natured.

277
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,040
So this camel milk...

278
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,560
Camel milk boosts yang energy.

279
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,840
He always quizzes me on my expertise.

280
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,240
Yeah.

281
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,320
He's testing you.

282
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,280
I know you're kind of an "expert" here.

283
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,920
That's why I'm asking you.

284
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,760
But when it comes to photos, you're more of an "expert."

285
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,800
Slow down, bro.

286
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,480
Hello.

287
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,080
Hi.

288
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,680
We arrived last.

289
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,800
We were the last to arrive.

290
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,480
Come quickly.

291
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,400
Hurry, there's a spot over there.

292
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,200
Sit down.

293
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,240
Xinjiang—still having fun in Xinjiang.

294
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,680
Bringing me up again.

295
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,120
You guys make us feel like

296
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,960
our hearts haven't returned yet.

297
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,200
Like we just got off the plane.

298
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,560
True.

299
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,800
How was the weather when you went?

300
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:34,960
Depends on her mood.

301
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,800
Depends on my mood.

302
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,440
When I'm happy,

303
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,720
it's clear skies.

304
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,640
When I'm upset, it pours rain.

305
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,200
And when my mood is all over the place,

306
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,040
it gets windy.

307
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,440
It's exactly like that.

308
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,880
So why were you upset?

309
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,480
Ask him.

310
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,320
Please tell your story.

311
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,000
Can't go into details, huh?

312
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,880
Go ahead, tell us.

313
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,720
Raise your hand if you want to hear.

314
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,360
Expression.

315
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,760
Just now, he...

316
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,880
had a pro "gossip-watching" look.

317
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,280
Because that day we talked about something.

318
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,080
Well,

319
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,320
maybe both of us

320
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,400
weren't really

321
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,640
mentally prepared or expecting it.

322
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,400
It was about long-distance relationships.

323
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,880
Maybe that day,

324
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,000
I didn't express myself clearly.

325
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,800
And she

326
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,760
misunderstood a bit too.

327
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,720
Yeah.

328
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,600
So we had a little disagreement.

329
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:33,880
Right.

330
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,400
But it cleared up later, right?

331
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,760
It was sunny for two days after.

332
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,960
He really gave gifts.

333
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,080
He gave me a great one.

334
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,400
So on your confession day,

335
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,080
what was the sweetest moment?

336
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,800
When I confessed that day,

337
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,360
halfway through, I looked at him.

338
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,000
He started crying right then.

339
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,840
That moment

340
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,680
made me feel he was truly

341
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,560
doing things for me with sincerity.

342
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,000
So what did you do on the last day?

343
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,000
It was just the two of us.

344
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,560
Each of us held a bunch of balloons.

345
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:13,880
The rule was,

346
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,200
if you two, right there,

347
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,840
wanted to become a couple,

348
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,400
then you would swap balloons.

349
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,360
But if you let the balloons go,

350
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,560
yes, that meant

351
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,320
you wouldn't be a couple at that moment.

352
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,240
We

353
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,240
let the balloons go, then

354
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,800
held hands and walked back to Heartbeat House.

355
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,000
Right.

356
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,520
Even though those were the rules,

357
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,040
honestly,

358
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,360
we hadn't spent much time together at Heartbeat House.

359
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,840
We hoped that after it ended,

360
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,000
we could keep seeing each other.

361
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,640
And then make a decision later.

362
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,480
So after about a week,

363
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,880
how did things go?

364
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,480
It went pretty well.

365
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,440
Pretty well.

366
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,560
I want to hear from you two.

367
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,760
Go ahead.

368
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,920
Herry, bro.

369
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,560
The pressure's on you.

370
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,720
Go ahead.

371
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,440
Go ahead.

372
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,520
Tell us the whole story.

373
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,240
So,

374
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,080
I made him a cake.

375
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,920
And that cake had

376
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,880
both a snow mountain and a desert.

377
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:14,800
And

378
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,120
because we'd talked about this before.

379
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,720
When you're together,

380
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,680
sometimes you run into

381
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,680
one person wanting the snow mountain,

382
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,920
the other wanting the desert.

383
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,920
What do you do?

384
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,280
He said,

385
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,880
Xinjiang.

386
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,680
Xinjiang really

387
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,080
has everything.

388
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,080
Yeah, because I think

389
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,160
when you're together,

390
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,160
if either side always compromises,

391
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,320
it's not right.

392
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,160
So you need to balance things.

393
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,040
That's really true.

394
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,240
I honestly think when two people are together,

395
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:45,760
you have to

396
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,480
stay true to yourselves.

397
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,960
Not just always giving in

398
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,840
to the other person,

399
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,400
or else

400
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,000
one of you will end up unhappy.

401
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,040
Yeah, so

402
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,160
when it comes to this,

403
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:55,840
I made

404
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,640
that kind of cake.

405
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,640
He also made me

406
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,960
those gift exchange cards before.

407
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,200
So I made him three

408
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,600
wish cards for anything.

409
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,080
These are for you.

410
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,240
Three Universal Wish Cards.

411
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,120
Did you use them?

412
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,520
I used one.

413
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,920
The wish was,

414
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,080
The wish was,

415
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,800
for us to last forever.

416
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,000
For us to last forever.

417
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,240
That's so sweet.

418
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,840
I think

419
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,200
the happiest moment

420
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,080
the happiest moment

421
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,080
was when we set off fireworks.

422
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,080
Because I told him

423
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,440
fireworks fade so quickly,

424
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,320
they're so brief.

425
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,840
I'm kind of afraid

426
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,160
that beautiful things always disappear so fast.

427
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,800
He said, "We can keep setting off fireworks."

428
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,800
So happiness will always be there.

429
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,320
Why did you just say "Mm"?

430
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,520
No, I just think

431
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,600
the fireworks part,

432
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,600
why is it so good?

433
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,800
Then explain it.

434
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,800
I don't get it.

435
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,520
I didn't understand.

436
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,720
Leaving space is really important.

437
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,640
Okay.

438
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,480
Just imagine it, that's enough.

439
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,720
So, for everyone here,

440
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,720
holding hands tightly,

441
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,480
Doctor Fang's gaze

442
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,800
never once looked away.

443
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,600
This person,

444
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,720
can you share

445
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,560
about our confession night?

446
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:25,880
Yes.

447
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,800
First,

448
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,840
are you ready?

449
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,720
I'm ready.

450
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,240
Go ahead.

451
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,000
The first thing he said was,

452
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,920
"I'm so nervous. Are you nervous?"

453
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,160
"Why aren't you nervous?"

454
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,840
"Why aren't you nervous?"

455
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,080
And in the middle,

456
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,520
she just wouldn't reply to me.

457
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,520
I was listening carefully.

458
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,080
Then he said,

459
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,560
"Are you still there? Hello?"

460
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,640
He said, "Hello, anyone there?"

461
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:53,800
Yeah.

462
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,440
That's exactly what Doctor Fang would say.

463
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,120
True.

464
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:57,560
No.

465
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,720
The more I talked, the more anxious I got.

466
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,640
I kept talking, but got no response.

467
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,440
You know what?

468
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,080
It was my first time ever getting flowers from a girl.

469
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,480
Alright, for that,

470
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,400
let's give you a round of applause.

471
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:08,680
Okay?

472
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm proud.

473
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,760
I'm proud.

474
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,680
Not proud, just happy.

475
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,600
Yeah, I get it now.

476
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,400
It's not about pride.

477
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,160
It's about happiness.

478
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
So, on confession night,

479
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,600
what was your sweetest moment?

480
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,520
For me, I think it was

481
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,600
when I saw him running toward me.

482
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,440
Whether it's a date or any occasion,

483
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,040
I feel like he's always eager to see me.

484
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,320
And then I just feel

485
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,440
that in his eyes, there is always

486
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,040
only me.

487
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,600
You can tell.

488
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:46,840
Yeah.

489
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,320
And then

490
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,640
The card I wrote for him in the flowers

491
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,600
had a message on it.

492
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,600
I wrote,

493
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,760
I noticed that in a noisy crowd,

494
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,440
your gaze

495
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,320
always stays only on me.

496
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,720
Look to your left.

497
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,960
That's him.

498
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,560
In his (shopping) cart,

499
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,520
there's something else.

500
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,680
It's something related

501
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,200
to his profession.

502
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,840
I know.

503
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,200
Can you guess what it is?

504
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,320
I think I know now.

505
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,160
I knew as soon as I heard.

506
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,120
Glasses.

507
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:25,920
Look at me.

508
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,760
Heart.

509
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,680
It's

510
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,440
the stethoscope.

511
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:28,920
Yeah.

512
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,440
Right, so I took the stethoscope

513
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,840
and listened to his heartbeat.

514
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,240
Then he asked if my heart was beating fast.

515
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,480
And I said,

516
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,320
Is it fast because I ran over here,

517
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,560
or is it for another reason?

518
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,360
Running is only part of it.

519
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,160
How much? What fraction?

520
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,480
Ten percent.

521
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,400
So the other ninety percent is

522
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,480
the cart is too heavy.

523
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,480
Heartbeat.

524
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,680
Heartbeat.

525
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,080
Welcome back, everyone,

526
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,040
to witness your happiness and joy

527
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,120
here at the warm and sincere Heartbeat House.

528
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:14,520
Here,

529
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,520
everyone has spent

530
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,560
unforgettable and precious moments.

531
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:17,960
Here,

532
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,160
we've gained friendship, love,

533
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,720
and personal growth.

534
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,160
Everything here deserves to be captured forever.

535
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,120
Next, we'll split everyone into three groups.

536
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,000
The first group is

537
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,920
Chichi and Herry,

538
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,240
Xu Rulan and Doctor Fang,

539
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,520
Lu Yuan and Le Chen.

540
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,520
The three of us are already here.

541
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,000
Yes, Duoduo, Jue'er, and Yifan.

542
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,520
And then

543
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,600
there's Brother Jiao,

544
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,960
Yu Xing and Rui Long.

545
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,360
Each group needs to take

546
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,760
three themed Heartbeat Snapshots.

547
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,680
The best photo in each theme

548
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,320
will win a mystery prize.

549
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:48,840
So now,

550
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,800
please sit with your teammates.

551
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,480
Sit together.

552
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,160
Brother Jiao, Rui Long, and Yu Xing should sit together.

553
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:58,800
Let's discuss

554
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,200
how each group needs to shoot three themed photos.

555
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,480
Each theme must be shot separately.

556
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,480
So that's nine photos in total.

557
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,080
I think that's right.

558
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,120
Let's take more photos first.

559
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,600
Yes, shoot first.

560
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,840
Taking more is always good.

561
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,520
Take more.

562
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,480
Then we'll submit them.

563
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,240
We'll choose on the spot.

564
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,480
Let's do a gaze shot.

565
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,040
Yes, romantic.

566
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,440
I've planned a gaze shot.

567
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,480
Do you want to do a gaze shot too?

568
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,120
I want to take a photo with my big dog plush.

569
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,640
I'll go get it.

570
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:28,960
Wait a bit.

571
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,320
How should we shoot "captured romance"?

572
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,880
Let's think about it first.

573
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,160
What do we want to capture?

574
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,320
Something custom.

575
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,200
Actually,

576
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,560
this might be

577
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,040
where we can really shine.

578
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,480
I think Jue is perfect for romance.

579
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,080
Let's look for romantic scenes.

580
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:46,560
And Yifan,

581
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,200
you can go for happiness.

582
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:47,640
Because Yifan

583
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,160
really fits that joyful vibe.

584
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,960
Then capture "x".

585
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,880
I'll give you two options.

586
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,400
You can choose.

587
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:51,720
Okay.

588
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,000
Okay.

589
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,760
Alright, done.

590
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,560
We're finished discussing.

591
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,280
Really?

592
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,640
That's bold.

593
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,680
We've already discussed.

594
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,600
What should we do next?

595
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,360
Step one, two, three.

596
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,480
Let's "borrow" some answers.

597
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,520
Six people are definitely more complicated than three.

598
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,040
Go for it!

599
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,680
We're now split into three main groups.

600
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,600
And each group needs to pick a leader.

601
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,000
It's just that the rules for choosing

602
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,960
and the method are different.

603
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,120
You guys (first group) have to dance.

604
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:12,320
Yeah.

605
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,600
Then the rest of us will vote for you.

606
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,400
Then we'll do a quick quiz.

607
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:16,920
Answer questions.

608
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,560
Rapid-fire Q&A.

609
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:17,920
Yeah.

610
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,200
Then it's a men's showdown.

611
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,080
That's pretty simple.

612
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,560
Push-ups.

613
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,320
This.

614
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,240
Yeah.

615
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:25,840
Looking forward to it.

616
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,880
This is so sweet.

617
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,360
It's sweet even before it starts.

618
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,640
This really suits Lanlan.

619
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:39,560
Hurry up.

620
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,760
Doctor Fang, memorize it quickly.

621
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,320
Honestly, this really suits Chichi.

622
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,840
Chichi always has that shy face.

623
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,560
Are you guys choosing one?

624
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,320
Or are you dancing to every song?

625
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,240
Dancing to every song sounds good too.

626
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,680
The first one.

627
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,240
Okay.

628
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,600
Then we'll pick the first one.

629
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,440
Alright, we'll take the third one.

630
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,880
You guys pick the second one.

631
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:18,960
Got it.

632
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,120
Okay.

633
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,800
This move is actually pretty simple.

634
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,960
Honestly, you don't need to worry.

635
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,960
You can just keep going—

636
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,080
I think Herry is great at improvising.

637
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,440
Like that night when he sang.

638
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,280
Because at that time,

639
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,040
he wanted everyone

640
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,000
to get hyped together,

641
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,200
he was so good at performing on the spot.

642
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,960
Let's go first, then.

643
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,320
Sure.

644
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,280
Then our group will go first.

645
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,160
Do I need to stand on something?

646
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,280
I need to stand up higher.

647
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,480
Why are you being shy?

648
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,280
You're hiding in the back.

649
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,720
You're like a little kitten back there.

650
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,440
I'm a kitten.

651
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,240
Are you ready?

652
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:06,880
Ready.

653
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,400
I can't hear you.

654
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,160
Are you ready?

655
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,800
Ready.

656
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,200
Doctor Fang isn't ready.

657
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,400
Ready.

658
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,520
Doctor Fang is probably memorizing the moves.

659
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,200
We'll go with you guys.

660
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,320
We can join you.

661
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:16,840
Yeah.

662
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,920
We're ready too.

663
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,520
Did you touch?

664
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:50,880
So sweet.

665
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,560
So sweet.

666
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,080
Did you remember it?

667
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,200
Sort of.

668
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,600
Just go for it, don't look.

669
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,840
You'll do great.

670
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,080
Believe in yourselves.

671
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,120
Can we face this screen?

672
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,720
Move over a bit, let me see.

673
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,320
Sorry.

674
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,280
Let's go, let's move.

675
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,120
Let's go.

676
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,240
It's fine.

677
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,840
No need to go that far.

678
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,720
I want to watch from the other side.

679
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,760
I want to go over there too.

680
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,160
Maybe you guys should go over there.

681
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,680
This might affect your score.

682
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,600
What we mean is—

683
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,720
The judges' table is over here.

684
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,760
But then we won't remember the moves.

685
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,560
Are the moves that important?

686
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,280
I still remember Herry

687
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,200
when he first came

688
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,000
to Heartbeat House, he said

689
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,360
in northern guys' blood,

690
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,200
there are only four words from childhood.

691
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:39,960
What are they?

692
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,320
Bold and open.

693
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,760
Just be bold and open.

694
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,520
You say start, and we start.
