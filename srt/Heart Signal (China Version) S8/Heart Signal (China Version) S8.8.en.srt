1
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,720
Choosing gifts

2
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,040
Looking forward to it

3
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,120
Let the newcomer pick first

4
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,840
Then I won't be polite

5
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:49,880
I'll go first

6
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,760
Let's go

7
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,320
Then I'll go

8
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,200
I'll choose this one

9
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,200
So big

10
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,880
It's really big

11
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,080
Let me take a look

12
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,480
Who goes first

13
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,800
Yes

14
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,040
Car air freshener

15
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,560
Okay, take a guess

16
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,360
Yours

17
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:20,960
Really?

18
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:21,920
Yes

19
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,240
Impressive

20
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,160
Why?

21
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,080
I think this is really impressive

22
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,520
Like this

23
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,720
I think I couldn't hold back my laughter at first

24
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,280
Right

25
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,880
He noticed

26
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,600
Actually, there was some other information

27
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,320
When we arrived

28
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,320
Order of arrival

29
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,480
Yes, that's right

30
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,000
I could see two at that time

31
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,280
Yeah

32
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,280
Then it was my turn

33
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,120
What's this?

34
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,720
What's this?

35
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,840
Then it definitely isn't yours

36
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:17,760
Why?

37
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,160
Because you're asking what it is

38
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,480
Could it still be yours?

39
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,600
Because you asked what it is

40
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,200
Guess

41
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,280
Yours

42
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,360
Yes

43
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,000
Really?

44
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,280
Yes

45
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,600
Why do you always guess right?

46
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,280
I think that's amazing too.

47
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,280
By looking at your eyes.

48
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,080
I didn't look at you just now.

49
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:03,520
Yeah.

50
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,320
You're avoiding it.

51
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,720
You're dodging.

52
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,480
Yes.

53
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,080
I'm someone who

54
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,560
really likes to create spaces.

55
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,360
I think the atmosphere of different spaces

56
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,400
can also bring everyone different feelings.

57
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,840
And it's a playground.

58
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,760
I think

59
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,920
life is a huge playground.

60
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,960
I hope everyone can freely

61
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,880
enjoy themselves in this playground.

62
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,680
Thank you, I really like it.

63
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,280
It's my turn next.

64
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,120
This one is

65
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,160
What is it?

66
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,200
It should be a photo printer.

67
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,960
Let me guess.

68
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,240
Could it be you?

69
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,000
Could it be you?

70
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,040
How did you know?

71
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,000
Everyone guessed so accurately.

72
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,920
That's impressive.

73
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,480
Why did you guess it was me?

74
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,280
It just feels like something you would give.

75
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,040
Yes.

76
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,840
Thank you.

77
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,600
Because I am someone

78
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,960
who really likes taking photos.

79
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,440
Photos can capture

80
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,360
the moments in my life,

81
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,080
all the little things.

82
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,120
Nowadays, many people

83
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,080
keep their photos on their phones.

84
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,480
They're digital.

85
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,960
But if you don't look for them,

86
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,800
they tend to be forgotten.

87
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:53,960
But

88
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,480
if you print out some important photos from your life

89
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,640
and print them,

90
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,120
hang them at home or

91
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,800
somewhere else,

92
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,320
every time you see them,

93
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,720
those happy moments become tangible.

94
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,760
I think those

95
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,760
physical photos are even more precious.

96
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,000
Because everything is digital now,

97
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,920
but this might be

98
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,440
the only one of its kind.

99
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,840
So I hope

100
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,480
when you're spending time with everyone in the cabin,

101
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,840
if there are happy moments,

102
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,240
you can print them out.

103
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,680
It's so beautiful.

104
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,080
It matches the box so well.

105
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:50,960
Yes.

106
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,400
What are you doing?

107
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,400
What's going on?

108
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,600
It's been auctioned.

109
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,200
Take a guess.

110
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,720
Wang Yifan.

111
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,640
No, that's not it.

112
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,040
I'll drink as a penalty.

113
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,800
I was going to say, if it was

114
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,560
If Jiao Zhiheng also guessed it right on the first try,

115
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,280
I would feel a lot of pressure.

116
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,280
You're under a lot of pressure.

117
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,280
Actually, I was already feeling a lot of pressure just now.

118
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,280
I'm already sweating all over.

119
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,800
Because they all guessed it right.

120
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,480
It's from me.

121
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,280
Chichi (Sun Hanqing).

122
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,080
That's right.

123
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,600
This is because I'm from Jiangxi.

124
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,000
So I gave something from Jingdezhen.

125
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,520
An underglaze painted plate.

126
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,640
And this is also similar to my name.

127
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,520
Because "Chichi" has a simple meaning.

128
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,640
I hope the person who receives the gift

129
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,920
eats and drinks well in the cabin

130
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,040
and is happy every day.

131
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,920
That's wonderful, thank you.

132
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,640
Bro, I finished lining up for you.

133
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,920
This is a

134
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,040
film camera

135
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,520
film camera

136
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,360
That must be Wang Yifan

137
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,120
Because, like Xiaoyuan (Lu Yuan),

138
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,480
I also really enjoy taking photos

139
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,640
and I use a film camera myself

140
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,840
It's like an hourglass of time

141
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,320
because the number of shots is fixed

142
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,160
so with each photo, the count goes down

143
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,360
So you end up using it

144
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,560
to capture many important moments

145
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,000
That's why I'm really looking forward to

146
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,680
you capturing

147
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,600
an important moment we share

148
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,440
And if

149
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,040
one day you get the photos developed

150
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,880
you can invite all of us

151
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,920
to look at them together

152
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,520
Okay

153
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,200
Sure

154
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,520
It's obvious

155
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,720
Mine is a bouquet of flowers

156
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,040
But it's hard for me to guess

157
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,680
because I just met everyone today

158
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,680
You can look at their eyes

159
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,560
Ruilong

160
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,720
I didn't give it

161
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,000
You're very sincere

162
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,640
Yes

163
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,640
Yeah, it was me

164
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,320
Although the blooming period of flowers is very short,

165
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,120
I think

166
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,840
this reminds me even more to cherish the present.

167
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,520
And here, there's also a bouquet

168
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,880
of rather special flowers.

169
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,680
It's made with pipe cleaners.

170
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,280
It's a gerbera daisy.

171
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,560
This one can be kept forever.

172
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,600
It also symbolizes the sun and happiness.

173
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,280
I also hope that everyone can

174
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,280
always be happy

175
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,640
and full of energy.

176
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,720
It also matches my outfit quite well.

177
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,280
Thank you.

178
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,080
It's mine.

179
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,680
Open it here.

180
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,080
This is

181
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,480
Is this a lamp?

182
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,680
It's so beautiful.

183
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,280
It can change colors.

184
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,200
You two are out.

185
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,320
I guess its shape.

186
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,200
It was given by Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong).

187
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,800
Thank you.

188
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,400
Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong).

189
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,280
Yes.

190
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:47,960
It's just that everyone

191
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,000
Maybe a lot of people like to

192
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,160
play with their phones after turning off the lights at night.

193
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,400
Right?

194
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,360
You have this habit, right?

195
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:55,960
Yes.

196
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,480
That's right.

197
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,360
Actually, this behavior

198
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,560
is really bad for your eyes.

199
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,440
Neutral light is better for your eyes.

200
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,200
This kind of soft light

201
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,640
represents a soothing mood.

202
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,720
I hope that everyone in the cabin

203
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,200
can have a good night's sleep every day

204
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,560
and a good mood.

205
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,160
This is a cup.

206
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,720
It's like a kaleidoscope.

207
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,080
I guess it's

208
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,320
Wang Lechen.

209
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:45,960
Wang Lechen.

210
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,840
That's me.

211
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,080
Impressive!

212
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,960
Although it's a container for water,

213
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,480
it can actually

214
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,760
also be a container for emotions.

215
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,480
And

216
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,560
Even if the ritual is small,

217
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,080
no matter how busy life gets,

218
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,440
don't forget to love yourself.

219
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:13,920
Thank you.

220
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,600
Thank you, that's wonderful.

221
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,040
Chocolate

222
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,080
This

223
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,200
Yes, this is chocolate

224
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,880
I really love eating chocolate

225
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,160
Giving chocolate

226
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:48,760
is for sharing with friends

227
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,160
for friends to share together

228
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,360
sweet moments

229
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,560
So mine should be easy to guess

230
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,680
It's yours

231
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,560
Xiao Jiao (Jiao Zhiheng)

232
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,000
It's a

233
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,520
cushion

234
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,640
panda

235
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,600
Yes

236
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,880
Everyone probably knows

237
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,520
that there are pandas in Sichuan

238
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,360
I hope that during your days in the cabin

239
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,760
you can be like pandas

240
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,480
carefree

241
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,480
and happy

242
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,280
And at the back of its tail

243
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,040
you can unzip it

244
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,400
Yes

245
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,320
and inside there's a blanket

246
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,600
So now you have a sleep set

247
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,960
I also hope everyone

248
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,200
can, in the coming days

249
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,960
sleep a little better

250
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,120
This also matches with Teacher Xiao Fang (Fang Yijiong)

251
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,280
as a little echo

252
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,160
Yes

253
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,200
I'll just open it and take a look

254
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,720
Thank you

255
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,560
The box itself is already so beautiful

256
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,120
Actually, it is

257
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,600
Two gifts

258
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,240
Yes

259
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,080
I gave them

260
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,520
It's incense

261
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,240
Really?

262
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:31,680
Yes

263
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,440
I also love burning it at home

264
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,040
Me too

265
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,920
This is incense

266
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,200
Just stick it right in the center of the flower

267
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,120
So delicate

268
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,400
So beautiful

269
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,800
So delicate

270
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,480
Thank you

271
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,600
This is really special

272
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,640
Yes

273
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,440
I'm so lucky

274
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:03,880
It's incense

275
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,200
I basically

276
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,120
use it every other day

277
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,680
It's a lifestyle

278
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,560
And every time I smell the incense

279
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,040
I feel at ease

280
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,920
I feel like my emotions

281
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,160
also have a place to rest and a carrier

282
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,840
The scent of the incense you gave

283
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,200
It's sandalwood

284
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,360
It helps a little with sleep

285
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,640
Hope you have a good sleep

286
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,640
I have trouble falling asleep

287
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,400
I really need it

288
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,400
That's great

289
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,040
Thank you

290
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,040
All the girls, please go to the front hall

291
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,400
Choose the room you want to stay in

292
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,040
The girls choose first

293
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,960
The boys choose after

294
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,640
Ladies, please

295
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,560
Okay

296
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,080
Let's go

297
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,400
Here.

298
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,040
I'll go with you.

299
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,920
I'll get our profile pictures first.

300
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,520
This is yours.

301
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,640
We're looking for the profile pictures first, right?

302
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,160
Yes, they're here.

303
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,960
Over here.

304
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,280
Which pretty girl?

305
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,200
This one's mine.

306
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,000
There's more.

307
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,640
The pretty girl's.

308
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,800
There's one more.

309
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,360
And another one.

310
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,160
Yes.

311
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,000
Chichi (Sun Hanqing).

312
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,680
Thank you.

313
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,480
It's Chichi's (Sun Hanqing's).

314
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,320
So is it two floors?

315
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,320
Yes, it doesn't seem to be separated.

316
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,360
Then let's...

317
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,840
Let's pick the second (floor).

318
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,680
Then I'll take this one.

319
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,240
Let's grab ours first.

320
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:05,960
Go ahead.

321
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,960
Okay, then stick this here.

322
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,320
Because sometimes I...

323
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,520
might get up very early.

324
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,160
Maybe...

325
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,320
(living on the first floor) is a bit more convenient.

326
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:17,840
Like this.

327
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,720
How about I stay on the first floor with you?

328
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,240
Sure.

329
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,960
If you two stay on the first floor, I'll take the second.

330
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,800
Then I'll stay here.

331
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,320
Okay.

332
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,640
Then I'll stay here.

333
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,360
Then I'll stay here.

334
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,040
Okay.

335
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,080
Would you prefer a single room

336
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,280
or a double room?

337
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,480
Actually, when I live alone,

338
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,560
I like single rooms.

339
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,720
But after meeting you all,

340
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,360
I feel like I want to stay in a double room.

341
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,160
Really, I even want to stay in a five-person room.

342
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,080
Now I want to stay in a five-person room.

343
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,560
Really.

344
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,360
Yeah, all five of us in one room.

345
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,360
I think five people in one room

346
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,760
would definitely be super fun.

347
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,120
Yeah, I think so too.

348
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,560
I've chosen.

349
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,280
I've chosen.

350
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,240
How's the room?

351
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,040
We can't see the information.

352
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,720
We can only see that it has a first and second floor.

353
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,800
Yeah, then put your sticker

354
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,600
on there and that's it.

355
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,560
Let's go.

356
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,320
Let's go.

357
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,200
Over there?

358
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,200
It's here.

359
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,400
Where's the avatar?

360
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:56,680
Two floors.

361
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,760
There's a first and a second floor.

362
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,640
It's just the difference in floors.

363
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,200
Thank you.

364
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,040
You should put it over here.

365
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,480
Hold the key like this.

366
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,960
I'll choose this one too.

367
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,640
I choose 8-2 (the second floor).

368
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,640
Because it's my birthday.

369
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,480
Your birthday is August 2nd.

370
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,480
Then stay

371
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,440
on the first floor.

372
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,160
So I can only choose the lower one, right?

373
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,040
We're roommates again.

374
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,600
We're roommates now.

375
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,360
Yeah.

376
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,240
This room card

377
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,360
Do we need to use it like in college,

378
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,000
like attach a lanyard to it?

379
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,400
Otherwise, it might fall off easily.

380
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,720
Wear it around your neck.

381
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,240
Wear it around your neck.

382
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,680
So how did you choose your floor?

383
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,920
Well, because the two of them picked quickly,

384
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,600
they chose the second floor.

385
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,080
And the two of us wanted to stay together,

386
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,360
so we picked the first floor.

387
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,240
I think it's more convenient for getting up early.

388
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,920
Because I wake up early.

389
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,840
Finally, I can run upstairs.

390
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,320
It's kind of "revenge."

391
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,880
Yeah, maybe I want to learn to dance.

392
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,840
Jumping or dancing?

393
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,320
Dancing.

394
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:44,920
Like tap dancing, for example.

395
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,000
Like tap dancing, for example.

396
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,840
Then you have to find the right spot.

397
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,600
Because it might not be directly above.

398
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,400
Did Ruilong also choose the first floor?

399
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,600
First floor.

400
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,120
That's great.

401
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,520
We can eat lots of delicious food.

402
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,000
We can have egg rolls now.

403
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,560
We're in for a treat.

404
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,760
I feel like this time will be a lot of fun.

405
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,480
First floor, second floor.

406
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,320
It really feels like a dorm.

407
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,120
It really feels like a dorm.

408
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,600
Back when I was in college,

409
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,520
I often went to the second floor

410
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,960
to visit other rooms and hang out.

411
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,280
I also went downstairs sometimes.

412
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,520
Then I'd come back when they did room checks.

413
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,840
You can come check our room on the second floor.

414
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,760
Lanlan (Xu Rulan)

415
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,080
You're back.

416
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,120
I'm back.

417
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,320
Wait, let me put this down.

418
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,400
Sure, I'll go with you.

419
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:54,920
Okay.

420
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,000
Let's go find them now.

421
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,720
Okay.

422
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,400
You're an ENFP (Campaigner personality type).

423
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,280
Right?

424
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,880
And Ruilong is

425
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,960
an INFP (Mediator personality type).

426
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,840
Yeah, I remember.

427
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,560
He's an INFP (Mediator personality type).

428
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,000
And the two of us are

429
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,360
ENFJ (Protagonist personality type).

430
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,600
So we're the "happy big dogs".

431
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,560
"Happy big dogs".

432
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,360
"Broken little butterflies".

433
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,240
"Happy little dogs".

434
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,960
"Broken little butterflies".

435
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,280
Why "broken little butterflies"?

436
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,840
It's not a bad term.

437
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,840
It means

438
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,040
you're a very sensitive person.

439
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,120
But our spot today is still

440
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,360
pretty amazing.

441
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,320
Hello.

442
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,680
Hello.

443
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,640
Do you want to come over to our place?

444
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,200
Have something to eat?

445
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,280
Is that okay?

446
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,120
We can share that thing

447
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,520
and let you have some.

448
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,200
We just started eating.

449
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,080
Okay.

450
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,680
So everyone came back late today.

451
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,400
Yeah, I thought I was already pretty late.

452
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,120
Maybe open the other side.

453
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,800
Can you open the door on the other side?

454
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,920
We can't get in.

455
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,600
Can you bring some plates over?

456
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,000
Sure.

457
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,800
No problem.

458
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,000
Who just got back?

459
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,000
Did you two come back together?

460
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,040
I came back a bit earlier.

461
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:09,760
Yeah, she was a bit earlier.

462
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,280
Then when I went to my room to put my things away,

463
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,560
she happened to come back.

464
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,880
Then let's just leave the door open.

465
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,280
Our card can't open your door.

466
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,720
They should have been washed, right?

467
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,680
All of these.

468
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,720
They've been washed.

469
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,600
I brought some ready-made ones.

470
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,840
How long have you been back?

471
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,680
How long have you all been back?

472
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,080
The two of us arrived first.

473
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,720
Why were you the last one yesterday?

474
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,080
And today you're the earliest.

475
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,160
I got here too late yesterday.

476
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,120
A little bit.

477
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,800
Did you work a little overtime yesterday?

478
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,800
Yeah, so today I thought I couldn't do that again.

479
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,440
I had to come a bit earlier.

480
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,680
Let's go.

481
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,680
Let's go.

482
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,720
So we won't close this door?

483
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,680
Yeah, just leave it open.

484
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,200
Leave it open.

485
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,120
Hi, did you bring your camera?

486
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,680
Can we take photos at night?

487
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,120
Yes.

488
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:03,640
Okay.

489
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,800
I also brought a CCD camera.

490
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,320
Our dining table is just right.

491
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,640
Which seats are still available?

492
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,240
This side is all empty.

493
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,120
There are exactly two.

494
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,800
Okay.

495
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,560
It's fine, you can sit here.

496
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,120
Because Wang Jue and I have finished eating.

497
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,760
Thank you.

498
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,600
Thank you.

499
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:21,920
Thanks.

500
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,360
You guys are back so early.

501
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,080
Really.

502
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,240
Is it early?

503
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,040
Do you know what time it is now?

504
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,840
It's past eight.

505
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,960
Yeah, probably past eight.

506
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,520
That's pretty early.

507
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,160
Can't help it, today really...

508
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,480
...we worked pretty late.

509
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,440
This bun is okay to eat.

510
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,880
But these two are a bit...

511
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,760
Because the pot...

512
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,840
When it was steaming...

513
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,440
It wasn't the kind with a steaming rack.

514
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,800
So a bit of water got in.

515
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,640
Okay, I want to eat this one.

516
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,960
This one has vegetables.

517
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,320
It's really tasty.

518
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,640
Actually, I also brought some pancakes.

519
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,400
What kind of pancakes?

520
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,000
Scallion pancakes.

521
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,400
And sweet sugar pancakes.

522
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,520
You can try them.

523
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,840
But they might be a bit cold now.

524
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,160
I'll go...

525
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,560
...heat them up in the oven over there.

526
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,720
Okay.

527
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,560
They look so delicious.

528
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,720
Is this an oven?

529
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,560
Use ceramic or glassware.

530
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,440
Come on, Jiao, let me take some photos for you.

531
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,480
Let’s get a few cool shots.

532
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,000
Come on.

533
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,280
That’s the focused look I want.

534
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,480
So handsome, look at that jawline.

535
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,360
Jiao, those strong arms.

536
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,280
So handsome.

537
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,640
Your ears are turning red.

538
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,800
Really?

539
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,360
So handsome.

540
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,480
This camera is really...

541
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,320
...the best thing I brought today.

542
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,040
Okay, I’m out of ideas now.

543
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,560
I’m getting nervous.

544
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,480
Jiao, you’re full of hidden talents.

545
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,440
So handsome.

546
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,640
Come on, let's all look at the camera for a photo.

547
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,560
It's okay.

548
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,200
You can look stiff.

549
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,280
Stiffness is allowed.

550
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,040
Come on.

551
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,240
This is a bit hard to grill.

552
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,440
So I'm not sure.

553
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:52,920
It might affect its original taste.

554
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,320
Xiao Jiao, do you want to?

555
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,600
Let's take a photo.

556
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,640
Everyone together.

557
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,320
Okay.

558
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,480
Sure.

559
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,000
I thought you said you wanted to. Okay.

560
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,360
Where should I stand?

561
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,360
Anywhere is fine.

562
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,200
Alright.

563
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,000
Xiao Jiao.

564
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,080
Holding his pancake.

565
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:09,720
Walked a round.

566
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,720
Holding the pancake, not knowing what to do.

567
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,120
Brother Jiao is just...

568
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,280
Just walked a few rounds.

569
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,440
Feels like he walked around the world.

570
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,760
I'll sit here first.

571
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,560
Okay.

572
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,160
Three, two, one.

573
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,120
Alright.

574
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,680
As long as everyone's eyes are open, it's fine.

575
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,960
Let me take a photo of you all.

576
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,800
Okay.

577
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,600
Happy New Year! Three, two, one.

578
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,120
So beautiful.

579
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:42,840
You.

580
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,800
I think you've learned my trick.

581
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,560
Are you going to walk the dog?

582
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,320
The four of us can go together.

583
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,400
Or you guys can go first.

584
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,800
Hello.

585
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,720
Duoduo (Ke Ailin), I brought you something.

586
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,040
I brought guava.

587
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,120
Really?

588
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,880
Thank you, dear.

589
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,880
Have you eaten yet?

590
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,800
Go take a look.

591
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,280
Why are you back so late today?

592
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,440
There's no one over there.

593
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,840
You can borrow Jue'er (Wang Jue)'s camera later.

594
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,400
I'll take a couple of photos for you too.

595
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,160
Okay.

596
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,600
Have some char siu.

597
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,440
Alright?

598
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,440
What?

599
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,080
I want to go out and look around too.

600
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,640
I want to go out and look around too.

601
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,480
Let's go.

602
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,480
Is this shrimp still edible?

603
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,520
Yes, you can eat it. I think I was the only one who ate that shrimp.

604
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:49,800
Just now.

605
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,680
Okay.

606
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,920
Get the chopsticks.

607
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,800
They went out.

608
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,720
They went out.

609
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,880
They went out again.

610
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,840
Should we go for a walk too?

611
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,280
Sure.

612
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:03,840
Let's go.

613
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,000
Let's go, let's take a walk.

614
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,440
Where is everyone?

615
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,360
They all went out.

616
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,800
Jue'er (Wang Jue)

617
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:18,840
Jue'er (Wang Jue)

618
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,040
Wait for us.

619
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,560
Come on, let's go.

620
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,080
They went out too.

621
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,120
We want to go out too.

622
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,040
We haven't seen what's outside yet.

623
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,240
When will the chef make shredded chicken?

624
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,600
I brought chicken legs.

625
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,240
I remember.

626
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,480
Laughing to death.

627
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,560
I'll make you a late-night snack tonight.

628
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,400
Wait, why is it every time

629
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,840
it's always the three of us accompanying you?

630
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,000
Yeah.

631
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:48,640
Go back.

632
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,480
You'd better not look back.

633
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,520
You'd better...

634
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,920
You can leave too.

635
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,560
If you want.

636
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,360
Fine, as you say.

637
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,320
Then goodbye.

638
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,360
After all, you can't walk a dog with five people.

639
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,200
What time did you leave the house?

640
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,560
Me? Seven o'clock.

641
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,480
Then what time did you get up?

642
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,680
A little after six.

643
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,040
That's really early.

644
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,720
Didn't see Wang Yifan.

645
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,480
Yeah, they're here.

646
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:12,760
Here.

647
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,560
They're over there.

648
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,800
Maybe when we go over there later,

649
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,280
we'll run into them.

650
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,120
Just happened to turn back.

651
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,240
Is this Wang Yifan?

652
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,000
Wang Yifan and me.

653
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,960
Wang Yifan's outfit looks great today.

654
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,360
Really?

655
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,400
And together with the puppy,

656
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,560
it looks like a perfect match.

657
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,040
I really miss the puppy.

658
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,200
The puppy must miss me too.

659
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,920
So confident.

660
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,360
It should miss me, right?

661
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,000
Don't move.

662
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,840
Did you turn on the flash?

663
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,720
This looks really nice.

664
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,480
Really?

665
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,160
Because the lighting is great here.

666
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,680
It looks good, no need for the flash.

667
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,640
Okay.

668
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,160
As long as you all think it looks good.

669
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,000
You don't think it looks good, do you?

670
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,360
I think it looks good.

671
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,160
Doubting my skills?

672
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,520
Hello.

673
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,400
Hello, Weini.

674
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,680
You're so heavy.

675
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,560
Yesterday I carried the big dog, today the small one.

676
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,360
Bye.

677
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,240
Bye.

678
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,320
You guys go.

679
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,240
Bye.

680
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,440
You should be able to slide down this (slide) directly, right?

681
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,600
Go slide.

682
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,440
Did you slide?

683
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,120
No.

684
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,160
Why not?

685
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,440
I'm already past that age.

686
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,040
Jin Yuxing slid today.

687
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,800
Then he hasn't outgrown it yet.

688
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,120
Can someone catch me?

689
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,800
We're waiting for you here.

690
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:48,960
It feels great.

691
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,520
That was so fast.

692
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,680
You really don't need to worry.

693
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,760
Do it again.

694
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,680
I'm afraid my butt will catch fire.

695
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,520
It won't.

696
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,640
Let's leave it at that for now.

697
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,040
You go once.

698
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,440
Go and try it out.

699
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,880
It's really awesome.

700
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,280
Go on, hurry up.

701
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,680
Let's move away from here quickly.

702
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,120
Yeah, because he's too tall.

703
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,520
When I open the door, I'll go straight out.

704
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,280
You'd better go out.

705
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:12,640
I'll help you.

706
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,880
I'll open the door first.

707
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,120
You go, you go.

708
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,400
So funny, he's going out.

709
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,080
He just flew right up.

710
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,960
That's fun.

711
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,360
Just now there was a sound.

712
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,000
A sound I've never heard before.

713
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,360
Really?

714
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,160
I told you, I'm past that age.

715
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,880
But it's really fun.

716
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,040
Want to take Nicole for a walk?

717
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:51,960
Let's go.

718
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,080
Let's go.

719
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,800
Walking the dog.

720
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,600
Which one do you want to walk?

721
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,880
Let's go with Nicole then.

722
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,520
Nicole.

723
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,080
Let me try holding the leash first.

724
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,520
Do you want to hold it?

725
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,960
I want to play with her outside later.

726
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,120
Her butt is so cute.

727
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:11,800
Yeah.

728
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,720
She's like a four-wheel drive starting up.

729
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,160
No, I can't control her.

730
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:21,720
Nicole.

731
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,840
Nicole seems to have gone back.

732
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,320
She went back again.

733
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,040
Or we can just walk by ourselves.

734
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,080
Or maybe I think...

735
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,360
Should we bring some...

736
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,160
little treats or something?

737
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,640
To help control her.

738
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,720
She ran back.

739
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,800
Let's go.

740
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,520
Now she's sniffing around.

741
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,480
Now she's following me.

742
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,160
How many times do you walk your dog every day?

743
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,680
Bunbun? At least twice.

744
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,360
Just in the morning and evening.

745
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:58,840
Definitely have to walk her.

746
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,440
But usually, we walk her whenever we have time.

747
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,520
Its drool is dripping down.

748
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,720
It really looks like a four-wheel drive car.

749
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,360
Doesn't it?

750
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,960
When it runs,

751
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,080
So how do you tell if it wants to go to the bathroom or not?

752
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,520
Usually, dogs will sniff around before going to the bathroom.

753
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,760
They sniff here and there.

754
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,800
If it's going number two,

755
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,400
it will sniff in circles like this.

756
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,440
I don't know if it's a boy or a girl.

757
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,720
It's a girl.

758
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,320
Yeah.

759
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,840
There's a way to tell.

760
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,520
If it squats to pee,

761
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,640
then it's a girl.

762
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,040
But there are some exceptions with puppies.

763
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:36,800
Young male dogs,

764
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,640
well,

765
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,760
before they learn to lift their leg,

766
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,880
they also squat.

767
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,680
For example, Benben only learned after he was over a year old

768
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,160
to lift his leg.

769
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,560
Did you raise it from the very beginning?

770
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,800
You started raising it when it was just a puppy?

771
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,440
Yes.

772
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,440
How old is it now?

773
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,680
It's a year and a half old now.

774
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,640
What if it wants to run?

775
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,960
Wait, I can't run in these shoes.

776
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,120
Wait a second.

777
00:37:59,240 --> 00:37:59,640
Be careful.

778
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,360
You wait here.

779
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,560
I'll go after it.

780
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,800
Weini.

781
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,640
Just you wait.

782
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,360
Come, this way.

783
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,400
Wait for me.

784
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,280
Wait until I finish eating hotpot.

785
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,040
I'll change into a pair of sneakers.

786
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,040
Four-wheel drive, start!

787
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,720
Whirlwind charge, tornado!

788
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,480
If it charges really fast,

789
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,200
especially when a large dog charges really fast,

790
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,080
you have to

791
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:26,720
hold it back.

792
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,520
You have to do it like this.

793
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,840
You need to pull it like this.

794
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,840
Then it will slow down.

795
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,600
You have to let it know

796
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,240
that you have the strength to control it.

797
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,040
So cute.

798
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,760
Corgis are so cute.

799
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,240
Yeah.

800
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,440
I'm just staring at its butt right now.

801
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,040
Both of them are pretty good.

802
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,160
They're not especially clingy.

803
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,880
Benben is really good at being clingy.

804
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,000
How does it act clingy?

805
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,160
It's like a whiny baby.

806
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,440
Benben is the kind that

807
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,800
as soon as it sees me, it leans against my leg

808
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,720
and then lies down for me to pet it.

809
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,400
That's just too cute.

810
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,600
Bring it over here.

811
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,800
I want to bring it over too.

812
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,280
I'll bring it over if I get the chance.

813
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,160
I don't think it really wants to go to the bathroom.

814
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,160
How about we

815
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,480
head back first?

816
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,240
Sure.

817
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,000
Because I think you're hungry too.

818
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:17,960
That's fine.

819
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,520
Let's go.

820
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,280
Are you okay just now?

821
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,480
It pulled me a bit.

822
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,480
I'm fine.

823
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,600
It let go quickly.

824
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,520
Let's walk it again after we eat.

825
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,080
Okay.

826
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,880
You know, when we took it out yesterday,

827
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,320
it wouldn't pee or poop.

828
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,040
Now it's really well-behaved.

829
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,360
We've figured out the trick.

830
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,320
Because I brought some jerky.

831
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,880
Have you been busy with work these past couple of days?

832
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,120
Yeah, I've been busy.

833
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,760
Do you like your current job?

834
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,160
I do like it.

835
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,640
I don't put too much pressure on myself.

836
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,080
That's pretty good.

837
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:07,720
What about you?

838
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,200
My previous job was actually in an office.

839
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,440
I probably didn't like it much.

840
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,800
Now I just arrange my own schedule every day.

841
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,200
I find it pretty relaxing.

842
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,960
Do you take on work by yourself?

843
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,600
Yeah, on my own.

844
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,280
That's why I can

845
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,280
manage my own time.

846
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,600
My mom doesn't see it that way.

847
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,960
What does she think?

848
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,800
She thinks that

849
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,880
it's unstable.

850
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,320
She's a bit resistant to this kind of thing.

851
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,960
Does she still think that way?

852
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,520
Has she always felt like that?

853
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,760
Or was it just for a while before?

854
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,320
It was just for a while before.

855
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,840
It's so cool and refreshing.

856
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,880
Are you cold?

857
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,040
I'm fine.

858
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,080
Okay, last one.

859
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,280
You've already had three, that's enough.

860
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,200
That's enough.

861
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,080
Alright, now you're being good.

862
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,520
And keeps following us around.

863
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,720
Great job, really well-behaved.

864
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,880
Does this mean I'll be the only one walking Niko from now on?

865
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,960
I think so.

866
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,640
I feel like this bed is

867
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,160
more comfortable than mine.

868
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,560
Then you can sleep here tonight.

869
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,800
It really is quite comfortable to lie on.

870
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,440
Inside.

871
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,800
It's not impossible.

872
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,960
What's in that cabinet?

873
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,880
It should be something related to animals.

874
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,000
Those are their snacks.

875
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,160
Their snacks.

876
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,040
So the ones we were looking for that day

877
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,040
the freeze-dried ones are here.

878
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,480
Tofu snacks.

879
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,640
Freeze-dried.

880
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,760
Tofu snacks.

881
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,520
Help me.

882
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,440
Dogs probably can't eat tofu snacks, right?

883
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:56,640
Why not?

884
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,400
Can they?

885
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,280
What can't they eat?

886
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,040
They can't eat chocolate.

887
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,040
They can't eat onions.

888
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,080
I don't like onions either.

889
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,560
But you're not a dog.

890
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,800
Big dogs are really handsome.

891
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,520
Why did you choose

892
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,480
to raise such a small dog?

893
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,480
You don't have to walk it every day.

894
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,400
But it's quite a hassle.

895
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,360
You have to brush its fur every day.

896
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,480
Isn't it very delicate?

897
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,640
It's not that delicate, actually.

898
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,960
Mainly, it's just good-looking.

899
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,240
Libras care more about looks.

900
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,840
You're really all about appearances.

901
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,480
A little bit.

902
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,160
So when did you realize

903
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,520
that you care so much about appearances?

904
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,520
Hard to say.

905
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,800
Hard to say.

906
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,680
Hard to say.

907
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,040
Let's wash it.

908
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:52,560
I'll do it.

909
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,920
Shouldn't we soak it in hot water first?

910
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,920
It definitely won't get clean if you wash it like that.

911
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,200
It's fine.

912
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,480
It'll get clean.

913
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,240
It's really shiny after washing.

914
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,560
You're lying with your eyes wide open.

915
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,600
It still didn't come off.

916
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,920
This one.

917
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,920
Try scraping it off.

918
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,000
You do it.

919
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,640
Here, use this. It'll definitely come off.

920
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,960
Seriously.

921
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,040
Why won't it come off?

922
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,160
What if I manage to wash it off?

923
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,800
If I wash it off, you have to drink this soup.

924
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,200
There's nothing here that can't be washed off.

925
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,320
"Force" creates miracles.

926
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:40,800
Let me tell you.

927
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,520
I bet I could bench press you.

928
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,360
Okay.

929
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,240
That's about enough, it's fine now.

930
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,320
Give us a little dignity.

931
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,520
Otherwise, they'll really have to drink it.

932
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,000
Let's go.

933
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,760
Time for bed.
