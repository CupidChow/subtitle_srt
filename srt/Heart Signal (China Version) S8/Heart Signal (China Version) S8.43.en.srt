1
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,040
Let's just sit down.

2
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,240
Sit here.

3
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,600
Bet you didn't expect this, everyone.

4
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,000
It's me again.

5
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,480
I've "recharged" and come back.

6
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,720
I'm a super VIP member.

7
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,680
You're an ultra super member.

8
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,400
Didn't you come last time too?

9
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,720
Yeah, I was here last time.

10
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,440
Are you still nervous now?

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,960
I'm okay now.

12
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,680
I'm fine.

13
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,080
Let's give a warm welcome.

14
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,600
To our two mystery guests.

15
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,840
Hello.

16
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,160
Hello.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,240
Hello.

18
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:20,720
Please have a seat.

19
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,120
Sit, sit, sit.

20
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,920
Please sit.

21
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,600
Sit down.

22
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:22,960
Thank you.

23
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,800
Thank you, thank you.

24
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,520
Thanks.

25
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,480
Thanks for the support.

26
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:25,880
Alright.

27
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,240
Let's do a

28
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,320
Let's do a

29
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,440
quick self-introduction.

30
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,080
Hello, everyone.

31
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,960
I'm from "Signal of the Heart".

32
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,880

33
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:29,960
Season 8, Wang Lechen.

34
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,480
Hello, everyone.

35
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,280
I'm from "Signal of the Heart".

36
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:32,960
Season 8, Jin Yuxing.

37
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,680
Season 8, Jin Yuxing.

38
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:33,720
Season 8, Jin Yuxing.

39
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,560
Hello, everyone.

40
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,840
I'm from Season 8 of "Signal of the Heart".

41
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,360
Lu Yuan.

42
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:38,840
Hello, everyone.

43
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,080
I'm from Season 8 of "Signal of the Heart".

44
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,920
Wang Jue.

45
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,920
Why aren't you clapping?

46
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,800
Alright.

47
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,200
Is this your first time

48
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,160
joining "Watching Signal with You"? Right?

49
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,400
Yes.

50
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,960
Let me briefly introduce

51
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,320
how things work here.

52
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,480
This here

53
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,520
is the wishing bottle.

54
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,880
Now it's mostly full of "traps".

55
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,840
Everyone needs to draw one from here.

56
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,400
Left by the previous guests.

57
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,400
A wish from the wishing bottle.

58
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,840
Could you pick your own?

59
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,320
It's possible I might pick mine.

60
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,400
I could see Tomo and Qiqi from way over here.

61
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,440
Such a beautiful face.

62
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,560
Tomo and Zihan look really alike.

63
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,600
Which one?

64
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,160
Those two.

65
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,760
They look alike.

66
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,680
Zihan.

67
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,520
Their facial features are actually quite similar.

68
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,640
This is Jiao Ge.

69
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,440
This is Jiao Ge.

70
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,520
Is Jin Yuxing in this photo with Jiao Ge?

71
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,720
Who is this?

72
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,680
Jin Yuxing.

73
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,400
I'm at the very back.

74
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,160
Hiding in the back, all dark.

75
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,440
And this was from that time.

76
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,760
With the male guests from season five.

77
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,720
Filming "Watching Heart Signal With You".

78
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,280
This one too.

79
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,600
Are you all tired of seeing me already?

80
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,760
Up there.

81
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,520
You're in every episode.

82
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,600
The veteran host.

83
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,800
Are you guys nervous right now?

84
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,760
Not nervous.

85
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,440
Not nervous.

86
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,360
Alright, then you—

87
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,280
Impressive.

88
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,200
Actually, when I watched for the first time,

89
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,840
there were a lot of issues.

90
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,760
And I noticed them all here.

91
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,920
Then I gradually saw more.

92
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,000
So I stopped watching.

93
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,480
Today, you can watch as much as you want, okay?

94
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,760
Today, you can watch as much as you want, okay?

95
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,040
Today, just hold my head and make me watch.

96
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,880
Actually, when we were on "Watching Heart Signal With You",

97
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,720
we needed super quick reactions.

98
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,400
So next,

99
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,640
let's play a little game.

100
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,280
It's called "Simultaneous Eye-Opening Challenge".

101
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,680
Each guest needs to close their eyes and listen to the question.

102
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,840
If you hear something you're interested in

103
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,240
or something you agree with,

104
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,000
please open your eyes.

105
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,720
When, on stage,

106
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,120
someone opens their eyes at the same time,

107
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,560
you need to quickly shout out the other's nickname.

108
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,320
Whoever is slower

109
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,720
has to immediately accept

110
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,360
the massage hammer punishment from the others.

111
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,960
The person with the most challenges

112
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,600
will face the ultimate punishment.

113
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,120
How about the girls go first?

114
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,520
Give yourself a nickname.

115
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,240
I'll be called—

116
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,720
We can make it tricky for others, right?

117
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,360
I'll be "Black Fertilizer Can Volatilize" (a Chinese tongue twister).

118
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,720
That's way too hard.

119
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,320
You have to say it five times in a row first.

120
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:40,800
Alright?

121
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,160
It's not me saying it, it's you guys.

122
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,880
You need to be familiar with your own nickname.

123
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,560
I'm familiar with it.

124
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,880
Black Fertilizer Can Volatilize.

125
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,160
Black Fertilizer Can Volatilize.

126
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,640
Black Fertilizer Can Volatilize.

127
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,400
That's fine, right?

128
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:49,960
I can say it.

129
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,680
You guys definitely can.

130
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,120
Black—

131
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,800
Black what?

132
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,320
Aren't you just making it hard for Yuxing?

133
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,040
I'm totally making it hard for him.

134
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,680
What's wrong?

135
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,160
Black what?

136
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,240
Black Fertilizer Can Volatilize.

137
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,480
Black Fertilizer Can Volatilize.

138
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,560
This is way too hard.

139
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,160
I think you shouldn't open your eyes later.

140
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,560
Just don't open your eyes at the same time as me.

141
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,800
Then I need to come up with a longer one first.

142
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,280
What?

143
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,600
"Zongzong who carries a train from A to Z"

144
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,360
"Nike Weini Onion Head"

145
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,440
Okay

146
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,680
You're the "worst"

147
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,080
I'll be called

148
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,680
AAA Building Materials Wang

149
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,400
You're Wang Lechen

150
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,120
Call it "Spicy Hotpot Shredded Chicken Wasabi Macrobrachium Shrimp"

151
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,320

152
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,000

155
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,920
Okay

156
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,000
Okay

157
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,920
Now the game begins

158
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,640
Everyone, please close your eyes

159
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,360

Black Fertilizer Can Volatilize (a Chinese tongue twister)

164
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,160
Wait a second

165
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,640
Did Jue just open her eyes?

166
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,800
Nike Weini Onion Head

167
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,960
Can I hit you then?

168
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,080
I closed my eyes

169
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,680
I didn't go

170
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,480
You don't drink coffee, right?

171
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,120
No, I'm not

172
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,920
Don't let me see you drinking coffee

173
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,040
I don't like it that much

174
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,760
You're going against your true self

175
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,480
I really

No

188
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,040
Stop talking, you said it too slowly

189
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,120
You both spoke too slowly

190
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,320

Shredded Chicken Style Macrobrachium Shrimp

196
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,240
No

197
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,680
When I opened my eyes, these three people

198
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,600
Who should I call out?

199
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,760
Next

200
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,800
Watch the sunset together

201
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:04,960

Black Fertilizer Can Volatilize

203
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,920
I'm done talking

204
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,880
Your name is way too long

205
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,280
Okay

206
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:09,920
Last one

207
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,760
Nike Weini is so cute

208
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,600

Wasabi Macrobrachium Shrimp

212
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,120
What train?

213
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,200
From A to Z

214
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,480
Black Fertilizer Can Volatilize

215
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,280
Black Fertilizer Can Volatilize

216
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,800
I'm not saying it anymore

217
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,720
Can't remember

218
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,200
What's the suspense here, may I ask?

219
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,720
I heard you danced a group broadcast dance last time

220
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,320
How about another round?

221
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:37,920
Yeah, I really want to see it too

222
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,720
I really want to see it

223
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,000
I really want to see you do the group broadcast dance

224
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,520
I want to see

225
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,520
How about I request a sweeping leg dance?

226
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,480
Want to see

227
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,160
Alright then

228
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,360
Then let's do the group broadcast dance together

229
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,400
Why is it the two of us?

230
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,160
A bet's a bet

231
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,720
Not me

232
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,720
Stop arguing, you two dance together

233
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,880
Not me

234
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,040
Wang Lechen

235
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,360
Looks like you've danced it many times

236
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,360
I feel like

237
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,800
So cool!

238
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,040
Looks like everyone reacts quickly.

239
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,360
Especially the two girls.

240
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,240
Alright.

241
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,400
Let's hurry and watch

242
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,360
today's episode.

243
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,240
When was this?

244
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,520
This was after the sports day, right?

245
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,240
Yeah, after the sports day.

246
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,920
Is this your ordering segment?

247
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,480
Tell us,

248
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,000
how many dishes did you order?

249
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,000
You were kind of perfunctory.

250
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,600
You only called out once and stopped.

251
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,360
I called out twice.

252
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,440
Jin Yuxing,

253
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,800
you're really in the way here.

254
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,720
Should I switch seats with you?

255
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,520
I'll give you a bow later.

256
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,440
Fish tastes like fish.

257
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,720
Actually, I think

258
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,440
that game you just played

259
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,080
should be called "First Time Making Steamed Perch."

260
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,480
Later,

261
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,240
you'll have plenty to interrogate.

262
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,440
Don't set me up now.

263
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,280
I'm telling you, Jin Yuxing,

264
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,560
you'll see soon.

265
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,400
Don't dig a hole for yourself.

266
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:47,640
Okay.

267
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,560
You'll know soon.

268
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,920
Who was happiest riding the little train?

269
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,920
Alright?

270
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,800
Beef tastes like beef too.

271
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,360
Which dish was the best?

272
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,840
Lu Yuan, you answer first.

273
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,800
Lu Yuan, you go first.

274
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:09,760
Let's go one by one.

275
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,480
Which one was the tastiest?

276
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,480
Why me?

277
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,960
Definitely the dish I made myself.

278
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,400
The dish I made was the best.

279
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,080
Go ahead.

280
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,520
Which dish was the best?

281
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,360
The spicy hot pot shredded chicken version.

282
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,280
Wasabi lobster.

283
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,120
Thanks for the compliment.

284
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,920
Did you really make spicy hot pot?

285
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,520
He did.

286
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:27,880
You—

287
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,280
I didn't get to try it.

288
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,360
You were working out that day.

289
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:30,840
I was working out.

290
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,320
You were working out.

291
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:31,960
So you didn't eat.

292
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,200
Peking duck was the best.

293
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,520
That's true.

294
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,120
But actually, hot pot was the best.

295
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,000
Jiao Ge is changing rooms.

296
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,320
Jiao Ge is moving rooms.

297
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,440
I have a roommate now.

298
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,400
Only Jiao Ge would switch.

299
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,640
I don't want to switch.

300
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,800
Jiao Ge can't wait.

301
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,120
Great roommate, Ruilong.

302
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,400
See?

303
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,440
Look how happy Jiao Ge is to move in.

304
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,400
Not a bit of disappointment.

305
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,000
I want to ask,

306
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,360
from when you arrived on the island

307
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,280
to the sports day,

308
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,800
and during their mealtime,

309
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,400
what was the happiest moment?

310
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,080
Let me think.

311
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:27,880
There are too many.

312
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,080
Can't count them all.

313
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,320
Really a lot.

314
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,720
From first arriving on the island

315
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,040
and then

316
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,840
actually, cooking for everyone

317
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,600
was also really fun.

318
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,800
Riding the little train.

319
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,120
There's more later.

320
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,520
The rest probably hasn't aired yet.

321
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,200
Can't talk about what's next.

322
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,080
Don't mention what's coming.

323
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,280
That's basically it.

324
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,240
Wang Lechen

325
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,600
You really have a lot of reaction memes.

326
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,320
Why do I have so many expressions?

327
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,040
Is it a diary?

328
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,680
Not letting you see it.

329
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,720
Seriously.

330
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,280
It was after Jiao Ge moved in upstairs

331
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:07,960
that I found out

332
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,760
Every night, Jiao Ge

333
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,000
would give Lanlan a little gift.

334
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,120
Sometimes it's a snack,

335
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,840
sometimes it's something else.

336
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,400
Really.

337
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,440
Every single night.

338
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,480
He's the romantic type.

339
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,320
When I heard about it,

340
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,840
I was shocked.

341
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,040
It really looks alike.

342
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,400
At that time, there was nothing at all.

343
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,280
No expression showed.

344
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:01,840
Pretending, all pretending.

345
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,400
We really believed it.

346
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,600
Pretend.

347
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,320
I was sweating.

348
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,640
I could only turn away and laugh secretly.

349
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,840
Who is this?

350
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,520
So happy.

351
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,120
Just got the key.

352
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,200
How does it feel?

353
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,080
What made you decide to get the key?

354
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,400
Signal of the Heart.

355
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,000
The brave enjoy first.

356
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,920
Little train.

357
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,600
How did Dr. Fang know?

358
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,800
There are a lot of mosquitoes over there.

359
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,600
Very well prepared.

360
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,840
Why aren’t you wearing perfume now?

361
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,880
I want to see you spin around.

362
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,880
Spin around and spray Six God.

363
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,760
Only you know how to do that.

364
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,680
Teacher Jin.

365
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,240
It has to be you.

366
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,240
It has to be you.

367
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:23,920
It has to be you.

368
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,600
You guys are talking so abstractly.

369
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,560
Yuxing, are you romantic?

370
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,280
Is this considered romantic?

371
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,080
I don't even know why

372
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,400
I said that.

373
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,080
That's so funny.

374
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,880
You're pretty stubborn, bro.

375
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,680
Well, my friends all call me

376
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,640
"King of Comebacks."

377
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,560
Does Chichi play badminton too?

378
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,400
Yeah, she plays badminton.

379
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,960
She was on our team back then.

380
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,440
I remember Chichi was really good.

381
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,200
She learned it before.

382
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,680
She played in middle school, I think.

383
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,480
Do you usually have little alone time?

384
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,800
I'm always with friends.

385
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,920
Alone time.

386
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,040
What about work?

387
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,080
That doesn't count as alone time, right?

388
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,240
Alone time.

389
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,480
It's really only at night.

390
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,320
You wouldn't

391
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,320
intentionally make yourself alone

392
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,360
just to be by yourself for a while?

393
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,800
Intentionally.

394
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,880
No, I wouldn't do it on purpose.

395
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,560
Make myself be alone.

396
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,040
How would you divide these ten parts?

397
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,240
Socializing, alone time, and partner.

398
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,280
Alone time gets five parts.

399
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,960
Socializing gets three parts.

400
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,080
Partner gets two parts.

401
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,920
So your partner is this part.

402
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,360
Nice, that's great.

403
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:48,960
What about Jue'er?

404
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:50,480
I think

405
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,640
My socializing might be five.

406
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,920
Partner would be three.

407
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,600
The remaining two would be alone time.

408
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,920
That's so romantic.

409
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,040
This conversation is actually very effective.

410
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,600
Businessman

411
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,920
This is the "bossy CEO" type.

412
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,280
meme sticker

413
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,280
Is it this meme sticker?

414
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,520
The one from last time when you got smoked

415
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,560
It's the same

416
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,320
You really had a sudden jolt.

417
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,760
That's the downside of living alone, you know?

418
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,560
So you really are...

419
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,800
Didn't you notice at the time?

420
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,480
I didn't know about anyone.

421
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,480
Me neither.

422
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,840
After the first date card selection,

423
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,640
that's when I found out.

424
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,200
After my first date card selection,

425
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,240
I still didn't know.

426
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,960
Everyone only pays attention to

427
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,920
the person they're interested in.

428
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,640
Have you had any confusion lately?

429
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,200
Recently,

430
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,600
I haven't had much confusion lately.

431
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,800
Did you have any confusion back then?

432
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,880
Yes.

433
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,200
It was huge.

434
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,760
What was the confusion at that time?

435
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,640
The same confusion as Jiao Ge.

436
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,240
Don't dig a hole for yourself.

437
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,480
No, I just...

438
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,600
I want to hear it.

439
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,320
This is

440
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:19,920
Open Day

441
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,760
On Open Day, you have to cook.

442
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,280
We guys were cooking, right.

443
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,200
Everyone was silent.

444
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,640
Everyone showed their skills.

445
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,240
This is no longer just a kitchen.

446
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,600
It's a battlefield.

447
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,160
The tension was intense.

448
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,480
Who is this?

449
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,440
Who do you think it is?

450
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,040
Ma Ge

451
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,400
Du Ge

452
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,960
Xiao Ma Ge

453
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,440
Ma

454
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,400
Is he talking about Ma Ge?

455
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,120
My sister-in-law came at that time.

456
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,520
Because my mom was supervising the college entrance exam.

457
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,600
She happened to be invigilating.

458
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,240
So she couldn't come.

459
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,480
My sister-in-law lived nearby.

460
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,120
So she came.

461
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,280
It was the same for me.

462
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,640
I originally wanted to invite my mom.

463
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,520
To come to the event.

464
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,560
But she was too busy.

465
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,680
So I invited

466
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,000
my biological mom to come.

467
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,440
Actually, she

468
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,600
My mom really wanted to come.

469
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,280
Because she cares a lot about me.

470
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,640
In every aspect of my life.

471
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,080
It was a bit of a pity.

472
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,160
She didn't have time.

473
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,040
So she couldn't make it.

474
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,640
Is this a legit show?

475
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,440
Parents' worries are totally real.

476
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,960
Colleague sis

477
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,480
No wonder.

478
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,520
No wonder.

479
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,400
Besties really get it.

480
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,280
Got a gym membership.

481
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,640
No wonder.

482
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,560
No wonder.

483
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:09,920
Ideal type.

484
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,680
Ideal type.

485
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,080
Aren't you talking about Teacher Ma Boxian?

486
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,600
Why am I being mentioned?

487
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,560
I agree too.

488
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,560
So are you the type

489
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,480
when facing a problem,

490
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,320
do you handle your emotions first

491
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,600
or solve the issue first?

492
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,440
Of course, emotions come first.

493
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,640
If the emotions are there,

494
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,840
the problem can't be solved well.

495
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,640
What if the other person

496
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,880
wants to solve the issue first?

497
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,880
If they want to handle the issue,

498
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,800
then deal with it rationally.

499
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,640
That means her emotions are

500
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,200
already under control.

501
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,680
Maybe because I'm an F type (Feeling).

502
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,040
If someone like Chichi is a T type (Thinking),

503
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,960
they might focus more on solving the issue.

504
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,240
You're an F type (Thinking).

505
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,200
You're a T type (Thinking).

506
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,720
I think I tested as INFJ (Advocate Personality Type) before.

507
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,640
F (Thinking)

508
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,680
F (Thinking) means

509
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,960
You're also INFJ (Advocate Personality Type).

510
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,760
Yeah, you forgot.

511
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,000
So sad.

512
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,200
First day on the island,

513
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,360
we talked about this.

514
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,160
I said we're the same.

515
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,080
You said you used to be ENFJ (Protagonist Personality Type).

516
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,680
Now you've become INFJ (Advocate Personality Type).

517
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,520
You were even E (Extrovert) before.

518
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,480
When was I ever E (Extrovert)?

519
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,000
You forgot too.

520
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,360
When did I say I was E (Extrovert)?

521
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:31,800
You said it.

522
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,240
He didn't say that.

523
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:32,680
You used to be E (Extrovert).

524
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,360
No.

525
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,560
You said you used to be E (Extrovert).

526
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,840
No way.

527
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,840
He could never be E (Extrovert) in this life.

528
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,680
Let me tell you.

529
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,360
This point,

530
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,680
you're actually a lot like your mom.

531
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,120
You know, at that time,

532
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,680
I was just cooking there,

533
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,640
then I turned around,

534
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,200
Who?

535
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,080
Scared me to death!

536
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:16,960
Even now, seeing that scene

537
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,160
still makes me super nervous.

538
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,480
So did you guys know

539
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,400
the moms were coming?

540
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,000
No idea at all.

541
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,440
You know,

542
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,400
when we walked in

543
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,400
and saw that scene,

544
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,400
we totally panicked.

545
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,680
It was so shocking.

546
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,920
My mind went blank.

547
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,240
Totally crashed.

548
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,840
That kind of pressure,

549
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,440
you know?

550
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:52,880
Pressure.

551
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,640
There was real pressure.

552
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,560
It just felt super stressful.

553
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,240
After all, you're meeting elders, the moms.

554
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,280
So nervous I didn't know what to do.

555
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,920
Seeing you guys like that

556
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,400
was really nerve-wracking.

557
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,200
Felt even more nervous than meeting the female guests for the first time.

558
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,640
A bit more nervous.

559
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,360
Looks like Ruilong is blushing.

560
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,480
Nice, you're so proactive.

561
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,080
Because I thought

562
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,280
cooking might take a while,

563
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,200
so I bought some snacks first.

564
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,080
That's so you.

565
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,880
That's just like you.

566
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,000
Standing on pins and needles.

567
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,880
Standing on pins and needles.

568
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,240
Looking all serious there.

569
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,800
Just now felt like roll call in class.

570
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,760
Gotta sit up straight for that.

571
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,680
Who do you usually walk the dog with?

572
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,520
Who do you usually walk the dog with?

573
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,280
Haitao's questions

574
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,640
as sharp as always

575
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,920
I was sweating all over my back

576
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,560
you know?

577
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,480
why?

578
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,120
were you too nervous?

579
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:40,920
scared to death

580
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,920
I didn't know what to ask

581
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,560
I didn't know what to ask

582
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,200
I didn't know how to answer

583
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,400
I think you were already immersed

584
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,960
in that scene at the time

585
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,720
he's really good at talking

586
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,840
when I greeted them

587
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,600
I was already trying to answer quickly

588
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,600
you know?

589
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,680
your pot was about to burn

590
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,680
so anxious

591
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,400
yeah, I was really flustered then

592
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,160
I hadn't even finished cooking

593
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,040
they said we had to meet the family and friends

594
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,680
so I hurried up

595
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,000
switched to 1.5x speed

596
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,800
sunny boy

597
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,760
look, my hands were really shaking

598
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,600
my hand

599
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,920
you really were shaking

600
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,880
all I saw was work

601
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,080
just work everywhere

602
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,560
"kneeling service"

603
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,000
I remember we all knelt in a row

604
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,480
another one knelt down

605
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,200
Ruilong said, "Let me join in too"

606
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,160
there's so much to learn

607
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,560
Ruilong

608
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,200
Ruilong looked confused

609
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,720
Ruilong knelt down

610
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,280
before Ruilong

611
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,400
he often did that gesture

612
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,640
okay, we've watched the first half so far

613
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,440
Yuxing

614
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:01,920
how do you feel?

615
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,680
the most stressful

616
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,240
was still the parents' day

617
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,880
yeah, that day

618
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,520
that's true

619
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,920
so many elders and moms were there

620
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,760
what if the food wasn't good, right?

621
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,160
I feel like I'm back on that day

622
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,280
kind of sweating all over again

623
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,680
let's take a break

624
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,680
we'll watch more later

625
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,840
looking forward to the next part

626
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,920
you can look forward to what's next

627
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,120
really looking forward to it

628
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,600
definitely looking forward to it
