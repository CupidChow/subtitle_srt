1
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,120
Is this your first time here?

2
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,600
Hello, everyone.

3
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,240
Hi, everyone.

4
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,920
We finally came to watch

5
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,520
Watching Heart Signal with You.

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,960
Is it your first time here for both of you?

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,800
Yes, it's our first time.

8
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,560
We can take a look.

9
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,200
At the group photos everyone took before.

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,440
You've already taken so many.

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,400
I see three Chenge.

12
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,080
"Duoyuanxing"

13
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,280
We have a group name too.

14
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,800
We're called

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,800
"Chijiaolong"

16
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,120
Nice, we'll write it down later.

17
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:58,760
Okay.

18
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,880
It's my first time watching Watching Heart Signal with You too.

19
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,600
It's also Ruolong's first time.

20
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,560
So,

21
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,080
Ruolong, how do you feel right now?

22
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,480
Me?

23
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,120
Excited.

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,080
Excited.

25
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:11,680
Nervous.

26
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,920
And it's about to start.

27
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,280
Don't be nervous.

28
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,160
Just pretend you're watching at home.

29
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,280
So now,

30
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,600
Let's greet everyone.

31
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,360
Hello, I'm from Heart Signal

32
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,720
Season 8, Sun Hanqing.

33
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,360
My name is Chichi.

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,440
I'm from Heart Signal Season 8,

35
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,160
Ruolong.

36
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,720
Hello, I'm from Heart Signal

37
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,680
Season 8, Xiao Jiao, Jiao Zhiheng.

38
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,120
We're watching Watching Heart Signal with You now.

39
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,680
Let's start watching the show.

40
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,080
Okay.

41
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,120
Looking forward to it.

42
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,200
The familiar house.

43
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,680
The familiar hallway.

44
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,920
I'm back!

45
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,480
Liu Zihan is back.

46
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:03,920
Hainan.

47
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,360
That time on Hainan Island.

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,160
He really dressed like

49
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,200
someone going to Hainan.

50
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,240
Yeah, it's so funny.

51
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,880
Duoduo is really good at

52
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,280
giving emotional support.

53
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:19,920
You too.

54
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,680
Yes.

55
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,440
You two

56
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,760
You two are really special.

57
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,200
I'm here.

58
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,280
I'm here.

59
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:41,880
This is Duoduo.

60
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,880
She told me before

61
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,720
she likes cinnamon.

62
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,880
Cinnamon bread.

63
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,320
It's so tasty, I remember now.

64
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,120
You're so thoughtful.

65
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,720
Because I felt

66
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,440
during that time

67
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,400
maybe Duoduo's mood

68
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,320
wasn't very good.

69
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,760
So I wanted to

70
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,760
comfort Duoduo in my own way.

71
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,160
I felt it.

72
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,160
A dazzling entrance.

73
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,760
A dazzling entrance.

74
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,240
I was really skinny then.

75
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,960
You're still skinny now.

76
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,280
I gained six or seven jin.

77
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,600
Can't tell at all.

78
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,600
Really can't tell.

79
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:21,880
Really.

80
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,200
Thanks, that comforted me.

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,520
Thank you.

82
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,520
My reaction was

83
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,120
What you said

84
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,280
I was wondering what Yuxing was thinking.

85
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,800
What were you thinking at that time?

86
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,760
What was I thinking?

87
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,800
Ruolong said I was observing up close.

88
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,320
Observing up close.

89
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,640
Live observation room.

90
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,200
Duoduo said

91
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,680
Don't just talk, do something, bro.

92
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,640
Duoduo.

93
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,960
Duoduo is so funny.

94
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,880
You look like a statue.

95
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,720
Not moving at all, bro.

96
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,320
No.

97
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,560
Long asked when we can start eating.

98
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,000
How long do we have to keep filming?

99
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:03,920
Duoduo said

100
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,840
No one can escape

101
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:05,880
No one can escape

102
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,800
Everyone has to do it

103
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,640
We held it up for a long time

104
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,720
And then?

105
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,360
But it hadn't started yet

106
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,120
It still wasn't ready

107
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,680
We hadn't started filming yet

108
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,480
Actually, in the first second we saw it

109
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,600
We all went silent

110
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,480
Yeah, every day I

111
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,640
eat ice cream

112
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,800
I eat ice cream every single day

113
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,800
I can tell, you’re not full

114
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:11,800
No

115
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,560
Yes

116
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,120
I need sweets like this

117
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,800
to

118
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,120
relieve stress

119
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,880
recharge my energy

120
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,440
relieve stress

121
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,360
dopamine

122
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,480
What are you looking at?

123
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,840
Duoduo is watching the drama

124
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,880
I think watching other people

125
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,040
is really interesting

126
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,200
Go ahead and laugh

127
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,680
Long said

128
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,160
How’s the kiwi I sliced?

129
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,040
You’re really good at comforting people

130
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,400
What do you mean by a ten-kilogram blanket?

131
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,160
What does that mean?

132
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,440
I brought my blanket over

133
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,000
Ten kilograms

134
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,200
You must sleep really well then

135
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:31,760
Very well

136
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,920
I even want to lend it to him

137
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,680
Hurry and send the link

138
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,160
Send it to him

139
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,360
Share the link

140
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,120
It actually looks pretty nice

141
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,440
There’s delicious food every day

142
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,960
That’s how I gained weight

143
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,840
I’m really spoiled

144
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,760
I’m heading out

145
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,520
So every time

146
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,560
like it’s your birthday

147
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,560
do you make a wish?

148
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,400
I make a wish every time

149
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,600
But let me tell you

150
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,120
Actually, every wish I make

151
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,840
is pretty much the same

152
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,160
Me too

153
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,120
Really? You too?

154
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,560
I always make just one wish

155
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,760
What about you?

156
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,720
Me too

157
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,920
You make the same wish, right?

158
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,440
Looks like we’re all the same

159
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,600
Definitely the same

160
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,680
Eating fruit like crazy over there

161
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,480
And looking at me again

162
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,400
How have you been feeling these days?

163
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,280
I've been really happy these days

164
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,200
Very happy

165
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,440
As long as you're happy

166
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,200
Were you overwhelmed with thoughts at that moment?

167
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,720
Jue'er felt the same way.

168
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,000
She just said whatever was on her mind.

169
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,480
Very straightforward.

170
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,320
It was brave to ask so directly.

171
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:29,920
Yes.

172
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,760
Everyone was brave.

173
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,560
Not disturbing.

174
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,120
Duoduo really takes care of everyone.

175
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,840
Very caring.

176
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:30,920
I feel like a lot of people

177
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,080
have been encouraged by Duoduo,

178
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,720
encouraged,

179
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,680
and also emotionally

180
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,760
comforted and supported.

181
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,800
Actually, this kind of thing is really important.

182
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,760
Very important.

183
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,560
You need some support for your confidence.

184
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,680
Really, it's very necessary.

185
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,200
Actually, I think

186
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,480
I have a different perspective from him.

187
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,160
Later, I discussed it with him too.

188
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,200
I think interacting with each person

189
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,240
isn't really about

190
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,560
choosing or being chosen.

191
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,080
Because everyone

192
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,680
is both choosing and being chosen.

193
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,480
I understand.

194
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,520
Why is he dressed like he's on Hainan Island again?

195
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,240
Making a dazzling entrance.

196
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,240
A dazzling entrance.

197
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,480
At the time, I thought

198
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,600
maybe just having a meal in the park,

199
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,400
taking a walk,

200
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,400
and chatting.

201
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,800
When I heard him describe it in words,

202
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,520
in my mind,

203
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,440
the scene was already there.

204
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,200
You two chatting is really fun.

205
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,320
Very interesting.

206
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,080
Very interesting.

207
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,760
I'm really looking forward to it.

208
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,240
It's super far, I'm telling you.

209
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,040
Really far.

210
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,800
That was way off.

211
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,120
Like a hundred thousand miles away.

212
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,080
Did he hit it in one shot?

213
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,240
No.

214
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,960
Doesn't it seem a bit hard?

215
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,800
It's really hard.

216
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,080
It feels so far.

217
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,680
This is quite a surprise.

218
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,320
And then you realize,

219
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,440
I still can't hit it even this close.

220
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,680
Straightforward girl

221
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,280
What is it?

222
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,080
This line is really well written.

223
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,320
Your reaction now

224
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,600
is exactly the same as back then.

225
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,320
Single seat

226
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,160
He's a chef.

227
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,000
He serves you directly.

228
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,560
He cuts the food right in front of you.

229
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,560
So stylish, Zihan.

230
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,240
I didn't really believe it at first.

231
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,360
I just didn't believe it.

232
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,760
He planned all of this himself.

233
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,240
Now I realize after watching.

234
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,920
He checked everything himself.

235
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,160
On-site inspection

236
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,280
He designed it himself.

237
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,960
He put a lot of thought into it.

238
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,080
Honestly, I really wanted to go in and do it myself.

239
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:22,960
I really wanted to at the time.

240
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,600
You wanted to try it out.

241
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,640
Yeah, I wanted to do it myself.

242
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,680
I could tell.

243
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,840
I was eager to try.

244
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,440
I wanted to go in right away.

245
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,000
How is it?

246
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,760
Watching this made me hungry.

247
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:58,800
It's pretty good.

248
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,200
Yeah, that looks great.

249
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,280
This looks really delicious.

250
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,160
Definitely.

251
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,400
We ate a lot that night.

252
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:09,800
Really a lot.

253
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,920
The food was great.

254
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,640
He's good at giving emotional value.

255
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,000
Really.

256
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,560
He really prepared a lot.

257
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,160
Everything was connected.

258
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,000
I noticed everyone is

259
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,200
someone with a strong sense of ritual.

260
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,120
So do you all have a sense of ritual?

261
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,320
In daily life?

262
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,360
Ruilong

263
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,240
Sense of ritual

264
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,600
It's okay.

265
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,120
I just do whatever comes to mind.

266
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,480
Like eating three chocolates for breakfast.

267
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,320
That's a kind of ritual too.

268
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,800
Yeah, that's a ritual too.

269
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,320
What about Jiao?

270
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,240
I do.

271
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,480
Like the 24 solar terms.

272
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,480
Yeah, for example,

273
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,400
if it's the Double Ninth Festival,

274
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,680
I'll take my friends hiking.

275
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,360
I think that's pretty nice.

276
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,320
This really surprised me.

277
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,160
This is awesome.

278
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,760
So many.

279
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,200
This way you can keep making wishes.

280
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,040
This is great.

281
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,920
I think this is really awesome.

282
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,760
Lots of plans.

283
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,080
Yeah, so many.

284
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,920
Everything is truly connected.

285
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,680
Every part is great.

286
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,200
How did you feel at that moment?

287
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,280
I was really surprised.

288
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,120
I didn't expect it at first.

289
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,440
There would be so many parts to it.

290
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,360
I thought it would just be

291
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,120
a simple chat.

292
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:01,360
Because we

293
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,840
during our second date,

294
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,880
didn't have a great conversation.

295
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,160
It was pretty stressful.

296
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:07,760
So when he

297
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,960
asked me out again,

298
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,040
I was a bit hesitant.

299
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,520
I didn't know how to handle it.

300
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,720
But that night,

301
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,560
his activity was really relaxed.

302
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,600
And he didn't mention

303
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,840
anything about our last date

304
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,680
or what happened then.

305
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,640
I thought that was pretty nice.

306
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,800
It was really fun.

307
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,840
That's just like our Zihan.

308
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,280
And I saw that he

309
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,120
prepared so much.

310
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,240
He learned a lot too.

311
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,360
He really learned a lot.

312
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,040
What did you learn?

313
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,600
So romantic.

314
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,360
I learned something too.

315
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,480
Do you guys have something like

316
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,000
the 10,000 days

317
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,400
or a special milestone

318
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,000
where you celebrate with friends?

319
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:44,640
Actually, I think

320
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,640
you can create something like that in life.

321
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,720
Like the 10,000 days.

322
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,440
This is the first time I've heard of it.

323
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:49,920
Really?

324
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,280
But I think it's pretty nice.

325
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,880
Ruolong, do you have something similar?

326
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:53,800
I definitely would

327
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,520
do something special.

328
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,120
Or celebrate with friends.

329
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,600
I think most of the time I just

330
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,560
do whatever I feel like.

331
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,680
I don't have to wait for

332
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,160
a particular day.

333
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,440
Actually, I'm just like you.

334
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,600
Me too.

335
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,840
If I want to do something,

336
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,240
I'll just do it right away.

337
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,840
So if you want to celebrate your birthday,

338
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,680
just celebrate it right away.

339
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,520
If you want a birthday, just have it.

340
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,480
Let's watch the next story.

341
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,880
Yeah, let's keep watching.

342
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:31,680
Really.

343
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,840
We kept thinking at the time

344
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,720
it was already so late for you.

345
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,360
No way.

346
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,560
I feel like tonight

347
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,280
so many things happened.

348
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,240
We were in the living area at that time,

349
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,240
and when I heard Duoduo crying,

350
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,960
The seat I was sitting in

351
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,440
Yes

352
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,640
I don't want to hear it

353
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,480
It's fine, it's fine

354
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,000
Just be confident

355
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,080
You guys really

356
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,760
are pretty great

357
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,800
Actually, you probably also

358
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,200
spent a long time preparing yourself mentally.

359
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,920
When you wrote letters to everyone,

360
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,240
you also thought a lot about it.

361
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,120
Yes, that's right.

362
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:31,960
I want to ask,

363
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,160
if you were given

364
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,760
another chance to choose,

365
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,240
would you still come to the house?

366
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,040
Definitely.

367
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,600
Because coming to the house,

368
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,480
I think meeting everyone

369
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,960
was really joyful.

370
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,720
It was a unique

371
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,800
experience.

372
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,160
And I feel

373
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,800
I've grown a lot too.

374
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,280
Inside the house.

375
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,040
Yes.

376
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,000
I think each of us

377
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,600
has had some personal growth,

378
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,480
self-reflection,

379
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,720
our own happiness,

380
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,960
and our own sadness.

381
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,320
But we all agree

382
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,880
we don't regret coming to the house.

383
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,720
Because every choice you make

384
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,200
is made in the moment,

385
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,320
based on how you felt then.

386
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,560
It's a decision you made,

387
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:06,600
an action you took.

388
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,480
So,

389
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,480
there's nothing to regret.

390
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,800
Everything happens for the best.

391
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,040
Yes, after leaving the house,

392
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,520
we still hang out together.

393
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,520
I think we still have a great time.

394
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,360
Yeah, yeah.

395
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,240
So,

396
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,440
our lives are more than just the house.

397
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,640
It will be even more exciting than the house.

398
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,600
Jiao-ge,

399
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,520
what are you doing?

400
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,960
Making soup.

401
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,160
I spoke too soon.

402
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,440
I asked and answered myself.

403
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,760
Yuxing is so funny.

404
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,680
Looking left and right.

405
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,520
Can I just leave?

406
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,560
You're hilarious, Xiaoyuan.

407
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,040
I know that meme.

408
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,560
Chenge

409
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,640
So early?

410
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,520
So early?

411
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,360
How was it?

412
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,240
Go have fun.

413
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,880
Chenge just says it so calmly.

414
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,960
Calmly does the biggest things.

415
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,080
The most dramatic things.

416
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,160
Yes.

417
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,840
And there were fireworks.

418
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,040
I got goosebumps at that moment.

419
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,320
Watching from below.

420
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,560
I was so curious then.

421
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,880
We can only see it now.

422
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,320
How they filmed the lights.

423
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,640
Yeah, now we know.

424
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,600
It's like we guessed it.

425
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,240
Duoduo

426
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,720
Those days were really

427
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,560
an emotional rollercoaster.

428
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,960
Yeah, that's right.

429
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,080
She's really amazing.

430
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,160
So thoughtful, taking care of everyone.

431
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,000
Yeah, Jue really likes this plush toy.

432
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,880
It's really cute.

433
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,960
Now, right at my home entrance,

434
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,240
it's placed there.

435
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,760
Gave it to you right away.

436
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,280
Duoduo is so nice.

437
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,800
How could that be?

438
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,920
How could Xiaoyuan say something like that?

439
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,040
I think in my daily life,

440
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,480
what I see more often is

441
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,040
there's usually one really good person

442
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,200
who treats everyone especially well.

443
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,240
But in the house,

444
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,160
it's more like

445
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,720
a group of wonderful people.

446
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,080
I give you a hundred, you give me a thousand.

447
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,080
Then I give you ten thousand in return.

448
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,000
Everyone together,

449
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,280
sharing countless moments there.

450
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,880
Each person is

451
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,280
sincere and passionate.

452
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,800
Everyone is so lively.

453
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,160
It's my first time

454
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,480
seeing myself from a third-person perspective

455
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,800
and observing my own state.

456
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,880
Then there are many

457
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,080
emotions I didn't notice at the time,

458
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,480
and things others did.

459
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,400
I think

460
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:43,920
it's a

461
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,960
way to rediscover myself

462
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,600
and get to know everyone

463
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,520
in a new way.

464
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,560
Back then, I was just

465
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,160
hearing

466
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:52,920
all of you

467
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,560
sharing your stories with me.

468
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,440
But seeing it again

469
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,160
feels completely different.

470
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:57,680
It's really

471
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,480
like an interview.

472
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,480
After you left,

473
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,240
seeing our reactions,

474
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,560
I didn't expect it.

475
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,440
I didn't even know

476
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,720
how to describe it.

477
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,120
So if we

478
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,440
look back at our past selves,

479
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,760
I want to ask everyone,

480
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,520
would you make the same choice?

481
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,320
At the time, I definitely thought about

482
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,680
saying goodbye in person.

483
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,160
I also didn't know

484
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,520
what was good or bad,

485
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,080
or which was more suitable.

486
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,120
Because I knew Ruilong

487
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:30,560
writes Chinese characters a bit slowly,

488
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,760
so that card

489
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,200
I wrote it all night.

490
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,000
The whole night.

491
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,280
I wrote until nine in the morning.

492
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,240
Reading it was truly touching.

493
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,520
I think as people grow older,

494
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,720
it's harder to encounter

495
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,000
things that really move your heart.

496
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,160
Whether it's love or friendship,

497
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:48,760
so I feel

498
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,720
in this house,

499
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,520
I'm lucky to be here

500
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,120
and meet such wonderful people.

501
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,560
I feel the same as you.

502
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,080
Seeing everyone so happy,

503
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,120
seeing everyone moved to tears,

504
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,640
it's all so sincere.

505
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,920
Yes, that's right.

506
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,640
Let's ask Jiao to help us out.

507
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,040
Bring our capsule toy machine

508
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,360
to the center.

509
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,360
It's time to hand out some gifts.

510
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,960
We can write down

511
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,160
some blessings for each other

512
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:12,960
and put them into

513
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,960
the lucky capsule machine.

514
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,080
Give you a little cake

515
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,120
that makes you even happier when you eat it.

516
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,720
Let's go eat together.

517
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,640
Give you a

518
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,880
ticket for a spontaneous trip.

519
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:25,720
Alright.

520
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,560
Let's take a photo together

521
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,240
to capture

522
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,720
this wonderful moment.

523
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,880
Watching Heart Signal with You.

524
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,600
Heart Signal never ends.

525
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,960
See you next time.

526
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,800
Bye-bye.
