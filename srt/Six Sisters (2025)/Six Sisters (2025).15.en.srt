Don't punish yourself

for someone else's mistake.

17
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,490
Zhang Qiulin is blind.

18
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,980
You should live a better life

19
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:48,930
and be more successful.

20
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,380
Why do you avoid him?

21
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,490
When you look back in a few years,

22
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,900
this will just be nothing.

23
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,740
You can't ruin your future

24
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,410
for this little thing.

25
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,410
Without him, I wouldn't be
a college student!

26
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:03,540
So what?

27
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,540
Now, you can move on.

28
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,540
Go your own way

29
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,690
and live your own life.

30
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,170
You have to get through it

31
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,890
instead of turning back.

32
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,220
Don't be a deserter.

33
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,660
I can't get through it.

34
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,540
If you can't,

35
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,570
I will accompany you.

36
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,940
Nothing is impossible.

37
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,780
You know what?

38
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:33,820
In my eyes,

39
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,220
you're far better

40
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,880
than his girlfriend.

41
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,290
What's the point?

42
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,380
He doesn't like me.

43
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,260
He doesn't love me.

44
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,410
Whatever.

45
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,540
We don't want him.

46
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:47,410
I love you.

47
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,130
Mom loves you. So does Grandma.

48
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,730
We all love you and care for you.

49
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,420
In the future,

50
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,940
you can move away
if you get a flat from work.

51
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,980
You won't see that man anymore.

52
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,220
This is a big city.

53
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,570
You can live anywhere else.

54
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:03,570
Right?

55
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,940
I've been there.

56
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,130
I totally understand your feelings.

57
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,820
But love isn't the whole of life.

58
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,940
You have your family.

59
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,820
You have friends.

60
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:21,540
In the future,

61
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,890
you will be in love.

62
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,820
Now, you must get strong.

63
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,130
You need to work

64
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,100
and have your own career.

65
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,730
These things won't betray you.

66
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,130
Nor will we.

67
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:37,530
Jiali.

68
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,220
It's ok.

69
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,380
It's not a problem.

70
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:59,340
You told her what to do. She'll decide.

71
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,340
Jiahuan has always been stubborn.

72
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,940
I think she listened.

73
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,570
She just lost her mind.

74
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,340
Ask her to come back.

75
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,940
Jobs in our city are better.

76
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,980
That's for sure.

77
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,170
I guess there are

78
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,140
some other reasons.

79
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,980
Young guys are shortsighted

80
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,140
and thoughtless.

81
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,580
Things are fine now.

82
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,370
Jianguo is contacting local companies.

83
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,170
Let's see which one will hire her.

84
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,900
That's great.

85
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,100
In her hometown,

86
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,100
she has us to rely on.

87
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,020
If she works in another city,

88
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,580
I'm afraid she'll be bullied.

89
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,610
Your fourth granddaughter
has a bandit's temper.

90
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,340
Nobody dares to bully her.

91
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,140
I'm the big bandit.

92
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:53,980
She's the little one.

93
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,020
Don't say that.

94
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,020
I'll be the old one, then.

95
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,380
Mr. Zhang,

96
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,410
our company has just started.

97
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,490
We don't have our own building.

98
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,540
During the early days,

99
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,900
the conditions are tough.

100
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,930
So now, we stay
at the district finance bureau.

101
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,220
But it won't affect

102
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,610
our normal business.

103
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,930
This isn't a problem.

104
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,340
But we need to make a difference.

105
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,020
Our top priority

106
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,730
is to hold deposits

107
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:40,780
and make loans.

108
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,170
Go back and make a detailed plan.

109
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,060
Ok.

110
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,620
Then...

111
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,340
Can I apply for a dorm?

112
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,720
But you don't live far away, do you?

113
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,540
My daily commute takes some time.

114
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,050
During the early days,

115
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,730
I may need to work overtime.

116
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:01,650
I see.

117
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,700
Fine. I'll do my best to get you a dorm.

118
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,380
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

119
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:09,490
It's enough.

120
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,380
Have some more.

121
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,140
Jiawen and Jiayi can't come today.

122
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,220
I'll represent them.

123
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,540
Let's raise our glasses.

124
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,380
Cheers.

125
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,020
Jiahuan finally gets a job.

126
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,490
Jiahuan, congrats.

127
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,020
- Thanks.
- A toast to you, Jiahuan.

128
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,450
Thanks.

129
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,620
Jiahuan,

130
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,170
you've finally got a job.

131
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,730
Why do you look depressed?

132
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,730
Your job is really perfect.

133
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,930
Jiahuan, work hard.

134
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,930
Your job is promising.

135
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,490
You're the only
college student in our family.

136
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,730
I'll do a good job
and bring glory to our family.

137
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,340
That's more like it.

138
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:05,140
I've applied for a dorm.

139
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,170
I'll move out when it's available.

140
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,410
Is our house toxic?

141
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,020
Mom, don't say that.

142
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,540
The work thing, you know.

143
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,290
This company has just started.

144
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,580
I often need to work overtime.

145
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,540
Living here won't
interfere with your work.

146
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,900
Jiahuan, don't move out rashly.

147
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:32,900
If she moves out, so will I.

148
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,340
Don't follow her lead.

149
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,610
Fine. You can all leave.

150
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,930
You think you're tough now, huh?

151
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:42,930
You all want to leave.

152
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,170
Dislike Grandma and me, huh?

153
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:48,220
That's not what she means.

154
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:49,940
Jiahuan,

155
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,340
we'll talk about it later.

156
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,410
Now, you stay at home.

157
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:03,570
What does he do?

158
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,930
He works at Machine Tool Plant.

159
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,540
A worker?

160
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,850
A middle manager, actually.

161
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,900
If only she could marry a doctor.

162
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:17,460
That's true.

163
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:18,730
But this young man.

164
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,540
Look. He's handsome, right?

165
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,900
He's a nice guy, too.

166
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,980
You know what? Honesty matters most.

167
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,460
Am I right, Grandma He?

168
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,540
Mom, do you think Jiahuan will like him?

169
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,700
Are we being too impatient?

170
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,010
Jiahuan

171
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,300
has just started to work.

172
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,220
She's already 21.

173
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,300
How about we show her the photo?

174
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:47,370
Take a closer look.

175
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,650
Look at this guy.

176
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,250
From Machine Tool Plant.

177
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,340
He's a middle manager.

178
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,340
He looks handsome, too.

179
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,730
You look like a good match.

180
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,370
Do you have feelings?

181
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:01,570
No need.

182
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:03,730
What do you mean?

183
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:04,820
I don't need anyone.

184
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,940
He Jiahuan,

185
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,130
don't be so ungrateful.

186
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,730
You have to get married.

187
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,130
Who said that?

188
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,180
I'll stay at home,

189
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,980
living with you and Grandma forever.

190
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:18,060
Can we accompany you forever?

191
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,460
Impossible.

192
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,370
I'll then live with the chickens.

193
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:24,460
Chickens?

194
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,220
He Jiahuan, why are you so stubborn?

195
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,010
Isn't he a great choice?

(May Day Shopping Mall)

197
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,980
See you.

198
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:41,970
Thanks.

199
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,460
Hello. May I help you?

200
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,820
(Yan Hongyu)
One Longyan tiger-oil tonic wine.

(Tiger-oil Tonic Wine)

202
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,420
Thanks.

203
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,260
You're welcome.

204
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,220
How did you get in here?

205
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,580
Get out of here.

206
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:07,570
Come on.

207
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,010
Would you like something else?

208
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,060
A bag of Huaijian MSG.

209
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,250
A tin of Yiyi milk powder.

210
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,100
A can of Shanghai Qianghua malted milk.

211
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,820
Two bags of Yunlong pork floss
and pork jerky each.

212
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,300
A bottle of ground sesame oil.

213
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,820
So many things?

214
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,610
Five bottles of Tianbing lychee soda.

215
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,650
Here are three bottles.

216
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,100
Five bottles in all.

217
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,220
One Huainan Special Spirit.

218
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,210
Don't move.

219
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:50,700
What are you doing?

220
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,820
Trying to hold your chair.

221
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,250
I believe

222
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,420
you're up to something.

223
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,370
Why do you always
want to break the rules?

224
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,490
Did someone send you
to discredit my master?

225
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,220
You know what? When I'm here,

226
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,490
- no one can do that.
- No...

227
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,370
No what?

228
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,610
What are you guys doing?

229
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,820
Master.

230
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:21,850
I didn't let him in.

231
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,220
He broke in.

232
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,540
Mom.

233
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,490
What are you doing here?

234
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,220
Your aunt gave you a list again, huh?

235
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,460
Master, who is he?

236
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,100
My son.

237
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,010
He's Yan Hongyu,
working at No. 2 Car Factory.

238
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,340
Hongyu, this is my apprentice,

239
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:42,820
He Jiaxi.

240
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,610
Mom, she's fun.

241
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,730
To stop me from coming in,

242
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,010
she nearly fought me.

243
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,130
I didn't know who you were.

244
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,340
Jiaxi did the right thing.

245
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,460
Without permission,

246
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,320
no one can get in here.

247
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,220
Even if you're my son.

248
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,460
Get out of here. Go.

249
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:02,490
Jiaxi.

250
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,460
Here. Get him the things on the list.

251
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,090
All right.

252
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,460
Jiaxi,

253
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,420
pack them, please.

254
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:18,850
Is she really your mother?

255
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,610
Of course.

256
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,010
But you don't look alike.

(No. 28 Yanhuai Road)

258

259
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,820
Jiahuan.

260
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,370
- Jiahuan.
- Why are you back?

261
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,610
Aren't you rushing to work?

262
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,540
Hi, Qiulin.

263
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,210
- Morning.
- Morning.

264
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:08,580
Thank you everybody

265
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,890
for coming to my new home.

266
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,130
The dish is coming.

267
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,420
- Jiawen, you're so lucky.
- Weiguo.

268
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,490
Thank you, Weiguo.

269
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:19,420
You're welcome.

Weiguo's pork ribs soup

271
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:21,820
tastes super great.

272
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:22,820
Of course.

273
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,850
He has been cooking since he was little.

274
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:25,980
I also cooked.

275
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,610
I even cooked for Jiaxi.

276
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,420
I didn't eat anything you made.

277
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,270
You did.

278
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,130
When?

279
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,650
- In childhood.
- Get the bowls.

280
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,490
Enjoy the food.

281
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,650
- Thanks.
- Not at all.

282
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:35,700
You had a long day.

283
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,260
Jiawen.

284
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,220
Your new flat

285
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:40,700
is really suitable.

286
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,820
Thanks to Weiguo.

287
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,490
The living room is too small, though.

288
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,610
It's enough for a family of three.

289
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,420
Right. That's the disadvantage

290
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,460
of the old flat.

291
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,420
Small living room.

292
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,010
No space for too many people.

293
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,300
When we chose the flat,

294
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,060
I told Ouyang something.

295
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,820
The bedrooms can be small.

296
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,370
The living room has to be big.

297
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,180
Having a big ceiling lamp

298
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,100
will be artistic.

299
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,300
Yeah.

300
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,610
But you haven't invited us there

301
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:08,580
to enjoy it.

302
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,460
I don't have a reason for that.

303
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,610
When you have a boyfriend,
take him to my flat.

304
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,420
I'll prepare a big dinner
to make you proud.

305
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,460
Let's eat.

306
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,420
A toast to you, Jiawen.

307
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,530
To your new home.

308
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,250
- Be happy.
- Thanks.

309
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:44,340
I have work to do. I should go.

310
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:45,450
Don't go.

311
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,700
Jiahuan, you just...

312
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,100
- I'll walk you out.
- Why?

313
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:50,210
Jiahuan.

314
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:52,450
Go back to lunch.

315
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:53,330
Ok.

316
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,300
What's wrong?

317
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:55,570
Jiahuan...

318
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,700
Was she provoked?

319
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,460
Shut up and eat.

320
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,420
How could you be so sarcastic?

321
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,300
What's wrong?

322

324
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,820
should try to get Jiahuan a husband.

325
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,610
How do you know we haven't tried?

326
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,370
I think

327
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,580
Ouyang's brother is good.

328

He works at Water Conservancy Bureau.

329
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:17,700
Generous.

331
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:20,820
Which brother?

focus on the really important thing.

335

What's wrong with his face?

336
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,850
Don't judge a man by his appearance.

My husband has acne scars, too.

338
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,420

- So am I.
- Not until Jiahuan is back.

379
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:17,700
Business or private affairs?

380
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:19,330
Business.

381
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,090
I just asked by the way.

382
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,570
If there is, we'll solve it.

383
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:23,410
No misunderstanding.

384
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,770
In some old cases,

385
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,620
I was being thoughtless. I apologize.

386
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,660
You were never thoughtless.

387
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,010
- Are we still friends?
- No.

388
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,070
Jiahuan,

389
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,010
actually these years...

390
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,380
What exactly are you here for?

391
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,060
The loan.

392
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,620
Then, let's only talk about that.

393
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,860
I'll get married.

394
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:06,660
You have my blessing.

395
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,410
You can't go.

396
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,180
What do you mean?

397
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,180
You're going nowhere, huh?

398
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,220
Ok.

399
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,140
Oh, Jiali.

400
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,010
You won't really stop me, huh?

401
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,250
My company approved.

402
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,380
This is a big event.

403
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,530
I'll win glory.

404
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,180
I represent the Breakdance Club

405
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,530
of Huainan Youth Center.

406
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,770
You're too old for the Youth Center.

407
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,570
I don't care. I must go.

408
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:45,940
You insist, huh?

409
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,300
Fine.

410
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,680
I have one condition.

411
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:50,890
What is it?

412
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,180
Jiahuan will go with you.

413
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,330
Why?

414
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,380
You're a rash girl.

415
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,420
We worry about you.

416
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,380
Does she not work?

417
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,380
She's on a vacation.

418
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,010
Two choices.

419
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,700
First, you can't go.

420
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,490
Second, Jiahuan will go with you.

421
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:06,330
Second.

422
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:08,940
She'll pay by herself.

423
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:11,730
I'll pay.

424
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:14,940
Jiali.

425
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,420
End of discussion.

426
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,330
You're biased.

427
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,380
I don't dance.

428
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,460
I'm not interested in her breakdance.

429
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,810
Guangzhou is an important city.

430
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,860
Isn't it great to travel there?

431
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,700
I won't go.

432
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,460
I'm doing this for your own good.

433
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,180
Thank you, but no thank you.

434
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,700
Zhang Qiulin

435
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,380
will get married next week.

436
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:41,770
We're all invited.

437
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:42,770
Will you go?

438
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:45,860
I'll go to Guangzhou.

439
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:51,980
A pair of tens.

440
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,700
A pair of kings.

441
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,700
Zhenmin.

442
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,620
Why are you called Turbo?

443
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,770
I got him this stage name.
How does it sound?

444
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,250
Not good.

445
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,140
Then why is she Kelly?

446
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:08,770
She got herself that stage name.

447
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:09,770
Sounds bad, right?

448
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,980
It's the name
of the heroine in Breakin'.

449
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,010
Your turn.

450
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,460
How can you be a heroine

451
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,770
with this plain face?

452
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,460
Can I not be a heroine, Jiahuan?

453
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,810
You can.

454
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,260
(Guangzhou Station)

455
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,620
(Guangzhou)

456
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,660
Why can't I share a room with you?

457
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,290
Jiahuan is here.

458
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,700
So what?

459
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,460
Go back to your room.

460
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,490
Jiahuan will be back.

461
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,250
I don't want to go back.

462
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,490
Why can't we share a room?

463
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,250
My sister is here.

464
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,620
How can I share your room?

465
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,810
She's here, so what?

466
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,900
You tell me.

467
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,330
What if she tells Jiali?

468
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,730
I don't know why she came here.

469
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:15,660
She's upset.

470
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,660
She wants some fresh air.

471
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,050
But she's always upset.

472
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,290
Do you know she has a crush on Qiulin?

473
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,140
Don't be ridiculous.

474
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,900
It's true. My brother told me.

475
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,140
Go back to your room. She'll be back.

476
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:31,250
One more kiss.

477
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,380
Can you go now? Come on.

478
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,460
I'm less willing to go.

479
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,770
Just go.

480
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,290
Hey, let's talk.

481
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:41,900
I'll go back, then.

482
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,740
Hey.

483
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,050
Get up early tomorrow.

484
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,740
Liu Xiaoling,

485
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,460
are you in a relationship?

486
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:35,660
No.

487
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,330
Tell me the truth.

488
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:38,660
I won't tell anyone else.

489
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,500
No, really.

490
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,330
What about Tang Zhenmin?

491
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:44,530
What are you talking about?

492
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,860
Go to bed now.

493
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,660
Our families have had a feud
for generations.

494
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,250
Even Jiali failed.

495
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,860
How dare you challenge?

496
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,290
We're really not together.

497
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:55,890
Fine.

498
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,330
Let's talk to Mom and Jiali.

499
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,460
He Jiahuan, are you insane?

500
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:01,660
I'll go make a call.

501
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:04,290
Hey, Jiahuan. Come back.

502
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,700
Will you really tell them?

503
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:09,220
I'll confess, ok?

504
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:12,380
Tang Zhenmin

505
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,250
has feelings for me.

506
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,290
But I don't like him.

507
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,420
Whether you like him or not,

508
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,250
you have to stop now.

509
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,530
Why?

510
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:22,660
Our families...

511
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,700
Don't bring up the enemy thing.

512
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:25,700
It's the new century.

513
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,940
We're no longer enemies.

514
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,090
And why would that

515
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:29,460
impede this generation?

516
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,860
I know what you mean.

517
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:34,730
You don't want me to marry before you.

518
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:37,930
Right.

519
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,730
That's what I mean.

520
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,810
What if you never get married?

521
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,290
Do I have to be a nun?

522
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,810
I just don't understand.

523
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:05,250
What does Jiahuan really want?

524
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,860
That's easy.

525
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:09,460
Think about her profession.

526
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,140
Jiahuan?

527
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:13,250
She's an accountant.

528
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,660
That's right.

529
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,810
What do you mean?

530
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,250
What does an accountant care most for?

531
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:21,370
Money?

532
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,010
When we're all married,

533
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:25,700
Jiahuan will stay alone.

534
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,860
This house

535
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,380
and everything in it,

536
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,220
including some deposits,

537
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,660
will be hers.

538
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:35,140
We don't have a brother.

539
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:37,250
The last one to get married will win.

540
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:42,050
But she can't refuse to get married

541
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,810
just for this little money.

542
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:46,330
This is just a possibility.

543
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,860
Besides, Jiahuan is fierce.

544
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,730
What kind of man dares to marry her?

545
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,140
If you were a man, would you?

546
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:56,610
No.

547
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,700
That's right.

548
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,820
Liu Xiaoling.

549
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,300
Liu Xiaoling!

550
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:41,940
What's up?

551
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,700
Who gave this to you?

552
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,540
That's my business.

553
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:49,700
Tang Zhenmin, huh?

554
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,290
Are you insane?

555
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:59,090
Mom, Jiahuan is insane!

556
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:00,900
- Look at her.
- Stop fighting!

557
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:02,290
Stop it!

558
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,900
Leave here if you want.

559
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,530
You owe me a rose!

560
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,730
Stop shouting.

561
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,900
What happened again?

562
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:22,660
Meixin,

563
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,250
what's wrong with you?

564
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,220
Mom,

565
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:28,010
Mrs. Tang passed away.

566
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,490
Life is so boring.

567
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:40,380
How could she die so unexpectedly?

568
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:56,410
Mom,

569
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:57,650
come have dinner.

570
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,090
Get up slowly.

571
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,300
Where's she?

572
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:05,660
Who?

573
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:06,980
Where's Jiahuan?

574
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:10,010
She went to work early this morning.

575
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:12,940
What about Xiaoling and Jiaxi?

576
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,740
Are you confused?

577
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,770
Xiaoling said she wouldn't
come back for dinner.

578
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,330
Jiaxi hasn't come back yet.

579
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:24,900
She'll eat alone, I think.

580
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,940
I'm even too old to chew up the meat.

581
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,570
I took a bite.

582
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,260
It's ok.

583
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:53,980
You eat more.

584
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,220
How come

585
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:05,770
time passes so slowly now?

586
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:23,140
(Early 1990)

587
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:26,010
Mom, sit there. Don't get up.

588
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,980
Grandma. Mom.

589
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:29,050
Weiguo, Jiawen.

590
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,220
Such a smell of chicken poop.

591
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,010
Mom, when will you
stop raising chickens?

592
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,570
We've been eating chicken for years.

593
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,050
Why are there still live chickens?

594
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,620
Because they have chicks.

595
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,810
You don't like them now?

596
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:46,090
When you were little,

597
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:48,490
you even fought for the eggs

598
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:50,420
from the chicken. Don't you remember?

599
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,090
Ms. Liao.

600
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,900
Get me a chair.

601
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:56,930
Ok.

602
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,620
And wash the crabs.

603
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,740
Yes.

604
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,730
Jiayi,

605
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:10,090
don't order her about.

606
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,860
I pay her, Grandma.

607
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:16,570
She's a working lady, anyway.

608
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:18,250
Talk nicely to her.

609
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:21,050
Jiayi, according to Marxism,

610
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:23,420
capitalists get rich by exploiting

611
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,940
the surplus value of working people.

612
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,860
Weiguo,

613
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:28,660
I'm a working lady,

614
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,700
not a capitalist.

615
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:31,380
I never exploit Ms. Liao, either.

616
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,420
- Just kidding.
- I think Jiayi

617
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,180
has the soul of a capitalist.

618
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,900
Don't say that.

619
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,860
Who knows if the policy will change?

620
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,180
And who knows what may happen?

621
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,980
We just make a living.

622
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,140
Ouyang told me

623
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,050
your business was good

624
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:47,220
and you started a company.

625
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,770
Come to me if you want a loan.

626
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,620
He's just self-employed,

627
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:54,010
doing small businesses

628
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:55,420
for a little bit of money.

629
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,220
Where's Jiali?

630
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,820
And Jianguo?

631
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,290
Jianguo has something to do.

632
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:04,620
He'll come later.

633
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,090
Grandma, times have changed.

634
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:12,050
Eating crab is also an art.

635
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,250
It ends up

636
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,980
what it used to be.

637
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:16,860
- Here.
- Come on, Jiayi.

638
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:19,050
Don't bother to teach Grandma.

639
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,290
When she ate crabs,

640
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:22,420
you weren't even born.

641
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,460
Sounds as if you witnessed that.

642
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,730
It must be Ouyang.

643
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,860
I'll go call him back.

644
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,860
Mom, you need a phone here.

645
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,700
How inconvenient.

646
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,530
Only a few of us live here.

647
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:38,330
What do we need a phone for?

648
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,050
I'll ask Ouyang to buy one for you.

649
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:42,460
Sorry, I'm late.

650
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,460
- Jianguo.
- Jianguo.

651
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,900
What took you so long?

652
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,000
Some business.

653
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:48,490
Early this morning,

654
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,050
he went to the Telephone Bureau,

655
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,050
registered, lined up, and paid.

656
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:54,940
A phone will be installed here.

657
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,420
Then, we can contact more easily.

658
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,460
Jianguo is so thoughtful.

659
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,460
The installation fee is high.

660
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,860
Not really. 5,500 yuan.

661
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,700
Five...

662
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,460
So expensive.

663
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:05,490
That's too expensive.

664
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,290
It's ok. A phone makes it convenient.

665
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,660
Don't splash out like that.

666
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,460
You pay for installing a phone

667
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,660
and we'll pay when making a call.

668
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,180
But you don't need to go out.

669
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,860
Don't worry. I'll pay.

670
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,380
I'll go make a call.

671
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,220
Ok.

672
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:21,700
- Cheers, Jianguo.
- Cheers.

673
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:22,730
Thank you, Jianguo.

674
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,570
Jiahuan,

675
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:32,010
Mom wants you to have a good life

676
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,290
and get a good husband.

677
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,460
He'll care for you

678
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,620
and spend his life with you.

679
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,140
What do you think?

680
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:41,330
What's your plan?

681
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:42,530
What kind of man do you want?

682
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:43,420
Tell us.

683
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,860
We'll notice.

684
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:46,850
No need.

685
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:48,860
Will you live alone like this?

686
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,250
You don't want us to set you up.

687
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,140
You can't be so unreasonable,

688
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:53,980
Jiahuan.

689
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:56,050
I planned to stay in Bengbu.

690
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:57,530
You made me come back.

691
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,290
Maybe I would have a husband

692
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:02,330
if I had worked there.

693
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:03,980
Come on.

694
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,380
You think you could get one there?

695
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:06,770
Jiahuan will get a husband.

696
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:08,900
It will just take some time.

697
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,620
It's about destiny, anyway.

698
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,420
Even so, she...

699
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,530
Come on.

700
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,900
Stop worrying about me.

701
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,980
I won't be in love in a short time.

702
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:22,730
You should worry
about someone who is in love.

703
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:24,420
Don't be so sarcastic.

704
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:25,570
Right.

705
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:27,570
I'm the worst in the love case.

706
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:30,940
All my sisters do better than me.

707
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,940
Even my younger sister Xiaoling

708
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,380
has a boyfriend before me.

709
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,290
We're talking about you.

710
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:38,140
Don't get Xiaoling involved.

711
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:40,570
I know nobody loves me.

712
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,900
But under no circumstance

713
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:44,530
will I let my younger sister

714
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:45,730
get married before me.

715
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:48,290
I'm older than her.

716
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:50,490
Why can she get married before me?

717
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,620
Jiahuan, let's solve your problem first.

718
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:56,770
Do you not want Xiaoling
to have a boyfriend

719
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:58,290
or do you not want her to get married?

720
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,380
She can't get married.

721
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:09,740
Xiaoling has a boyfriend.

722
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,340
You can't be unaware, can you?

723
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:12,370
Who's her boyfriend?

724
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,610
Our enemy, Tang Zhenmin.

725
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,900
Tang...

726
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,130
Do you know?

727
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,530
Did you see with your eyes?

728
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,460
They've been hitting
on each other for years.

729
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,690
Have you not noticed anything?

730
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:29,900
Xiaoling will lose herself
sooner or later.

731
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,130
If she ends up like Jiayi,

732
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,780
our family will be in chaos.

733
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,210
Don't say anything like that.

734
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,820
Did you hear?

735
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:38,930
Oh.

736
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:46,900
Are you really with Tang Zhenmin?

737
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,610
Jiahuan told you, huh?

738
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:54,530
She's a traitor.

739
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:55,570
I'll go see her.

740
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,340
Jiahuan has nothing to do with this.

741
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,180
It's your problem.

742
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,420
She supports you to have a boyfriend.

743
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,530
We all support you.

744
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:06,370
Really?

745
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,170
Glad you aren't too silly.

746
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:09,340
But...

747
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:11,340
I knew you would say that.

748
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,570
You can't be with Tang Zhenmin.

749
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,010
Why?

750
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,740
Whose opinion, yours or Jiahuan's?

751
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,740
It's my opinion.

752
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,090
Your grandma agrees.

753
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:21,530
So does your dead father.

754
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:23,300
The whole family disapproves.

755
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,140
Is that enough?

756
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,530
Don't deny that you're naive.

757
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,980
You and Tang Zhenmin.

758
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:31,680
Our families have
had a feud for generations.

759
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,900
What are the benefits

760
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,130
of loving him?

761
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:36,300
Is there any hope?

762
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,340
But you went to his mother's funeral.

763
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,380
That's different.

764
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,300
There's no family feud in this century.

765
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:44,530
Xiaoling, we worry about you.

766
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:46,300
We don't want you to have a hard time.

767
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:48,010
What are the benefits

768
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:49,420
of marrying your enemy?

769
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:50,530
Isn't that perfect?

770
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,530
I can marry him and make trouble

771
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:53,530
to avenge our family.

772
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,740
Liu Xiaoling.

773
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,580
Jiali, Mom.

774
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,940
Let me choose my own way, ok?

775
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,980
I'm not silly.

776
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:06,090
No way. You are silly.

777
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:07,530
I'm old enough.

778
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:09,210
I can make my own decisions.

779
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,980
I know who's good and who's bad.

780
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:12,740
What if I learn from Jiayi?

781
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,820
I'll get pregnant

782
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:14,740
before marrying him.

783
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:16,010
You...

784
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,170
You are...

785
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:18,330
Mom. Mom.

786
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:20,050
Hey, Mom.

787
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:22,370
Sit there.

788
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:24,330
If you dare,

789
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,610
we'll expel you.

790
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:26,740
Do you hear?

791
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,740
Just saying.

792
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:34,300
I wouldn't really do that.

793
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,900
I won't follow in Jiayi's path.

794
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,380
She got married with a quilt

795
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,130
instead of any other dowry.

796
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,130
I have to be a straight-up wife.

797
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:45,820
Jiali, don't worry.

798
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:48,340
You failed to marry Tang Weimin.

799
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:49,490
I'll marry his brother.

800
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,900
Liu Xiaoling.

801
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,210
You're such an idiot.

802
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,570
How naive you are.

803
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,380
Do you know many members of his family

804
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,010
have been dead?

805
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:09,130
People die, ok?

806
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:11,380
Isn't that very common?

807
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,740
- We also lost...
- We?

808
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,530
Your father died in an accident.

809
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:17,170
But they died of incurable diseases.

810
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,490
That's good.

811
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:20,780
His parents are gone.

812
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,900
I'll be in charge

813
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,740
and live a free life.

814
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:26,450
You...

815
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:31,130
Xiaoling, Mom is saying

816
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:33,820
they have a gene problem.

817
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,980
If not for your own sake,

818
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,900
for the sake of your children.

819
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,170
It's too risky.

820
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,340
This is a private conversation.

821
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,340
We won't hurt you.

822
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,940
This is the truth.

823
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,300
And think about Tang Zhenmin.

824
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,170
He always fools around

825
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,690
and never works hard.

826
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:53,210
He dances every day.

827
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:55,130
He can't be a good husband.

828
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,530
Dance is an art.

829
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:57,380
You don't understand.

830
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,170
You can't eat dance for dinner.

831
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:04,380
Art isn't the problem.

832
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,740
You can't marry him.

833
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:07,490
You just can't.

834
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,170
You idiot.

835
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,050
I'm your idiot daughter, anyway.

836
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,180
You...

837
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:21,740
Mom!

838
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,210
- What's up?
- Look. Xiaoling left a note,

839
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,610
saying she'd move into her dorm.

840
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:28,380
Call Jiali right now.

841
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,690
We've got a rebellious girl.

842
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,090
What does it say?

843
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,820
"I'll move to my dorm.

844
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,260
Don't come to me.

845
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,530
I need to be alone.

846
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:40,610
Exclamation mark.

847
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,210
By Liu Xiaoling. From today on."

848
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,610
All the girls can leave.

849
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:51,170
We're old enough.

850
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,460
Nothing should bother us.

851
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:56,860
When children grow up,

852
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:57,980
they can't be controlled.

853
00:38:58,490 --> 00:38:59,570
Let her be.

854
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:03,010
Unless she breaks the law.

855
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:06,300
She didn't say
she wouldn't come back home.

856
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,300
(I'll move into my dorm.
Don't come to me.)

857
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,340
Why?

858
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:14,860
Will we always be involved
with the Tang Family?

859
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:17,460
Big Tang and his wife are dead.

860
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,690
Drop this.

861
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:21,210
Actually, I think

862
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:26,010
Tang Zhenmin is more honest
than his second brother.

863
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:28,860
He's a nice guy, really.

864
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,010
Jiahuan, what are you doing?

865
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,490
Go check on her.

866
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:40,490
Jiahuan.

867
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:43,010
Jiahuan.

868
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,260
What are you doing, Jiahuan?

869
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:56,940
What are you doing?

870
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:59,420
Mom, let me go.

871
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:01,890
What are you doing?

872
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:03,650
What's happening here?

873
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,170
Can't you live without a man?

874
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,420
Grandma, she's being ridiculous.

875
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,570
What were you doing?

876
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:10,860
Getting down the wind-bell.

877
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:18,980
What about the suitcase?

878
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:22,820
I plan to move out.

879
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,490
Where are you moving?

880
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:27,090
I rented a flat.

881
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,380
Isn't our house big enough?

882
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,860
You share one single room.

883
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,380
It's not about the space.

884
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,460
Then, what is it about?

885
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:40,490
I...

886
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:43,980
I can't stay here, Mom.

887
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:47,930
I...

888
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,260
I don't fit in here at all.

889
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,820
I'm nothing like anybody.

890
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:54,490
I can hardly breathe here.

891
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:56,420
Can't you let me out for some fresh air?

892
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,090
What did we do to you?

893
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:06,690
What did we do?

894
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:07,940
Stop it.

895
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,460
It's no use hitting her.

896
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:13,690
I'm so pissed off.

897
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,570
It's not that you can't move out.

898
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:21,610
But it may not be safe out there.

899
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:25,300
All right. I won't try to stop you.

900
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,170
You know what?

901
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,380
When you move out,

902
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:29,170
tell Jiali

903
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:30,340
where you live.

904
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:33,090
Come back home in case of trouble.

905
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:37,300
What are you talking about, Mom?

906
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,490
I don't want to talk to you.

907
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:39,610
Come on. Let's go.

908
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:41,010
Let's go and ignore her.

909
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:05,010
Come on.

910
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:06,820
What will be

911
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,010
will be.

912
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:10,010
We can't stop her.

913
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:11,860
Look on the bright side.

914
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,420
Jiaxi won't come back for dinner, huh?

915
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:22,300
Her master would buy her dinner.

916
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,820
So, we'll have dinner alone.

917
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,050
Yes, only the two of us.

918
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,650
In this big house,

919
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,610
only you and I are staying.

920
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:35,300
That's not a problem.

921
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,210
People

922
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:40,130
are born alone and die alone.

923
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:41,610
Always alone.

924
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:43,690
Maybe soon,

925
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:47,340
in this big house,

926
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,010
you'll be all alone.

927
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,050
Mom.
