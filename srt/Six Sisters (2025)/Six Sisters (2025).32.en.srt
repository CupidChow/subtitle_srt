15
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,150
Mom, what are you doing?

16
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,070
Cleaning up for the New Year.

17
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,420
Why do you put away Grandma's things?

18
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,280
Am I not allowed to touch it?

19
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,260
Are you making a museum out of them?

20
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,710
Don't worry.

21
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,840
I'll put everything together for you.

22
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,680
If you want, take it.

23
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,310
What do you mean by that?

24
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,840
I feel bad.

25
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,310
What do I mean?

26
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,750
Since your dad passed away, your grandma
had always been staying with me.

27
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,710
How many years had it been?

28
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,750
It's been decades.

29
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,280
We had our talks.

30
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,520
Now that she's gone,

31
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,680
I'm the only one left.

32
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,280
They always remind me of her.

33
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,240
I want to turn the page sooner.

34
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:50,750
Is that okay?

35
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,750
You all have your own homes now.

36
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,110
I don't expect anything from you.

37
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,150
The Chinese New Year's coming.

38
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,800
Who has asked about me?

39
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,680
Who's looking after me?

40
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,030
Haven't I always been here?

41
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,710
I just came to ask you.

42
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,310
Li Wen's pregnant.

43
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,280
Let's go visit her on New Year's Eve.

44
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,350
No need to run around
between two places.

45
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,470
I'm not going anywhere.

46
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,630
That's not my home.

47
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,470
According to tradition,

48
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,840
Chinese New Year's Eve
should be spent at home.

49
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,960
Who are you upset with?

50
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,710
No one.

51
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,680
I'm upset with myself, okay?

52
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,680
I regret living too long.

53
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,080
Do whatever you want.

54
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,400
I...

55
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,510
Mom, that's not necessary.

56
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,630
What does it matter where we spend it?

57
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,920
Wen and I don't care about this.

58
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,190
Yes, I can walk.

59
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,240
No problem
with going upstairs or downstairs.

60
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,510
She's packed up Grandma's things.

61
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,680
She was a bit hasty.

62
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,830
Grandma just passed away,

63
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,290
Mom can't accept it right away.

64
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,240
I understand.

65
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,560
We should also consider her emotions.

66
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,270
Take the gifts and let's go.

67
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,160
Come on, let's go.

68
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,560
You don't need to take these.
Don't take anything.

69
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,670
Okay.

70
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,910
Mom.

71
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,320
Grandma.

72
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,960
Grandma?

73
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,400
Where is she?

74
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,240
Has she abandoned us?

75
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,360
Honey.

76
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,360
Over here, smooth it out.

77
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,640
Sure.

78
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,200
That corner.

79
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:22,710
Mom.

80
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:23,950
Mom, why are you here?

81
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,790
Where's Jiaxi?

82
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,760
Upstairs.

83
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,960
Hi, Mom.

84
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,870
I just had a bite.

85
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,270
I hurried back at once.

86
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,560
Here, Mom.

87
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,150
Have you eaten?

88
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,890
I'm full with just anger.

89
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,920
There's no need to be angry with Jiali.

90
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,750
That's why Jiali is amazing.

91
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,630
She always acts selflessly
on the outside,

92
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,750
but behind the scenes,
she's doing selfish things.

93
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,480
I have to learn from her.

94
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:03,870
It's not exactly that.

95
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,480
I'm going to talk to her.

96
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,270
No need.

97
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,420
No need to talk to her.

98
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,360
Let us spend our New Year,

99
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,680
and let her spend hers.

100
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,910
Wait...

101
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,760
I...

102
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,720
I'll spend my own New Year.

103
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,660
That's not true, Mom.

104
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,880
I'm here for you.

105
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,680
I am always

106
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,510
on your side.

107
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:30,360
But I feel that in recent years,

108
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,680
if you can rely on Jiali, you should.

109
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,070
She's the only one with time.

110
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,650
Also, didn't she and Jianguo

111
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:37,830
promise to take care of you?

112
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,040
Let her step up.

113
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,000
Make her show it.

114
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,680
No, Jiaxi...

115
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,120
Mom.

116
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,270
- Mom.
- Jiali's here.

117
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,590
Mom.

118
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,400
Mom.

119
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,170
The food is all ready.

120
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,710
Let's celebrate
the New Year at home.

121
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,160
When I went back, you weren't there.

122
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,480
Still angry with me?

123
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,480
I'm not angry.

124
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,360
Well, let's go home then.

125
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:26,950
Right, go home.

126
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,910
Come back on the second day
of the New Year.

127
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,430
Bring Fang Tao along too.

128
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,270
Okay.

129
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,480
Let's go, Mom. Let's go.

130
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,390
Come on.

131
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:37,440
Let's go, let's go.

132
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,280
I'm leaving now.

133
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,230
Okay.

134
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,620
Take care.

135
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,870
- Bye.
- Bye.

136
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,720
I didn't even make chicken soup.

137
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,960
I've prepared it.

138
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,870
How much is it per jin?

139
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,670
This old TV.

140
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,560
I'll take care of it.

141
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,510
- Done.
- Nothing is clear.

142
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,150
My eyes are about to go blind.

143
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,720
It's time to get a new one.

144
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:13,720
Tomorrow, I'll have Xiaonian
go to the department store

145
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,270
and buy a big color TV.

146
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,280
Mom,

147
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,120
I understand how you feel.

148
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,720
Grandma's gone,

149
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,870
and you're left alone.

150
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,270
You're feeling insecure.

151
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,840
But don't worry.

152
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,910
Jianguo and I will take care of you.

153
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,120
I don't need anyone.

154
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,670
As for the others,

155
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,390
Jiawen works every day,

156
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,670
so she can't look after you.

157
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,270
Jiayi and her husband
are running the guesthouse.

158
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,030
Jiahuan is in jail.

159
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,360
Xiaoling is out there.

160
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,870
As for Jiaxi, she's so young.

161
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,550
She'll definitely find something to do.

162
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,480
I'm the only idle one.

163
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,120
So,

164
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,080
it's better for us to stick together.

165
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,150
You don't have time.

166
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,910
You'll have to take care
of your grandkid.

167
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,480
That's still a long way off.

168
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,790
Besides, Xiaonian's mother-in-law

169
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,780
has already told me

170
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,160
that she'll take care of the baby.

171
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,250
I'm giving her the chance.

172
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,870
But speaking of which,

173
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,670
if you think Jianguo and I
are in the way,

174
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,840
we can leave.

175
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,960
Where would you go?

176
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,870
We have a lot of options.

177
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,870
I'm not pushing you out.

178
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,120
Another year has gone by.

179
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,680
Yeah.

180
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,150
Another year.

181
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,270
Everyone's leaving me.

182
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,150
Isn't there a new member coming?

183
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,870
That's someone new in your family.

184
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,750
My family is only going to get smaller.

185
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,440
What do you mean by "your family"?

186
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,960
Aren't we one family?

187
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,870
You're a married daughter now.

188
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,870
So what?

189
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,270
Jianguo's your son-in-law.

190
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,670
He's here to support you.

191
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,110
Isn't that true?

192
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,320
Yes.

193
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,390
Jianguo.

194
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,790
How lucky you are.

195
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,360
It's you who's lucky.

196
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,910
Look, you've had six daughters.

197
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,080
What luck!

198
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,900
(Eight months later)

199
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,340
(Inpatient Department:
straight ahead)

200
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,440
How nice.

201
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,840
She looks like her mom.

202
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,510
Her skin's not like mine.

203
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,090
Her skin

204
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,080
is like your mom's.

205
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,900
- Wen.
- It really is.

206
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,800
Here.

207
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,750
Thank you for this. Take it.

208
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,590
This...

209
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,870
I planned to take care of you

210
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,910
for a few days during your confinement,

211
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,510
but your mother
didn't give me that chance.

212
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,080
It's okay.

213
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,510
I'll make it up to you later.

214
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,380
Though I can't take care of you,

215
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,010
I can offer
some financial help, right?

216
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,940
Well.

217
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:42,750
- No.
- Take it.

218
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,440
Alright, I'll accept it.

219
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,080
- Thanks, Mom.
- You're welcome.

220
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,560
Mom.

221
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,840
Thanks, Xiaonian's mom.

222
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,320
You're welcome.

223
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,120
Has the baby's name been decided?

224
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,670
Your dad thought of a few names.

225
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,720
We decided before the baby was born.

226
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,710
What is it?

227
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,910
- It's...
- He Wenyiyi.

228
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,360
He Wenyiyi.

229
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,320
Four characters?

230
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,260
It combines He and Wen.

231
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,510
It's a good name.

232
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,240
- It sounds nice.
- How romantic.

233
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,480
Yiyi, He Wenyiyi.

234
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,790
You're here.

235
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,630
I'll just rinse it out.

236
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,200
Go on.

237
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,840
Take a look at your new house,
Guangming.

238
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,510
Okay.

239
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,080
Come on.

240
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,440
This way, this way.

241
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,000
Look at that bed,

242
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,440
the desk,

243
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,150
and the big bay window.

244
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,080
Look at the bay window, Guangming.

245
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,240
We even made you a bookshelf,

246
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,790
so you can read anytime.

247
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,600
The lighting in this room is great.

248
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,200
Guangming,

249
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,440
the walls have just been painted.

250
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,080
If you keep putting up these,

251
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,000
they'll eventually leave yellow stains.

252
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,440
Guangming,

253
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,200
stick it behind the door.

254
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,090
I'll stick it for you.

255
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:50,830
Jiali...

256
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,150
After all the suffering,

257
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,550
she's made it.

258
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,000
This light's going to burn out.

259
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,390
The voltage is unstable,

260
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,630
and the wires are aging.

261
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,840
There are still many places leaking.

262
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,030
If you want to live here,

263
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:08,840
it all needs to be fixed.

264
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,920
Jiaxi,

265
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,600
do you really plan to live here forever?

266
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,670
I heard

267
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,600
the bus station is expanding again,

268
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,630
and in the future, this area

269
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,790
will only get noisier.

270
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,240
Listen, it's so noisy.

271
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,000
If I were you,

272
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,440
I'd have moved out already.

273
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,390
Trees die when they're moved.

274
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,390
But humans prosper instead.

275
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,670
Whose red eggs are these?

276
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,240
Jiayi sent them over.

277
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,280
Who in her family gave birth?

278
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,000
Xiaonian's daughter
is celebrating her hundred days.

279
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,320
Then I'll have one.

280
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,470
Go ahead.

281
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,790
Why are they still playing so late?

282
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,870
Did you get the money back
from your friend?

283
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,480
I found him,

284
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,390
but he's struggling too.

285
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,390
I can't just kill him, right?

286
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,670
Then you can kill me.

287
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,280
How can we celebrate the New Year?

288
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,870
Just get by.

289
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,390
My brother found you a job.

290
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,090
An inspection factory
of a Korean company

291
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,420
in the development zone.
You can start after the New Year.

292
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,390
- Really?
- Really.

293
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,390
Maybe in the future,

294
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,320
you'll have to rely on me.

295
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,440
Today, Jiayi came and mentioned

296
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,870
that she wants to buy this house.

297
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:42,750
What does that mean?

298
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,000
Can't you understand Chinese?

299
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,030
I'm saying Jiayi
wants to buy this house.

300
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,160
What?

301
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,120
Mom's house was just sold.

302
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,030
If we also sell our flat,

303
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,200
Mom will be unhappy.

304
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,440
So what?
I'll be unhappy if we don't.

305
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,290
She only cares about her sons
and grandsons.

306
00:16:58,290 --> 00:16:59,510
Has anyone cared about Xiaoman?

307
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,910
Your dad was like a living Buddha,

308
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:03,030
always at home taking care
of your sister's daughter.

309
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,440
Whoever makes offerings to him

310
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,690
simply doesn't matter to him.

311
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,540
Your mom is
like the Princess Iron Fan now,

312
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,830
waving people away with her fan.

313
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,440
She just doesn't want to see us.

314
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,440
The New Year is coming.

315
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,510
Has she ever called us?

316
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,110
If we don't think about ourselves,

317
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,110
who will think about us?

318
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,030
Xiaoman is starting school soon.

319
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,940
Her household registration
has been transferred.

320
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,590
She'll attend HNU Primary School.

321
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,640
So, we need to sell this house,

322
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,720
get some cash in hand,

323
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,400
and buy another proper one.

324
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,310
If we sell our house,
where will we live?

325
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,640
I'm thinking of a way right now.

326
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,440
You don't know this.

327
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,750
Jiali is

328
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,960
so stingy.

329
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,720
I don't know

330
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,550
who she learned this from.

331
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:49,950
The New Year is coming.

332
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,000
She didn't even have sausage
or salted fish.

333
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,400
I think she's not planning to celebrate.

334
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,160
(Public phone)

335
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,000
Also,

336
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,030
she said she was going out to collect
the electricity fee in the morning

337
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,510
but didn't come back until very late.

338
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,240
She probably went to Xiaonian's house.

339
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,310
At home, she doesn't even talk to me,

340
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,720
nothing at all.

341
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,640
She doesn't take me seriously.

342
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,200
Mom, how about you come here
for the New Year?

343
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:13,760
As for Jiali,

344
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,240
I'll talk to her after the New Year.

345
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,830
She can't just occupy the house.

346
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,880
Where are you going

347
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
for the Chinese New Year?

348
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,350
We have to think of the big picture.

349
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,680
Just go to your mother-in-law's place.

350
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,240
Go ahead.

351
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,390
I'm fine.

352
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,550
Don't worry about me.

353
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,750
Alright, it's settled then.

354
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,750
I just saw Mom at the market.

355
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,200
She was on the phone.

356
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,510
Why go outside to make a call

357
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,720
when there's a phone at home?

358
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,240
Maybe there's something

359
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,920
she can't say at home.

360
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,750
Do you think she's seeing someone?

361
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,960
It's common for older people to remarry.

362
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,500
With Grandma gone,
maybe she's come to terms with it.

363
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,390
Mom.

364
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,350
Where did you go?

365
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,040
I didn't go anywhere.

366
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,930
How about dumplings for dinner?

367
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:28,790
Do you need any help?

368
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,840
No need.

369
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,830
Stay. Let's chat.

370
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,240
Do you have something
on your mind lately?

371
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,590
Something on my mind? No, nothing.

372
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,790
I have to say it.

373
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,830
I fully support it.

374
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,110
Don't feel burdened by it.

375
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,750
Support what?

376
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,590
Remarriage for the elderly
is a good thing.

377
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,400
Do you think I'm going to remarry?

378
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,880
Who told you I'm going to remarry?

379
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,320
No.

380
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,830
I just said it casually.

381
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:12,670
Mom,

382
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,920
I saw you making a call at the market.

383
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,790
There's a phone at home.

384
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,960
Why go to the market to make a call?

385
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,110
He Jiali, you're really strange.

386
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,750
I can make a call

387
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,790
anywhere I want.

388
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,440
What does that have to do
with remarriage?

389
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,000
Alright, forget I said anything.

390
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,840
I know you.

391
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,310
You've been harboring this for years.

392
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,510
- What?
- You want me to find someone

393
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,750
and get married

394
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,550
so you can take over this house, right?

395
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,200
When did I want to take over the house?

396
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,160
Listen.

397
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,000
As long as I'm alive,

398
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,750
I'll stay here.

399
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,000
Even if I die, I'll die here.

400
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,350
Remarriage? What are you thinking?

401
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,350
What's wrong?

402
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,750
What's going on?

403
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,920
I just mentioned
remarriage for the elderly,

404
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,790
and she got upset,

405
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,000
saying I wanted to take over her house.

406
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,350
You really didn't need to ask.

407
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,640
Being nice is truly hard.

408
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,200
I'm sincere,

409
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,830
but she thinks I'm scheming.

410
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,160
Maybe it's a misunderstanding.

411
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,160
What misunderstanding?

412
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,030
She's said it.

413
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,160
What's left to misunderstand?

414
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,750
If we talk about it legally,
this house belongs to all of us.

415
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,160
No one can take it.

416
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,510
We're family. Why talk about law?

417
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,360
Fine.

418
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,700
If we talk about feelings,
we're staying here temporarily.

419
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,720
No problem, right?

420
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,160
I never thought about taking over,

421
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,750
but no one can just drive me away.

422
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,350
We've given so much to this family.

423
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,610
Even if there's no credit,
there's at least hard work.

424
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,840
Now it's all forgotten.

425
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,030
Stop nagging.

426
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,240
Do you think I'm deaf?

427
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,550
I heard everything.

428
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,310
Let's not bring up the past anymore.

429
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,160
When we helped, we never thought
about getting anything in return.

430
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,440
What return would I want?

431
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,510
I've worked so hard for all these years.

432
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,550
What did I get?

433
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,440
Now, it turns into me
wanting to take the house.

434
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,550
When you help someone,

435
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,510
don't always keep reminding them.

436
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,750
It makes others uncomfortable,

437
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,440
and it could turn into animosity.

438
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,950
The Chinese New Year is coming.

439
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,350
Don't be mad at Mom.

440
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,310
Go say a few nice words,

441
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,440
and this will all blow over.

442
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,280
I won't say it.

443
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,310
I beg you.

444
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,960
Just say a few words, come on.

445
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,460
You always try to smooth things over.

446
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,150
Mom,

447
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,110
for dinner, should I put

448
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,400
one piece of ginger or two
in the chicken soup?

449
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,960
I'll put one, then.

450
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,510
Put two.

451
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,440
Add some Sichuan peppercorns.

452
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,680
After living half a lifetime,

453
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,400
you still can't figure out
how many pieces of ginger to put in.

454
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,110
Is it good?

455
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,510
If it's good, eat more.

456
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,680
Your mom loves this too.

457
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,000
Don't worry, Dad.

458
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,070
Mom will definitely come back.

459
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,480
She won't be like the Monkey King.

460
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,880
What's the Monkey King
got to do with it?

461
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,550
The Monkey King
made a ruckus in Heaven

462
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,540
and was trapped for 500 years
under the mountain.

463
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,550
It won't happen to my mom.

464
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,480
Of course.

465
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,960
500 years?

466
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,310
When would that be?

467
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,030
I don't know
how your mom's doing inside.

468
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,310
- Hello?
- Fang Tao.

469
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,160
Lawyer Wang.

470
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,110
I have good news.

471
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,830
Jiahuan is coming back.

472
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,680
- When?
- After the New Year.

473
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,680
Since Jiahuan's superior passed away,

474
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:58,950
the lead had gone cold.

475
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,080
They'd been re-investigating.

476
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,960
Now it's all cleared up.

477
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:02,920
Jiahuan is innocent.

478
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,350
Great, great.

479
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,670
Dad.

480
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,080
Dad.

481
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,560
Son.

482
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,750
The lawyer called.

483
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,000
He said your mom

484
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,680
will be back after the New Year.

485
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:40,950
Really?

486
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,760
Really.

487
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,170
Sir, give me a serving.

488
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:09,150
How about side dishes?

489
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,880
Vermicelli, tofu skin,
and soybean cakes.

490
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,320
Okay.

491
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,640
- Add some chili.
- Sure.

492
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,240
Take your time.

493
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,680
Why are these beef slices so small?

494
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,550
It's all scraps.

495
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,350
Well, it's the end of the year,

496
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,790
so only the soup base is left.

497
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,110
Scraps are inevitable.

498
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,200
Sorry about that, ma'am.

499
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,520
It seems

500
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:47,070
that Mom can't stay with us anymore.

501
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,480
It's not as serious as that.

502
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,350
It's the New Year,

503
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,550
and the only elderly person left is her.

504
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,920
She must feel lonely.

505
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:00,160
She's having trouble
adjusting emotionally.

506
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,480
It's understandable.

507
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,070
You've studied military strategy

508
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,720
for so long.

509
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,310
She can't adjust?

510
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,880
She's adjusting too quickly.

511
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,150
What does that mean?

512
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,720
Don't you understand?

513
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,720
What a fool.

514
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,680
She doesn't want to live
with us anymore.

515
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,720
She might as well just say it.

516
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:29,720
Well,

517
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,350
let's eat first.

518
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,830
Jiali, Jianguo.

519
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,520
Xiaoling.

520
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:27,510
I thought I saw it wrong.

521
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,030
Why are you back alone?

522
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,920
Where are the kid and Huang?

523
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,160
Mom, wait until I finish eating.

524
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,350
Why didn't you tell us you'd come back?

525
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,610
I came back to celebrate the New Year.

526
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:46,680
Huang and your daughter
didn't come back with you?

527
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,160
I'll call Huang.

528
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,310
Jiali, don't call.

529
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:04,720
To put it simply, it's over,

530
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,680
so I left.

531
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,310
The kid is with him.

532
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,550
I can't take care of her by myself.

533
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:14,920
How irresponsible.

534
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,740
Back then, you brought Huang back

535
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,680
out of the blue,

536
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,270
and now you suddenly got a divorce.

537
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:22,160
You should've given us some warning.

538
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,310
I didn't want this to happen,

539
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,680
but it was unavoidable.

540
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,110
When it's over, it's over.

541
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:29,240
Isn't life just unpredictable?

542
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,810
You still have the nerve to talk?

543
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,240
Look at what you've done to Mom.

544
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:36,350
Jiali, I'm the victim here.

545
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:38,030
You brought this on yourself.

546
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,960
Stop blaming me.

547
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,440
The ticket was really hard to get.

548
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,270
I had to stand all the way back.

549
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,160
My legs are almost broken.

550
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,720
What's your next plan then?

551
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,830
You can't have a home alone.

552
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,440
That's why I came back.

553
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,550
I'll stay here for a while and see.

554
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,880
You're too old to stay at home.

555
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,830
What about your job?

556
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,260
How can you support yourself?

557
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,960
I still have a house, don't I?

558
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,270
Let me rest for a bit, okay?

559
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,880
I have hands and feet.

560
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,110
I won't starve.

561
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,550
Your hands are cold.

562
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,510
This place is a bit messy.

563
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,950
I haven't had time to clean up yet.

564
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,750
The previous tenant just moved out.

565
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:49,720
If you want to rent it,

566
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,070
it can still be rented out.

567
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,680
I'll have to rent it out.

568
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,160
It's how I make a living.

569
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,720
Won't you take Yangyang with you?

570
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,590
He hardly saw me.

571
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,160
Would he want to live with me?

572
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,070
It's true for now.

573
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,640
Weimin, Qiufang,

574
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,480
and Ms. Liu took him to Shanghai,

575
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,880
saying they had a relative
who was getting engaged.

576
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,510
If I want Yangyang to live with me,

577
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,480
I need to make some achievements.

578
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,070
If you had that kind of ambition,

579
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,480
even stones could bloom.

580
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,080
Alright.

581
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,480
He's your son. You're inseparable.

582
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,110
It's not the same.

583
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,480
Mom.

584
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,880
Mom?

585
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,480
You're here.

586
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,070
What's going on, Mom?

587
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:49,180
It's the second day of the New Year.
Who upset you?

588
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:50,060
Is it Jiali?

589
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,930
Is she cutting corners on food again?

590
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:52,960
No, no.

591
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,480
They went out to buy breakfast.

592
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,440
Jiaxi.

593
00:30:59,030 --> 00:30:59,870
Xiaoling.

594
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,510
Why are you back?

595
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,880
Why can't I come back?

596
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:04,960
- Mom.
- What did you buy?

597
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,800
Let me see.

598
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,590
Mom.

599
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,550
What's going on, Mom?

600
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,350
Wait, why is Liu Xiaoling back?

601
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,790
She won't settle down here, will she?

602
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,160
Mom, Jiayi's booked my house.

603
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:28,860
Even if I delay it,
it won't be past summer.

604
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,590
Once Xiaoman starts school
in the summer,

605
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,200
I'll have to move back.

606
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,110
Jiali hasn't left, and Xiaoling's back.

607
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,350
Xiaoling is single now.

608
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:43,350
If she's moving back, I can't stop her.

609
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,750
Doesn't she have a house?

610
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,440
She rented it out.

611
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,400
She's relying on the rent.

612
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,350
But she can't take over this house.

613
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,030
Whoever lives here needs to support you.

614
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,160
Can Xiaoling do that?

615
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,960
If she can, I can't let that happen.

616
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,640
In Xiaoling's whole life,

617
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,550
how many things has she done right?

618
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,590
She can't take care of me.

619
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,270
No way, Xiaoling has to leave.

620
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,400
Don't force it, Jiaxi.

621
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,100
You know me too well, Jiali.

622
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,540
I'm just craving that beef soup.

623
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,550
Did you brush your teeth?

624
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:15,390
I did.

625
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,440
Mom, it's time to eat.

626
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,240
Jiali, Liu Xiaoling.

627
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,550
Liu Xiaoling returns with honor.

628
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,720
Jiali, stop embarrassing me.

629
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,920
I'm just out of options,

630
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,860
returning in my old age.

631
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,240
Have you had breakfast?

632
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,110
Eat something. There's plenty.

633
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,840
I'm full.

634
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,350
This one is spicy. Try this one.

635
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,030
Okay, take care on the road.

636
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,190
Close the door.

637
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,790
- Xiaoling.
- Jiaxi, bye.

638
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:51,960
You're leaving too?

639
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,400
- I'll walk you out.
- No.

640
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:54,710
Hongyu,

641
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,750
take Xiaoman back.

642
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:56,920
I need to talk to Xiaoling.

643
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,510
Goodbye, Auntie.

644
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,110
- Goodbye, Xiaoman.
- See you.

645
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,500
- Go home with your dad.
- Goodbye.

646
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,240
- Take care.
- Close the door.

647
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,800
Let's go in.

648
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,080
It's cold outside.

649
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,960
Let's just sit here.

650
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:10,830
It's been a long time since we met.

651
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:12,030
Let's say a few honest words.

652
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,750
What's going on?

653
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:17,000
You're being all mysterious.

654
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,240
Xiaoling,

655
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,510
you haven't changed at all
after all these years.

656
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,550
You're still the same.

657
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:26,750
You don't consider others' feelings
before you act.

658
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,230
How haven't I considered
others' feelings?

659
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,280
Xiaoling,

660
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,590
look at you now.

661
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,690
Look at your situation.

662
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:38,110
You came home suddenly

663
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,590
without any warning.

664
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,350
I didn't have a choice.

665
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,550
How can Mom stand this?

666
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,390
Do you know how many times

667
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,640
Mom's taken Suxiao Jiuxin Pill?

668
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,310
With you around,

669
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,350
it's like you've set off a time bomb
above her head.

670
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,200
Did Mom tell you this,

671
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,120
or did you figure it out yourself?

672
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,960
Mom was too embarrassed to say it,

673
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,790
but I couldn't hold it in anymore.

674
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:04,750
Well, I need a place to stay too.

675
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,310
I've gotten a divorce.

676
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,400
I'm like an unmarried girl again.

677
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,750
A girl staying at her parents' house
is perfectly natural.

678
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,700
Besides,

679
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:12,960
Jiali's family is living here,

680
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,520
and they're all getting along just fine.

681
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,600
Isn't that good?

682
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,720
Xiaoling,

683
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,320
Jiali is taking care of Mom.

684
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,360
Jianguo is
the designated son-in-law for that.

685
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,640
Do you have that?

686
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,710
Can you do that?

687
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,710
How much money do you have now?

688
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,400
If you live here,
how about your expenses?

689
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,110
How much can you pay
for utilities each month?

690
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,630
How can you shamelessly stay here?

691
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,550
Fine, I won't mention that.

692
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,480
If you live here,

693
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:48,190
seeing Yangyang every day,

694
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,150
he's going to see you

695
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,150
living in a mess.

696
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,360
Will he want to live with you later?

697
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,000
You've wronged Yangyang
for so many years.

698
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,230
Shouldn't you make up for it?

699
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:05,030
Don't you need
to repair that relationship?

700
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,840
If I were you,

701
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:10,550
I would make something of myself
before coming back.

702
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,590
At the very least, I'd have a job.

703
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,710
I'd want my child to be proud of me.

704
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,630
I haven't even started yet.

705
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,110
Just wait for me to start.

706
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,000
Alright, Xiaoling.

707
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,760
Don't argue with me.

708
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,960
This may sound harsh,

709
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,360
but it's for your own good.

710
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,920
You need to think about long-term.

711
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,550
Are you saying

712
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:40,000
that before I find a job,

713
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,960
Yangyang shouldn't know I'm back

714
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,400
or see me?

715
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,510
Xiaoling, you've got it.

716
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,190
I have to leave now.

717
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,070
It's a bit cold.

718
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,760
You'd better go inside.

719
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:58,950
I'm leaving.

720
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,630
Here, take your medicine.

721
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,360
It's a bit hot.

722
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,230
We both need

723
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,670
to be mentally prepared.

724
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:32,000
Xiaoling's back.

725
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,800
She's his real mom.

726
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,800
Yangyang will eventually go back to her.

727
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,030
Have you told him?

728
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:41,800
What does Yangyang think?

729
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,630
I haven't told him yet.

730
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,320
I was thinking

731
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,800
I'd tell him after the Lantern Festival.

732
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:52,880
I'm afraid if he has any thoughts,

733
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,550
he might run off again.

734
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,610
It won't come to that.

735
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,440
The child is grown up now.

736
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:00,580
He knows what's going on.

737
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,840
Yangyang

738
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,960
has been with us for so long.

739
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,190
I really treat him

740
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,030
like our own child.

741
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:09,840
If he leaves,

742
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:12,150
I'll be really reluctant.

743
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,230
I'm reluctant too.

744
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,230
This child is kind

745
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:19,670
and filial.

746
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,400
Don't worry.

747
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:23,670
I'll always be his uncle,

748
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:26,840
and you'll always be his aunt.

749
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,360
By the way,

750
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:40,920
go book a room
at Guyuan International Hotel tomorrow.

751
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:46,590
Our daughter should be on the plane now.

752
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,400
We'll be able to see her soon.

753
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,720
Yes.

754
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,240
That's great.

755
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,060
(Jinmanlou Hotel)

756
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,110
Weimin, we've eaten enough.

757
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:05,990
Give us a speech.

758
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,920
Alright, let me summarize.

759
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,760
Good.

760
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,320
I'm glad my dear daughter

761
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,190
has finally found her Mr. Right.

762
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:19,110
I hope this beautiful start

763
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,510
leads to a happy future.

764
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,030
- Well said.
- Good.

765
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,720
Come on.

766
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:26,960
- Mom.
- Qiufang.

767
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,320
Come on, dear.

768
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,630
Let's drink then.

769
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,480
Cheers.

770
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,510
How's that? Satisfied?

771
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,350
Yes.

772
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,710
I'm satisfied if Xiaofang is.

773
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,400
But Mark needs to treat Xiaofang well.

774
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,800
That's right.

775
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,000
He's been good to me.

776
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,840
Come on.

777
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,360
Try this.

778
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:51,840
This is tofu from our Bagong Mountain.

779
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,920
This is

780
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,510
the hometown of tofu.

781
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,240
- You eat.
- Tofu.

782
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,800
Good, good.

783
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,190
Mark.

784
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:04,110
You can't just say it's good.

785
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,030
You have to say thank you
to your grandma.

786
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,120
I'm your Grandma.

787
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:11,190
Thank you, Grandma.

788
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,110
Eat, eat.

789
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:13,960
Good, good.

790
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,400
Can you two understand each other?

791
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,760
Of course.

792
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,960
They just showed you.

793
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,670
They communicate in both languages.

794
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,400
Both Chinese and English are okay,
right, Xiaofang?

795
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,190
Yes, Mark's Chinese

796
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,110
is pretty good.

797
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:28,960
How exotic.

798
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:37,110
I want to grow old with Elsa.

799
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:39,800
What did he say?

800
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:41,280
Grow old together.

801
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,000
- Good.
- Mom, Dad.

802
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,320
Bottom up.

803
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,110
Wait, wait.

804
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,480
You can't

805
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,150
call us that for now.

806
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:51,110
- Right.
- Translate this.

807
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,400
This is how you drink with sincerity.

808
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,840
You have to drink it from a pot.

809
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,150
How could I let you

810
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,760
take my daughter away so easily?

811
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,110
I get it.

812
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:02,110
My sincerity is all in this wine.

813
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,480
I will always love Xiaofang.

814
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,590
How's that? Is it good?

815
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:07,950
Yes.

816
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,440
Cheers.

817
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:12,370
- Here.
- He knows that.

818
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,800
I'll drink it.

819
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:16,110
Drink slowly.

820
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:17,860
I'm fine.

821
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:18,990
Just a little sip will do.

822
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:20,620
- Why so serious?
- Mark's finished it.

823
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,480
You can't lose face.

824
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,760
Of course, I have to drink it.

825
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,880
Can't lose face.

826
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,230
Qiufang, he's happy today.

827
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:25,870
Let him drink.

828
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:27,110
- I'll drink.
- It's too much.

829
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:27,680
Finish it.

830
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,720
- Slow down.
- It's fine.

831
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:29,960
Slow down, slow down.

832
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,720
Slow down.

833
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:42,580
Drink some water.

834
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:44,110
I told you not to drink.

835
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:46,000
- Let's take a family photo.
- Yes.

836
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,710
Come on. Let's take a family photo.

837
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:48,710
Qiufang, sit here.

838
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,190
- Come on.
- Stand here.

839
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,030
Come on, sit here.

840
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,920
Don't blink, everyone.

841
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,800
Three, two, one.

842
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,710
Cheese!

843
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:04,320
Thank you, Mark.

844
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,590
How about this?

845
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,110
I'll take a photo for you, okay?

846
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:07,960
Sit here.

847
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,280
Press this button. Yes, here.

848
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,710
- Sure.
- Is it okay?

849
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,470
How about this?

850
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,710
The kids take the photo first.

851
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:16,810
- Look at the camera.
- My grandson and granddaughter.

852
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:46,660
(Enduring Memory)

853
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:34,590
Yangyang,

854
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:37,110
how about living with me?

855
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:44,400
I'm already looking for a job.

856
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,320
There will be an income soon.

857
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:49,320
If you stay with me,
you'll live a good life.

858
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,360
Let's talk about it then.

859
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,480
