00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,740
So, how was your last trip to England?

16
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,770
Did you enjoy it?

17
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,020
Yeah, enjoy a lot and it was so much fun.

18
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:53,930
It's great.

19
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:54,770
Ok.

20
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,020
Welcome to China.

21
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,050
Thank you so much.

22
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:58,890
Welcome to China.

23
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,100
It's been an honor. Thank you.

24
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,260
Ok. Bye-bye.

25
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,250
Bye-bye.

26
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,340
Hello, sir.

27
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,260
I'm He Jiahuan.

28
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,100
This time...

29
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,780
May I help you?

30
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,690
I'm terrible at speaking English.

31
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,540
This is Ms. He.

32
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,340
And she is head of the Trust Company.

33
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,820
Welcome to invest in the development zone.

34
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,260
- I know.
- Thank you, sir.

35
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,340
Nice to meet you.

36
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,290
Nice to meet you.

37
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,100
I'm glad you're here today.

38
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,730
A friend invited me over.

39
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:46,940
I wasn't going to come.

40
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,290
But I ended up coming.

41
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,820
It turns out I came here to meet you.

42
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,850
Our interpreter took the day off.

43
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,410
I thought I could handle it.

44
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,660
But I could only listen, not talk.

45
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,060
You're a rare talent.

46
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,130
That's all I've learned abroad.

47
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,850
You look different today.

48
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,100
Really?

49
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,940
I did you a big favor today.

50
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,660
You should buy me dinner someday.

51
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,900
Sure.

52
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,130
Deal.

53
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:22,850
I have to go.

54
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,780
Ok.

55
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:24,730
Bye.

56
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,060
Take care.

57
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,380
Sir, where are you going?

58
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,340
Longhu Market.

59
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,500
- Bye.
- See you.

60
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,380
Fang Tao!

61
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,420
Fang Tao!

62
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,570
Stop, Fang Tao!

63
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,940
Follow them, sir!

64
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,290
Stop.

65
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,260
It's not your call.

66
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,220
You can get off anytime you want.

67
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,730
How can I? How?

68
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:09,940
Jump off?

69
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,100
Where are you driving me?

70
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,460
Sir, hurry up. Thanks.

71
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,020
- Ok.
- Please follow them.

72
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,220
Fang Tao!

73
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,660
I said stop. You hear me?

74
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,980
Why are you acting like a child?

75
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,620
Stop the car!

76
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,050
Red light! Red light!

77
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,700
Tell me what's your relationship with her.

78
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,850
We went to elementary school

79
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,410
and middle school together.

80
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,900
We're best friends.

81
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,370
Get out.

82
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,050
I've heard all about your story.

83
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,540
Touching and tragic.

84
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:41,810
We're both men.

85
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,340
Let's get this straight today.

86
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,020
Do you still have feelings for her?

87
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,660
We're best friends.

88
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,220
I won't take advantage of you.

89
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:01,690
Pick it up.

90
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,740
Pick it up!

91
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,090
Come on.

92
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,140
How many times have you eaten alone

93
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,220
like today?

94
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,140
Misunderstanding.

95
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,380
Misunderstanding?

96
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,850
I'm telling you, Fang Tao,

97
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,410
you're insulting yourself

98
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,050
as well as Jiahuan!

99
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:45,170
Is seducing a married woman an insult?

100
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,020
I'll teach you a lesson today.

101
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,580
Stay away from her from now on.

102
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,420
Do you hear me?

103
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,650
Do you hear me?

104
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,250
- Fang Tao!
- Do you remember?

105
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,700
Stay away from her!

106
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,610
Get up!

107
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,460
Do you remember?

108
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,300
Get up.

109
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,300
Are you ok?

110
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:08,980
I didn't

111
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,900
have an interpreter today,

112
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,700
so Qiulin came to help me out.

113
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,020
What's wrong with you?

114
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,210
Let's go.

115
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,330
Jiahuan,

116
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,650
come back.

117
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,410
Jiahuan, ride in my car.

118
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:29,790
Go.

119
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,520
He Jiahuan!

120
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:04,990
I've signed my name.

121
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,360
It depends on your attitude.

122
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,810
Dad, when will mom be back?

123
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,490
Son, why are you still up?

124
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,140
Mom will spank you when she's back.

125
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:17,660
She'll spank you first.

126
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,460
The big bad wolf will bite your butt.

127
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,730
Go to bed. Turn off the light.

128
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,180
Hello, paging 5257, please.

129
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,570
Come home now.

130
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,490
Eight times in a row.

131
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:09,730
What took you so long?

132
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,850
Our son has been asking about you.

133
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,060
Why are you packing?

134
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,250
Where are you going so late?

135
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,490
Jiahuan,

136
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,490
can't we

137
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,940
talk this over?

138
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,250
Tell me where you're going

139
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,650
and who you're staying with.

140
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,420
Let's take some time apart

141
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:41,530

Shall we heat it?

173
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,250
No.

174
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,010
There are only a few customers.

175
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,890
Those old men always complain.

176
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,100

186

00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,060
I've been thinking about it too.

193
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,260
(Fortune comes from eight directions)

194
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,860
(Li Wen)

195
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,100
Hello, beautiful.

196
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,530
- Hello.
- Take a look around.

197
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,300
- Ok.
- We've got all the latest styles here.

198
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,180
Ok, let me see.

199
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,020
Ok.

200
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,420
Can I try this on?

201
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,820
Of course. The fitting room is over there.

202
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,660
Ok.

203
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,870
- Here.
- Let me help you.

204
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:47,450
Auntie.

205
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,210
You're not eating?

206
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,130
How is it? Does it fit?

207
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,770
Ma'am, do you have a bigger size

208
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,100
for this dress?

209
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,610
Yes, wait a minute.

210
00:13:58,610 --> 00:13:59,730
I'll try another size up.

211
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:00,570
Ok.

212
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,490
Here, here is a size up.

213
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:08,340
Thanks.

214
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,540
How about this one?

215
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,940
I think it's a good fit.

216
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:25,060
- You look great in it!
- Really?

217
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,850
It's perfect for you.

218
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,770
One size up is right.

219
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,580
- It looks good.
- Yeah? Just right.

220
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,420
Li Wen?

221
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,340
He Xiangdong?

222
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,130
You know a lot of things.

223
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,370
Is that why

224
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,370
you like to hang out with me?

225
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,820
No.

226
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,460
I think there's something

227
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,530
free and rebellious about you.

228
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,180
Come on.

229
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,340
Because I was an underachiever in school?

230
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,100
Music doesn't have underachievers.

231
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:29,610
Here.

232
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,250
- To the underachiever.
- To the underachiever.

233
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,650
Jiawen, you're off work early today.

234
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,540
Jiawen?

235
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:13,850
Qiulin.

236
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,850
Are you here for dinner?

237
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,550
With some friends.

238
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,300
Well, go ahead.

239
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,540
I have something to do.

240
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,650
I'm leaving.

241
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:24,970
Bye.

242
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,820
Bye.

243
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,890
Excuse me,

244
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,490
is she an employee of the restaurant?

245
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,130
She's a temporary dishwasher.

246
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,160
Thanks.

247
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,180
I ran into her by chance

248
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,890
and asked around.

249
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,300
The pharmaceutical plant

250
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:51,700
is having layoffs

251
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:52,730
and rotations.

252
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,730
So I'm guessing

253
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,490
Jiawen is in trouble.

254
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,580
But don't worry.

255
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,130
I've called my friends

256
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,010
at the Medical Bureau

257
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,730
and asked for their help.

258
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,340
She has to keep her job at least.

259
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,700
Jiawen is having a hard time.

260
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:08,530
This job is important to her.

261
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,090
I wouldn't have known if you hadn't come.

262
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,220
Thank you.

263
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,090
We are neighbors.

264
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,090
Now that I know it,

265
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:19,220
I won't just sit back and do nothing.

266
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:22,530
I know. I owe you one.

267
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,240
What?

268
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,620
Do you live at the office now?

269
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:33,660
I work overtime a lot.

270
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,090
When it's too late, I'll stay here.

271
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,020
Pay attention to your health.

Qiu,

273
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:48,770
is Director He here?

274
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:50,730
I think she's out with her friend.

275
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,050
Jiawen is coming over

276
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,220
to thank you in person.

277
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,860
It's no big deal.

278
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,490
I didn't realize you were well-connected.

279
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:06,090
I have some friends and schoolmates.

280
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,940
If you need help in the future,

281
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,900
feel free to tell me.

282
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,730
Excuse me!

283
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,130
What's happening?

284
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,500
I'll take care of it.

285
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,330
Drive.

286
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,700
(Available)

287
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,290
Don't make a fool of yourself, ok?

288
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,460
You were caught in the act.

289
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,860
Who is the fool?

290
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,900
Jiawen was laid off today.

291
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,730
Qiuling pulled strings

292
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,490
and kept her job.

293
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,490
Shouldn't I buy him dinner

294
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,490
and thank him?

295
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,900
If he did Jiawen a favor,

296
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,980
she should buy him dinner.

297
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,660
Why are you eating with him alone?

298
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,570
Forget it. I can't reason with you.

299
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,180
It's not the first time. Pull over.

300
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,900
He Jiahuan, I know you look down on me.

301
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,860
You both have advanced degrees.

302
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,380
You're well educated. I'm just a driver.

303
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:16,330
At home, you boss our son around,

304
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:17,900
trying to control everything.

305
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:21,090
That's fine. I give in.

306
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,090
Because I love my life.

307
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,090
But I can't accept

308
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,490
my wife cheating on me!

309
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,730
Fang Tao, stop the car!

310
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:31,700
Do you hear me?

311
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:32,930
Stop!

312

313
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,020
Are you hurt?

314
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,170
Any bumps?

315
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:47,610
Jiahuan!

316
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,430
Jiahuan!

317
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,540
Where are you going?

318
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,050
Starting today,

319
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:56,980
you go your broad road,

320
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,980
and I'll take my narrow path.

321
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:00,930

Have you thought this through?

325
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,180
It's stamped already.

326
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:20,980
Fine.

327
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,090
I'll pack my things

328
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,500
and move out.

329
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,900
I'll move out,

330
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,860
or where could you go?

331
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,900
Listen to me one more time, ok?

332
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,900
My brother has a few empty rooms.

333
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:35,850
I can live there.

334
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,860
What will you tell your brother?

335
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:42,700
The truth.

336
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:44,130
No.

337
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,900
My mom and grandma can't handle it.

338
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,700
Let's wait and see.

339
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:03,930
This is yours.

340
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,290

345
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,380
hasn't called yet.

346
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,900
It's a good thing, though.

347
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:56,330
She's probably doing well.

348
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:57,410
Don't worry.

349
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,460
She won't let herself suffer.

350
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,460
She can fool around at home,

but not outside.

354
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,740
Sure.

00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:16,660
He's in the hospital.

359
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,420
What's he got that's so bad?

360
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,090
The genetic disease.

361
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,090

362

I need your help.

366
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:35,290
What is it?

367
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,940
It's about Jiawen.

We have to hurry,

371
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,740
otherwise

372
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,090
it'll get harder to find her a husband.

373
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:51,380
You should ask her what she wants,

374
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,730
in case she doesn't want it.

375
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,570
She won't admit it,

376
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,460
but she's probably

377
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,570
got it in her mind.

378
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,980
What are you looking for?

379
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,900
Nothing too specific,

380
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,050
just someone financially stable.

00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,620
Age doesn't matter.

382
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,460
A widower or a divorced man is fine.

383
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:12,700
I can't think of anyone suitable

384
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,980
right now.

385
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:31,770
Why didn't you tell me

386
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,490
you got divorced?

387
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:36,900
Maybe I'm being presumptuous,

388
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,700
but if I'm in any way responsible,

389
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,250
I will take accountability.

390
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,860
I'm done.

391
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:48,650
Jiahuan.

392
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:52,660
What are you doing?

393
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:54,140
You know how I feel about you,

394
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,290
and I know how you feel about me.

395
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,490
Now, for whatever reason,

396
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,380
you've been liberated.

397
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,490
You're free.

398
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,490
I have every right to chase you openly.

399
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:04,980
Don't make things worse, ok?

400
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,540
Have you eaten?

401
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,090
Yes, I ate out.

402
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:27,660
Dad, Mom,

403
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,700
I have something to tell you.

404
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,130
What is it?

405
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,940
This Mid-Autumn Festival,

406
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,330
I'm going to grant you a wish.

407
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,140
What wish?

408
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,330
I'll bring someone home.

409
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,290
The girl who went to your aunt's store?

410
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:47,610
Are you dating?

411
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,900
We fell in love at first sight.

412
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:51,660
Don't rush into things.

413
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,740
Take it steady.

414
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:54,130
It's ok.

415
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:55,860
When are you bringing her back?

416
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,770
I need to prepare some food.

417
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:58,610
Don't bother.

418
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,860
At the Mid-Autumn Festival,

419
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,290
I'll take her straight to Grandma's,

420
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:02,900
and make it official.

421
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,700
What's the rush?

422
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,090
Just take your time.

423
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,090
Taxi!

424
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,940
To the street.

425
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,090
Are you Fang Tao's brother?

426
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,020
You are...

427
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,770
Me, Hongyu.

428
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,040
You are

429
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,700
Fang Tao's wife's sister's husband.

430
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,140
Sounds like a tongue twister.

431
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,490
Yes, we are brothers-in-law.

432
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:42,380
No, you used to be,

433
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,220
but not anymore.

434
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,300
What's up?

435
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,770
He Jiahuan isn't a good woman.

436
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:50,940
She dumped my brother.

437
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,090
Is that true?

438
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,220
Don't ask her.

439
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,290
She wasn't going to announce it.

440
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,490
It is hard to judge a domestic affair.

441
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,660
Fang Tao has moved back to his old house.

442
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:00,940
He doesn't drive a taxi anymore.

443
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:02,330
Then what is he doing?

444
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,770
Long-distance freight.

445
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:05,530
My goodness.

446
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,860
But they weren't right for each other.

447
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,380
It's not a surprise that this happened.

448
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,530
I'll go to my mom's at noon tomorrow

449
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:15,220
and see what Jiahuan says.

450
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:17,900
Remember,

451
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:19,330
don't ask her about this.

452
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,250
I know. Do you think I'm stupid?

453
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,700
Mom.

454
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,660
You're so early.

455
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,050
Don't you have to watch the store?

456
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,300
There's no customer.

457
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:37,610
Where is Xiaoman?

458
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,140
At her grandma's.

459
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,180
Hongyu will bring her over later.

460
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:46,380
Why are you being so secretive?

461
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,140
Are you playing spy?

462
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,530
Do you want something to eat?

463
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,900
No, I'm not in the mood.

464
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:57,370
What's wrong?

465
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:02,330
Forget it, I'll keep it to myself.

466
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:03,930
Just say it.

467
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,010
Alright, Mom, here's the thing.

468
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,770
Just stay calm, ok?

469
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:11,770
Jiahuan

470
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,050
is divorced.

471
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,250
What does that mean?

472
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,250
Literally.

473
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,070
They've got a divorce certificate.

474
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,380
Who told you that?

475
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,090
No way! I'll call her.

476
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:26,370
Mom, Mom.

477
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:27,330
No, no, no.

478
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:29,570
They weren't going to announce it.

479
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:30,490
If you ask her,

480
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:32,010
they won't have a chance to make up.

481
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:34,700
Don't ask her.

482
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:39,010
Divorce

483
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:41,490
isn't just a game.

484
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,900
Mom, calm down, ok?

485
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,490
All we can do now is watch

486
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:48,530
and see what happens.

487
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:49,780
Take it easy.

488
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:52,290
Calm down or I won't tell you anything again.

489
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,570
- Calm down.
- Mom.

490
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,490
We're home.

491
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:59,290
I can't live a day in peace.

492
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,900
Feng, give this to Grandma.

493
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,620
Jiaxi,

494
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,140
what's wrong with Mom?

495
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,530
The pickle business has gone bad.

496
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,300
Really?

497
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,700
Jiali, Jianguo.

498
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,250
Yangyang!

499
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,290
Have some food. Auntie bought it.

500
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:36,410
Say hello, Yangyang.

501
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,900
Hello, Auntie.

502
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:42,930
Where is Ouyang?

503
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,700
Working. He'll be here soon.

504
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:46,810
I'll get something to drink.

505
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:50,140
- Is that enough?
- Yes.

506
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:51,980
Jiali,

507
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:55,290
I think Yangyang

508
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,570
is acting strange.

509
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,740
Yes.

510
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:01,500
We each have our own families,

511
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,380
but he's all alone.

512
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:06,250
Zhenmin is sick again and in the hospital.

513
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,240
Mom.

514
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,490
Hello, Zhicheng.

515
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:14,140
- Hi, Jiali, Jiayi.
- Hello, Aunties.

516
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,460
Come on, Zhicheng.

517
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,860
Let me take you to play with Feng.

518
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,460
Feng, don't bully your cousin.

519
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,020
Where is Mom?

520
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:21,570
In her room.

521
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,660
Mom.

522
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:25,330
Mom.

523
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:27,010
Good holiday.

524
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,090
Where's Fang Tao?

525
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,490
He's on a business trip.

526
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:32,940
Did he go on a business trip,

527
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,730
run away,

528
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,900
or get kicked out?

529
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,490
Mom, what are you talking about?

530
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:41,980
He Jiahuan,

531
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,980
don't think you are always 18,

532
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,860
with guys surrounding you.

533
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,050
You should be happy

534
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,180
to have a husband like Fang Tao.

535
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,050
Fine, fine.

536
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:52,980
Why are you so mad?

537
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,180
Stop!

538
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,020
Sit down.

539
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:57,330
Sit!

540
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:00,770
It's a holiday today.

541
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:02,090
I don't want to ruin the mood.

542
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:03,730
After today,

543
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:05,420
go home with Fang Tao,

544
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,860
restore your family

545
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,180
to its original state.

546
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:09,770
Original, prime state,

547
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,900
you hear me?

548
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,570
Exactly the same as it was!

549
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:32,660
What happened?

550
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:34,700
Mom's hemorrhoids are back.

551
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:38,980
Shall we take her to the hospital?

552
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,500
Mom.

553
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:43,770
What's wrong with you?

554
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:46,180
Jiahuan

555
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,980
is so bold

556
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,090
and outrageous.

557
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,290
- What did she do?
- Forget it.

558
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:53,130
Don't mention her.

559
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:58,180
Xiaonian is bringing his girlfriend over.

560
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,330
Don't you want to see her?

561
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:05,330
Yes, I do.

562
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:08,290
Marriage

563
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:09,150
is a lifelong commitment.

564
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:11,290
You guys make sure they're fully prepared.

565
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:14,980
They must stick it through no matter what,

566
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,530
no quitting halfway.

567
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:18,700
We don't have a history of divorce.

568
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:24,250
They are going to stick it through.

569
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,290
What's up?

570
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:27,570
What's this about?

571
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:31,410
Here we are.

572
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,570
Hello, everyone.

573
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:36,570
Let me introduce you.

574
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,490
This is

575
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,010
- my great-grandma.
- Nice to meet you.

576
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,570
This is my grandma.

577
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:42,410
Nice to meet you.

578
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,700
This is my mom.

579
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:45,170
Nice to meet you.

580
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,060
Li Wen, right?

581
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,130
This is my dad.

582
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:48,330
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

583
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,860
This is my aunt, Jiaxi.

584
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:51,930
- Welcome.
- Nice to meet you.

585
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:53,610
Aunt Jiahuan.

586
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:54,570
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

587
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:56,330
That's Aunt Jiayi.

588
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,220
Hello.

589
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,080
- Aunt Jiawen.
- Hello.

590
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,980
Hello, nice to meet you..

591
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,820
Hello.

592
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,060
This is Uncle Ouyang.

593
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,290
Hello, nice to meet you.

594
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,900
You've got a beautiful girlfriend.

595
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,090
They are my cousins.

596
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,130
- Guangming, Feng.
- Hello, cousin.

597
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,090
Yangyang, zhicheng,

598
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:11,930
and Xiaoman.

599
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:13,980
We're from the same generation.

600
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,100
That's great.

601
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:16,650
Where is your fifth aunt?

602
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,340
She is away from home,

603
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,650
doing business.

604
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:22,300
She's really good.

605
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:25,530
This is Li Wen, my middle school classmate.

606
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:26,900
She's my girlfriend now.

607
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:27,970
Nice to meet you.

608
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,460
Alright. Sit down.

609
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,300
- Ok?
- Sit down.

610
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,690
One table for adults, one for kids.

611
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:33,010
- Well...
- Xiaonian.

612
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:33,600
I'll sit here.

613
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,780
Let Li Wen sit next to Great-grandma.

614
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:35,930
- Ok.
- Thanks.

615
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:37,660
- Sit here.
- I'll sit here.

616
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,300
- Jiawen!
- Coming!

617
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,140
Later...

618
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:42,660
Here.

619
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:46,300
Meixin, look, her nails are pretty.

620
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,700
Thanks.

621
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,130
It's a popular color.

622
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,980
I'm so happy to meet you all today.

623
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,090
I'll finish my drink first.

624
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,050
Feel free to pace yourselves.

625
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:16,010
I'm ok.

626
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,900
You can really hold your liquor.

627
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:21,330
Jiali,

628
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:23,130
your future daughter-in-law is good.

629
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:25,820
You'll have someone

630
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,090
to drink with you at home.

631
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:29,340
I'm no match for her.

632
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,980
Thanks, Great-grandma.

633
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,260
Answer the phone.

634
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:40,720
Hello.

635
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:41,580
Jiayi.

636
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,780
Xiaoling.

637
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:43,860
Where is Yangyang?

638
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:44,980
He's here with us.

639
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,140
Put him on the phone.

640
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:47,410
Yangyang.

641
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:53,090
Yangyang, it's Mom.

642
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,210
How can you...

643
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,340
It's ok.

644
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:58,900
I'm sure she'll call again.

645
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,220
Yangyang.

646
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,220
Yangyang.

647
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,170
Mom misses you.

648
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:07,570
She wants to talk to you on the holiday.

649
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:09,420
It's not easy for her to work alone

650
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,490
out there,

651
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:11,340
right?

652
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,170
Talk to Mom later, ok?

653
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:17,410
Be good.

654
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:18,890
Hello.

655
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,140
Mom.

656
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,300
Call Mom.

657
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,860
Call Mom.

658
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:27,980
- Call her, Yangyang.
- Say it.

659
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,690
- Yang...
- Yangyang.

660
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,180
Yangyang.

661
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:47,140
(Highway Auto Repair)

662
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,010
Lin.

663
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:49,370
Lin.

664
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,050
Noodles. It's hot.

665
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:51,890
Ok.

666
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,350
Come on.

667
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,640
Ok.

668
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,350
Tao,

669
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:05,700
mooncakes.

670
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,300
It's Mid-Autumn Festival.

671
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,300
We should have some too.

672
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:11,780
I forgot all about it.

673
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:18,930
Tao,

674
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:20,860
this is a tough job.

675
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:22,530
We shouldn't have taken it.

676
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:23,570
It's not much money.

677
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,130
It's tough,

678
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:26,970
but we have to finish it.

679
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:28,780
Progress is all that matters.

680
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,340
Tao,

681
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:36,490
after this job,

682
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:38,300
I'd like to take two days off.

683
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:41,930
Why?

684
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:46,460
My dad's not well.

685
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:48,260
I want to take care of him for a while.

686
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:02,930
Take this money.

687
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:03,780
No, no, Tao.

688
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,690
- Take it.
- I can't.

689
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:05,780
Buy some good food for him

690
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,740
to build up his health.

691
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,580
Take it.

692
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,820
Thanks, Tao.

693
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:14,300
This is the early stage of our company.

694
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:16,380
The profits aren't great,

695
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:18,740
but we're getting more customers.

696
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:21,570
We'll get better and better.

697
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:23,940
When our company gets better,

698
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:24,900
you'll be rewarded.

699
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:26,330
Keep up the good work.

700
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:27,330
Thanks, Tao.

701
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:28,860
- Eat your food.
- Ok.

702
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:32,900
- Eat.
- Ok.

703
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,690
Kids these days are frustrating.

704
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,300
It's your fault.

705
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,340
The boy was sensitive already,

706
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,090
yet you had to push his buttons.

707
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,780
What do you mean?

708
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:58,170
Xiaoling just wanted to talk to her son.

709
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,340
Xiaoling left in a hurry

710
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:00,460
and said nothing

711
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,490
to Yangyang.

712
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,050
Naturally, he feels abandoned

713
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:05,050
and blames her.

714
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,490
It's understandable.

715
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:11,460
You know what it was like at that time.

716
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,780
When Xiaoling left,

717
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,780
she didn't even know if she could

718
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,780
make a living.

719
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,260
How could she bring a child?

720
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:21,780
Even if

721
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,090
she wanted to,

722
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,570
the Tangs wouldn't let her.

723
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:26,740
A little boy doesn't know that much.

724
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,620
I think

725
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:33,570
you'd better convince her to come back.

726
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:34,530
How?

727
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:37,260
Those thugs are still watching us.

728
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,300
They come to our door from time to time.

729
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,650
Besides, what will she do for a living?

730
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,300
Enough, forget about them.

731
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:49,420
We have

732
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:50,780
a lot of problems ourselves.

733
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:52,300
What problems?

734
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:59,490
I was just about to tell you.

735
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,580
Isn't...

736
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,300
Isn't that a bit ostentatious?

737
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,050
With her gaping maw

738
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,010
and nails

739
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,900
covered in blood,

740
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:10,300
she was the White Bone Demon

741
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,380
of Journey to the West incarnate.

742
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,860
Your son isn't Tang Monk.

743
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,780
We're a revolutionary family,

744
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:17,650
but we have to accept such a girl.

745
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:20,690
Our son likes her. What can you do?

746
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,490
Nothing. I have to like who my son likes.

747
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,860
If it comes to it, I'll avoid looking at her.

748
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:28,980
We'll live in the same apartment.

749
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:31,460
There's no way you can avoid it.

750
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:32,410
I won't live with her.

751
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,980
When they get married, they live here.

752
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,340
We'll move in with Mom.

753
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:38,900
Will Mom agree?

754
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:40,780
Why not?

755
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:46,130
Dad appointed you to take care of them.

756
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:49,460
They're getting older and older.

757
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,300
We'll have to take care of them.

758
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:54,780
I didn't have enough for dinner.

759
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,570
I'll peel peanuts for you. Have some more.

760
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,260
Why don't you make me some noodles?

761
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,380
It's too late for noodles.

762
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,260
I'm hungry.

763
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,140
Wait a minute.

764
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,740
So nice.

765
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:25,130
Qiu Lin, look how full the moon is.

766
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:28,460
Let's have a mooncake.

767
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:32,820
Mom,

768
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,570
I want to tell you something.

769
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:37,940
I've fallen for someone.

770
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,620
Who is she?

771
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:40,940
You know her.

772
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:42,460
Do I?

773
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,740
Who?

774
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,080
You're out?

775
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,300
Hello.

776
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:01,460
Ms. Liu, are you going grocery shopping?

777
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:10,860
If you hadn't come,

778
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:12,490
I wouldn't have known that.

779
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,490
What do you think?

780
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:17,940
This is so unexpected.

781
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,090
Give me a minute to process.

782
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,300
I think

783
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:22,860
the first thing to do

784
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,460
is to find out

785
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,780
what's going on with Jiahuan,

786
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:27,490
whether she is divorced,

787
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:28,900
and why.

788
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:30,900
If it isn't that serious,

789
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:33,130
there's still room for maneuver.

790
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:35,460
Jiahuan isn't that stupid.

791
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:36,650
That's not necessarily true.

792
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:40,940
When people are blinded by love,

793
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:42,690
they can do stupid things

794
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:43,980
and act irrationally.

795
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,690
What do you think?

796
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:49,940
I don't

797
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:51,260
agree with it.

798
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,980
I don't agree either.

799
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,860
Jiahuan's career is booming.

800
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:00,210
She doesn't have to sacrifice everything

801
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:01,210
for a divorced man.
