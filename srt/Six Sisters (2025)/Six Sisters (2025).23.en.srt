00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,480
- Zhenmin.
- How did it go?

16
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,520
How was the talk?

17
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,760
They're divorced.

18
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,200
What about Yangyang?

19
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:03,920
Xiaoling will have him.

20
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,520
You were supposed to negotiate,

21
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,160
but how did you lose Yangyang?

22
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,520
We asked for Yangyang,

23
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,600
but Xiaoling rejected it.

24
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,320
(Tang Youmin)
Or she'd have a lawsuit.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,280
I thought about it.

26
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,080
If they really have a lawsuit,

27
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,320
as Yangyang is so little,

28
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,920
his mother will have custody.

29
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,640
He's the only child of our family.

30
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,480
Right?

31
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,920
The only heir of our family.

32
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,320
Weimin,

33
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,120
it's the new century.

34
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,320
Don't say that.

35
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,240
Isn't it great when Yangyang

36
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,320
doesn't live with Zhenmin?

37
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,740
He can live an easy life.

38
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,060
Besides,

39
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,660
Zhenmin isn't good at raising children.

40
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,740
Then, you have a baby.

41
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,900
I...

42
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,980
Yangyang.

43
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,580
Tell Uncle.

44
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,660
Do you want to see Mom?

45
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,860
(Tang Yangyang)
Yes. I want to go with Dad.

46
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,100
Dad, Mom, and Yangyang

47
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,260
will always stay together.

50
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,460
Jiahuan.

51
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,460
Why did you arrive so late?

52
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,660
How do I know?

53
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,860
The plane was just delayed.

54
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,060
Are we going home
or to your workplace?

55
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,060
My workplace.

56
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,300
You still have to go there?

57
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,460
You really have a lot of work to do.

58
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,900
I don't have a choice.

59
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:31,900
Excuse me.

60
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,420
Can you take me to Huainan?

61
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,500
Sorry, sir. The car is occupied.

62
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,260
Don't reject the passenger.

63
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,740
We're going back to Huainan, too.

64
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,100
I'm here to pick you up.

65
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,340
Just take him on our way back.

66
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,100
Hey, sir.

67
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,060
Going to Huainan?

68
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,660
My wife is in the car.

69
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,860
If you don't mind,
I'll drive her to work first.

70
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,340
We may take a detour.

71
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,020
Don't worry. I won't charge you extra.

72
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,700
Ok. No problem.

73
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,420
Give me your luggage.
You get in the car.

74
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,260
Thank you.

75
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,700
Where are you going?

76
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,460
Longhu Market.

77
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,020
Sit tight. Here we go.

78
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,300
(Investment Corporation)

79
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,380
We should go.

80
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,420
Sir, sit still.

81
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,660
I'll run the meter.

82
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,660
To Longhu Market.

83
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,020
Sir.

84
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,340
Is that woman

85
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,140
your wife?

86
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,860
So, you're her husband?

87
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,540
Of course.

88
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,580
She's my wife.

89
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,460
I'm 100%

90
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,300
her husband.

91
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,420
The two of you look very sweet.

92
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,820
Not too bad.

93
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,060
When did she marry you?

94
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,180
Our son is in kindergarten.

95
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:47,980
Really?

96
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,220
Then,

97
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,980
do you love her?

98
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,100
Sir,

99
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,500
you must have
stayed abroad for a long time.

100
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,740
This question will make everybody flush.

101
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,020
It's good to stay in China.

102
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,380
Are you married?

103
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,680
Yes.

104
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:22,860
But I'm divorced now.

105
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,700
Here.

106
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,580
Mom, ignore her.

107
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,580
Eat it yourself.

108
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:46,860
You eat.

109
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,260
Qiulin,

110
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,620
welcome back.

111
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,100
Cheers.

112
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,140
Here. Have a drumstick.

113
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,380
Eat it yourself.

114
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,540
What is a successful man?

115
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,060
Zhenmin,

116
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,100
a successful man

117
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,620
can handle everything.

118
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,980
Either in work

119
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,020
or in life.

120
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,980
He handles everything
inside and outside the home.

121
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,780
What is a loser?

122
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,420
A loser loses his wife.

123
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,460
He'll lose his son, too.

124
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,620
You're drunk.

125
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,460
Don't be ridiculous.

126
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,180
Zhenmin, ignore him.

127
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,620
I'm not being ridiculous.

128
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,060
I just shared some experience.

129
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,780
Actually, it's nothing.

130
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,780
When a couple can't live together,

131
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,180
divorce is actually a relief.

132
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,980
Just like the molting

133
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,780
of a snake.

134
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,940
It can't grow without molting.

135
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,820
Right?

136
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,420
Qiulin,

137
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,780
you're exactly a successful man.

138
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,660
You speak quite eloquently.

139
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,180
Come on. A toast to you.

140
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,340
Be cool with it.

141
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,060
Qiulin,

142
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,180
are you saying

143
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,940
you approve of Zhenmin's divorce?

144
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,620
Youmin, my opinion doesn't matter.

145
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,460
It all depends on the facts.

146
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,380
If your wife wants to divorce you,

147
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,820
what will you do?

148
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,340
When we just arrived in the USA,

149
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,460
we got divorced.

150
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,500
How much did you make today?

151
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,740
Nearly as much as yesterday.

152
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,900
Not too bad.

153
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,580
Tomorrow,

154
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,260
go to work earlier in the morning.

155
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,180
It's too dark in the night.

156
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,300
A man like me isn't afraid of the dark.

157
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,140
Do you remember the passenger
I took from the airport?

158
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,500
What's up?

159
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,660
He's quite straight.

160
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,140
What do you mean?

161
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,300
After you got off,

162
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,700
he asked me if we were very close.

163
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,420
How did you reply?

164
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,700
I said, "Yes."

165
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,860
I also asked him,

166
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,300
"Are you close to your wife?

167
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,340
You seem to be loving her a lot."

168
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,340
Guess what he said.

169
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,820
They're divorced.

170
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,500
It's easy for a couple to get together,

171
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,100
but it's hard to get along forever.

172
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,060
What's wrong?

173
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,940
It's tangled up.

174
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,620
I lost a piece of hair again.

175
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,500
I've been losing hair lately.

176
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,020
I need more black sesame seeds.

177
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,580
Hongyu.

178
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,660
We aren't in a hurry.

179
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,180
Hongyu.

180
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,060
Thank you.

181
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,740
You're welcome, Weiguo.

182
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,540
You've been driving us all the time.

183
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,580
Don't say that.

184
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,740
Go easy on it.

185
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,500
Jiawen.

186
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,540
This spring is cold.

187
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,540
Do you need another stove in the room?

188
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,660
No. This stove is just on.

189
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,660
It'll be warm soon.

190
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,620
Weiguo, rest and get well.

191
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,820
I think you'll recover by May Day.

192
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,780
Give it to me.

193
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,860
Guangming, I'll buy
sweet steamed buns tomorrow.

194
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,700
I want black sesame
and blown sugar filling.

195
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,540
Ok.

196
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,940
I should go, Jiawen, Weiguo.

197
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,940
Guangming, walk your uncle out.

198
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,780
- Bye.
- Ok.

199
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,500
See you, Hongyu.

200
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,180
- Don't bother, Jiayi.
- Thanks.

201
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,420
Hongyu helped really a lot.

202
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:32,940
He's a nice man.

203
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,180
Let me do it.

204
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,020
No.

205
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,140
Lie back there.

206
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,220
It's ok. I've recovered.

207
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,020
People fall sick quickly,

208
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,220
but recover very slowly.

209
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,620
You need to recuperate.

210
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,180
Do I have to?

211
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,460
You know what? Reishi is really great.

212
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,860
I've obviously gained some weight.

213
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,660
Your sisters helped a lot, too.

214
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,300
They're my biological sisters.

215
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,220
That's different.

216
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,820
But some guys

217
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,300
never show up

218
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,180
as if they didn't

219
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,580
even exist.

220
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,100
My brother and his wife live far away.

221
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,300
Their child is little.

222
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,620
I know.

223
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,180
Drink it.

224
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,700
I never count on them.

225
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,540
Anyway, we know
what kind of people they are.

226
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,260
We're a family.

227
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,700
Do you want an apple?

228
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,500
Ok.

229
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,020
Make it three pieces.

230
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,060
We'll share it.

231
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,860
We can afford apples. Wait.

232
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,580
Let's welcome Kelly,
the prettiest girl in Tianjia'an,

233
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,020
to sing Keep Awesome.

234
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:03,900
Welcome.

235
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,460
She isn't the prettiest girl.

236
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,820
She's just a divorced woman.

237
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,420
I hear she has

238
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,700
screwed Mr. Turbo.

239
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,500
Yeah. She's terrible.

00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,500
Just watch. I'll go teach her a lesson.

253
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,780
Stop... Stop singing.

254
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,980
Stop it. You sing very well.

255
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,380
Go drink with us.

256
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,580
Why? Who are you?

257
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,220
Come on. Go have a drink.

258
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,500
Let go. Let go of me.

259
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,420
Come on.

260
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,620
Stop singing.

261
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,780
Who are you?

262
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,220
Let me go. Do you hear?

263
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,260
Drink with us.

264
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,260
Let me go.

265
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,140
Go away.

266
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,180
Are you insane?

267
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,460
Yangyang, are you ok?

268
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,660
I'm fine.

269
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,180
- What are you doing?
- What do you think?

270
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,300
Get lost!

271
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,380
And you. Get lost, too!

272
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,220
He's your son, huh?

273
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,580
Yes.

274
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,100
Good boy.

275
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,820
It's brave of you
to protect your mother.

276
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,460
Thank you.

277
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,620
(May Day Shopping Mall)

278
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,460
Jiaxi,

279
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,620
you must have heard

280
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,460
some rumors.

281
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,820
Will we really have the reform?

282
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,300
Here's the situation.

283
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,900
There's only one position
in the non-staple food counter.

284
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,220
Leader, I'll do a good job.

285
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,620
Right. I know you work hard.

286
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,660
The point is there's only one position.

287
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,620
Either you or Wang Huaimin can stay.

288
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,460
She and I...

289
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,700
Come on.

290
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,620
She and I are a family.

291
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,540
Five dots.

292
00:16:59,020 --> 00:16:59,860
Two dots.

293
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:00,860
Pass.

294
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,140
Five dots.

295
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,220
One dot.

296
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,340
Mom.

297
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,420
Jiaxi, come on.

298
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,980
Get one tile for me.

299
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,700
Come on. Let's see if you're lucky.

300
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,540
Ok.

301
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,020
Nine characters. I win.

302
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,100
Really?

303
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,060
All of one suit.

304
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,380
- All of one suit.
- Again?

305
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,060
Wang, your daughter-in-law
brought good luck.

306
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,460
You're lucky, indeed.

307
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,300
All right. Let's go.

308
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,340
- Leaving?
- Come early tomorrow.

309
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,700
- I'll walk you out.
- No need.

310
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,560
Don't bother.

311
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,060
You stay here. Bye.

312
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,700
- I lost.
- Ms. Zhang.

313
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,060
You can continue tomorrow.

314
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,620
- See you.
- Go back.

315
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,460
Stay safe.

316
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,420
Ok.

317
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,260
Mom, you must have won a lot.

318
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,060
Look, a great victory.

319
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,020
You're lucky, Mom.

320
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:51,900
You always win.

321
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,500
Unlike me, I'm unlucky.

322
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,740
Life is like playing mahjong.

323
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,860
You can't always expect

324
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,620
to have good tiles in the beginning.

325
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,540
The point is

326
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,980
you should play
a poor hand of tiles well.

327
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,700
It makes you really great.

328
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:09,900
That's right.

329
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,660
But this is the problem, Mom.

330
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,220
Not everyone is as capable as you.

331
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,700
Me, for example.

332
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,980
Mom, if I lose my job,

333
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,260
how can I live?

334
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,620
Live as usual.

335
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:26,180
Even if the sky fell,
you wouldn't be crashed alone.

336
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,940
Besides, you're young.

337
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,660
Youth is power.

338
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,020
You can make money in every way, right?

339
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,140
Yes. But Mom,

340
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,860
we need money to do business.

341
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,100
Hongyu and I don't have money.

342
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,980
Then, start with a small business.

343
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,020
Stay at the station

344
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,580
and sell tea eggs. Isn't it great?

345
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,340
Oh.

346
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,100
You can buy eggs

347
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,500
from your eldest sister.

348
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,860
A good bargain, then.

349
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,940
Great, isn't it?

350
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,820
Mom.

351
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,940
Mom, I'm thinking...

352
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,740
The job thing...

353
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,660
How about I stay and you quit?

354
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,740
I'll give you half of my pay

355
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,300
until you formally retire.

356
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,380
Jiaxi,

357
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,740
you appear to be smart.

358
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,180
Why can't you understand?

359
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,780
I can't interfere

360
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,980
with the job thing.

361
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,060
None of my business.

362
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,540
It's a decision from superiors.

363
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,900
Mom, you don't need to interfere.

364
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,980
You just quit and rest.

365
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,700
I'll work. I'm young and tough.

366
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:31,100
You're so simple-minded.

367
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,140
Do you think you can get the job

368
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,100
after I quit?

369
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,380
It's not your turn,
in terms of seniority.

370
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,460
Besides, a lot of people
are expecting this job.

371
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,300
Let me be clear with you.

372
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,120
If I quit,

373
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:48,360
you'll also lose your job.
Do you believe it?

374
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,540
If you quit your job

375
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,060
and can't get a new one,

376
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,860
rest at home.

377
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,100
Don't worry about work. Take your time.

378
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,580
You will find a suitable job.

379
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,460
A suitable job?

380
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,580
Do you think the way your mother does?

381
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,260
I'll sell eggs on the station platform.

382
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,380
Look at those who sell eggs.

383
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,420
Their average age is

384
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,540
at least 60.

385
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,300
How about we do business?

386
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,300
What will you sell?

387
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,980
Huainan is the home to tofu.

388
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,100
- Then?
- Then, we'll sell tofu.

389
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,300
Do you think selling tofu

390
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,460
is very simple?

391
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,660
It needs techniques.

392
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,980
Mom wanted Jiali to sell tofu.

393
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,300
But she couldn't do that.

394
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,380
We...

395
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,700
We won't sell raw tofu.

396
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,780
We'll process it.

397
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,420
You'll open a restaurant

398
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,060
and sell tofu feast.

399
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,540
Tofu feast?

400
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,900
I haven't even tasted it.

401
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,100
You haven't?

402
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,780
It's so delicious.

403
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,940
It's near Bagong Mountain.

404
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,660
I'll drive there to buy you some.

405
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,580
Now, people get a job by themselves.

406
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,580
This is a trend.

407
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,660
Right. It's easy to eat tofu.

408
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,460
But it's not that easy to do business.

409
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,260
It isn't so hard, is it?

410
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,500
The cost of tofu is low.

411
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,740
And it's nutritious.

412
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,900
You can't just think of making tofu.

413
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,500
Think about something else.

414
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,660
You'll rent a restaurant,
apply for the certificate,

415
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,980
buy furniture, and hire a cook.

416
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,940
I need no more examples.

417
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,460
These things are complicated.

418
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,380
I'm not a superman.

419
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,540
I can't do them at one time.

420
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,340
Is it so hard?

421
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,220
Director He, someone wants to see you.

422
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,340
Who?

423
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,020
Can I buy you a cup of coffee?

424
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,940
You stayed in a developed country.

425
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,980
You aren't used to life
in this small city, huh?

426
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,820
I went abroad to come back one day.

427
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,780
And let me correct you.

428
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,540
This is no longer a small city.

429
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,980
Since 1984, it has been
one of the thirteen

430
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,060
major cities approved
by the State Council.

431
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,660
Glad you're back.

432
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,100
You can contribute to this city.

433
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,220
What about you?

434
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,940
What do you mean?

435
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:28,740
How's your life?

436
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,900
You see it, don't you?

437
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:32,940
Are you married?

438
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,300
You saw my husband.

439
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,340
He's a nice guy.

440
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,220
What about you?

441
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,180
Me?

442
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,780
What do you mean?

443
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,780
Where's Lisha?

444
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,940
She isn't back with me.

445
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,020
We broke up.

446
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,060
Oh no.

447
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,100
To be exact, we're divorced.

448
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,380
A mistake should be corrected in time.

449
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,660
(Black Tea House)

450
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,100
(Taxi)

451
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,580
We arrived safely. Ten yuan, please.

452
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,420
Thank you, sir.

453
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,780
- See you.
- Ok.

454
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,220
I don't need to run the meter
on this snowy day.

455
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,340
One passenger after another.

456
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,820
(Black Tea House)
Hey, buddy.

457
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:19,900
You can't park here.

458
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,740
You're in my way. I'll unload something.

459
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,580
I'm in a hurry.

460
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,820
Why did you park so close?

461
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,830
My car broke down.
Push it or detour it.

462
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,580
You're so quick-tempered.

463
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,780
It's snowing.

464
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,700
Dad, it's snowing.

465
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,580
Come out and see.

466
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,780
It's snowing?

467
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,900
Dad, it's snowing.

468
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,370
Yeah.

469
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,300
It starts to snow so early this year.

470
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,420
Dad, let's go out and play.

471
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:12,980
Go out?

472
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,500
Forget it.

473
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,700
Slow down.

474
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,860
Dad, look. Such thick snow.

475
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,220
Dad, don't throw it at me.

476
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,060
Come on.

477
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:34,940
Dad, look.

478
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,260
There's a rabbit.

479
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:39,980
Be careful.

480
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,510
Don't scare it away.

481
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,180
Let's see who'll catch it first, ok?

482
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,180
Ok.

483
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,100
Go ahead.

484
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,900
Be careful. Don't scare it away.

485
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,140
Got it.

486
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,140
Dad, I caught the rabbit.

487
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,060
Dad.

488
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:06,900
Dad.

489
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,740
Dad!

490
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,580
Dad!

491
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,700
Dad, Dad.

492
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,820
Dad, wake up.

493
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,340
Wake up.

494
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:20,740
Help! Help my dad!

495
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,260
Doctor, how did this happen?

496
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,620
He has almost recovered.

497
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,540
How come he fainted again?

498
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,660
Please understand.

499
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,660
The biochemical test takes a while.

500
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,620
Be patient, please.

501
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:53,020
When the result is out,
we'll let you know, ok?

502
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,940
It's my fault.

503
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,860
Don't worry too much.

504
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,380
Maybe he suffers

505
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,140
from low blood sugar.

506
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,260
He's weak during recovery.

507
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,060
He can't exercise strenuously.

508
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,300
Yeah. He's gained weight.

509
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,620
I think he'll be all right.

510
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,260
Let's go.

511
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,100
(Taxi, For Hire)

512
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,660
You look gorgeous today.

513
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,740
We can go. Where's Zhicheng?

514
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,860
I drove him back home.

515
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,940
Finish your work early today.

516
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,500
It's snowy out there.

517
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,620
The roads are icy.

518
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:25,900
You can't drive.

519
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,460
Do you hear me?

520
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,860
What do you want to say?

521
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,900
I said,

522
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:39,310
it's cold today.

523
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,260
Finish your work early.

524
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,740
I want to have a hot pot.

525
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:44,860
That's all?

526
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,620
What do you expect to hear?

527
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,500
I want to hear

528
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,500
what you've kept from me.

529
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,940
Did you forget something?

530
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,620
Where's the red scarf?

531
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,900
What's wrong with you?

532
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,340
See? Before I get angry,

533
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,460
you're losing your temper.

534
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,940
I'm the victim, right?

535
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,460
I don't know what you're saying.

536
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,140
Do I have to say this?

537
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,860
Smell yourself.

538
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,020
Black Tea House.

539
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,100
Red scarf.

540
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,660
A passenger of mine!

541
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,860
Fang Tao!

542
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,540
Are you insane?

543
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,820
You must have read too many novels.

544
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,340
Ok. Listen carefully.

545
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:45,660
That passenger is Zhang Qiulin.

546
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,500
Who is he?

547
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,660
His sister is Zhang Qiufang.

548
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,260
His mother is Ms. Liu!

549
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,660
He's a neighbor who lives
next door for decades!

550
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,460
He and I grew up together!

551
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,900
A... A neighbor?

552
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:04,580
You're so narrow-minded.

553
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:06,860
Wait.

554
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,860
When he took the taxi,

555
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,100
you didn't talk.

556
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:10,940
You didn't say hello.

557
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,100
What kind of neighbor is that?

558
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,260
Do you know when we met last time?

559
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,860
He was in the USA for years.

560
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,940
We both have changed.

561
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,260
I didn't recognize him, ok?

562
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,300
Why did you have coffee?

563
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,020
When he's back from abroad,

564
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,660
he wants to do business.

565
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,220
So, he came to me to consult something.

566
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,660
After I told him, he felt grateful

567
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,740
and bought me coffee, ok?

568
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,060
What about the red scarf?

569
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,020
The snow was small.

570
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,300
Later, it snowed heavily.

571
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,150
He tried to be nice.

572
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,500
But I gave it back to him.

573
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,700
You put it on, anyway.

574
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,660
Would you stop it?

575
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,340
When he took my taxi,

576
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,300
I thought he asked a weird question.

577
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,820
As I think about it,

578
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,140
he must have meant something else.

579
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,820
Hey, Huan.

580
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,580
I'm worried about you.

581
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,940
I was just wondering.

582
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,940
If he's your neighbor,

583
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,220
I'll be relieved, then.

584
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,260
Let's go have hot pot.

585
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,300
It's a cold day for the hot pot.

586
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,020
What would you like, mutton or beef?

587
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,340
We won't eat mutton.

588
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,260
It gives internal heat. We'll eat beef.

589
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,700
Here we go.

590
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:29,220
(Outpatient
Huainan No.1 People's Hospital)

591
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,740
According to the result,

592
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,700
your husband has

593
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,100
terminal liver cancer.

594
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,260
(Oncology Department)

595
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,220
Didn't you say

596
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,500
he had hepatitis

597
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,460
and cirrhosis?

598
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,180
(Oncology Department)
Why is it

599
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,900
terminal liver cancer now?

600
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,220
Is there something wrong?

601
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,820
Medical conditions in our hospital

602
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,020
are limited.

603
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,660
We advise you to go
to a big hospital in the big city.

604
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,460
The medical conditions there

605
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,460
will be better.

606
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,700
And I have to tell you something.

607
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,620
If he goes back into therapy,

608
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:32,220
you'll have to prepare enough money.

609
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,300
I'll send you the money tomorrow.

610
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,260
You'll go with him alone?

611
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,500
Do you need my husband to help?

612
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,380
No need.

613
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,940
He's busy.

614
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,300
I'll take Weiguo there.

615
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,340
What kind of disease does he have?

616
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,540
Why does he need to go to Shanghai?

617
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,140
Shanghai has better medical conditions.

618
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,140
We'll go there and get relieved.

619
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,180
Call me if you need anything.

620
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,700
Jiali,

621
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,300
can I leave Guangming

622
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,900
to you?

623
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:33,900
Leave him to me.

624
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,700
Don't take him back tonight.

625
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,300
Don't tell Mom or Grandma.

626
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,900
They're old.

627
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,820
I don't want them to get worried.

628
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,660
Rest assured.

629
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,700
What are you doing?

630
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,340
Oh, you scared me.

631
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:04,940
Jiawen will take Weiguo
to see a doctor in Shanghai.

632
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,300
She wants to borrow money.

633
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,140
Why will they go to Shanghai?

634
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,580
How's Weiguo recovering?

635
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,700
Jiawen said he was fine.

636
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,900
But I don't think so.

637
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,380
Then, take all this money.

638
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,580
I'll get my pay soon.

639
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,940
We're ok with it.

640
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,940
We can only give her all we have.

641
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,780
If Weiguo has a serious problem,

642
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,340
he'll need help from Jiayi.

643
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,100
She didn't tell Jiayi?

644
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,180
No, I think.

645
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,540
Hello.

646
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:46,860
Oh, Jiayi.

647
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,100
Jiali,

648
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,500
Weiguo is going to Shanghai tomorrow.

649
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,740
Why didn't you tell me?

650
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,180
Did Jiawen not tell you?

651
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,300
No.

652
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,980
Maybe she forgot.

653
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,660
How can I help them?

654
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,500
When are they leaving?

655
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,300
I'll go to her home tomorrow morning.

656
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,100
If you want to go, go with me.

657
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,180
Deal.

658
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,060
Umm...

659
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,380
Shall we tell Jiahuan?

660
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,900
Tell her if you want.

661
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,260
But don't tell Xiaoling.

662
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,780
It's hard for her to raise a child.

663
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:18,900
See you tomorrow.

664
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,140
Be right there.

665
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,540
What are you guys doing here?

666
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,060
Come on in.

667
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,740
Jiawen, it's from Jiaxi.

668
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:46,980
Why?

669
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,220
Jiawen,

670
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,460
you should have told us.

671
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,740
We're sisters,

672
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,740
not strangers.

673
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,060
I'll always support you

674
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,980
voluntarily and gratuitously.

675
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,460
You're always my elder sister.

676
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:05,060
I've contacted my classmate in Shanghai.

677
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:05,980
He's there.

678
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,740
He'll receive you. Don't worry.

679
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,180
Keep the money.

680
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,180
Are you done packing?

681
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,620
Hongyu.

682
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,500
Call us if anything happens in Shanghai.

683
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,860
You'll take care of them.

685

687
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,260
Isn't it great to quit working?

688
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,180
You can do anything you want freely.

689
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,780
That's easy for you to say.

690
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,860
You have Dad's secure job.

691
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:46,740
It backs you up.

692
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,980
Now, I can't get paid every month.

693
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,740
I have to get a job.

694
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,500
Jiaxi,

695
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,300
let me be honest.

696
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,340
Now, I'm making more money

697
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,300
than my salary.

698
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,700
How?

699
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,580
By working.

700
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,420
What kind of work?

701
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,380
Manual labor.

702
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,300
Be specific.

703
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,740
Go with me tonight and you'll know.

704
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,500
What kind of work do you do at night?

705
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:13,940
Xiaoling,

706
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,300
you can't be...

707
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,540
Hey. Don't be silly.

708
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,180
It's a time for each

709
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,700
to show their skill.

710
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,540
You've got to be capable.

711
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,700
We can get a salary.

712
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,700
But is that enough?

713
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,540
If it weren't for my job

714
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,540
and my son,

715
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,660
I would've done business.

716
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,860
Where would you go?

717
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,740
To the south. Guangzhou,
Shenzhen, or Xiamen.

718
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,620
Anywhere.

719
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,100
It's better than staying here.

720
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,140
Jiaxi, seriously.

721
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,180
Shall we go out and do business?

722
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,740
I can't go.

723
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,540
That's your problem.

724
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:50,460
You look fierce,

725
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,500
but you're a coward.

726
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,260
You're homesick, too.

727
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,580
How about you sing at my place?

728
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:57,130
Fine. I'll try.

(Cancer Hospital)

730
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,980
According to the test results,

731
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,620
he indeed has terminal liver cancer.

732
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,100
This is

733
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,420
a really tough disease worldwide.

734
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:21,860
Doctor,

735
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,420
he's still young.

736
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:29,660
Is there...?

737
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,260
Is there...?

738
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,820
Is there anything we can do?

739
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,420
We'll schedule a consult.

740
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:43,700
We'll do our best

741
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,420
to reduce the patient's suffering.

742
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,060
Are there any painkillers?

743
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,700
You took too many today.

744
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,860
Go back to sleep.

745
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:42,620
I won't.

746
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,220
The day is breaking.

747
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,780
Yeah. The day is breaking.

748
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,620
What would you like for breakfast?

749
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,900
I'll go buy it for you.
