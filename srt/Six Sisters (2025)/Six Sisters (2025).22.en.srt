15
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:41,640
Hello.

16
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,670
Hello? Say something.

17
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,340
I held my pee for too long.

18
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,140
Where's our son?

19
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,020
He's gone out with Ms. Liao.

20
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,260
Honey.

21
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,220
During this trip,

22
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,500
did anything happen?

23
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,900
Yes.

24
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,940
Something really weird.

25
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,300
What do you mean?

26
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,060
The feathers

27
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,500
were surprisingly cheap this time

28
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,020
and I bought them all.

29
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,220
All?

30
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,660
Now, the warehouse

31
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,660
is full of feathers.

32
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,140
So, you spent all our money.

33
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,660
Come on, honey.

34
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,340
Great profits come with risks.

35
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,780
Don't worry. It'll be fine.

36
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:51,260
Trust me. We're going to make a fortune.

37
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,140
What about anything else?

38
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,780
Did you meet anyone?

39
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,700
What do you mean?

40
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,020
A woman

41
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,620
just called,

42
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,940
asking for a man.

43
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,020
She must have the wrong number.

44
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,100
Now, a lot of men have a cellular phone.

45
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,020
Just ignore her.

46
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,540
Come on.

47
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,700
Honey.

48
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,860
If you fall in love with someone,

49
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,020
let me know.

50
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,020
Unless you bring her home,

51
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,620
I'll be ok with that.

52
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,340
I swear.

53
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,940
If I had an affair,

54
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,140
even if I ever thought about it,

55
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,260
I would die immediately.

56
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,420
Is it ok?

57
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,180
Don't be ridiculous.

58
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,420
I just pledged.

59
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,540
I'm just saying.

60
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,780
Don't be so nervous.

61
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,900
I didn't suspect anything.

62
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,020
But now, you're suspicious.

63
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,180
I did nothing...

64
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,820
Brrr.

65
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,900
I'm just kidding.

66
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,220
Don't worry. I'm not that kind of man.

67
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,820
Or why do you love me?

68
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,060
Answer it.

69
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,620
Go ahead.

70
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,500
- Hello.
- Hello.

71
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,420
The goods are here.

72
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,700
Which warehouse?

73
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,180
I'll hang up. We'll talk later.

74
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,500
What product?

75
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,260
What warehouse?

76
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,260
She's a business partner.

77
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,540
Nonsense. She must be a vixen.

78
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,780
She called just now.

79
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,900
Warehouse. Is that a secret code?

80
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,740
No. No, honey.

81
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,420
She's really a partner.

82
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,660
She's a woman, indeed.

83
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,020
Tell me who she is.

84
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:46,980
Tell me.

85
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,340
- I...
- You don't, huh?

86
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,100
- Three, two, one.
- Honey.

87
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,820
Please don't. I'll tell you.

88
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:53,860
Xiaoling.

89
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,860
Xiaoling who?

90
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,940
Liu Xiaoling!

91
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,980
Tang Zhenmin!

92
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,780
Liu Xiaoling!

93
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,060
Liu Xiaoling!

94
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,140
Jiayi.

95
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:09,980
Tang Zhen...

96
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,190
Where's Xiaoling?

97
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,820
Let's get in and talk.

98
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,940
Come on, Yangyang.

99
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,780
Yangyang.

100
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,780
Say hello to Aunt.

101
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,180
Jiayi, come in.

102
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,700
I forgot to pay electricity bills.

103
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,300
Yangyang, go get a candle.

104
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,820
Jiayi, what's the emergency?

105
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,540
Nothing. Where's Xiaoling?

106
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,860
She's working overtime.

107
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,300
I don't know when she'll be back.

108
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,580
Working on the sheepskin?

109
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,140
I don't know.

110
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,580
She's your wife.

111
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,540
How come you don't know?

112
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,700
Get me some water.

113
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,460
I'm so thirsty after running up here.

114
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,980
Well, you've seen this.

115
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,060
Xiaoling is divorcing me.

116
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,100
She has moved out.

117
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,700
Xiaoling,

118
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,660
you've lost your mind.

119
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,980
I haven't.

120
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,220
I do this because I'm too clear-minded.

121
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,420
A couple

122
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,860
should rise or fall as one.

123
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,460
Divorce is no child's play.

124
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,980
If he makes a mistake,

125
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,620
ask him to correct it.

126
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,060
Don't talk about him.

127
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,260
It gives me a headache.

128
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,260
Fine.

129
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,300
What about the sheepskin?

130
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,420
Some of our sheepskin can't be sold.

131
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,100
I asked Ouyang to find a way

132
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,300
and sell it.

133
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,700
Why do you keep it from me?

134
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,780
I'm doing this when I have a secure job.

135
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,820
The fewer people know it,
the safer I will be.

136
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,780
I asked Ouyang to keep it secret.

137
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,500
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

138
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,700
Don't tell anyone about Zhenmin, either.

139
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,710
Don't get divorced so hurriedly.

140
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,940
Be cool with it.

141
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,540
Yeah, he doesn't want a divorce.

142
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,660
So, he still cares for you.

143
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,070
Not at all. No one takes care of him

144
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,920
and he can't live.

145
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,860
I asked him to get a girlfriend quickly.

146
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,180
What about you?

147
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,020
Do you also want a boyfriend?

148
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,690
All I want now

149
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,800
is to make money.

150
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,150
Will she really divorce?

151
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,840
I don't think she's kidding.

152
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,120
Just because Zhenmin
is lazy and unambitious?

153
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,800
This is a serious problem.

154
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,600
But I don't think they have to divorce.

155
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,920
Maybe

156
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,960
Xiaoling has something to hide.

157
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,800
Perhaps,

158
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,760
Zhenmin has an affair.

159
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,320
He can't.

160
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,160
Nobody would like him.

161
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,040
We never know.

162
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,120
When he was on the dance team,

163
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,200
a lot of girls adored him.

164
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,760
This is no longer the era for dance.

165
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,600
Right. It's your turn to show off.

166
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,240
So, I have to warn you.

167
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,760
In a bad environment,

168
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,240
people easily change.

169
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,280
Come on. Let's read.

170
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,160
Let's read together.

171
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,200
How would I do that?

172
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,840
I'm not that kind of man.

173
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,600
Honey, look.

174
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,320
What do you think?

175
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,320
If they can't be shipped out...

176
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,760
They can.

177
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,040
This winter is really cold.

178
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,560
Why do I store so many feathers?

179
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,640
For this chance, exactly.

180
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,320
Honey.

181
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,000
I think we're taking a big risk.

182
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:19,760
Honey, we have to when we want profits.

183
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,760
Ok. You call the shots on feathers.

184
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,160
That's more like it.

185
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,360
Oh.

186
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,360
What about Xiaoling's sheepskin?

187
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,040
I'm selling it.

188
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,360
Two or three pieces, though.

189
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,320
Honey, to be honest,

190
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,440
it's hard for Xiaoling

191
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,840
to make money like this.

192
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,040
It's hard for her to raise her son.

193
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,760
We should help her

194
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,680
as much as we can.

195
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,080
Of course. She's your sister.

196
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,400
We'll certainly help her.

197
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,040
Honey, you're the best.

198
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,920
Let's go to Jinman Restaurant.

199
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,760
Come on.

200
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,040
You're back?

201
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,200
Yes, I'm back.

202
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,560
Oh, Mr. Ouyang is back.

203
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,520
Dad, I want a Transformer.

204
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,720
Ok. We'll buy it tomorrow.

205
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,760
- Ok.
- Go watch TV.

206
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,160
Honey, come upstairs with me.

207
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,280
What's up?

208
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,520
Come on.

209
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,960
What's so mysterious?

210
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,840
Let's get in and talk.

211
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,120
Hurry.

212
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,800
How much do we have now? Give it to me.

213
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,120
- What for?
- Just do it!

214
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,520
Is this all we have now?

215
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,440
Yes.

216
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,440
You invested all the money in feathers.

217
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,400
(Bankbook)
I stopped you but failed.

218
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,040
I'm doomed!

219
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,080
What...?

220
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,360
What happened?

221
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,560
I'm so unlucky.

222
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,200
The snow is to blame.

223
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,320
The road is blocked by heavy snow.

224
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,520
I can't ship the feathers out.

225
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,720
And people say this year, we have

226
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,760
the economic crisis.

227
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,760
Even if they're shipped out,
they won't be sold.

228
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,160
I can't sell any of them!

229
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,600
Then...

230
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,880
Can we sell them next year?

231
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:51,980
Next year?

232
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,800
No one wants the new feathers now.

233
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,600
How will they want them next year?

234
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,360
How much did we lose?

235
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,320
We lost...

236
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,160
About...

237
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,320
- All our money.
- Be specific!

238
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,320
A million!

239
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,160
Shall...?

240
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,960
Shall we ship them out?

241
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,200
How?

242
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,000
The public fleet broke up.

243
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,640
It's snowing hard. Private trucks

244
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,120
will not take the risk.

245
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,120
And when they can't be sold,

246
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,400
the money will be lost, anyway.

247
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,840
If they're shipped out,
there will be hope.

248
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,080
If they aren't, there will be no hope.

249
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,640
How can I? The problem is
I can't ship them out.

250
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,800
Wait a minute. I'll go get a truck.

251
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,160
I'll go right away.

252
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,040
Where are you going?

253
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,640
Honey, I'll go with you.

254
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,480
- Brother!
- Who?

255
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,400
Open the door, brother!

256
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,920
Brother.

257
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,240
What are you doing here?

258
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,200
Brother, Jiayi, something's wrong.

259
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,120
- What's wrong?
- Dad.

260
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,600
Dad fell.

261
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,000
How did he?

262
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,480
The ground was slippery and he...

263
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,840
How did you take care of Dad?

264
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,920
Why were you so careless?

265
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,880
Why?

266
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,080
Calm down.

267
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,160
You go see Dad with him.

268
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,760
I'll go get a truck, ok?

269
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,160
You're making things worse.

270
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,680
Go with me to check on him.

271
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,520
Hurry.

272
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,760
Ms. Liao, take care of Feng.

273
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,640
Ask him to eat less.

274
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,840
Let him stop eating oranges.

275
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,880
Ok. Ok.

276
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,920
Dad.

277
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,360
Dad.

278
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,760
I'm your third son.

279
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,960
Please stay with me.

280
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,440
Now,

281
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,600
I'm in some trouble.

282
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,760
I have to handle it.

283
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,320
Please wait for me.

284
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,240
Throughout your life,

285
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,000
you've been through everything

286
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,040
and gone over all the difficulties.

287
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,520
You've survived in the end.

288
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,680
You will survive again.

289
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,640
You have a great life to live.

290
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,280
Please wait until I'm back.

291
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,320
Take care of Dad.

292
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,680
I have to go.

293
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,080
I drove along Jiangsu before.

294
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,120
I can go, but I don't have a truck.

295
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,880
I've got a truck.

296
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,840
You'll just drive.

297
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,600
Ok. Then I can go anytime.

298
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,640
Fine. How about this?

299
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,520
Wait for me
at the crossing of Guoqing Road.

300
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,840
I need to get Hongyu.

301
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:09,880
I won't drink.

302
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,640
- Thanks, Jiahuan.
- Jiayi, calm down.

303
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:12,880
I'll pick up something and go.

304
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,960
Why do you stare at me?

305
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,120
You should have discussed it with me.

306
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,080
Jiayi is so anxious.

307
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,520
Let's not waste time.

308
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,400
It's snowy.

309
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,920
There's said to be a heavy snow, too.

310
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,440
It's the end of the year.

311
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,760
How can you go out?

312
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,720
But this is an emergency.

313
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,680
If we don't help her, who will?

314
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,280
You're such a nice man.

315
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,560
Is the road slippery
and can you drive smoothly?

316
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,800
Does anyone care for you?

317
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,120
Are you worried about me, Director He?

318
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,000
Don't worry.

319
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,920
I lost my job.

320
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,800
But I haven't lost my driving skills.

321
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,080
I'm not useless, huh?

322
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,920
Drive slowly.

323
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,200
Got it.

324
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,200
This is an emergency.

325
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,680
Please help me.

326
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,680
How about you go with Jiayi?

327
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,120
Since Jiayi asks for help,

328
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,330
I'll certainly go.

329
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,960
I'll triple the pay.

330
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:18,960
Jiayi,

331
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,400
it's not about money.

332
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,240
Don't say that.

333
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,720
I'm leaving. Wait for me.

334
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,040
- Thanks. Bye.
- Let's go, Jiayi.

335
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,160
Stay safe.

336
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,240
- Ouyang.
- Hongyu.

337
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,920
You've never driven this before.

338
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,760
Are you ok?

339
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,160
Yes. I have the truck license.

340
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,520
Fine.

341
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,440
Drive safe.

342
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,280
Don't worry.

343
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,120
Fang Tao.

344
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,360
It's snowing.

345
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,520
The roads are slippery.

346
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,120
Drive slowly in the night.

347
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,480
We're experienced.

348
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,160
This is an old route. Don't worry.

349
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,920
Hongyu.

350
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,360
Drive slowly in the night.

351
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,280
Honey, you go back.

352
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,120
You have to take care of Dad.

353
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,960
Don't worry.

354
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,400
Honey,

355
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,620
just try your best.

356
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,920
Where there is life,

357
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,260
there is hope.

358
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,140
Come on.

359
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:43,640
(Grain Warehouse 3)

360
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,960
Fang Tao!

361
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,600
Ouyang!

362
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,760
Jianguo?

363
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,720
- What are you doing here?
- Jianguo.

364
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,920
Glad I'm not late.

365
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,040
Are the trucks enough?

366
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,720
My comrade-in-arms has a truck.

367
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,160
Jianguo,

368
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,800
I forgot to tell you.

369
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,320
After you called me,

370
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,480
in case it would be too late,

371
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,000
I borrowed some from my friends.

372
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,240
Two trucks are enough.

373
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,200
Glad to hear that.

374
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,640
No tire chains, right?

375
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,400
Roads may get icy on snowy days.

376
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,640
I've brought tire chains.

377
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,080
Put them on. Safety matters.

378
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,160
It's so thoughtful of you.

379
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,040
Come on.

380
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,720
- Come on.
- Let me do it.

381
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,760
Jianguo delivered chains in the snow.

382
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,800
Sir, get up and eat something.

383
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,080
Leave it to me.

384
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,160
Dad passed away peacefully.

385
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,120
He didn't suffer too much.

386
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,680
You were too busy out there.

387
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,400
Dad would understand

388
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,600
even if he was in heaven.

389
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,480
And...

390
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,880
Even if you could come back

391
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,400
to see him one last time,

392
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,720
in the last minutes,

393
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,920
he failed to talk.

394
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,760
When I was there,

395
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,520
I represented you, right?

396
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,760
That's different.

397
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,360
Here.

398
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,600
Have something to eat.

399
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,160
Don't worry too much

400
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,720
about business.

401
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,240
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.

402
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,920
Nobody can win forever.

403
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,120
Like I said,

404
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,600
where there is life,

405
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,080
there is hope.

406
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,920
I believe one day

407
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,760
you'll be successful again.

408
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,400
I can't.

409
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,260
I'm doomed.

410
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,120
(Wu's Grocery)

411
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,000
The feathers weren't sold?

412
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,880
No. They have to be stored.

413
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,320
Not even a single piece was sold.

414
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,600
What about Ouyang Bao and his feathers?

415
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,400
He's doomed.

416
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,000
It's just destiny.

417
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,080
He can't do anything.

418
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,640
I hear his father also died
during Chinese New Year.

419
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,200
It's just one thing after another.

420
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,080
Yeah.

421
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,440
One trouble after another.

422
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,240
Mom, thank you for taking care of Jiaxi.

423
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,920
I'll take her back.

424
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,400
Wait. Where are you taking me?

425
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,120
Home.

426
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,480
You rented a flat?

427
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,320
We need a plan for that.

428
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,680
You moved away so suddenly.

429
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,920
Mom was so sad.

430
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,160
Your mother? Sad?

431
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,080
She celebrated when she sent me away.

432
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,320
She even said, "Hope you won't
come back again!"

433
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,720
Mom,

434
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,120
those were cross words.

435
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,560
Indeed.

436
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,880
Hongyu.

437
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,160
We had a deal.

438
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,480
Don't change it.

439
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,480
Take the opportunity

440
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,560
to rent a flat.

441
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,080
The two of you will live together.

442
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,040
Seriously, it works on everyone.

443
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,520
Distance makes the heart grow fonder.

444
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,120
When you're married,

445
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,840
you'd better live alone.

446
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,880
Do you hear?

447
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,720
OK. I'll listen to you, Mom.

448
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,560
Be careful. It's hot.

449
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,000
We stopped on the highway
for two days and nights.

450
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,440
When we arrived,
people had stored the feathers.

451
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,000
Ouyang couldn't sell anything.

452
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,520
What can he do, then?

453
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,840
He can't do anything.

454
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,760
The trip is in vain.

455
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,080
No one bought the feathers.

456
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,720
I've realized something.

457
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,400
It takes brains

458
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,400
to do business,

459
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,880
especially big business.

460
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,520
But it takes luck more.

461
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,000
Or it would be really risky

462
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,280
and dangerous.

463
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,200
Then, do you still want
to deliver goods?

464
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,400
Or will you serve people?

465
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,480
I'll just serve you.

Jiayi,

483
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,280
will you really sell it?

484
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,440
Now, a used Santana

485
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,920
isn't very valuable.

486
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,040
I know. A low price is ok.

487
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,520
Fine. I'll ask around.

488
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,840
Umm.

489
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,120
How's Ouyang?

490
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,680
He's fine.

491
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,760
It was really unfortunate.

492
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,520
A little adversity can be good.

493
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:35,920
In life,

494
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,600
people rise and fall.

495
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:42,320
He and I started from scratch.

496
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,640
Now, without money, we can still fight.

497
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,960
Jiayi,

498
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,960
you're impressive in my heart.

499
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,240
If Jiaxi was half as clever as you,

500
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,000
our life would be much better.

501
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,480
Be patient.

502
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,440
Honey.

503
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,680
Here. Have lunch.

504
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,080
I'm not hungry.

505
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,480
You're a human.

506
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,640
A human has to eat.

507
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,120
Here.

508
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,080
Unless you don't want to live.

509
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,800
I don't want to live, indeed.

510
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,160
It's not that serious.

511
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,360
Hope is only for living people.

512
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,080
Such poor food.

513
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,760
We worked so hard to get rich.

514
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,480
Now, we're poor again.

515
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,240
Life isn't worthless.

516
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,960
It's normal that people earn some money

517
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,480
and lose some money.

518
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,960
Think about your father.

519
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,760
He lived a poor life in his early years.

520
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,880
Honey,

521
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,360
don't bring him up.

522
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,720
My father

523
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,880
worked so hard to bring his sons up.

524
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,240
He sold melon seeds for years

525
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,440
and worked hard all his life.

526
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,440
When he deserved a happy life,

527
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,160
he passed away.

528
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,840
In the end,

529
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,640
he still didn't enjoy a good life.

530
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,120
What shall I move? Where is it?

531
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,080
Look around for it.

532
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,880
Don't mess with me. I'm cooking.

533
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,400
It's such a big thing.

534
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,880
Can't you see it?

535
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,720
Umm...

536
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,360
The taxi...

537
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,680
Did you buy it?

538
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,440
Why do you look upset?

539
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,720
I spent a lot of money

540
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,560
and asked Hongyu for help.

541
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,560
How much does it cost?

542
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,080
It doesn't cost too much.

543
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,040
We need it urgently.

544
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,280
So, Hongyu could only get this taxi.

545
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,280
Make do with it.

546
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,600
It's hard to get this quota.

547
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,120
(Taxi)
So, we must take it up now.

548
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,440
Get it or lose it.

549
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,760
Make do with it now.

550
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,880
At last, I will serve people.

551
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,760
Come on.

552
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,320
Let's get Zhicheng and go.

553
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,560
Jinman Restaurant.

554
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,000
To spend money before making some?

555
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,280
I'm cooking up there.

556
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,280
I'll spend my money. Don't be stingy.

557
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,400
And you'll drive a taxi.

558
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,840
You can make money every day.

559
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,880
But we can't spend all our money.

560
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,720
Why do you sound

561
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,560
really jealous?

562
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,280
Come on.

563
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,120
Let's go.

564
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,350
Tang Zhenmin,

565
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,880
have you packed up my things?

566
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,760
Tang Zhenmin,

567
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,200
why did you use my shirt as a rag?

568
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,560
Don't blame me.

569
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,200
Who else shall I blame?

570
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,560
You threw it about.

571
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,360
It was a white shirt before I left.

572
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,250
What is it now?

573
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,840
Look. How can we live together?

574
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,680
We won't live together, will we?

575
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,840
Can you stay out of my way?

576
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,280
What else can you do

577
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,280
except playing games?

578
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,800
Look, my shirt is ruined.

579
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,680
What happened?

580
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,880
You threw it about. I'm not to blame.

581
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:16,960
Look what a mess it is.

582
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,720
Look at my shirt.

583
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,920
It deserves to be dirty.

584
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,680
How dare you say that?

585
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,120
How dare you?

586
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,160
Every time I see you, I wish I could...

587
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,480
Are you insane, Liu Xiaoling?

588
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,920
Every day, you do nothing

589
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,320
but play games or cards.

590
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,400
Are you a shrew?

591
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,640
Mom, Jiali, I'm back here

592
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,000
to tell you something

593
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,720
big, serious, and important.

594
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,760
Had a problem with Zhenmin again?

595
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:10,880
Go ahead.

596
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,400
We won't have problems.

597
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:15,240
Tang Zhenmin and I are over.

598
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,440
Liu Xiaoling, don't be ridiculous.

599
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,600
Get Tang Zhenmin here.

600
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,000
He's back home
to tell his family about it.

601
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,920
Mom, Jiali, I'm no longer a kid.

602
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,600
I thought really carefully about it.

603
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,560
Are you even wise enough to think?

604
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,920
We'll be responsible for what we do.

605
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,600
How can you be responsible?

606
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:43,320
We lived separately for a while.

607
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,600
He has a girlfriend, too.

608
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,000
We had a really clean breakup.

609
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,920
Are you saying he...?

610
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,200
He didn't cheat on me.

611
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,000
I approved of that.

612
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,480
What an idiot you are.

613
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,360
What about you?

614
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,520
I'm in no hurry.

615
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,680
Now, I focus on my career.

616
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,640
Career?

617
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,800
Liu Xiaoling,

618
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,720
family is the most important thing.

619
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,840
Do you understand?

620
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,720
Mom, this kind of old idea is terrible.

621
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,680
When a man is useless,

622
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,200
his woman should rely on herself.

623
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,880
Really. We can't rely on anyone.

624
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,800
You know what?
Here's the advice for women.

625
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,160
"Rely on yourselves."

626
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,680
Tell us the real reason.

627
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,680
Why do you end up like this?

628
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,760
You haven't explained yet.

629
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,760
He and I

630
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,280
have different views of life

631
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,680
and different requests for life.

632
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,040
We're different in every way.

633
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,200
This is a great era.

634
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,120
We should make progress

635
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,120
and embrace chances.

636
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,760
Or we'll miss them.

637
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,600
Now, he's good for nothing.

638
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,200
Every day, he keeps playing games

639
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,120
and eating food.

640
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,200
He doesn't even sleep.

641
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,000
Before I talk to him for a while,

642
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,040
we'll fight.

643
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,320
Where do you live now?

644
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,400
In my rented flat.

645
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,800
Where will you live after a divorce?

646
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,000
We'll see.

647
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,160
Mom, Jiali,

648
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,240
we're a family.

649
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,800
We're all one.

650
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,920
I'm here back for your support.

651
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,360
You have to support me.

652
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,560
He and I have got to a point

653
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,080
where there is no turning back.

654
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,120
We have to move on.

655
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,840
What's our marriage like?

656
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,080
Let me describe it.

657
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,920
It's like a ship

658
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,720
sinking in the middle of the sea.

659
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,040
Unless I get away from the ship,

660
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,920
I'll be drowned,

661
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,240
asphyxiated, and suffocated.

662
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,080
I... I can't even breathe.

663
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,800
I'll nearly have depression.

664
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,840
You know?

665
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,880
I'm so suffocated at home.

666
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,080
I can talk to no one.

667
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,120
All right, all right.

668
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,080
There's...

669
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,640
There's no hurry about this.

670
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,760
You can do it slowly.

671
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,240
I can't.

672
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,520
Why can't you?

673
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,680
What silly thing did you do again?

674
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,120
I got the certificate.

675
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,560
What certificate?

676
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,000
Divorce certificate.

677
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,200
We're divorced.

678
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,840
(Divorce Certificate)

679
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,280
(By Liu Xiaoling)

680
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,120
Jiali, go get me the heart-save pills.

681
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,680
Look what you've done.

682
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,880
Grandma is old.
Let's not tell her for now.

683
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,720
Look what you've done.

684
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,240
What's wrong?

685
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,000
You always make trouble
unless we watch you.

686
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,440
Such an idiot.

687
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,320
I'm divorced.

688
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,240
I'm not a criminal.

689
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,280
You have to take it seriously.

690
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,600
What will people think of you?

691
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,640
I don't care. I'll live my own life.

692
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,040
Fine.

693
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,600
You're bighearted and you don't care.

694
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,000
Then tell me.

695
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,080
What kind of life do you want to live?

696
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,320
What kind of way will you go?

697
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,040
I want to do business.

698
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,320
Liu Xiaoling, you're just divorced.

699
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,040
Will you even quit?

700
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:16,920
I won't.

701
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,960
I'll work and do business
at the same time.

702
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,760
Where will you live?

703
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,360
Will you move back

704
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,400
or will you keep renting a flat?

705
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,160
You got married,
but you have nowhere to live now.

706
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,040
He and I will talk about it.

707
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,080
You're already divorced.

708
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,320
How will you talk?

709
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,000
Can't you go through a normal procedure?

710
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,640
After you moved out,

711
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,720
you would ask for the flat.

712
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,800
Would he give it to you?

713
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,760
You appear to be wise,

714
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,200
but you're actually so silly.

715
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,440
And your son.

716
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,200
Who'll take care of him?

717
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,080
Will he pay the child support,

718
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,960
or the other way around?

719
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,800
Have you thought about any of this?

720
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,360
Before you had a plan,

721
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,320
you did everything, seriously?

722
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,040
Jiali, I'm here

723
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,160
to get a plan from you.

724
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,360
The point is, I must get my son.

725
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,200
He's the only child of his family.
Can you have him?

726
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,520
It makes sense.

727
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,960
But that's not fair.

728
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,160
It's wicked to ask a mother

729
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,360
to abandon her son.

730
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,720
I don't care.

731
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,240
We're sisters, anyway.

732
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,600
You have to help me.

733
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,320
Who'll go first?

734
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,400
Zhenmin.

735
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,360
After careful consideration, she and I

736
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,600
decided to break up.

737
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,600
In a marriage life,

738
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,960
a couple sometimes quarrels.

739
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,240
Even the sweetest couple

740
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,040
may sometimes have a problem.

741
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,040
You don't have to divorce.

742
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,200
Unless you have

743
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,480
an irreconcilable conflict,

744
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,160
you'll get back together.

745
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,120
Not for the fake

746
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,640
of the two of you,

747
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,960
but for the sake of Yangyang.

748
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,000
Divorce will hurt your child.

749
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,910
I quite agree.

750
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:23,960
Unless you have serious problems,

751
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,320
you should get remarried.

752
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,560
Look.

753
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,840
Oh my God.

754
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,720
Tang Zhenmin.

755
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,200
Don't just look at her. Look at me.

756
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:39,270
Look at here.

757
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:40,880
And here.

758
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,040
She hit me really hard.

759
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,480
She's a woman while you're a man.

760
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,840
A woman can't fight, either.

761
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,120
She shouldn't have fought.

762
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,360
He started this.

763
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,480
Jiali is here. Stop lying.

764
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,680
I simply fought back at you.

765
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,880
- Talk nicely.
- Fine.

766
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,680
Stop. Don't do this.

767
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,840
You aren't enemies.

768
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,960
We really can't live together.

769
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,920
Or one of us may get killed.

770
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,960
The two of you

771
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,680
tried so hard to get together.

772
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,760
Both of our families disapproved.

773
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,560
Now, you want a divorce.

774
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,240
Honestly, we don't approve, either.

775
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,560
But you insist, anyway.

776
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,760
Then, don't regret it.

777
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,360
- I won't.
- I won't.

778
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,520
Then, let's talk about the future.

779
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,760
I want nothing else.

780
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,160
But I must have my son.

781
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:47,160
No way. Yangyang is my son.

782
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,280
So what?

783
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,680
I'm his mother, aren't I?

784
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,880
And I'm his father.

785
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,120
I gave birth to him, didn't I?

786
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,280
How could you without me?

787
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,120
If you insist, I'll call the police.

788
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,280
Policemen don't interfere with this.

789
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,600
They don't?

790
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,640
Then, I'll complain to anyone in charge.

791
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,760
I believe

792
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,080
there is justice.

793
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,280
Insane.

794
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,600
Xiaoling,

795
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,920
I have to remind you.

796
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,160
You'll always be responsible
if you want your son.

797
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,840
If you take him away,

798
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,320
he'll be your responsibility.

799
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,160
You can get a divorce.

800
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,200
Then, you'll get remarried.

801
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,560
Without a son,
you can hardly get remarried.

802
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,360
Xiaoling,

803
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,920
have you made up your mind?

804
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:35,880
Yes.

805
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,120
I'll take no money.

806
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,080
But I want my son.

807
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,720
What are you talking about?

808
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,000
You're innocent.
Why will you take no money?

809
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,520
You should take what you deserve.

810
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,800
You're divorced.

811
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,320
But if you really have a lawsuit,

812
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,320
the mother will have custody.

813
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,600
She should have whatever she deserves.

814
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,080
Come on.

815
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,560
We don't need to have a lawsuit.

816
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,400
Then, we'll do what Xiaoling wants.

817
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,520
Zhenmin will pay
for Yangyang's living costs

818
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,120
until he's 18 years old.

819
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,320
Xiaoling will have his custody.

820
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,520
But Zhenmin has the right

821
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,920
to see his son once a week at least.

822
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,320
Like Xiaoling said,

823
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,800
she won't take their common property.

824
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,720
Your savings

825
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,320
will remain with yourselves.

826
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,720
Do you still have a problem?

827
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,800
Agreed.

828
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,080
Ok.

829
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,160
I have one request.

830
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,240
If she can't take care of Yangyang,

831
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,840
he must come back to me.

832
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,440
Don't worry. He'll live better with me.

833
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,800
He'll be nice and plump.

834
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,920
And I warn you.

835
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:43,720
He can't call anybody else Dad.

836
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,040
Tang Zhenmin.

837
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:45,980
Agreed.

838
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,320
Nothing else, huh?

839
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,760
I should go.
