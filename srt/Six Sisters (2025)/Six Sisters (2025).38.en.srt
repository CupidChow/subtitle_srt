Sit.

19
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,320
So, what do we do?

20
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,160
Shall we go to Hefei?

21
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,510
- Ok.
- No problem.

22
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,840
I'll book hotel rooms.

00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,150
Don't, Jiahuan.

I'll do that.

Stay at home with Mom.

We'll go there

38
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,430

I don't want to continue the therapy.

68
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,000
According to the result,

69
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,760
only Jiali is a match.

70
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,080
I'll go beg her.

71
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,230
She can help us.

72
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,280

00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,560
I beg you, Hongyu.

Let me die.

75
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,840
I'm too ashamed to see Jiali.

Jiaxi,

77
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,560
your life isn't just your concern.

78
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,470
Listen carefully.

79
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,880
If you die, how will Xiaoman live?

80
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,150
How will Mom live?

81
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,710
We promised

82
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,150
to take care of Mom forever.

83
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,000
However hard it is,

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
you must hang in there.

85
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,640
You can't die before Mom.

86
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,230
And...

87
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,280
How could I live without you?

88
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,910
We made a lot of mistakes.

89
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,880
I'll go beg Jiali.

90
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,280
I'll beg her

91
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:51,840
to save your life.

92
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,880
When you recover,

93
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,150
we'll correct and repent.

94
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,030
We'll make it up.

95
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,110
That is if you can survive.

96
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,230
It's so painful.

97
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,960
It's ok.

98
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,200

99
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,670
How did it go?

100
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:31,910
Hongyu,

101
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:33,550
what is the result?

102
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,280
Is there a match?

103
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,910
What's the situation?

104
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,110
Is there no match?

105
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,280
Say something.

106
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,060
Jiali,

107
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,660
please save Jiaxi.

108
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,260
No one but you can save her now.

109
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,020
So, she can be saved.

110
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,100
Yeah.

111
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,580

113
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,780
Jiaxi and I are sorry.

114
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,420
We'll do anything to repay you.

115
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,020
I'll save her.

116
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,260
Who told you I wouldn't?

117
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,300
I can't leave her to die.

118
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,420
Get up.

119
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,140
Let's just say
I owed her in a former life

120
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,420
and now I'll repay her.

121
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,660
Glad she can be saved.

122
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,380
She's my sister, after all.

123
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,180

What are you doing?

128
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,300
No surgery is 100% safe.

129
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,780
I want to arrange everything.

130
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,060
- If...
- But the surgery is said to be safe.

131
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,820
It is safe.

132
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,740
But when I arrange everything,

133
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,220
- I'll be relieved.
- But...

134
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,980

until you die.

139
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,220
Don't say that.

140
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,020
I'm not that great.

141
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:23,260
Before, I lived for my family.

142
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,100
Later, I thought, "Why?

143
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,420
I must live for myself."

144
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,100
Now, I have the old idea back.

145
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,380
I think living for someone else

146
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,620
and for this big family

147
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,460
can also make me happy.

148
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,700
I remember when Dad was alive,

149
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,940
he often told me
to take care of the family

150
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,980
instead of breaking it.

151
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,780
Now, I think

152
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,580
I'm serving my purpose well.

153
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,420
I'll finish my duty.

00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,020
- You have the drumstick.
- No.

191
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,140
- I have the chicken feet.
- No, no. I'll have them.

192
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,260
- You eat this.
- Chicken feet are good for hair.

193
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,300
No need.

194
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,140
Your hair is so thick.

195
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,460
I had more hair when I was little.

196
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,740
I couldn't grab it with one hand.

197
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,820
Come on. Eat it.

198
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,100
We still have nice hair.

199
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,380
Ouyang Bao is nearly bald.

200
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,500
I'm always worried at this time of year.

201
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,380
What if the loan sharks come?

202
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,940
My comrade in arms told me

203
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,100
those loan sharks were arrested.

204
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,560
Really?

205
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,940
Then Xiaonian can come back.

206
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,340
Are they here again?

207
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,060
No way. I'll go check it.

208
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:11,940
I'll go.

209
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,180
Count on me if we have to fight.

210
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:26,980
Here's a package.

211
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,260
He Jiali, right?

212
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,700
- Yes.
- Sign here.

213
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,940
What is this?

214
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,140
I didn't buy anything.

215
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,140
- Here.
- Ok.

216
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,780
Who sent it?

217
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,340
Shanghai. Son bought it for you.

218
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,700
Open it and see

219
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,580
what it is.

220
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,300
Looks great.

221
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:20,540
I always wanted to buy

222
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,980
a pair of shoes of this color.

223
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,260
Try them on.

224
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,980
No need. They must fit perfectly.

225
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,340
He's doing good in Shanghai.

226
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,340
That's a relief, right?

227
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:43,700
(Huainan TAXI)

228
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:47,940
Be right there.

229
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,740
Jiali.

230
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,180
Jiaxi, Hongyu.

231
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,260
- Jiali.
- Come in.

232
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,140
Jiali.

233
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,500
- Get up.
- Get up.

234
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,700
- Come on.
- Jiali.

235
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,100
- Get up.
- Jiali.

236
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,380
I was wrong.

237
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,180
I really was wrong,

238
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,060
Jiali.

239
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,100
Jiali.

240
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:17,100
I may not repay you in this life.

241
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,260
But in my next life, I will.

242
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,260
Come on. I've let it go.

243
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,620
You can let it go, too.

244
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,460
Come on.

245
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,980
I'm too ashamed,

246
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,980
Jiali.

247
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,740
Jiali, will you forgive me?

248
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,940
Fine. I forgive you.

249
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,500
I forgive you.

250
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,180
- I really do. Get up.
- Come on.

251
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,020
Get up.

252
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,140
Jiali.

253
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,090
It's ok.

254
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,540
It's my decision to save you.

255
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,180
I've figured everything out.

256
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,900
Don't think you owe me anything.

257
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,980
I know.

258
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,460
It's easy to forgive someone else,

259
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,860
but hard to forgive yourself.

260
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,700
You should learn to forgive yourself.

261
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,180
Anyway,

262
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,380
I want you to be healthy.

263
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:46,460
(Spring Festival, 2009)

264
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,540
(Harmony)

265
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,700
It's been a really long time

266
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,660
since we last have a reunion dinner.

267
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,940
I'll say no more.

268
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,540
Let's eat.

269
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:06,980
Mom.

270
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,620
I want to say something.

271
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,220
Ok. Go ahead.

272
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,140
For the sake of my weakness,

273
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,940
I'll drink water instead of wine.

274
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,820
I couldn't

275
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,620
come to this world

276
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,980
without Mom.

277
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,180
I couldn't be sitting here alive

278
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,620
without Jiali.

279
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,980
When I nearly died,

280
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,540
I did grow mature.

281
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,620
I had a lot of feelings.

282
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,340
I made many mistakes before.

283
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,180
I'll make it up to you guys.

284
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,580
Being your sister
is the greatest blessing

285
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,620
I've ever had.

286
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,420
It's my luck to have sisters.

287
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,380
I'll cherish you.

288
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,540
Come on. The six of us
shall drink together.

289
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,380
Ok.

290
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,980
- To sisters.
- To sisters.

291
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,020
Cheers.

292
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,700
All of you guys

293
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,580
are my daughters.

294
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,580
Incredible.

295
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,380
Mom.

296
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,620
This is the house deed.

297
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,140
It's yours again.

298
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:58,980
Keep it.

299
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,820
All right.

300
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,700
Come on. We all know about it.

301
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,080
Let's propose a toast to Mom.

302
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,140
- Ok.
- Right.

303
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,620
- Come on. To Mom.
- To Mom.

304
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,420
- Ok. Come on.
- Come on.

305
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,620
A toast to me.

306
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,140
- To good health.
- Good health.

307
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,500
The same wish for everybody.

308
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,540
- To good health.
- To good health.

309
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,980
Let's eat.

310
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,140
Ok. Let's eat.

311
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,740
Mom, I hear your pickle recipe

312
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,780
is worth a lot now.

313
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,500
I won't sell the recipe

314
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,420
at whatever price.

315
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,780
Your dad's fur techniques

316
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,540
are only passed down to sons.

317
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,340
But my recipe will only
be given to daughters.

318
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,420
The talented and virtuous daughter.

319
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,860
Mom, it has to be me.

320
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,940
Come on.

321
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,620
You aren't talented or virtuous.

322
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,340
Think about what Mom said.

323
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,900
It'll only be given to daughters.

324
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,900
Among the six of us,

325
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,860
only Jiaxi and I have a daughter, right?

326
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,700
Besides, only I have Mom's family name.

327
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,220
I'm a perfect heir.

328
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,900
- Right.
- I won't compete.

329
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,740
You'll have it alone.

330
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,020
You're surprising me.

331
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,380
She's really grown up.

332
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,140
Mom.

333
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,260
You should think about us, too.

334
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,140
Yeah, Mom.

335
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,420
Across from you, we'll open

336
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,140
a Six Sons-in-law Pickled Vegetables.

337
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,500
Let's have a healthy competition.

338
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,740
Why do men like you
make pickled vegetables?

339
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,700
You should dream big, huh?

340
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,780
That's right.

341
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,860
You can make the jars.

342
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,140
I'm really happy tonight.

343
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,940
I even want to cry.

344
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,900
Mom.

345
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,860
Glad you're happy.

346
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,500
I...

347
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:03,460
I'll propose a toast, my sons-in-law.

348
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,700
I gave birth to six daughters

349
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,460
and brought them up.

350
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,100
I know them very well.

351
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,980
They're all annoying.

352
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,100
When you live

353
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,060
with them every day,

354
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,340
you must have suffered.

355
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,620
Mom,

356
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,620
I can't agree more.

357
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,180
Since I married Jiali,

358
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,380
I've always been worried.

359
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,340
Don't you think?

360
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,540
What has worried you?

361
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,820
I shouldn't have asked you.

362
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,380
Come on. It's your turn.

363
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,220
What has worried you?

364
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,340
Your quick temper keeps me worried.

365
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,860
I'm gentle, ok?

366
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,180
Come on. Let's drink.

367
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,100
Mom, look. She wins in drinking.

368
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,620
- Drink it up.
- Ok, I will.

369
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,940
It's your turn to complain.

370
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,340
When Jiaxi is around,

371
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:53,740
I'm very happy

372
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,580
and satisfied.

373
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,020
Thanks for your hard work.

374
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,380
We all have to speak, huh?

375
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,180
I have nothing to say.

376
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,060
I have a great wife.

377
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,100
Come on.

378
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,340
I heard that.

379
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,180
What did you say? A great...

380
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,260
A great wife.

381
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,740
Then, I have a wonderful wife.

382
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,940
I wanted to marry a super-rich man.

383
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,380
In my afterlife, then.

384
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,620
I'll try to be super rich.

385
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,300
- Cheers.
- Thanks, honey.

386
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,580
Oh, Ouyang.

387
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,180
Mom,

388
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,700
I was divorced once.

389
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,820
I cherish my remarriage very much.

390
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,260
Hope you'll do very well.

391
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,020
I'll even get a reward.

392
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,500
Mom, rest assured
when Xiaoling is with me.

393
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,900
The two of us will

394
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,140
live a great life.

395
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:45,980
- Huh?
- Of course.

396
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,380
Cheers.

397
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,740
Come on.

398
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,980
- Let's drink.
- Cheers.

399
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,180
Cheers.

400
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,180
Let's drink.

401
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,780
To a happy family.

402
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,660
To a happy family.

403
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,910
We're a happy family.

404
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:07,630
♪No matter what you've been through♪

405
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,740
Mom, take some rest.

406
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,740
- Qiulin.
- Ms. Meixin.

407
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,100
- Happy Chinese New Year.
- Jiali.

408
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,580
- Hello.
- Happy Chinese New Year.

409
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,500
Happy Chinese New Year.

410
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,620
- Mom, look who's here.
- Ms. Liu.

411
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,460
Happy Chinese New Year, Ms. Liu.

412
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,060
Ms. Liu, happy Chinese New Year.

413
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,260
Happy birthday.

414
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,460
Happy birthday.

415
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,580
That's right.

416
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,860
Happy birthday.

417
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,780
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

418
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,220
She's confused again.

419
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,620
How old are you?

420
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,340
I'm 29.

421
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,660
Good.

422
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,620
Take your seats.

423
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,100
Qiulin, go get some water.

424
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,260
You look good.

425
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,060
Sit down.

426
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,220
What are you doing?

427
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,300
- Thanks.
- Have some oranges.

428
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,140
Ms. Liu looks good.

429
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,260
Not really.

430
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,580
I'm going to take her back to Shanghai.

431
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,340
New therapies are available there.

432
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,380
Maybe there's still hope.

433
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,780
Then, we'll meet even less.

434
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,820
That's not true.

435
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,380
We'll often come back.

436
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,460
- Have some water.
- I can't imagine.

437
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:11,900
Thank you.

438
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,180
What are you looking for?

439
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,860
Happy birthday.

440
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,380
Be happy.

441
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,660
Happy birthday.

442
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,340
Thank you.

443
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:30,180
I'll put it away.

444
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,380
Ok.

445
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,260
What do you want now?

446
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,260
What do you want?

447
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,540
Qiulin.

448
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,780
Be right there.

449
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,340
Mom.

450
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,060
What do you want?

451
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,780
The comb.

452
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:00,980
The wooden comb?

453
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,020
You sit here.

454
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,120
Sit back.

455
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,020
I'll get it for you.

456
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,580
What do you want it for?

457
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,380
My husband is back.

458
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,460
He's back.

459
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:10,820
That's right.

460
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,460
- This is him.
- The condition has worsened recently.

461
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,780
Your husband is back.

462
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,420
That's good. He's back.

463
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,780
She's like a kid.

464
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,540
They're best friends.

465
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,060
Is this what you want?

466
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,180
Such a nice comb.

467
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,260
Shall I comb your hair?

468
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,780
I'll do it.

469
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,900
I'll comb your hair.

470
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,140
You'll do that?

471
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,780
Fine.

472
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,140
You're doing it so well.

473
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,140
Good.

474
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,700
Did you contact Yangyang?

475
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,940
What if you can't see him?

476
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,540
I contacted Qiufang.

477
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,700
She said Yangyang was there.

478
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:27,900
What about Xiaonian?

479
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,780
How about I go with you to see him?

480
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,020
I haven't seen him for years.

481
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,060
I miss him a lot.

482
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,020
He may not see me.

483
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,340
If he doesn't see you,

484
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,300
as his fifth aunt,

485
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,260
I'll punch him out.

486
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,540
Come on.

487
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,940
Jiali, when you see Xiaonian,

488
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,220
tell him his fifth aunt is rich now.

489
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,820
He always has his space in this family.

490
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,740
When he comes back,

491
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,100
he'll make a lot of money.

492
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,700
Fine. I'll tell him.

493
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,540
Ok.

494
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:59,060
I'm quite nervous
when I'm going to see Yangyang.

495
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,700
I've even had a pimple.

496
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,300
No one despises his mother.

497
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,580
Even if you were disfigured,

498
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,060
you would still be Yangyang's mother.

499
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,180
It makes sense.

500
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,380
Thank you.

501
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,900
You're welcome. Enjoy it.

502
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,460
Liu Xiaoling.

503
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,900
Yangyang.

504
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,620
I looked around but didn't see you.

505
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,780
I thought you didn't want to see me

506
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,980
and didn't come, then.

507
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:56,340
Someone traveled all the way here.

508
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,100
I should show her some respect.

509
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,940
Don't stand there, Mom. Sit down.

510
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,300
Yangyang.

511
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,740
What did you just call me?

512
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:17,780
Mom.

513
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,820
I don't know what you drink.

514
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,980
I ordered coffee for you.

515
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:29,140
What would you like to eat? Order up.

516
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,500
It's my treat.
Order the most expensive food.

517
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,740
I'm done ordering.

518
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,940
Keep your voice down.

519
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,140
Ok, I will.

520
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,300
Yangyang,

521
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,940
how's your work in Shanghai?

522
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,220
Is it hard? Is it tiring?

523
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,100
Do you have regular meals?

524
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,140
Do you starve?

525
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,340
Why do you not answer

526
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,660
when I call you?

527
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,700
And you don't text back.

528
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,700
Ms. Liu,

529
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,500
I know you're very excited now.

530
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,340
I'll explain one by one, ok?

531
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,140
I'm doing great

532
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,220
in Shanghai.

533
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,380
I have a nice flat and fancy food.

534
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,500
I don't answer the phone

535
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,180
because sometimes I'm so busy

536
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,140
that I miss it.

537
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,220
Look at me. Cool, isn't it?

538
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,220
Indeed.

539
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,780
My son has grown up.

540
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,620
Of course.

541
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,460
You...

542
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,620
You look like a character in a TV drama.

543
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,780
- Who?
- Xu Wenqiang.

544
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,780
I do?

545
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,820
The famous TV drama, huh?

546
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,780
Shanghai is such a big city.

547
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,740
Quite different from Huainan.

548
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,220
Yangyang. Shall we take a photo?

549
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,100
Good idea.

550
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,260
Excuse me.

551
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,620
Can you take a photo for us?

552
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,740
No problem.

553
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,100
- Alright.
- Come over here.

554
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:51,940
- Ok.
- Come on.

555
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,300
- Give it to me.
- Here.

556
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,420
Take the big city in the background.

557
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,020
Are you brother and sister?

558
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,460
No.

559
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,340
She's my mother.

560
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,660
He's my son.

561
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,220
Such a young and beautiful mother.

562
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,900
Ok. Three, two, one.

563
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:14,140
One more take. Three, two, one.

564
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:25,860
Here.

565
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,060
Ok.

566
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:31,900
It's done.

567
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,340
Mom.

568
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,460
Mom, sit here. Don't bother.

569
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,620
Leave it to me.

570
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,580
You take a seat, too.

571
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,020
You look older.

572
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,140
Me?

573
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,460
But you look younger.

574
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,220
How is Dad?

575
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,820
He's doing good.

576
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,620
What about Yiyi?

577
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,300
Did you see her?

578
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,300
Yes, a while ago.

579
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,220
She's grown up.

580
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,820
She looks like you.

581
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,540
That's good.

00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,620

Xiaonian,

584
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,900
have you thought about going home?

585
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,940
I hear those loan sharks
have been arrested.

586
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,260
Mom,

587
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:27,500
I feel sorry for Dad.

588
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:30,970
So, I think

589
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:36,380
I must make a difference

590
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,660
before going home.

591
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,820
Fine.

594
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,460
So cute. Jiaxi was
only a few months old.

595
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,220
I was even asleep.

596
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,580
Yeah.

597
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,220
I had my hair cut at that time.

598
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,380
How did you recognize me immediately?

599
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,820
Jiawen's long braids look great.

600
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,940
Jiawen looks like your father.

601
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,940
She looks like you.

602
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,020
I look like Dad most.

603
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:17,500
- Right.
- I'm the combination of Dad and Mom.

604
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,940
I look like Dad most.

605
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:19,940
Right. Jiali does.

606
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,340
- She does.
- I do, huh?

607
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,020
You look like your grandma.

608
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,220
What makes you say that?

609
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,540
- Indeed.
- Don't I look like you?

610
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,700
Jiahuan looks like Dad, too.

611
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,460
I have Dad's temper and character.

612
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,620
I look like Dad.

613
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,620
I look like Mom, too.

614
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:34,740
No. I have Dad's and Mom's advantages.

615
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,340
So,

616
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,940
I have their disadvantages.

617
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:40,860
Hey.

618
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,100
Shouldn't someone object at this moment?

619
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,060
I expect to hear that.

620
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,940
- I object.
- Two rights make a wrong.

621
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,220
- Mom.
- Fine.

622

To be honest, I really...

642
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,180
I don't want to leave.

643
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,380
It'll be gone tomorrow.

644

Oh.

645

Come on, Mom.

646
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,220
When we moved out of our small house,

647
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,420
you also didn't want to leave.

648
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,710
You even cried for two days.

Mom, how about you live with me?

654
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,460
My flat is big.

655
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,740
How about you move in with me?

656
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,940

657
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,300

into the settlement flat?

Oh, I forgot.

672
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,780
Now, we have many flats
but very few people.

673

Since we're all here,

679
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,020
how about we live here tonight?

680
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:41,940
- Ok.
- Good idea.

Jiali,

682
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,380
you assign the rooms.

683
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,260
Anyway, Jiahuan and Xiaoling
can't share a room.

684
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,100
They'll fight.

685
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,700
Mom, you assign the rooms.

686
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,340
It's the last night.

687
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,620
You can sleep wherever you want.

688
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,860
Then, Jiayi and Xiaoling
will share a room.

689
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,260
- Jiawen will live with me.
- Ok.

690
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,740
Jiahuan and Jiaxi, you stay with Mom.

691
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:04,700
- Sure.
- Ok.

692
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,940
I'll sleep in the living room.

693
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,420

694
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,260

696
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,300
I don't want her to kick me.

697
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:11,820
We have bunk beds.

698
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,140
I don't sleepwalk.

699
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,540
You'll take the lower bunk.

700
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,500
Fine.

701
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,460
- What's wrong?
- The power is out.

702
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,860
The neighborhood will be demolished.

703
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,940
There's often a power failure.

704
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,660
Xiaoling, go get some candles.

705
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,820
They're here, huh?

706
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,500
I'll take them back home.

707

I loved power failures in childhood

708
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,820
because I could play with fire.

City people use this.

759
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,140
It's called... Dressing case.

00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,260
- Do you like it?
- Yes.
